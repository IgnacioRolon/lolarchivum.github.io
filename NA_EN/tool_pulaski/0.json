Long time viewer first time poster, but I'm at my {{item:3091}} ...\r\nbut for real...  I've played for about three years now and never really had huge issues with lag or ping until this week, when I've begun dc'ing from every game I play.\r\n I don't know what to do.\r\nI would love to keep playing but I won't be able to if this continues.\r\nIve checked my computers ping with http://www.speedtest.net, reinstalled LOL, and made sure that I have the most resent IOS on my mac...\r\nmy computer has always been slightly slower (when running league) than the people i play with, but I just assumed it was something stupid... now I'm going crazy... please help me!!!! what do i do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T15:37:34.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've done some troubleshooting already, and I'd like to help.  A lot of the steps taken so far are solid for performance issues, but your symptoms sound like they have more to do with your network communicating with the game server.  I'm inclined to believe the issue is something more local than ISP related, because you are disconnecting completely in addition to high ping.  Are you able to use the net just fine outside of League?\n\nTo rule out possibilities and really know for sure, go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to troubleshoot.  Hopefully this will lead you towards a fix for good.

I am currently living in a dorm and haven't had any trouble with any other internet tasks, and my friends are able to play next to me while I am continually dc'ing.\nI just ran the Hextech repair tool, and the only feedback that I got that seemed like it might be strange was the ping results, which read...\n\n\"PING www.google.com (192.232.16.106): 56 data bytes\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 1\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 2\n\n--- www.google.com ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss\"\n\nIs this a problem? what can i do to fix it?\nthank you again for spending the time to help a clueless fan of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T15:19:04.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue may not necessarily be with your ISP, but could be something local or even how your campus has your network set.  Make sure to go over every step in the connection guide to make sure everything local is setup accordingly.  You may also want to hit up your campus IT to make sure that nothing is blocking data flow for you.  Hopefully, this will help fix things up!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Et Cetera","date":"2016-10-12T04:08:52.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had insane lag issue as well, I contacted my provider after trying almost all the local solutions (I'll explain why almost) and they boosted my connection and blah blah... My ping and packet loss kept at it unharmed. So after a ton of howto's on youtube and forums, frustration and desperation ... I did a \"Reset\" on windows.

A \"Reset\"/Refresh is like re-installing windows from scratch. It cleans everything (All installed apps settings e.t.c e.t.c) and brings the Operating System to the state it was when first installed. \n\nSo you would just have to re-install your OS.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
