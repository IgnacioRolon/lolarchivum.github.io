The worst thing is that once it finishes, it can either happen again when I try to connect if they hadn't remade by then, but it just makes things like Ranked and even Normals unplayable. I end up being punished, and I'm sitting on 20 minutes of leaverbuster. For five games. Please, I need a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-07T17:57:07.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like an update didn't go well and may have become corrupt.  If this is on the updated client, you may need to perform a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)and refresh your client back to the legacy version.  You can then re-download the updated client from there.  If you are still on the legacy, then you can use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to perform a fresh repair.  I recommend testing it out in custom games to prevent any further penalties.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
