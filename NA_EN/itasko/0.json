I have 7999 IP ( i saved this specifically for Camille) and it will not let me buy Camille. It says I do not have enough IP. Please fix this issue, I am not pleased with this. I have been trying to buy her since yesterday and I still cannot buy her. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-13T19:54:40.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this, your IP is showing just a bit shy of that.
