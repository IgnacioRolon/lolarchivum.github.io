When i use it for me it is classic katarina (both the sounds and skin), but for everyone else in the game it is PROJECT. I don&#039;t really know if riot knows about this or if it&#039;s only me but i hope it can get fixed soon if you know a reason or something that may explain why it is happening, please tell me.

Have you tried doing a client repair? Since we patch every two weeks, there's a chance a file or two may have found its way into the wrong spot. \n\nYou can perform a client repair by doing the following - \n\n* Open the League of Legends Launcher.\n* Click the Gear button to open the Settings menu.\n* Click the \"Repair\" button. The repair process will take about 30-60 minutes\n\nLemme know if this solves the issue. If not, we can dig a bit more.","replies":[{"poster":"TheStarsCallsMe","date":"2016-08-30T23:07:44.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you so much, it worked!
