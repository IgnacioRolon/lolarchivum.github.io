So good that this mode is friendly to the old people. My grandma（68） can&#039;t wait to play this mode and according to the video on the internet. They got 2 new items 1 is doran stick/rod? which look like the wukong&#039;e Q and it gain 1 AD and 1AP per mins with no max limit and also u can have 6 doran sticks/rods......Yes  have 6 daron rods and have this game not ended in 2 hours is a good idea. And another item whih has no AD/AP but can reset all ur skills&#039; cd. I dont think this one is useful if the cooldown of this item also +200% and has no AD/AP.\r\n\r\n**YES I LIKE URF AND MY GRANDMA LIE NURF PLZ HAVE 2 MODES TOGETHER\r\nI DONT WANT TO PLAY A LAGGING GAME WITH MY LAGGING COMPUTER CONNECTING TO A LAGGING INTERNET WITH LAGGING GRANDMA...**","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-03-31T12:32:19.893+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I project that the most powerful Nurf champions will be\n{{champion:14}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Nitsuabo","date":"2015-03-31T13:39:01.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think {{champion:3}}  is looking like a great pick for New Ultra Rapid Fire.
