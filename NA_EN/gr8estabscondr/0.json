Starting today, however, as soon as I load into a game, as in, after champ select and the loading screen, my whole computer freezes up. I cant move the mouse, I can't alt-tab, pull up task manager or the start menu, and I get a monotone sound instead of music or lack thereof. This has happened three times so far, and I've already tried deleting and reinstalling league. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T20:52:28.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports on this, and it sounds like these crashes have been a result of either a recent windows update or the use of third party programs.  As a first and most common fix, if you are using any apps like play.tv go ahead and remove them.  Secondly, some change to the[ Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is causing some freeze and should be **disabled**.
