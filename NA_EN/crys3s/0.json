After completing my purchase I received 3 consecutive error windows (for each color skin within the chroma pack I assume) and have been unable to use the chroma&#039;s in game. I have restarted the client multiple times, and have tried methods such as re-selecting or re-creating my teambuilder session. However, everytime I get in game my selected chroma&#039;s are not loading. I am unsure if this is strictly a client issue or if it&#039;s an account issue.\r\n\r\nPlease help! {{champion:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-08T17:11:59.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morning Crys3s! \n\nI just set up a Team Builder and selected the Headhunter Yi chromas without any issues. (Screenshot attached). Are you only having this issue in Team Builder, or in any queue you attempt to use this chroma pack in?\n\nWhen selected the chroma pack, are you selecting Master Yi -> Headhunter Yi -> Selecting the color you'd like to use? \n\nIf you're still having issues, please submit a ticket to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584) so we can take a look at your account to make sure the content is unlocked properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2015-07-09T00:34:54.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply Katey! I am able to select it, the issue is when I get to the loadscreen and then in game the skin is not showing up. I have not tried selecting it in other game modes yet - only team builder.  I received 3 error messages upon purchase and am not sure if  it is a result of that. I will submit a ticket as you requested. \n\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-09T16:39:47.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for the load screen, you should see base HeadHunter Yi's splash, as chroma packs won't have unique splash art - they use the parent skin's splash. \n\nAs seen in the earlier attached screenshot, are you selecting one of the squares of color to select which HH Yi chroma you're looking to use? \n\nIf none of that works, Support will be able to help you out a bit further. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2015-07-09T19:21:39.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, selecting it.
