[**I think this is the most appropriate response here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848). Be careful when using any type of third-party program, self-made or not, that could give you some type of edge within the game. I wouldn't say this would give you an edge since you could just look up a build, but our system might detect it as a malicious program.","replies":[{"poster":"Tworie","date":"2017-10-06T04:06:22.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'd only be using it outside of the game when I'm not playing :v\n\nSooo what's riots stance on using their API for personal use? <:3c","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2017-10-06T08:11:15.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tworie,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=FeXOvMG3,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-06T04:06:22.863+0000)\n>\n> Well I&#x27;d only be using it outside of the game when I&#x27;m not playing :v\n> \n> Sooo what&#x27;s riots stance on using their API for personal use? &lt;:3c\n\nBasically they're generally ok with things if it's not giving you some kind of advantage in game, that being said if they do find it to be unfair  somehow they will ban you hard, all this being said it sounds like you're basically just trying to make a program to tell you the most effective builds, and so that's probably not gonna get you in trouble but use at your own risk, so up to you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
