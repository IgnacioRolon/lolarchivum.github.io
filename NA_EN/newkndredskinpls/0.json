I want someone to talk to me personally, like add me on league and stuff, and tell me what the fuck is going on in the minds of the balancing team that you think Yasuo is a fair and balanced pick right now. Not only was he a bit fucking ridiculous before, but with the adc patch, he has many more build paths and new masteries that make him even stronger. A Yasuo with bloodthirster and Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust is almost unkillable most of the time. Thunderlord&#039;s Decree is also very strong and adds a lot of burst. Why would you ever even allow double crit chance to exist in the first place. I need 4 items to get 100% without runes or masteries but Yasuo needs 2. What a lot of people say is that you need to harass him a lot before he hits 6 because he is melee and all but the thing is, his entire kit is built to not get hit by poke. He literally makes every single skillshot champion in League of legends irrelevant. I really wish I could play Ziggs, ap Ezreal and other skillshot champs nowadays but he sorta just makes everything I do worthless. And there is Yasuo in almost every game I play it feels like. Some may argue to ban him but when playing with friends we just like to play teambuilder together. And there are a lot of other strong picks we would want to ban as well so Yasuo wouldn&#039;t always get in there.\r\n\r\n     So let&#039;s talk about his kit. He has a windwall that grows almost as wide as the lane. This blocks any sort of skillshot or airborne ability you can think of. Does it actually make sense that Azir&#039;s ultimate is blocked by his windwall. Does it really make sense that Rumble&#039;s ultimate is completely decimated as well. A lot of ultimates in the game are skillshots because of how strong they are so you need to at least be able to dodge. But Yasuo prevents all of them. They&#039;re just gone. Even then say he doesn&#039;t have his windwall up so its your chance to poke. Oh wait, he has a windshield passive that prevents him from taking much damage at all on top of his E that makes it really easy to dodge skillshots as well. These usually allow Yasuo to kill enough time for his windwall to be up again so then even after the minimal poke you got on him, if you tried to go in on him afterwards, windwall is probably up. If his windwall is not up, he can just play safe for like 5 seconds and then he&#039;ll probably have it up along with his passive. You can try to push him out of the lane and kill all the minions maybe rush his tower down. Oh wait, his windwall will block all your waveclear and if he doesn&#039;t feel like blocking the wave clear, he windwalls the turret so you can&#039;t even auto attack it. You can argue that his ult is hard to land but you know that is a straight up lie. He doesn&#039;t need to land a skillshot most of the time anyway. He can literally just E, Q, R you and there&#039;s nothing you can do because its a for sure knock up. Even if not in melee range his tornado has a decent amount of range so its not exactly the hardest ability to land. Also his tornado crits too. On top of that he can ult off of any little itty bitty piece of displacement in the game. He can ult off of Quinn E. Even if the Yasuo player is completely awful, if he has a teammate with any sort of displacement, all he has to do is press r which will cc the enemies further and deal a good amount of damage. \r\n\r\n    This is really out of hand. Most of Yasuo&#039;s counters are top lane champions, but he goes mid lane a majority of the time. He counters like 90% of his mid match ups unless someone decides to take a top laner down there. Like come on, think about how stubborn League of Legends players are. Yasuo mains are now admitting how broken their champion is. I don&#039;t know about the general populace, but I pretty much NEVER see someone say their main is overpowered because they are in denial about how freelo the champion is. But Yasuo has reached a point where even the mains sit there and look at him like &quot;Yeah dude this champion is completely broken.&quot; I get honestly shocked every time this happens. This champion has gotten to that point. Its gotten to the point where no matter how many videos I see, I haven&#039;t seen an impressive Yasuo play in months because even while looking flashy, the champion is too brainless. Its just ridiculous how I can&#039;t even appreciate a good play on him because I know how easy he is to play. I&#039;m sick of seeing first time Yasuo&#039;s dominate every lane almost because of how simple he is. I haven&#039;t played Yasuo a lot, but the few games I have, I rarely lost lane. The only time I lost was my first time I think and that was just a rough game because I never played AD melee champs. I recently saw my friend playing _Yasuo with 500 ping_ and he got a _quadra kill_ just spamming his keyboard as everyone teleported around. _My friend had no idea what was going on_, but he could just, play Yasuo, and everything was going to be okay. Because he&#039;s **Yasuo**. Argue that I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about all you want because I&#039;m not a Yasuo main, but I think we all have played against Yasuo enough to know every single detail of that damn champion.\r\n\r\n    What I&#039;m asking is: Do something about this. Anything that isn&#039;t a buff. Just balance the game properly for once. You know, just to mix things up a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"NewKndredSkinPls","date":"2015-11-24T01:34:00.770+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":9,"body":"Good points dude I agree.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-11-24T02:05:08.626+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you agree with your own post?","replies":[{"poster":"NewKndredSkinPls","date":"2015-11-24T02:08:40.943+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Maybe","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2015-11-24T04:29:06.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:29}} Sneaky, sneaky!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caffeinerratic","date":"2015-11-24T02:40:14.597+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I as a Certified Yasuo Main can safely say that Yes Yasuo is the Most Balance of All champion.

Early items have a bit less AD to be more affordable but other items got some AD buffs.\nSwain is really stupid though. No one plays him because he's so damn boring which is why no one looks at him.

Meaning if you don't pick him/ban him, it's ass to play against him. This leads to skewed statistics from people who are not playing him well.
