I did a repair and even a full reinstall of league, which I can not do again as I only have 11gb of bandwidth left for the month. \r\n\r\nAny one know any other ways I can possibly fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T04:21:50.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of things that could randomly take the main focus away from League like the usual windows popups or possibly even sticky keys popping up from hitting shift too many times in a row.
