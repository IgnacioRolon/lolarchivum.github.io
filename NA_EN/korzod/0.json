I really do. I always call him the void pupper, and I understand the thematic match and honestly really want either a cat or dog skin for him, and was really hoping that april fools would give me one. However, if Sewn Chaos was taken off of the PBE for being artistically below par, I think Dog&#039;Maw must be the same. \r\n\r\nThe Void VFX are an awful match for the skin, which itself is a bit of a far cry from Kog&#039;s normal silhouette and recognizability in-game. Two of the first things I noticed is the effectively invisible passive, and the subtle yellow glow on his W activation. Both of these are terribly difficult to see, and are way too subtle for what should be clear moments of danger in the champ&#039;s kit (AOE true damage and his auto-attack steroid). \r\n\r\nThe model itself, is also just... off. The tongue hanging out is cute, but along with the severely oversized head and weird googly eyes, it just seems strange, as does the spiked collar (although I understand both fill the dog theme). What I don&#039;t understand is why they didn&#039;t go the same champ-in-costume route that they did with Meowkai, Dino Gnar, MooCow AListar and cottontail Fizz, where it is very evident that is is simply the normal champion dressed up like another. \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a thread about me liking or not liking the skin, simply arguing that if Sewn Chaos were removed for artistic inferiority/ champion visibility mismatch, Dog&#039;Maw should be reworked until it is in a better place and can then be released. \r\n\r\n(as a side, can we use those new blue watery particles for deepsea? thx)","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralMarkinOff","date":"2017-03-08T07:14:14.847+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dog'Maw has watery/slobber VFX, no void/green VFX. :)\nWe also updated its death VFX, and W activate.

If it were Kog with a cartoonishly obvious dog costume like Dinosaur Gnar then I think I would be okay with it.  Bonus points for having those big googly eyes bouncing around on top of his head.\n\nBut as it is I can't stand the thing.\n\nSorry, this owner of all the current Kog skins is going to be sticking with Reindeer.  Hard to beat singing while exploding on people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Relish","date":"2017-03-08T08:29:09.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"But why does it look like a shitty custom fan skin, you pulled the sewn chaos skins for not being \"good\" enough, why add this horrible thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-08T00:28:18.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Kog'maw is a weird, out of place creature on Valoran.
