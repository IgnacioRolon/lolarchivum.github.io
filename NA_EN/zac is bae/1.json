Problem ensues.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As soon as I open the client, it gives me an ambiguous error message that says the client has reverted to the last patch and will attempt to re-patch. It never tries to re-patch, and just sits there, stagnating and wasting my time, not allowing me to join any games. I am currently running a \"full repair,\" but if my past experiences with client issues still bear relevance, this will not help anything. Re-patching with the Hextech repair tool has done nothing. Help would be very much appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: The \"full repair\" tool has repaired nothing. The full text in the pop-up is \"We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\" As I said prior, it does nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T00:44:59.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you switch regions on the client, it will need to download those languages packs among a few resources. When you switched back to NA it seems like those files didn't download correctly. I know you mentioned that the repair tool didn't do anything, but make sure you checked **force repatch** and let it run to completion.
