I've never had an issue like this. After it gave me the \"scanning files\" message in place of the play button for about a half a second, a window appeared that said \"unspecified error.\" After force repatching, I tried uninstalling the game. As soon as the patcher began downloading the game, it gave me the same error message. \r\n\r\nAfter closing and re-opening the window, (it might have been in administer mode at this point, I can't remember,) the game began downloading. After it had gotten past \"step 1/2\" (updating interface,) it gave me the same error message. I tried disabling my antivirus, and am currently downloading the game from the start again. I have yet to see if the patcher can get past \"step 1/2.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, I am considering just wiping my hard drive and re-installing windows, but this would be a massive pain. I have at least 300 gigabytes of games that I would have to re-download on top of League of Legends, not to mention the backup disk I have for my desktop is very old. If I could find a solution for this without wiping my hard drive, that would be fabulous.\r\n\r\nSorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I'm just kind of panicked and sleep deprived from trying to find a solution to this. Any help is greatly appreciated. If needed, I can send my log files to you.\r\n\r\nSystem information:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Home 10.0.14393 Build 14393 (anniversary update)\r\nGTX 970\r\nIntel Core i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 4 cores\r\nAvast Antivirus (temporarily disabled)","replies":[{"poster":"El Trashu","date":"2016-08-24T00:51:11.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue , and i think if the patcher skips the 1/2 download part the game will not be complete since a huge amount of files are not downloaded correctly , if anyone has a fix please let us know","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T21:41:06.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help but I need one more piece of information to help out!
