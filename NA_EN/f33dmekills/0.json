LOL music in this game ... why even bother lol\n\nI began muting SR's music when someone was streaming was my team and decided to bounce on in. I didn't like hearing music echo, so I turned it off. After the stream, I liked the music off a lot more because it helped me focus a lot more than usual, concerning I have ADHD.\n...I turn on the music for Howling Abyss and Crystal Scar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThoughtEntity","date":"2014-11-15T11:00:35.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:37}}  :)","replies":[]}]}
