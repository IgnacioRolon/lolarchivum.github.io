One of two things would happen: the old client loading screen showed up, followed bu an \"unspecified error\" before it even got past zero, and crash;  a small patching window showed up, where a loading bar would get to a random distance, and restart upon lost connection, resulting in an endless loop of this little loading window.  \r\n\r\nI tried disabling antivirus, giving league exclusions, disabling windows firewall, deleting some stuff in the RADS folder or whatever some other threads suggested, deleting/uninstalling the game and re-installing from the website, repair tool, etc.\r\n\r\nNothing worked.  I can't install league without getting that small window which starts at 0 Mb / 0 Mb, goes to 0 Mb / 5000ish Mb, then goes to 6000ish Mb / 5000 ish Mb (this part especially makes no sense), then resets to an endless loading loop where its trying to get to 1460 Mb or so, but never does.  \r\n\r\nSo, tell me, how do I install League of Legends?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-17T20:52:47.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's try getting you a fresh start with that installation.
