Once everyone picked their champion, I was waiting at loading screen for a good while, and it was just black. Nothing there, literally a black screen. I tried to ctrl+alt+dlt to get myself out and eventually my team just did a remake. Can someone help me out with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-15T20:46:31.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network may have lost connection here and left you behind.
