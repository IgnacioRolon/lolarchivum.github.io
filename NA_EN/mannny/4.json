Melee carries wouldn't be viable bot lane because it's impossible to build full damage as a melee carry and not get blown up in teamfights. That's why no one builds full damage Jax, why Fiora sucks at teamfighting. ADC does change. You have caster and attack based AD carries.

Battle Mages have DPS - Ryze, Rumble, Swain, Cass, etc - but they don't go bot lane. Skirmishers and many Divers are primarily DPS, but they don't go bot lane, either.\n\nADCs go bot lane, not because they're DPS, but because they are incredibly strong when allowed to farm tons of gold to purchase high-end items while protected by a dedicated support. They completely crowd out other options because of their range and being auto-attack based, giving a significant early game advantage against melee champions and most mages.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-06-23T00:14:37.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ok then allow me to explain why you're wrong using basic logic, and I'll go case by case. Either you're stupid or just wanting me to explain, either way, you're horrifically wrong.\n\nRyze - Other than he sucks, he requires decent amounts of setup for damage during laning which doesn't work well in duo lanes. His ultimate is also best used in mid lane, which is why top lane Ryze died.\n\nRumble - He's very low ranged compared to range champions so he would suck at teamfights if he built glass cannon like the \"marksmen role\" does. Also his low range would lose him the lane, especially a duo lane. He's an \"anti bruiser\" for a reason.\n\nSwain - All the same reasons as Rumble, except with more. ADCs, which is the entire lane, can buy Mortal Reminder. Supports can also carry ignite, unlike top laners who would be punished for not having teleport.\n\nCassiopeia - Her E ability makes her a high zoning against the hyper mobile assassins. Otherwise I have no clue why she hasn't been tried bot lane, except for maybe her rough powercurve.\n\nEvery single god damn fighter - Here's the one where you don't need to think hard. Why is Rageblade shit on Jax, Xin Zhao, Irelia, Aatrox, ect? Same reason Infinity Edge is. They're melee, they can't afford to build full damage unless they want to get blown up, they don't have the safety of range, and thus must build tank/bruiser items which don't scale up exponentially.\n\nHave you ever thought that maybe it was because of their mid game and late game and nothing to do with the early game is why melee's aren't brough bot lane? Why the design of Mordekaiser \"Marksmen\" failed? Seriously, please just think logically, so I don't have to waste my time explaining the fundamentals of the game because someone wants to circlejerk that ADCs are broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-06-23T01:13:11.411+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You continue to troll around and completely ignore the point of this thread.\n\n_Why does it matter if other classes are able to go bot lane?_\n\n_Why does it matter if **1** mage was able to have a tiny, but successful, play rate in bot lane?_\n\n_Why is it acceptable for 1 class to have a complete monopoly on an entire position?_\n\nEverything you are stating isn't answering or even contradicting any of these questions or concerns. All you are doing is stating _why_ Marksmen are overwhelmingly strong in the bot lane and crowd out all other potential picks. \n\n_That isn't the point!_\n\nWe all know _why_ they have a monopoly in Bot. What we're asking is why they are _allowed_ to have a monopoly there, and why ADC mains are so obstinate that no other champion ever be allowed to set foot in the role. \n\nRiot doesn't like it either. They've shown through Mordekaiser's rework, the initial concept for Yasuo, designing (or embracing - Graves) Marksmen for other roles like the Jungle (so that a team doesn't hurt in some areas if they take a different class bot), and their acceptance (and explicit statements they made) of Ziggs Bot, that they want to fix this problem and give other champions a chance to be viable in bot lane.\n\nHaving a Marksmen-Only bot lane is unhealthy for the game, restricts champion diversity, and inhibits the meta from growing and developing to an extent. We aren't saying all Marksmen should be gutted and kicked out of bot lane. But having it be viable for Marksment to only have a 60 or 70% pick rate in Bot and have other champions able to succeed there and bring different strengths and attributes to their teams would be a_good thing!_","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-06-23T01:39:34.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> What we're asking is why they are allowed to have a monopoly there, and why ADC mains are so obstinate that no other champion ever be allowed to set foot in the role.\n\nNo ADC main is stopping other champions from doing role. ADC is a strict role because it's required. You need DPS on your team, and AD is the only class with DPS that doesn't fall off. You need to understand that. It's not they don't want variety, it's that the variety just can't exist.\n\nMorde's rework failed for this exact reason. He had to be grossly overpowered, or unviable because he didn't provide high DPS.\n\nWhen has marksmen only bot lane been unhealthy? It never has. The meta always grows and marksmen aren't stopping it. Other champions attributes don't belong in the bot lane, they exist already in other roles. Every role but top lane and jungle have very strict requirements. Top lane is brawling tanky characters or anti bruisers; mid lane is burst; support is protection (enchance, peel, zone). You don't grasp that.\n\nYou can try it. Get 9 other people and play the game without marksmen. You'll find teamfighting very different. Play Jax vs Aatrox in the bot lane, full damage. Mid/late comes and the mage or top lane blows them up without any safety from range.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-06-23T02:47:37.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AirKingNeo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nEK1Xwag,comment-id=0000000100020000000100000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-23T01:39:34.641+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s not they don&#x27;t want variety, it&#x27;s that the variety just can&#x27;t exist.\n\nFINALLY!\n\nIt seems you have finally understood the point of this entire thread!
