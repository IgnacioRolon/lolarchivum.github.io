It is the default mode for League of Legends, the most standard way to play.  Normal is \"practice\" and nothing you do there qualifies you to play in ranked.  Only playing in ranked, qualifies you to play ranked.\n\nAs such, rank is divided into many divisions of play and depending on your skill as a player (not with a champion, but as a player) you are placed into your appropriate division.  As such if your an Iron IV player for example, its assumed you are a general nooby and are playing at the lowest skill level, again, as a player, not as a player playing a specific champion.\n\nEvery player before entering ranked must achieve 30 levels on their account in normal games, intended to assure you understand the rules and flow of the game, it does not assume that you are a professional player or that you are an expert with every champion, this is a significant amount of experience with the game, again, as a player, not as a player with a specific champion.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is geared towards the player and while there are mastery systems and some system bias towards playing champions you are familiar with, there are also automations in place that could conceivably force you to play a champion you are not familiar with.  For example your mains get banned, you get autofilled into a position you don't normally play, or as a result of someone on the opposite team picking the champs you normally play.  This happens to everyone from time to time and we all find ourselves forced to play positions and champions that we don't know anything about.  The assumption is, that as a player with 30 levels of experience you should be able to pick up any champion or any position and play with a reasonable amount of skill and that is a part of the intended challenge for players.\n\nFor example I normally play Malphite Top or Nami as support.  Now if I get autofilled as a Jungler, I will definitely be playing at a major disadvantage as I neither know the position well or the champions for those positions.  Still, I'm a reasonably experienced player and its expected as part of the competitive scene that I will work it out.","replies":[{"poster":"BackdoorPrincess","date":"2019-05-06T12:39:23.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Normal is \"practice\"\n\nEnd smug reply, question was literally why is someone allowed to play a champ they have never/only played a few times, I wouldn't say it's out of the question to force ~10 games on a champ before playing it in ranked, bots are available, \"practice normals\" are available, hell even aram gives you a feel for a champ after a few times, but a teammate picking a champ they've never played just to counterpick their lane puts them at a massive disadvantage, which in this snowball burst meta puts your team at an even bigger disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2019-05-06T20:01:40.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BackdoorPrincess,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x5d8fkv0,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-05-06T12:39:23.007+0000)\n>\n>  I wouldn't say it's out of the question to force ~10 games on a champ before playing it in ranked, bots are available\n\n10 games of bots/norms?

Just play out the scenario.\n\nYou join a ranked game, you que up with your main top and support bottom.  You are autofilled into the jungle, the champion you might have some familiarity with gets picked or banned by the opposing team.\n\nThis scenario happens all the time.\n\n> no...co-op vs ai is practice\n\nReally?  Are you sure?  So your saying that a person that plays a champion 10 times in Co-Op is ready to join your team in ranked play? \n\nThe only way to get experience in ranked play is to play ranked.  Co-Op and Normal are entirely different games and even if you do practice like hell with every champion you can get your hands on, at any given time you only really know a handful of champions.  You will eventually due to circumstances of drafting and autofills be forced to play champions you are not familiar with.  \n\nHell I have been playing for the better part of a decade.  For a couple of years I played Jungle exclusively, that does not qualify me to do it today, two years ago is two years ago, it may as well be 30 years ago.\n\nThe best thing for any player to do is as soon as they hit level 30, start playing ranked.  That's where you get the best practice, the best competition.  Yeah you will lose a bunch of games and end up playing in low divisions, but that is where you belong so its the right place for you.","replies":[{"poster":"BackdoorPrincess","date":"2019-05-06T13:40:34.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you don't seem to be getting it. You know why overwatch ranked makes sense at 25? Because there is a **significantly** lower number of champs than league, on top of there really isn't that much in the way of diversity, certainly not confusingly so (how many damage types have hard cc at range or soft cc in addition to damage). If you're stumbling into ranked with only two, god forbid one, especially if its the flavor of the month champ in each position, you are setting your team up for failure, and it's one of the most frustrating things to have happen in a promo match or even placements. Look at how many champs there are, this isn't the casually pick up and play ranked type of game, even just getting to 30 there are a _ton_ of champs you probably have never even seen before, and that's before you get into off-meta builds on champs you **do** know. Literally anywhere that has a guide for ranked recommends at least 4-5 champs per role you are comfortable with, you might get counterpicked and they might main said counterpick, but at least you're comfortable with that champ and should by then know how to level/item/play at an acceptable level for where you're ranked, and this isn't even getting into people that do this fresh at level 30 for placements.\n\n> Really? Are you sure? So your saying that a person that plays a champion 10 times in Co-Op is ready to join your team in ranked play? \n\nNo they certainly aren't, but you know, I'll take setting a bar as low as the current presidency over the literal nothing requirement that we currently have. If you're saying that you can't put in 200-400 minutes on that one champ to even get some basic combos or strats down, you have no business playing that champ in a gamemode where wins are actually recorded and affect where you are currently ranked. I would rather both sides have to do this than have games where I absolutely roflstomp the person that picked riven into garen having never played that matchup but \"oh riven's broken it's okay\". League has always been in dire need of a gamemode where you can test out each champ that isn't the PBE or waiting on weekly rotations before dropping that precious BE when you're still fresh leveling, but the argument of \"that's not a perfect solution so let's leave the problem alone\" is exactly how you get vayne in her current state.\n\nAgain, can't emphasize enough, you should be comfortable with several champions in each position, if somehow all 10 champs that get banned were all in that one specific lane and all people you exclusively play then yeah you probably get a pass for that freak accident (and a lesson in why you should play more than just the fan favorites atm) but even when I hit 30 **in season 3** all of my friends made sure I knew how to play each position leading up til that point with several different champs so that that specific scenario wouldn't happen, yeah you might get stuck with Susan or Mundo or someone super lackluster, but those cheap champs exist for a raisin.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-05-06T12:43:10.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"no...co-op vs ai is practice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-05-06T13:36:20.531+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Prove they have no experience.
