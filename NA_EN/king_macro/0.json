Once I logged back in I was not given the option to join a game nor was i penalized for dodging. After a short period of time I was alerted that I was placed on Low Priority que and was marked for a loss due to a remake. I had no chance of joining back into this game and was penalized and placed in low priority que. Is there any way I could get loss prevented and have my low priority que lifted?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T21:41:32.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look into this for you, and it seems that the game may have already been remade before being able to rejoin the match.
