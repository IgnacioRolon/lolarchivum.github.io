So the game started so I just go to my bottom land turrent and then  go use the restroom. I come back and I'm dead, apparently I was in the Teemo's attack range. Afterwords I told my friends as a joke \"Let's just all give the teemo a kill to give him a head-start\" so we give him like 2 more kills and start trying. Although my friend top is at like 0/2/0 at that point and is about to give up, plus my other teammate has to go afk for a bit. So after trying to kill the Teemo I end up dying like 6 more times, at this point me and my friend who just got back decide to run it into the enemies fountain since they are at our Inhib and soon to get our nexus with their 100/0 God-mo. However this is where things start to get interesting. The Teemo simply states that he will report me for inting, this is where I start to get a little bit worried because I wasn't sure whether I would get banned, however there wasnt really much to do to prove that I wasnt completely inting. So my question is, Can I be severely punished????? EDIT: The Teemo also added me just to say \"I just submitted a ticket\" with this screenshot attached: https://gyazo.com/bbba16392d0f1cd4d2e06efbd7efc7fc","replies":[]}
