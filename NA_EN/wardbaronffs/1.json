Her kit has been the same since 2011. What you're complaining about is rediculous. \n\nAnd guess what? She needs these things in her kit because all her abilities are SINGLE TARGET. She needs to be able to kite and knock people back and tumble skill shots and on top of that all her abilites are AA range. Take away her Q and E and stealth from her R and what does she have? She would be garbage just like this post.","replies":[{"poster":"WardBaronFFS","date":"2018-01-19T21:50:47.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am listening. Im saying their is multiple solutions to the problem like removing things that would allow her to peel so easily or stun or dodge I get it single target woohoo but who cares single target adcs dont always get these stupid things.....Jhin why doesnt he have all this mobility and stealth????? I mean hes a single target adc........ Or kog maw yes you can get a ruunans (MY SPELLING) but cant you build that on vayne lmao your point is valid but so is mine we can keep the damage and nerf other parts or nerf the damage and keep the other parts and dont go personally attacking people just sorta breaking rules of the boards btw.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2018-01-15T15:34:21.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also her items are cheap and she gets a much easier laning phase rn with the relic meta.
