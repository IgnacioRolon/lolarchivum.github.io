With League being a free to play game, there wouldn't be much longevity if you were able to have all the content unlocked for free in a very short amount of time. \n\nOver time, you'll be gaining levels and getting chests which contain champion shards. Those you can use to keep getting blue essence which you can use to buy whichever champions you want. You don't have to spend real money, it only helps to unlock content like champions and skins immediately instead of earning it over time.","replies":[]}]}
