Please run a Chkdsk utility.\"\r\n\r\nThe first time it took a repair that took forever.  (So long in fact that I gave up an hour into it).  Then league was suddenly working the next day.  Now a few days later the same thing happened.  Anyone know what causes this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T17:58:27.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running a repair as you performed previously can help resolve issues with bad game files and get you fixed up.  If this issue continues, there might be a hardware issue that's causing this.  Running a chkdisk could help tremendously by finding areas on your drive running poorly, and could fix this through repair.  Otherwise, you may need to swap in another hard drive.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
