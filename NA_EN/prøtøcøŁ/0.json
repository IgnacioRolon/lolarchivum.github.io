The[ IP Breakdown Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824-Reward-IP-XP-System-Breakdown) gives an example that 37 minute loss could earn you 68 IP while a 37 minute win could give 100.  New accounts might also get IP and XP faster, and there are other factors too like boosts.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
