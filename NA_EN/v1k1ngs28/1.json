Come on........","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-03T19:35:55.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion select on the updated client currently has an attempting to reconnect feature.  It sounds like you might have a bad connection that's completely getting kicked off champion select.  You should run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, and test it over a custom game to be sure it works.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"V1k1ngs28","date":"2017-03-04T03:05:18.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response but It only happens every now and again. I play all the time and it doesn't lose connection. And then of course I get in a series and it freezes....just unlucky I guess. You said updated client has an attempting to reconnect figure? Is that in the beta client? Otherwise I have the updated version and didnt even get the chance to try and reconnect. I could browse through the internet just fine in the mean time..","replies":[]}]}]}
