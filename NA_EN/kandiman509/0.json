I have left games in the past and after a while i realized it wasn't just myself i was causing problems for but my whole team too. They got a loss and i got a leaver. But this time my internet went down and i know I've been reported in the past. Is there any way i can check if my acct was ban? Would i even be able to log into the website to discuss this? Im so stressed out because i have a lot of joy in the acct and i don't want to lose it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T23:26:49.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No bans for you!! Don't worry about that one game, leaverbusters won't actually ban you. If you end up leaving multiple games you might have to sit through a low-priority queue but you shouldn't be banned. \n\nAnother little tidbit, even if you **were** banned from the game, you'll still be able to access the boards! These profiles are linked, but they are in fact 2 separate profiles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-06-01T21:46:13.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. LeaverBuster does not issue bans, only low priority queues.\n  * These queues will extent the amount of time it takes for you to get into Champ Select. \n\n2.
