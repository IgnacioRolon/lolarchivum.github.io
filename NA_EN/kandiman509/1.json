I get that I flame when i am upset but i just got off a 2 week ban and now my account is perma-banned because i was sticking up for myself? I put so much time and money into this game that i made this game my life for the last couple years and recruited so many of my friends thinking it was a good game. The 2 week i completely understand why, i was in the wrong on that one, but this time is complete crap. I got banned after the SECOND GAME OFF BAN! All because the mid laner kept calling me names and kept telling the enemy team to report me for being \"toxic\" when i was defending myself. SUCH A GREAT COMMUNITY. THANKS SO MUCH. I'm probably NEVER going to hear back from anyone about this but oh hey he isn't going to get penalized. FANTASTIC. Great to know that the ban system is going to continue to screw people who defend themselves so that riot can keep getting loads of money that people dump into this game because their account before gets banned. \r\nRiot doesn't give a crap about their players or their customers. Why would they when they can keep sitting on more and more money?\r\nGreat job. I'm livid but not like riot cares the only people who are going to see this are players. Why would riot care to look at message boards. whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T21:19:47.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely look through these posts and try to give the best answers/advice, but there isn't a lot that we help and support agents can do on our end about in-game punishments.
