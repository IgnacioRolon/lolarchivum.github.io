And I was wondering what I would have to focus on, if I would like to be a player support one day. I would prefer to fulfill this dream for Riot games, as I really enjoy the game. And despite reading so many mean comments about the player support, \"Where I don't know what they are talking about, because each time I created a ticket, I did get a fast and good answer. \" I would like to work in that field. I am used to the life of a Support, that u are getting yelled on a daily basis and that your work might not be displayed, or better, valued as high as others. But it still is important. Too highlight my main question,\r\n**What should you focus on, if you want to become a player support?**\r\n**Which languages should you focus on? **\r\n**Can you make up missing experience, with dedication? **\r\n**Should you invest more in xml/flwr or sql, in order to save/retrieve Data?**\r\n**Do you have to be perfect, before trying to get a job in this field?**\r\nI am sorry, cause this might not be right place to ask, but I guess this is the place where many people will search. So it might help others, too. \r\n{{champion:26}} \r\nI gonna repost it on euw if you don't mind.\r\nC ya on the rift, if ya visit euw servers. And if ya visiting Regensburg/bavaria/germany I might be able to help ya.\r\nRegards\r\nSyIÃ¢r","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T05:47:39.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to preface this with the following: **It's best to check with the specific post for the position that you're interested in. These posts do a fantastic job at detailing the type of person we look for and what specific requirements are associated with the position.**\n_____\n\nAlright, now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's break this down:\n\n> \"What should you focus on, if you want to become a player support?\"\n\nI worked in a lot of customer service positions before I got in with Player Support. I feel that spending a lot of time in positions that allowed me to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures really prepared me for helping players from all over the world. \n\n> \"Which languages should you focus on?\"\n\nI'm not sure if you meant programming languages or written/spoken languages. If the latter, I'd recommend English and any other language supported on your region. If the former, it really depends on which role in Player Support you're aiming for.\n\n> \"Can you make up missing experience, with dedication?\"\n\nAgain, it really depends on the specific position you're applying for. Some positions have more flexible requirements than others. Dedication is great, just make sure to find the right channel so that dedication can grow into something tangible. Even if you don't think it's great, having something to physically show as a result of your passion can go a long way\n\n> \"Should you invest more in xml/flwr or sql, in order to save/retrieve Data?\"\n\nNot sure the answer to this one. This may be a better question for one of our NOC techs. :P\n\n> \"Do you have to be perfect, before trying to get a job in this field?\"\n\nNope! I'm certainly not perfect and in my personal belief, imperfection in itself is a human trait. ^.^\n_____\n\nI hope this helped in some fashion.
