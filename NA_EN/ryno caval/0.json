Everyone has done it once or twice or an indefinite amount of times.  I personally dodge if i get paired up with someone I played with previously who is not very good or when someone on my team bans my pick. I try to avoid dodging as it is aggravating to other players but there are situations where it is unavoidable. I think there should be a timer from when you last dodged and when your &quot;first dodge of the day&quot; timer resets. Its almost necessary to dodge if you are trying to climb because the free to play nature of the game and to avoid smurfs and boosters.
