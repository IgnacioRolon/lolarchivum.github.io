I think everyone will love it. If u don&#039;t know what a Orca is it is also called a Killer Whale so imagine Nami&#039;s tail as a killer whales Tail and her back is where the fin is so on and so forth. So tell me what you guys think about it :D &lt;3 hope u guys like my idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Barbwired Mind","date":"2015-08-27T05:49:47.496+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean Tundra Nami?
