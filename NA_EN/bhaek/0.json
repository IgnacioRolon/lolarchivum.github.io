I was wondering if the grade that is permanent on your champion is the one you get your chest with or did the system just glitch and didn't register the grade I got today. This is another question but I think after last patch my ping went up to 101 but prior to it, it was around 60.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-17T04:38:11.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you've earned a chest for S- or higher on a champion, you won't be able to get another chest from that champion for the rest of the season. Along with that, I believe the score that is registered on the collection screen is permanent as it's showing the grade that got you the chest. \n\nIf your ping is constantly around 101, there might be some network setting that is affecting your connection with our servers. Go through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and we should be able to get to the bottom of that ping spike.","replies":[{"poster":"Bhaek","date":"2017-04-17T04:44:18.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh I see, I was hoping to get S+ on every champ but it's a shame that it won't show in my collection.
