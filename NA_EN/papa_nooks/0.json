After that, it&#039;s a 3 day ban. Then 1 week, then 2 weeks, then permaban. If your warning/ban was chat-related, you also receive a chat restriction that lasts for several games and restricts the number of chat messages you&#039;re allowed to type.\r\n\r\nDisconnecting and idling are handled by an entirely different system called Leaverbuster. This is automated and doesn&#039;t rely on reports or votes from other players. Leaverbuster bans come much more swiftly than Tribunal bans. It is possible but rare to get permabanned by Leaverbuster... you have to really demonstrate that you have no intention of playing games to completion despite multiple warnings.\r\n\r\nDo i really  deserve a instant perma even thought ive literally gotten msg from riot on my client thank you for being a good sportsmanlike player in like season 4 or 5  ill take the rest of the season if i could off to lif this perma btw this this case is already being solved but i would like to hear what others think","replies":[{"poster":"ThrÃ«at","date":"2017-07-04T07:53:24.311+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, you deserve it. I also want to point out that in the game where you were Jhin and talking down to your team mates about feeding fizz, you did extremely poorly that game. You shouldn't judge your team mates so harshly unless you are playing top notch yourself, and even then it should be advice giving not trash talking. You did 12.6k damage as jhin. The ekko did pretty good going 10-4-111 and did 26.2k damage. The Kindred as a jungler did 21.8k damage, the ziggs went 9-9-12 and did 31k damage. As an ADC you had legit no damage at all, it looks like you spent more of the game flaming than you did actually playing.\n\nOn top of this, you only had 11k damage. They died more than you but had more gold than you. That means even with their higher amount of deaths they still managed to level and gain gold better than you. In a 33 minute game you only had 155 CS. You clearly were not playing to win, you were playing to scapegoat your loss on the team mates that were having harsh games while they were playing to win.\n\nI'm telling you right now, after you make a new account, don't trash talk your team mates. Sometimes they end up being a shit ton better than you but you just don't have the game knowledge to understand it yet. Good luck on your next account.\n\nPS: You talked down to people that were bronze because you were silver 4. You quickly dropped down to silver 5 0 LP and actually have bronze MMR. Is it not ironic to you that you talked down to people that were literally playing at the same skill level as you? The only difference between a silver 5 0 LP and a Bronze 1/2, even 3 is just placement luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Nooks","date":"2017-07-04T07:56:15.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Why do others get warning or 14 day bans that what i mainly dont understand i understand what i did wrong but why compared to others its permanent","replies":[{"poster":"Kitty Cat Tosha","date":"2017-07-04T08:29:53.650+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"You managed to cram hate speech, death threats, threats of trolling, condescension,negativity, ggez and jerkyness in one game.
