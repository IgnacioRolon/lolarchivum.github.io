Sometimes your connection can go dormant and time out from the servers, but it still lets you chat and the timer continues to countdown. At that point even if you do ban/lock-in that signal doesn't ever actually get sent to the servers, so to the game it seems like you didn't click anything. Then, you time out and get a leaver penalty due to your network timing out. \n\nIf this *ever* happens, it's a really good first step to try testing your connection to make sure you can still talk with our servers efficiently. It's not uncommon whatsoever to be able to access servers like youtube/reddit but not be able to reach certain gaming servers like ours or Blizzards. Double check your network settings with the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if you can make that bridge with our servers any smoother.","replies":[]}]}
