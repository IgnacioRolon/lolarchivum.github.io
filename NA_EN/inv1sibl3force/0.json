And when i check the match history or that person they are always on a 10 loosing spree or something like that. How do you deal with those ppl.\nI just got out of a game were j4 {{champion:59}} and ashe {{champion:22}}  carryed, they didnt say anything , but blitz {{champion:53}}  and yas {{champion:157}}  were both bad and spammed ez or izi all game long i checked and they both were on a 5 loss spree. And its every time i check not 1 time but every time . So i was asking myself what they tryed to do maybe its to bring back their confidence. What do you think?\n\nposted this on gameplay mb XD but its part of the game so i let it .","replies":[{"poster":"Emperor Talquin","date":"2019-11-18T19:54:28.465+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually used by players who got carried or are degenerates. \n\nI only type it if i've just hard stomped a game, which i guess makes me a part-time degenerate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-19T00:54:27.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turn off /all chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Inv1sibl3Force","date":"2019-11-19T11:12:06.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I created an account named mute all king 1 year ago XD i used to mute every body but i feel bad about my team mates.

Get over it, you know you did your best, You know they sucked, so what?\n\nIf it really affects you so much that just means you don't believe in what you did. There really is no point giving them the reaction they want.\n\nI only ever BM if the enemy BMs from being ahead then at the end of the game i tease them a bit. And I usually say \"ggez\" when the game was extremely hard to me lmao. they do it just to joke most likely. calm down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"macspam","date":"2019-11-18T20:02:53.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only say EZ ironically when I lose but about those who say it in a mocking way, it might be a little tilting but it's not really reportable.
