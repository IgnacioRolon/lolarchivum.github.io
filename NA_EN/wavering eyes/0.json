I had a few conversations with my friends and the messages went through without error. I was in the process of writing a feedback report through the app, when I glanced away from my phone to watch LCK. My phone locked and I reopened the app and returned to the feedback page to my half written report. The app then closed itself and upon reopening the app I am still signed in, can see and receive new messages, but when I try to reply it prompts me to sign in again. I input my login info and am told that I am logging in, but it loads endlessly. This is probably a rare case because of what happened, so I tried to describe as well as I could exactly how I came to this situation. Basically, the app works in the sense that I receive and can open messages, but trying to reply or write another feedback report prompts me to sign in and signing in loads endlessly.","replies":[{"poster":"Wavering Eyes","date":"2016-01-27T10:24:58.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow. A few minutes after writing this post the problem appears to have resolved itself. The app is now fully functional and I am signed in. I'm sorry if I wasted your time if you read the post beforehand, I am new here and do not know how to edit or delete my post. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of testing. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot DevilPup","date":"2016-01-27T18:59:11.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed feedback!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChocChipCookie","date":"2016-01-27T18:56:31.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the heads up - even if it's working now!","replies":[]}]}]}
