I can't speak to the specifics due to spoilers, but let's just say that we'd like to visit Noxus, and certain important characters, this year. This doesn't necessarily mean a lore event, before folks read too much into this. Sorry I can't be more specific.\n\nTo your specific example, we had a breaking session a while back that included a story about Karma and the Black Rose that I loved the shit out of. That doesn't mean it will be one of the pieces we release this year (it's a complicated story and challenge for various media types), but I just wanted you to know it's an aspect we do think about.\n\nThanks for the Q, Happy Poro.","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2016-01-19T22:28:05.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please make Noxus not just a place where bad guys some from.
