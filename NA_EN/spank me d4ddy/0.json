'constructive.'\n\nAnd while I don't have an issue with you personally, what the ever popular Jar Jarvan and ApatheticCPU is doing isn't constructive.\n\nHere's a majority of the posts, but rewritten to be constructive:\n\n'Hello!\n\nJust a few things:\n\nYour sword is a bit big and bulky, and looks like it might be made of cardboard or some material; While it has the correct shape, it looks like it might be a bit of an issue were you to take your costume to a con or elsewhere. you might be interested in scaling it down, and applying some finish, to really round out the appearance, and make the weapon more of a size that you can easily carry around during a con. \n\nI also notice you have tattoo's, most cosplayers aren't particularly concerned about tattoo's (seriously) BUT if you're going to a photoshoot and want to look more like Riven, You can use (insert reccomendations here) to cover it up temporarily.\n\nFinally,  I personally noted that it looks like there's a bit of bunching around the bottom of your outfit that looks a bit unflattering. There are some sprays that can be used or a slight modification of the outfit could prevent any embarassing occurences during a convention or meet up.\n\nOtherwise, the costume looks on track! I'd encourage you to look for a nice park or Photogenic area to take your next photos!'\n\n>> but that isn't what most of these people did. They used unflattering terms and pretty much implied that short of being a professional south Korean cosplayer, this individual had better not. >> And as someone who cosplays, that's not the message cosplayers want to be known for sending.","replies":[{"poster":"Häßlich","date":"2015-09-05T21:49:11.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel a need to sugar coat it.
