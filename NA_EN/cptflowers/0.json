Urf, Star Guardian, and Doom Bots. I've read the Honor FAQ and honestly, I'm personally asking how I've not gained Honor 5 at this point. I'm getting honors, I've read the FAQ and you don't need to get honors and you'll still slowly gain honor over time. But I would be surprised if that would be true if over 520 games while getting honored I haven't gotten it at this point. I've been honorable throughout my entire league career, I've gotten the Santa Baron icon, All the honor reward summoner icons, the friendly behavior icon from a few years ago as well. I've never been banned or chat restricted before yet I've read countless claims that people have gotten Honor 5 while being toxic and previously chat restricted before. I just find it hard to believe I haven't gotten Honor 5 at this point unless my account is bugged. Can I get a rioter to respond to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T05:02:35.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you haven't had any actual chat punishments, keep in mind that even borderline toxic behavior in chat can be picked up on. It looks like there are a couple of games that came close to needing to be actioned on, but in these cases, the system decided to give you some slack and not actually punish you. Even though you weren't punished, those chat logs can still hold some weight and slow down your Honor game. Stay honorable and your honor rate should pick back up.","replies":[{"poster":"CptFlowers","date":"2017-11-06T05:40:06.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JgXGLLHh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-06T05:02:35.887+0000)\n>\n> While you haven&#x27;t had any actual chat punishments, keep in mind that even borderline toxic behavior in chat can be picked up on.

I know that your honor can slow down but after 530+ games I still haven't even came close to reaching it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jestraa","date":"2017-11-06T07:15:16.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was curious if the system was bugged too, I've been at honor 3 since like the second or third week the new system came out, hit it before any of my friends, now they're all 4 and 5 and im just sitting here like whats going on?","replies":[]}]}
