All items that I have earned after the first error notification appeared were not displayed in my Loot. I filled in the \"Report a bug\" form and submitted it to OCE LoL. They still haven't replied to my form yet (I wonder if they ever reply to bug reports). Magically the error is now gone somehow but all the items that I earned during the bug above still disappear. What can I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:17:19.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you couldn't see them for a moment but then they finally showed back up, it was due to a connection issue where your network wasn't able to grab the loot data for your account. If that happens again, try refreshing your client and connection really quickly to get a cleaner signal. You can also try updating your network settings following the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[{"poster":"K4G4","date":"2017-10-20T11:19:40.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Broporo.\n1. There is no problem with my network I think because I can still play League and do other stuff normally. (no ping spike or anything)\n2. I can't see items that I earned from the beginning of the glitch and now when the glitch is gone, those items still disappears (not just for a moment)  even when I restart the client or the computer or wait until the next day to open it again.\n3. Granted that there was a problem with my network at that time and it made my loot data disappear (it still disappears now), what can I do to get my items back?\nThanks for your reply.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrHollandLop","date":"2017-10-18T11:15:03.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same prob bro","replies":[]}]}
