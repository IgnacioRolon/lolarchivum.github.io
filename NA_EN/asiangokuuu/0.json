I've spent alot of time and money in that acc and it all come to waste, lol. And just now my new acc got \"leaver buster\" warning again cause i was playing in a cafe and got internet problem! I mean whats the point of this? \r\n\r\nRiot if youre reading this you just make people lost interest in League of Legends not make it better. \r\nPeople leave game not because they wanted to, alot of player gotten into different situation like internet problems etc and you just make a system that banned our acc like we were a robot player without feelings. Do you know our frustation when we got dced? how hard we try to get back into the game but we cant? how many times we restart the computer just to get back to the game and when we has to wait a couple minutes just to queue which if it happen again goes up to 20 mins? \r\n\r\nYo riot, people got dced everyday not because they wanted to. If you really wanted to make things right just leave it to their teammates. They can report the leaver themself! Theres no need to make a system that banned people just because technical problem happen Jesus.. \r\n\r\n> If you got hit by a car by accident and then the police put you in jail while youre injured everywhere instead of the driver, would you be happy?","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-07-21T15:42:53.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If you got hit by a car by accident and then the police put you in jail while youre injured everywhere instead of the driver, would you be happy?\n\nActually, the more apt comparison would be that you're playing in a football match with nine other players, five versus five. However, you didn't sleep well that night because of the noise your neighbour keeps making and you decide to leave the game early to get some shut-eye.\n\nThe nine who were playing with you now have to play 4 versus 5, which isn't entirely balanced and they don't enjoy the game as much as they could have. (Maybe the five guys who're winning.)\n\nYou pull this behaviour consistently, even if it's never really your fault. (You get called away because your dad's in the hospital, you have to leave because your dog died, you quit halfway because of a stomach ulcer...)\n\nAfter doing this for the tenth time, you show up to play and the people there all tell you they don't want to play with you because you consistently ruin the game for everyone by leaving repeatedly.\n\nDoes it matter that it's never your fault when you abandon the game and leave nine people in the lurch? It doesn't. You're still negatively affecting everyone you play with on a consistent basis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Leper COn","date":"2016-07-21T17:06:43.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A much more realistic comparison than the Op's, as well as being very well written.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T15:17:18.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The [lower priority queue](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) should allow you time to troubleshoot any issues that might cause an interruption.
