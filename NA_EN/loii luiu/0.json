Or it's just a big finger to us and we gotta wait ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T23:31:34.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa that sounds pretty shitty to be completely honest. Let's get you in touch with our Billing Agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and they should be able to get that refunded for you as long as the RP is still on your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"El√Æjah","date":"2017-12-09T19:05:31.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, preseason was a good place where you could transfer and accomodate to the new server, as we know, not all servers have the same amount of competitive/good players/good games, and we could have adjust there while untill the start of the season, i even heard a rumor transfers will be open when the season start, how is that cool or fair, well you tell me. I honestly think they just want to make them available then and not now, i kinda refuse to think that a big team like theirs can`t fix a bug like this, wich average tech guys can resolve, no hate towards the RIOT team, but it is what it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-07T16:20:06.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming you haven't spent it yet. Well, in that case, at least you'll be prepared for when the option becomes available again. It's not as if you didn't receive what you paid for. You paid for RP, and received it. You just weren't able to get what you were expecting out of it at the moment of purchase. It wasn't an unintentional purchase, as you decided to hold on to the RP for a specific purpose all this time. The longer you wait before trying to request a refund, the less likely you'll be able to get that refund. $20-25 is nothing over the course of a couple months honestly, and you'd end up spending the same amount anyways when transfers do become available, right?","replies":[{"poster":"LoIi LuIu","date":"2017-12-07T16:23:30.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather spend 20 euro on something i can actually have, if I knew it'd take 2 month i could have taken a XP boost and make a fresh account on the server I wanted and be 30 already\n\nWhat pisses me off is that we've been given dates and it keeps being pushed back, why would it take 2+ months to fix a server transfering system","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-07T17:01:13.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had 20 euros. You now have 20 euros worth of RP. You do _actually_ have something, nothing is missing. You just don't have the option for the specific thing you purchased the RP for at the moment. You _could_ spend it on anything else available for RP if you wanted to _actually have_ something, apart from the RP or the server transfer at the moment. Or, you could continue to patiently wait until it's available again. Another option is to go ahead and create that account on the server you wanted to transfer to. This would allow you to see the difference, if any, that transferring servers would do for you, and it would be 100% free unless you decided to spend something there too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
