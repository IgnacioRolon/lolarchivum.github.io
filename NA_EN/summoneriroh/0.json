Think 'Azir.' Though, in that case...Sivir **would** likely be the one doing his dirty work. But she wouldn't be the inquisitor.

But also the basic frame of 'eternal battle of 'good' vs 'evil.' ' Most LoL lore is pretty non-specific from which culture it's taken from, or is a mishmash of several ideas. Some are pretty obvious where the main part of the idea came from- Karma- Buddhism,\nNasus/Renekton/Azir/Amumu- Egyptian,\nPantheon/Leona/Diana- Spartan and by extension Greek..)\nBut they all have their own bit of unique flavor. And most are set in kind of a good lighting (unless it's 'good' vs 'evil' type story, and even then usually there's reasons to side with the one more on the 'evil' end, or reasons the 'good' side isn't exactly black and white.)\n\nThe Inquisition is pretty much all bad lighting and generally agreed to be a stain on Christian history. (There's a reason it's called the Dark Ages)\n\nThough KateyKhaos already said that wasn't the reason for the change, I'd still hold it to be a bad idea to use such a bad era of Christianity in such a forward/obvious way in LoL. Too much 'salt.'\n\nFor the Chinese 'can't show bones out of respect' part. It's out of respect, but also, if Riot wants LoL to be played in China, they -can't- show bones because China's equivalent of ESRB would ban the game if it showed skulls or exposed bone. So it would be **illegal** to play LoL in China. China's a huge part of online gaming culture, Riot wants to be part of online gaming.\n\nIn retrospect though, I probably should have said something closer to- 'too much negative religious context' other than 'too much religious meaning.'\n\nI actually love when they throw in biblical/religious ideas into game lore. I grew up in a heavy Christian environment, though I'm no longer Christian, I still have a lot of religious knowledge and have great respect for believers and the general healthy mental way of living/thinking a good Christian has. So it hits a nice happy part of my childhood to see it used. respectfully, in gaming.\n---\n**TL;DR**: Should have said Inquisitor has a bit too salt behind it other than 'too much religious meaning.'","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2015-02-19T22:28:43.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will I still think Inquisitor is the better name.\n\nI can respect what you are saying, and can see things from your view point.\n\nsome sadness that you no longer identify as a Christian but I can certainly respect and admire your willingness to at least be real about who you are... in a lot of ways that places you in a better place than many lukewarm Christians.\n\nSorry if I came off a bit defensive, I'm just tired of it always seeming like every culture is far game to pull from... until it gets to Christianity and then people seem to go out of their way to appear neutral, to the point that they discriminate against.\n\nAnyway, much love dude/dudet, and props on conducting yourself with some class.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-02-19T22:41:52.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inquisitor brings to mind a religious police force, like the ones that the church used to have.
