I need to edit the contents of the event to include the sign up link however I cannot.  I press edit event, add what I need to add and then press save.  It tells me that everything has saved correctly but nothing has changed.  I understand a rioter has approve the changes but the changes do not even show on my edit or preview end and I have tried to change it several times over the past few days with no changes to either the public or private view of the event.\r\nEvent link: http://events.na.leagueoflegends.com/events/121959\r\n\r\nI am having identical issues with this event: http://events.na.leagueoflegends.com/events/122261\r\nHowever in addition this event is intended to be held on summoner's rift using the Black Market Brawlers game mode but the Rioter that approved it changed the map to Butcher's Bridge.\r\n\r\nThank you for the swift assistance.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirrorsound","date":"2015-07-29T03:26:55.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anyone has suggestions it would be greatly appreciated!
