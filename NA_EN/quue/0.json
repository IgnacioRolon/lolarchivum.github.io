(Match making makes sure everyone is about a 50% win rate, Including hadicaps) I quit playing that game like a lot of others. Not that it means people will quit playing. People like the blow outs I guess, so it works, but not for me. Just wanted to say good buy to all and have fun. \r\n\r\njust some info:\r\nThis is based on 40+ games since update and I&#039;ve played over 3k Aram games. Blow out win or Blow out loss, What Fun!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-04T07:30:40.318+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">match making makes sure everyone is about a 50% win rate\n\nYou have a 50% winrate when you are playing with people of equal skill level, and the system tries its best to place you against people of your own skill level. That's all there is to it. It doesn't arbitrarily enforce a 50% winrate. That doesn't even make sense, because if it did force 50% winrate, then nobody would ever climb.","replies":[]}]}
