Two priorities for me here were:** staying with the theme of frosty archer and keeping her mechanics fairly simple.**\n\n**Focus - **Each time Ashe hits an enemy champion with a Frost Shot she gains a stack of Focus, upon reaching 5 stacks her next Frost Shot on a champion (has a cool spell effect added) is a guaranteed crit with 25% increased crit damage (multiplicative with IE) and has double the slow of a regular Frost Shot.\n\n**Hawkshot - **Passive - Old is scrapped and replaced with “when Ashe crits an enemy with an auto attack she gains true sight of them for the next 3 seconds, on target cd 10/9/8/7/6”. \n\nActive, reduce the CD to 30/27/24/21/18 but also halve the area size revealed and duration.\n\nAdded effect: If Hawkshot reveals any champions in the fog of war Ashe gains 15 gold.\n\n     - The idea of focus here is adding a bit more depth and dynamic to her kit. Since it is a straight up buff to her current passive, she loses the extra gold on unit kill on hawkshot to compensate, a mechanic that was itself very boring.\n\n     - On Hawkshot the passive change is meant to go with her theme and add more utility. The idea of her E is vision so Ashe's theme as an ADC is vision and cc. So adding a true vision proc goes well with it and gives Ashe something unique that could be situationally helpful (chasing which Ashe does/dealing with stealth escapes) but is not a straight up power boost.\n\n     - The change to the active is quality of life, current hawkshot covers a huge area for a long time and I rather have something smaller and quicker but that can be used more often, making it more fun, precise and strategic (and archer like so you have to really aim better at where you think they are). The added effect is minor but would be a fun addition\n\nWould these be what she needs? And if you don't like it, how would you change her passive and E?","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-11T19:50:53.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every 5th q auto is a stun(passive)\nplace a 30 sec ward where hawkshot lands(e) ","replies":[]}]}
