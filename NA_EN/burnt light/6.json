They nerfed him enough times in a row to finally get the community to shut up about it and stop permabanning him, and then quietly buffed him up to a power level several nerfs prior a few patches later once the hysteria around him had died down. Yasuos win rate is 47.5% now, it was 44.5% right before they nerfed his health and MS, and it was 42% after they nerfed those, and he's been sitting at around 47% since they buffed his Q and gave 5 MS back.
