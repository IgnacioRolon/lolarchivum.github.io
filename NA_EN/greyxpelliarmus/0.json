Previously, she was the Battle Mistress the title which was bestowed *by* Noxus. Also the video makes no mention of the weapon being a family heirloom. There's a old empire nearby, I can't believe it wasn't looted hardcore since it's fall, no reason to think Sivir is part of any special bloodline til you guys spell it out at the end.  Ancient weapon doesn't automatically equal family heirloom since we have no history of it's providence. \n\nDistracted?

Yes, her ancestors may be from Shurima, but that was centuries if not millenia ago, which is plenty of time to relocate and assimilate into another culture.

Cass knows how to handle a blade, she was just having to use alternative methods due to being on unfamiliar territory. She stepped out of her comfort zone for the good of the Du Couteaus and Noxus (though primarily herself, of course) and thought she'd pulled it off to perfection. There were just a few aspects of Shurima that even her considerable charms had been unable to uncover beforehand. A little knowledge is an extremely dangerous thing.\n* Azir saves his descendant within the waters that mark the birthplace of Shurima's capital, a city that once ensured life and prosperity for countless thousands in one of Runeterra's most inhospitable places. I can't be too specific due to spoilers, but Shurima is far more than a great place to vacation (insert beach front property gag here), and it takes more than great aqueducts to make a civilization like that possible. Shurima's rebirth, Azir's Ascension and Sivir's return from the severely iron-deficient are all part of one truth.\n* Sivir's got a bloody awful singing voice. It's quite shocking really.

We assume she stabbed her somehow, because she's bleeding afterwards. \n\nCass \"sees only the statue of a huge serpent silently guarding the door to the tomb of the Emperors and smiles\". Why is she smiling? What makes her think the HUGE SERPENT GUARDIAN won't do anything?? \n\n  Cass gets pinned in the jaws of a Temple guardian, and \"the venom sears her flesh like acid\" (weird simile) How does this not kill her? Why does a Temple guardian's acid/venom turn her into a being similar in power to Ascendants? How does she get out of its jaws?  How does Sivir's blood get to Azir? Why isn't Azir dead? He never ascended, so what is keeping him alive? Where the heck do Renekton and Xerath go? Two immensely powerful beings come bursting out of a tomb after centuries and completely ignore the people who released them? Why isn't Nasus guarding the place instead of some giant serpent that turns people into Ascendants? \n\nSo many questions, so many details that are ignored. When you can't even get a \"she stabbed her with a knife\", I highly doubt we'll ever get anything as cool as Lulu pretending to be Veigar's evil minion, or anything of that miniscule a detail.\n\nWriter's who build a story shouldn't be allowed to just back out of it entirely because they felt they wrote themselves into a corner. Write yourself OUT of the corner. This retconning is just really lazy.\n\nIoW is too powerful? Have some void monsters come and kidnap all the summoners, throwing the world into chaos. You don't need motivations for Void creatures other than CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION. Maybe the Void God wants to see Runeterra thrown into chaos and laugh at our suffering. Maybe Summoner's are just peons for greater powers. Maybe ANYTHING. But just erasing everything already written? I seriously can't understand the logic behind this lore decision.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2014-09-17T20:31:33.053+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, all this retconning reeks of laziness to me.

If they want us to trust them, they should actually consider **NOT** going through with the proposed changes of divorcing the world from the game.\n\nBut again, Riot won't address any of these concerns, they'll shrug them off and focus on \"positive\" statements like these.\n\nEven though the OP's point was that this was the first thing they've done right recently.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2014-09-17T18:06:45.692+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"I didn't as much miss it as want to speak to moving forward.\nWe know there are concerns and consternation, a few of us have  expressed how we need to improve greatly on communication, execution and cadence when it comes to pure storytelling. \nWe've made the changes to our approach to story because we genuinely believe it will allow us to do more and do better. \nI understand that you disagree, and it's our responsibility and privilege to produce content that can give you and our other players things to get excited about. \nThe proof will be in the pudding, and I don't want to keep saying \"trust us\" as an answer.

Why have you guys decided to push through the negative pushback on this decision, and force the community to accept what you are saying as far as narrative decision as \"better\" when, as you say, the community doesn't trust you.\n\nWould it not be a good trust-building exercise to demonstrate your willingness to make amends or to set things right with the vocal lore-fans by rescinding this direction, and bringing the community into the folds as far as direction going forward?\n\nI mean, we all get that popular opinion shouldn't affect something like balance or game design, because the game would look awful. But the flip side to that is why **shouldn't** we be allowed to have a say in the direction of lore?\n\nThe issue I'm seeing here is that from a narration perspective, you guys want to move forward. To look past JoJ, the IoW and other previous iterations of the lore at something bigger and better. But, if the community is against you on leaving those things behind, why is this something that is forced upon an unwilling community? And let me head off defenses such as \"It is only a vocal minority of the  community.\" You have polling available to you. I am sure that you could send out plenty of surveys and test focus groups of people who play league and enjoy the lore. Don't use a defense that you can easily prove or disprove.\n\nOn a personal note, I am ok with some changes being made to narration going forward. I am not opposed to removing some older aspects of the lore to make it easier to move forward. What i am VEHEMENTLY against is the systematic, and complete refusal of your department to work with the community. It is constantly a situation where we are told \"this is how things are going to be\" and even under great pushback and negative opinion, you refuse to bend and accommodate the community and their wishes/desires.\n\nI cannot stress enough that THIS is where you lose the trust and support of the community. If you are unwilling to work with us and work around the things we love and believe give character and heart to this MOBA, then no matter how amazing your direction is moving forward, you will NEVER be able to regain the trust that you subtly, but pointedly say doesn't matter to you by your actions and lack of regard for what the community wants.\n\nYou have a REAL chance to make changes here. You have had an overwhelmingly strong and negative opinion directed towards your new lore direction. Don't ignore this and say \"it is part of a loud minority\" Test your hypothesis. Use the data analysts you have in the office. Stop ignoring us as if we are screaming children angry at not getting a piece of candy because we aren't, and we deserve a give-and-take relationship with Riot. Not just one of \"stomach this bitter pill because it is good for you and we know best\"\n\nI want you to succeed with lore narration going forward. I WANT you to do right by the community, and make amends for 3 years of silence and ignoring us. What I don't want, and I know for fact that I am not alone, is Riot to force us to accept something when an overwhelming opinion exists against it, and for good reasons.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The6DollarMan","date":"2014-09-16T22:11:24.538+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have done a good job with the video content, so I'll give them that.
