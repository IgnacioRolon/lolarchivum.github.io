There's too much empty space in this splash art and it's really awkward. Fizz is so separate and gets half the splash art to his self while the rest share the fire. It's too late now to change it though, they already invested so much into the art so they can't go back. The music is nice though.\n\nHere are some war movie posters, note how they use the space they got:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/76/f2/43/76f2431f7a6e987140c42f26bef57d00--in-the-navy-instant-video.jpg\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Phantom_Below_FilmPoster.jpeg/250px-Phantom_Below_FilmPoster.jpeg\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/17/14/6e/17146ebe2d98a29687383a4d7db6d2b8.jpg\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5e/ea/be/5eeabebc295882ec646ad415a504b125--avengers-movies-superhero-movies.jpg\nhttp://www.joblo.com/timthumb.php?src=/posters/images/full/flowers-of-war-poster-final.jpg&h=600&q=100\nhttp://www.theexpendablesmovie.net/images/expendables-2--movie-poster-comic-con-high-quality.jpg\nhttp://www.impawards.com/2012/posters/expendables_two_ver18_xlg.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-07-15T07:55:45.971+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The art was actually painted as a movie poster!

As a solid splash it looks great! but as a animated login, it actually hurts my head to look at (I am incredibly prone to migraines). Something about the layering and I don't even know what's going on between Trist, Viegar, and Twitch... it took me a little bit of searching to figure out what the tail was ('why is there a knife on a rope...? oh, it's twitch's tail'). \n\nAlso the tilt of the poster/login anims actually pulls VERY HEAVY to the lower left. It feels like it's about to slide apart, and my eyes can't find anything on that far side to really look at.\n\nMy eyes first hit trist, then twitch. After that, they get lost on the far left. I can't really appreciate the right half simply because my eyes can't complete a full rotation of the picture without having to force it. \n\nTL;DR: It is a good piece..... but it needs a little bit of work on layering, weight, and movement.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=TheFancySkeleton,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oK7OLyaE,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-15T15:00:21.823+0000)\n>\n> I actually had to look for Veigar.\n\nThat's exactly what I mean by movement, you have to force yourself to look for veigar and fizz (even though fizz is easy to find, we still have to force our eyes against the movement of the piece and look right).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFancySkeleton","date":"2017-07-15T15:00:21.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually had to look for Veigar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lordllo","date":"2017-07-16T06:25:22.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks great!

This is more a nod towards David Arnold, Alan Silvestri and Basil Poledouris (at least as far as the orchestral stuff is concerned), and the great work they've produced in the 90ies. \n\nThe synth stuff is a mixed bag: there's some Miami Vice vibes in there, some more modern things as well. \n\nThat said, from a mix standpoint the overall sound of the piece is closer to Zimmerland than it is to the work of the composers I referenced above. \n\nCheers!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcSnipeyz","date":"2017-07-16T06:28:20.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, didnt expect a reply, really awesome seeing insight from inside.\nI really think this is one of the your scores better works, it gets you right into the mood and it replicates the action movie vibe perfectly","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-16T02:33:38.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This theme to me sounds pretty heroic...so the Omega Squad are supposed to be the good guys, right?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2017-07-15T17:50:43.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're all soldiers now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2017-07-15T06:41:20.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:105}}  - TO WAR!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Furor Nexis","date":"2017-07-15T17:34:50.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A WEAPON TO SURPA-\n\nWait.\n\nWrong franchise.","replies":[]}]}
