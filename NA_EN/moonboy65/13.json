I think the pose is great though, and the design of the character, and the fact that hes not insanely bulky looking. \n\nif you did do a new background, which seems super likely, whether its a brand new splash or not, i'd go for something very 'dragon trainer tristana', with the nice view of the green cliffy high fantasy area with the open blue sky. but that's just me. \n\nI actually like to think dragon trainer tristana is in the same world with all those RP skins, and gravelord Azir maybe, partly because they were all the same patch, but also it just works so nicely","replies":[]},{"poster":"QMighty","date":"2017-01-06T13:36:30.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think something should be done about it like what happened with Spellthief Lux (my favourite skin splash in the game before AND after it was updated) how it very much preserved the feel of the original and even kept most of the same elements, just brought it up to today's standards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2016-12-29T00:38:16.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's something about the style- It's very rough and feels unrefined but it's also very \"painterly\" (which applies to both Garen and the background).\nIt's not flashy or \"shiny\" like most modern splashes- It's got this feeling of simplicity and modesty (which are two things that compliment each other a lot).\n\nAlso, that might be more of a thing that applies to me rather than most other people, but I also really like the lighting in the splash. It's almost holy, but it's also very natural, and the way it comes from behind all of those trees. It makes Garen look kind of heroic but also makes the whole scene looks ethereal (and very calm), but not in an outworldly way. I can almost hear the peaceful chirps of birds invisible in the blurred depths of the forest.\n\n;D\n\nEDIT: Also, I realize the you probably can't retain all of these in the modern, updated splash (especially when considering whatever direction you'll take with it), but those are mostly the things that I personally find charming in the current splash.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-12-24T02:06:44.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty!

As they will probably destroy her individuality like they have done with MANY other female champions in these updates.)
