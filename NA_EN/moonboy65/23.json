I have made a list of errors and issues below for both of these.\n\nLeague Displays App:\n1. Program Nami, Program LeBlanc, Praetorian Fiddlesticks, Praetorian Graves, Infernal Amumu and Victorious Orianna (as well as a bunch of K/DA images and splashes) all have the League of Legends logo.\n2. Missing splashes: Championship Kha&#039;Zix, Winter Wonder Neeko, updated Sea Hunter Aatrox and all of Ezreal (excluding base and Ace of Spades).\n3. Mafia Braum is 1280x720 for no apparent reason.\n\nAsset Website:\n1. Arcade Ezreal and Dark Valkyrie Diana images can&#039;t be downloaded as the links are missing/broken.\n2. Mr. Mundoverse is in the Cho&#039;Gath drop-down menu for some reason.\n3. Hecarim&#039;s preview image isn&#039;t the base splash, it&#039;s the Worldbreaker splash instead.\n4. the 2016 SKT T1 splash uses the 2017 SKT T1 splash art instead.\n5a. Silent Night Sona, Dreadknight Garen, Blast Zone Heimerdinger and every Yordle splash that were tweaked to have 4 fingers are outdated. Base Karthus, Base Hecarim, Dynasty/Midnight Ahri splashes are also outdated from when they were tweaked in 6.7\n5b. Aatrox, Akali, Nunu and Ezreal splashes are outdated.\n6. loads of Chinese  and regular splashes are in their native resolution (1215x717) or in resolutions smaller than 4000x2360 (1920x1080, 1830x1080, 1920x960 etc...)\n7. Every splash art in 8.8 going forward are missing.\n\n\nI hope someone at Riot notices this post and gets these fixed/updated.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Squimpy","date":"2018-12-06T23:23:18.748+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone, \nJust wanted to say a quick thanks for pointing out these problems. You've helped us out a lot by calling attention to this! \n\nCurrently, League Displays is managed by a one person army (me), in addition to my other responsibilities. I promise that in 2019 I will make a stronger effort to update LD in a timely manner with NO logos xD. Thanks for taking the time to write your feedback out and call me out if I don't make good on my promise.\n\nxoxox\nSquimpy\n\nps. Everything is on League Displays now. Go check it out! Some of the K/DA music video screengrabs are watermarked from the point of creation, but I'll try to track down the originals. If you're not seeing the updates in the app, try a 'clean' reinstall.","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-12-07T00:01:59.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always heard you referred to as the \"team\" so I assumed it was two or three people!
