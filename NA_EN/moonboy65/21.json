It sounds kinda like DLC but for skins, and when it comes to DLC here's how I personally feel about it: If it's something that takes additional work and gives me a new way to enjoy something I already really like then it's great, but if it feels like content that should have been included in the initial cost that's cut out and sold on top then I really dislike it. So with that in mind if it's something we could do after the fact for really popular skins that players want to experience in new ways (like chromas) then I don't see why we wouldn't explore this at some point down the line.\n\nRight now the team are still looking at what tiers/cadence we should be producing skins at, and how to create more legendary skins and new themes without burning the team out or getting repetitive.

These skins had so much potential but had to be bogged down by the mediocrity that is the 750 tier.\n\nHeartseeker 2017: These were just awful. Lucian's VFX looks nice, but the designs are the worst. They're boring, lazy and not fitting. I hate this new direction where you tried to make the Heartseeker line \"Classy\". There's nothing interesting about a red suit, and Quinn's is just awful in more ways then I can list here. There is a reason why people loved Heartseeker Varus, Ashe and Vayne, and the team completely failed to capture that with these skins. \n\nRPG Skins Tier 2: Despite my gripes with the splashart being trash, these skins weren't awful per say. Bard's was funnily creative and Jayce's model changing was nice. I just realized, no wonder people hate 750 skins, they're seemingly only given to champions who need more high quality skins. It's a shame the skins team hates Sejuani. It was a smart idea to make the Karthus one 975 with new particles. \n\nBlood Moon skins: There is a very big split on these skins. A lot of the community likes them, but a lot of the community hates them. I don't mind them myself, but they're by no means my favorite skins. Just average. \n\nFestival Queen: Creative, Unique, Special feeling. Probably one of my favorite skins of all time. They really outdid themselves here.\n\nDragonslayer: Personally I despise this skin line. It's SO lazy. A guy in a suit of armor and a sexy chick. Genius, bravo, you must have spent like 1 hour working on these concepts I'm sure, that or you just looked at every other MMORPG and copied the least interesting designs. \n\nDreadnova: GP was great but Darius was again, another lazy attempt. \n\nApril Fools Day/Toy skin line: Super interesting and very creative. Champion choice was definitely odd but that's by no means a bad thing. I think the skins team really ended a slump here. \n\nGod Fist Lee Sin: This skin is kind of a work of art. I don't even like Lee Sin, but the animation in this skin. \n\nCosmic line: Super awesome and beautiful designs. A lot of care went into these, a shame about Xayah's moons, I feel like a compromise could have been met. \n\nDark Star: Exactly the same as Cosmic. Beautiful and amazing designs. It was nice to see the quick response to the Orianna skin. The slow reply to the Kha'Zix skin kind of felt expected though. \n\nUpcoming: \n\nPulsefire Caitlyn: FUCK. ME. UP. This skin is my shit. \n\nPulsefire Ezreal update: Some good shit. Ult feels a little bit flat though. Not very dynamic. \n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-05-10T07:20:29.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sharing your thoughts Jackalopeer - taking the time to elaborate was way more helpful :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-05-10T08:54:31.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey no worries.\nI wrote this when I was very upset.

That still doesn't change the fact that the current skin team is, by your own admission, focusing on making new offerings without visibly addressing old offerings already made and never fulfilled upon.)_","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-05-10T07:43:36.939+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what you're mentioning actually happens a lot at Riot. Very few of the same people work on the same thing for the past 7 years+ so things can get left behind, or can be reworked with an attitude to revitalise rather than preserve. As I mentioned in a previous post, Riot DrPh8 joined and wanted to sort of rework how Steel Legion fits in and, given that the original story wasn't socialised even internally, no one had a problem with that and was instead excited about the potential future. However the intention is, as players, to improve on things. So far the general response from players has been that it's working more often than not so that's reassuring.\n\nIt was before my time, but as far as I understand Crimson Elite was sort of the 'Cobra' to the Commando's 'G.I. Joe' skins. Unfortunately players didn't like them - so much so that the 5 was never completed. But that happens; we try new skins, 1 or 2 at a time, and sometimes they aren't what players want so we try something else. When Galio was updated we got to see how cool the Commando skins could become with the modern League Dev team, so if/when Talon or Riven get updated we might see a take on Crimson Elite that is worth investing in. For example the update to Lollipoppy certainly served as some inspiration for Candy King Ivern.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-05-10T13:10:26.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dumb question but how do you know which skins are popular or not?
