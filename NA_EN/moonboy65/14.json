Why can't angler Jax look this cool on his splash ?) . \nBut you're working on updating splashes for a different reason ? Guess technically this falls under updating champions eh ? \n\nIdk I'm having a hard time complaining about your products .... Think you've really stepped your game up for the past few releases.
