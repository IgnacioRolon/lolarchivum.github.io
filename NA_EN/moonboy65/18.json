Right now he&#039;s completely hidden by the champion info and skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-04-27T02:21:46.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh Reav3, i was referring to the champion page where the ability info/lore/skins/champion data is\n\nnot talking about the champion select screen","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-04-27T00:08:33.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should actually be resolved in the new client I believe as it displays splash art centered","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-04-27T17:58:02.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Yorick's rework coming up, wouldn't it just mean he'd have a new splash for all the skins?
