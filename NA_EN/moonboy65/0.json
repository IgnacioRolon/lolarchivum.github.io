How soon can we expect the Karma splashes? I can&#039;t stand seeing threads talking about &quot;Karma splashes are a waste of resources&quot; \r\n2. Have you decided on whether to give Haunted Maokai a new splash or some polishing?\r\n3. With the Galio update, will the Commando skins get a shared splash?\r\n4. Have you decided on updating Ashe&#039;s splashes?\r\n5. Are there any splashes at 80% completion as of now?\r\n\r\nI hope you can answer these, didn&#039;t get any from your state of champion update 2017 post.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LegendLarry","date":"2017-02-15T20:36:24.080+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Moonboy!\n\nI know I'm not Reav3 BUT I do work with the illustrators on the Champion Update team.\n\n1. Karma splashes are in production and being worked on as we speak! ...er...type...whatever. Work is being done.\n\n2. I actually had to ask our Art Lead about this one lol. As of now it looks like the team is gonna touch it up a bit but we won't be doing a completely knew splash.\n\n3. T . T No. That would have been so awesome!\n\n4. She is definitely on the list but we haven't put a date on those updates yet.\n\n5. I'm going to answer this question directly. Yes. However, if you're asking are there illustrations that are laying around at about 80% just waiting to be finished? Then the answer is also yes!\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2017-02-15T20:44:46.115+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the awnsers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2017-02-15T22:14:41.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are any of Miss Fortune's splash arts on the update schedule?\nWould also like to mention Talon, the dude really needs some fresh paint.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2017-02-15T22:17:47.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, Miss Fortune is on the list as well with Cowgirl, Waterloo, Secret Agent, Candy Cane, Road Warrior and Mafia","replies":[{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2017-02-15T22:25:08.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, i can't stand to look at the Candy Cane splash anymore.
