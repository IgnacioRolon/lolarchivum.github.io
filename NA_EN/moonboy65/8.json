I&#039;m really curious to see the new splash arts for French Maid Nidalee and Pharaoh Nidalee seeing as these two are probably the worst offenders for her in terms of splash arts.\r\n\r\nFrench Maid Nidalee looks like she has plastic boobs, and it&#039;s just a recolor of Nidalee&#039;s original classic splash art.\r\n\r\nPharaoh Nidalee on the other hand has the weirdest neck...","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-02-11T17:44:06.231+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did mention this.

Nidalee's splash art was updated same date with her full visual update it doesn't need anything else, they mean her outdated skin's splash arts","replies":[{"poster":"Von Revanchist","date":"2016-02-15T02:59:27.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea I'm serious the current base splash for {{champion:76}} is not up to the same quality as champions such as {{champion:104}} {{champion:37}} and {{champion:55}}. Her posture makes it look like an older splash, she needs to be in action. The colors/shading/effects and overall quality of the picture is no where near the 3 I mentioned. Her spear is odd and while {{champion:76}}  looks realistic her spear looks like a cartoon spear. You do realize her VU came out in 2012 right?? That was 4 years ago. Her warring kingdoms splash art is up to par and I was hoping her base would be caught up to that level as well. Besides my question wasn't for you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ireeb","date":"2016-02-14T21:39:22.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you also start working on Karthus? ^^ (I mean, look at phantom Karthus, that splash has nothing to do at all with the ingame model... :P )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashe Jungle","date":"2016-02-12T03:45:37.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oM0G4fNF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-11T17:44:06.231+0000)\n>\n> I did mention this.
