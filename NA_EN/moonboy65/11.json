I&#039;ve been trying to reach Reav3 but he has not mentioned anything yet.\r\n\r\n1. How soon can we expect the Karma splashes to hit the PBE? I know a lot of people are waiting on them, so we&#039;d love to know\r\n2. After Maokai and Sejuani, do you have an idea on who could be next for splash updates?\r\n3. Any plans on updating any old Ability and Item icons in the future?\r\n4. How do you chose which champion will receive a new set of splashes?\r\n5. Last time i asked if there were any splashes 80% completion but I forgot to mention: are those bonus splash updates?

Not sure yet, we haven't decided yet\n3. We don't have any current plans to update icons outside of VGU's or roster projects that need it\n4. Lots of reasons (How bad the old splashes, how different the are from the new models, if we have upcoming projects like the tank update, play rate, amount of splashes that need work vs amount of splashes the current VGU we are doing, different types of positions/roles/gender diversity)\n5. A few, but they will likely be finished when we update all there splashes at once.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2017-03-15T11:49:53.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding 3: In what situation will it make sense for you to consider updating icon art for **ITEMS**? \n\nThere are still a LOT of bleh art in the shop; especially with all the old component items ({{item:1052}} {{item:1026}} {{item:1031}} {{item:1018}} {{item:1042}} {{item:3675}} , etc).\n\nFor instance, wouldn't an item-system overhaul (such as you did with ADC items some time back, or the upcoming Tank items) be good timing for updating some old item icons?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-03-15T16:35:30.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ChampUp doesn't own items or item icons, the systems team does.

Remember they had to update Galio, Karma, Maokai, and Sejuani consecutively who all have a fair amount of skins combined. Galio was the priority with his update hitting the PBE. Karma's should be dropping in soon, and Mao & Sej should drop on the PBE with patch 7.9-7.10. \n\n\n* At the moment they mostly choose their priority candidates for updated Splashes based on who has previously received a VU/VGU, but no updated splash arts. \nIf I can recall for those who still need some splash updates for either classic or skins are; **Renekton, Singed, Sivir, Sona, Soraka, Twisted Fate, Viktor, Nasus, Miss Fortune, Master Yi, Malzahar, Katarina, Karthus, Kassadin, Janna?, Heimerdinger, Garen, Gangplank, Cassiopeia, Ashe, Annie and Alistar.**","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2017-03-14T23:40:38.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass got a Texture update, different than a VU/VGU\n\nKatarina, Singed, Soraka, Janna, Twisted Fate, Master Yi and Viktor were not mentioned to be on the list by Reav3\n\nalso you forgot Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"Grimm Howl","date":"2017-03-15T00:02:58.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lw-pvjaAUYw/VBAjiBePocI/AAAAAAAAYEs/SAn-ZfRfy6A/s1600/cassase.jpg\nHow is that just a texture update exactly? \n\nSome of them might not be on Reav3's top priority list, but those are all the champs who have received VU/VGU of some kind without updated splash arts.
