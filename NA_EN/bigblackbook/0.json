Ekko said in main chat that they were going to feed all game and they did, Ekko finished 0-10-2. Vayne said they gave up as well and did nothing all game went 0-9-4. Riven said nothing all game, never helped, just stayed top lane and went 5-13-4. I finished the game at 6-2-2. I destroyed Zed on mid lane. This is the frustration and chat that gets you restricted. Swain and Ekko both went afk towards the end of the game. I am sure there will be some rejects who will say I deserved chat restriction but at the end of the day, no cussing, no swearing, just calling out the trolls who said they were going to troll and then trolled all game. Riot really should stop trying to control every little detail about chat. \"If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.\", so all those terrorists around the world, all the bad people in the world, all the rude people in the world, you should just stay silent?

It actually encourages them to respond, and you get into those very negative flame wars that the OP's chat log showcases. The only way to **prevent** being further flamed is to mute and say nothing.
