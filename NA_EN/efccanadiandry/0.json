It just seems like a better way to do objectives. For example, if a team wants to do dragon, they can ensure that they can get it since they know the jungler has the smite. It can also inform the team if they should move forward to try and steal the objective or to try and push the lane or go on to a bigger objective. For example if Team A is doing dragon, Team B can see that their jungler doesnt have smite so they can either push the lane up the the inhibitor or try and go for baron. It can give a lot of information to the team and potentially win the game. I just thought It was a neat idea and it&#039;d be great if Riot saw this!! Thanks and dont let this go into the vault...","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-07-09T01:44:37.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should show summoner spell timers on the tab screen.\n\nIt's been suggested in the HUD update feedback before, and a Rioter said they'd pass that feedback along.","replies":[{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-07-09T01:47:24.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have that on the HUD update","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauki","date":"2015-07-09T01:01:50.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like this","replies":[]}]}
