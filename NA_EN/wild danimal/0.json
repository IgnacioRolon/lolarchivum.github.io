I&#039;ve always loved audio dramas and this is no exception!\nBoth the writing team  and the sound team did absolutely incredible jobs working on this, not to mention Lars&#039; voice actor (who is probably one of the best I&#039;ve heard, he conveyed the stories absolutely perfectly) There were a few nit picks e.g. In part 3 Lars responding to children sound effects kind of ruined the immersion (but this is just a minor nitpick). \nAgain, props to everyone who worked on this, I&#039;d love to see more Lore in this format since it provides us a perspective on how people within the world view the champions without knowing their backstories.","replies":[{"poster":"Ampson","date":"2018-06-02T21:48:51.712+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the kind words!
