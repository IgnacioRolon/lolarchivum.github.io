Or is it the video not showing it or maybe it&#039;s coming back with a lower volume or maybe it was making enemies try to dodge hes empowered Q? anyway that&#039;s the best sound effect i heard in years (Not really, i still love Rhast Transformation for Kayn, and so on). Please bring it back, as it&#039;s amazing. Not just completely remove it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-16T20:41:44.455+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \nWith the new Varus W change, it looks like some audio was changed too, albeit intentional or not.

If that comes into the game, that's what Varus should be known for. And \"gameplay balance\" as it gives enemies a warning, witch it's nice.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-16T23:17:44.589+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ISmurfy420,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=YqJIbEOk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-16T21:23:23.722+0000)\n>\n> Hope it&#x27;s just an error of some sorts, since i&#x27;m the kind of guy that likes the Art/Audio in-game witch define a champion.

Since we're close to shipping 8.8, it won't be fixed in time for that patch, but will be fixed for 8.9, and should be hitting PBE a bit later this week. Thanks for the call out. :)","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-04-17T00:26:34.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi!
