It would seem to me that there might be a problem with my account or a bug of some sort, if any of you know what the problem is please tell me, also I would love to know if any of you are facing the same problem and not just me. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Aggoness","date":"2017-09-28T12:39:40.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having the same problem with not receiving a chest when one of my team members or I earn an S or above. Since the addition of sorting which champs still have their chest available, I know for certain that I did not have a chest earned on either champ I played when someone earned an S. I thought perhaps it was because I was in a solo queue, but I would think that wouldn't be the case since people earn chests in solo queue all the time. Also, I have 4 chests available to earn currently, so it isn't as if I have reached the limit of chests either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T18:40:46.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some requirements to grab a mastery chest.  In addition to having a chest drop available for the week, you'll need to also own the champion.  Also per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, you can only receive a chest once per champion per season.
