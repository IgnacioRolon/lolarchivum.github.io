Can you guarantee that there are no HR processes going on at the moment that we don't know about to discipline him? Just because he hasn't been openly fired yet doesn't mean that it won't happen or that he won't get some other disciplinary measure. These things don't happen overnight.

To me it is similar to the James Gunn situation. The MCU had released James Gunn for Tweets made years ago before doing the Guardians of the Galaxy. So he was being released for Tweets made 7 years ago and held no standing to the MCU. If Disney does this as precendant, then many actors/actresses may be at risk for the risque jokes/materials they used in the past.\n\nThen you can also compare it to the Riot Sanjuro case. Which, to my understanding, he made the comments about T1 on an official Riot account.\n\nSo unless a person actually trys to claim it as official representation, I firmly believe they are not the POV of said company.
