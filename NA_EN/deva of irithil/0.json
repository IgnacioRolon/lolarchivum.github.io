We've seen this a bit in the last week or two for some players. Restarting your PC or your client can sometimes cause the sync to happen or when you try to purchase something from the store. \n\nLet me know if you continue to see this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"beastslayer267","date":"2016-08-10T16:18:05.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about the server maintenance do you have any idea how long it will take, because i spent money to get an ip boast for one day and ive gotten about 4 hours taken away from me already","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Destruxia1","date":"2016-08-10T12:04:17.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed the same thing. Started a few days ago, i wasnt sure if iimagined it, lol, but today i first saw my 18k IP become 11k ( all i did spend them on is buying Shen, which is 3150IP ), and then, as i clicked shop to go and buy this new hextech box, i saw it diminish by 1k IP, at that exact moment. I dont think this is a result of a hack, i dont see what anyone has to gain by deleting my IPs, and as far as i know, you cant send IP to anyone, right ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zer0Necrosis","date":"2016-08-10T01:50:18.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah change your password you have probably been hacked.","replies":[]}]}
