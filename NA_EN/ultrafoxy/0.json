He has one of, if not the best lore in league of Legends and ever since his buffs several patches ago, has started seeing more play. That being said, with his increased play, he deserves some skins for the new Zac mains. I know a highly requested skin is gentleman Zac, which i could see as a white Zac in a tux. But i feel Zac has the potential to get even a legendary skin. I call it, Hextech Zac.\r\n\r\nHextech Zac would be a yellow colored Zac, suited up in a newly created flexible armor. His legendary \"lore\" would be as if Piltover found Zac and brought him from Zaun to Piltover to create a weapon out of him against Zaun. I feel like his blobs from attacking could become metal scraps to pick up, instead of blobs. He could have metalic or machine sound effects for his abilites. His w could be an electrical surge explosion. For his ultimate he could lose his armor to become a complete blob and bounce on people. His passive would have him turn into 4 little blobs as usual, but with armor on them instead. I know that this would be a tough skin to make, and probably will never happen, but just an idea for my favorite champion.\r\n\r\nSome other less complicated skin ideas include: Magma/Lava Zac, Spooky/Ghost Zac, Snowy/Freljord Zac. Also there is Gentleman Zac which in my opinion is the most likely skin to come. And another potential legendary, or at least 1350 RP skin idea, Dark Star Zac. I won go into as much detail with this one but its basically a black colored Zac, filled with stars. I feel like this wouldn't be as difficult to make as Hextech Zac but it would be just as cool. To end, I would love to see a new Zac skin come out soon and i'm certain tons of other league players would love to see one too. So here are a few thoughts and thanks for reading :D.
