The strange thing was that i was still logged in online on the league of legends site thats why i know the email was changed and unverified. Dont know how this is even possible.\r\n\r\nI have already send a support ticket is there anything else i can do ? plz help.\r\n\r\nPS: I think my account was hacked because i joined a discord server that was designed for league players to find friends of the same elo. We had to give our elo and summenor name and change our summenor icon to verify our rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T21:59:23.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a little risky to try and do account recovery type stuff like this here on the boards, but those account agents should be able to get all of this straightened out and repaired in your ticket!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Liquid Poro ","date":"2017-11-16T13:20:30.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a support ticket.
