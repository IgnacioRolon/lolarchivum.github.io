The problem i have is that the rioter that is helping me is ignoring the fact that my email got unverififed aigan. Wich I though was to be impossible (or only possible by riot itself). Does this mean that a rioter hacked my account ?\r\n\r\nPS: Iam not trying to accuse a rioter of stealing my account, I am only trying to know how this is possible because if its not possible then thats proof my account got hacked.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMatteo","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T22:46:22.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's most likely that someone was able to hack into your account and change that info either by knowing the login info or being able to verify themselves with your account information.
