Is this a glitch or do you have to purchase it separately?","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2018-11-08T06:42:01.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you bought it in the bundle then you won't have to buy it again. Try closing and restarting your client, then checking in your collection if it is there. You may have to scroll down to the bottom to find it.\n\nIf it still isn't available even after restarting your client, you will need to send in a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
