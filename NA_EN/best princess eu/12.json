Like a few patches ago there were a few \"OPs\" that were picked/banned (Rengar, Lb, Camille, Varus - on red side, and possibly Maokai and Shen), all of which have been nerfed since.\n\nNow it's based a lot on drafting - like if you want to first pick your ADC, you might ban out other ADCs (to pinch the champ pool) - which look, first pick Ashe for KT. Then they didn't pick ADC in first rotation of picks (picked support, JG , mid) - so they COULD attack top lane pool, BUT rumble and Camille are already banned and Kennen will crush any tank - so PINCH ADC pool even more - forcing Lucian against an ASHE giving Deft lane priority and stopping CoreJJ from roaming because of All In potential. Also huge dive potential because Karmas peel actually isn't that great and Lucian has no CC.

The reason for the bans in the screenshot are thus: Samsung failed to pick an adc in the first rotation, but they picked karma as a support. This allowed kt to target ban the botlane and pinch the ADC in a position where he didnt want to be in, and taking out champions that synergyse well with karma, so they banned out caitlyn and jhin, both laners who have an extremely oppressive early game with karma and both champs that are a headache when fed. This forced Samsung to pick lucian as their only hope of winning lane. \n\nevery pick you listed has been picked in NA as well, god forbid adc's have access to a little bit of sustain in skirmishes and don't need to wait for 4 items before they start dealing decent damage to enemies building health","replies":[{"poster":"MetalGearTeemu","date":"2017-04-17T20:40:39.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"its almost like ADC is so overtuned now that you have to pick one of the boosted ones in your first rotation or you risk losing the game at the draft. \n\nThanks for pointing that out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2017-04-18T01:31:15.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What adcs abusing an item balanced on melee?
