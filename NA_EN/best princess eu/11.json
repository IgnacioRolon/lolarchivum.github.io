If you don't fall in either of those categories, or even if you do it's best to get jungle help early. A shut down camille is good news for everyone on your team -- better than a 4/0/0 adc who gets 1 shot by the enemy camille. So bring your cc and hold out for good jungle ganks... or play lane bully and/or mixed damage champ and just don't snowball her. I have 1v1 beat camille with 0 help vs a decent player (for my rank) as both {{champion:10}} and {{champion:58}} although I am sure others work. Renek is decent because you can either kite out of her ranged harass and her stun, or you can trade stuns and do more damage afterwards early game. Kayle has the mixed damage to make camille shield less useful and can hard punish when she engages if she can't just delete you. q slow and e ranged autos with mixed damage means she eats more damage from you while backing away to wait on cd's than what she dealt to you when she tried to stun combo you to chunk you out. Level 6, your ult is... well, you are kayle. Plus you have 0 pressure to win lane because of how well you scale into mid/late game whereas camille kinda wants a lead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CancerBasedGod","date":"2017-01-24T23:26:51.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC or die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2017-01-24T20:40:07.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"revive tp\n\nquints of revival","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2017-01-24T18:20:38.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Randuin's omen is the most efficient item against her; it gives you a fair amount of armour and health, and the passive means her attack-speed gets reduced for hitting you.
