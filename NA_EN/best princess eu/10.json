No nerferino.\n\ngoing by the name, i can understand why youre attached to the item. but really think about it.\n\nrylais fucks over morde harder than it helps him. i know it sounds weird. but just for a moment, imagine a situation where youre playing morde and are up against a malzahar and you both have rylais.\n\n{{champion:90}} {{item:3116}} vs. {{champion:82}} {{item:3116}} \n\nwho do you think benefits more from the item? the malzahar is going to use its constant slow from with his space aids + voidlings, and the silence on his q, and the supression on his ult, to keep you out of range before you can even benefit from the slow yourself.\n\nhes going to kite you to death with the item before you even get the opportunity to get in range of him and benefit from the slow to stick to him.\n\nthe same goes for a lot of ranged ap scaling champions who have the ability to create permaslows with rylais.\n\n\nit makes more sense to rework the item and get rid of the ability to constantly reapply the slow over extremely long durations. buff morde directly and give him his own tools to stick, rather than keeping the item in the game as it is.\n\n\nthe issue with rylais slow is, that its not a defensive mechanism against mobile champions. mobile champions dont give much of a fuck that theyre slowed. they have their own inbuilt tools to move around. but it is an item that is used by ranged champions to shut down low mobility melee champions in particular. their ability to kite someone like morde or volibear doesnt hinge on the fact that they can hit their skillshots and cc abilities anymore. they just passively keep their opponents slowed which in turn makes hitting their other cc abilities even easier, and completely prevents them from moving.\n\nit makes the ability to kite someone like morde downright foolproof, and the item abusive in many cases.\n\nits stats are not the problem. its really the passive that breaks it.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-08-24T13:47:20.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Just my opinion.\n\nthe problem is really not just restriced to malzahar, you cant just ban out every champion whos building rylais right now. because half the ap champion pool is building it.\n\nand morde still has to get in range to cast the ult on you. even then, his ult alone wont win him the fight. youre never going to get into q range, which is your main damage source. \n\nrylais slow isnt your only concern. most mages already have powerful cc abilities in their kits, like zyras snare and ult for example.\n\nrylais makes these abilites almost braindead to land on someone like morde.\n\n{{champion:50}} would be another example, who can keep kiting muliple opponents with his ult, his e and the rylais slow + his snare.\n\neven champions like {{champion:30}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:85}} shouldnt rely on rylais passive slow to keep people in range of their aoe. they have their own inbuilt cc mechanics to set themselves up to kite their opponents or stick to them. \n\nrylais just makes this one again, foolproof against slow champions. (a zed is still gonna jump out of a karthus e, rylais or not).\n\nif those abilites on their own are too ineffective in general, then its an issue of their kits, and it might be worthwile to think about adding things like a grounded debuff to karthus wall, so he has a tool to deal with high mobility.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-08-24T14:44:36.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=w5prk7XE,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-24T13:48:21.216+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n> and morde still has to get in range to cast the ult on you. even then, his ult alone wont win him the fight. youre never going to get into q range, which is your main damage source. \n> \n> \n> \n> if those abilites on their own are too ineffective in general, then its an issue of their kits, \n\nJust to touch on these two things. If you are running Deathfire Ignite Morde with Rylais, Liandries and maybe a Ludens. His Ult + Ignite alone actually can kill some squishier champs and leave some beefier nontanks sitting on deaths door. It also has pretty reasonable range. So yeah, there are plenty of times where Morde's Ult and Ignite alone can win him the fight depending on items.\n\nFor the second part, I agree somewhat, but I'd say the issue wasn't caused by their kits, but by game updates that have increased mobility a million fold through item changes and new champions. I'd rather see mobility nerf batted to hell rather than changes to champions I love, but I suspect I'm in the minority cause we gotta have LC$BIGPLAY$.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killstrado","date":"2016-08-24T14:13:52.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First item on cass everytime after tear for that reason","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-08-24T13:07:46.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because it costs a truckload of money?","replies":[{"poster":"Best princess EU","date":"2016-08-24T13:11:22.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still 101% cost efficient without the passive. \n\nmeanwhile luden's echo is 80% cost efficient without the passive\ni understand your concern because Morde will be trash without Rylai, but this isn't a viable reason","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-08-24T13:17:07.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Nashors tooth is near 140% efficient with 0 extra ap, ROA is something like 150% gold efficient stacked.
