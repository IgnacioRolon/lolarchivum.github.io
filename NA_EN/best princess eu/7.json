Zephyr will never be a 2nd or 3rd item for ADCs since it doesnt give any crit (or flat-pen, which current ADCs are liking/abusing). It will only be a late-game 6th item, and only if you dont want another zeal item. The only champions that really want the Zephyr as a core part of their kit are those with a similar playstyle to Irelia, Jax, or Udyr  - so champions like Shyvana, Trundle and Olaf. Champions with damage in their kits so they can make 25 AD go a long way, can be kited, and mostly use mostly autoattacks for their damage. \n\nAnd whats all this talk about \"outdated kits\"? From my experience, whenever Riot updates an \"outdated\" kit (aside from a rework, in which case their kit and playstyle is new), they usually make the champion much more stronger. Malz, Annie, Swain, Maokai, Brand, Zyra, Ashe, Fiddle and Garen had their kits updated, and all saw a spike in power while being more effective at doing the exact same thing. The only champions that I can remember that got their kits updated but turned them weaker were Anivia and Rengar.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-10-13T04:44:41.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i sometimes built it on nautilus","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2016-10-12T23:30:30.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cri evritime {{item:3070}}  {{champion:32}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2016-10-12T22:56:26.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like Cloak and Dagger on my AD Jungle Eve...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-10-12T22:29:27.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i miss this item so much","replies":[]}]}
