It can also be used to bring back an enemy, basically it&#039;s strong. But unlike other mages the cooldown is insanely low at rank 3\n80 sec cd makes it feel in late game like orianna can miss an ult if someone flashed, but she can just wait (even better with cdr) for a minute to get it back.\n\n{{champion:115}} ultimate is as powerful, and yet has 120 sec cd at all ranks\n{{champion:112}} storm is similar with AOE damage and CC, but the cd is 120/110/100\n\n**protect shield duration: 4 seconds**\n\nOrianna as a mage should bring utility to her team.\nshe can shield for SHIELD STRENGTH: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 40% AP) which is a lot since she can build AP\nthe problem is that the shield duration allows her utility to remove her weakness as a mage\n\nA mage should be weak in 1v1 against an assassin or a diver. Orianna is not the case, her W allows her to be safe against them **while shielding herself constantly with E** , it has 9 sec cd and lasts for 4 sec, this leaves her oppenents little opportunitis to fight her like {{champion:92}} a long time ago, riot prevented her to shield herself constantly if she stacked CDR by nerfing her shield duration.\n\nthose 2 things are what i feel like things orianna has that makes her stronger than an average mage\nShield duration and Ult cd makes her too much forgiving to play and leaves little window of opportunities to her enemies","replies":[{"poster":"SB Arneeman","date":"2017-05-26T14:27:38.017+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's only powerful because the other mids were nerfed.
