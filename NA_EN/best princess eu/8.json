I'm not asking for him to be nerfed or anything here though.  Maybe some neutral shifts though, like reducing/removing his shield and adding some more damage to his kit as compensation would be nice, but he'd need a serious look to make such a significant change without breaking him (either making him super weak or although less likely, making him op).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-11-27T20:01:05.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is LeBlanc on there","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2016-11-27T23:31:02.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People think she's a mage now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2016-11-27T19:44:37.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its cause late game it gets tough to kill some people even with void staff.

(So i concede this one)\nOrianna is, dare i say, also a bit too strong? Regardless, quick simple number changes would fix (another one conceded)\nAnd lastly, LeBlanc. I'll be honest I haven't seen her all too much, personally i think shes fine, but you seem to have a reason to put her on your list, so we can leave her on the fence.\n\nWhich means your choice of champions that could be seen as accurate generalisations of mid-mages across the board really only has 2 that carry any solid weight, which I've also agreed with, and in fact think they need nerfing. The rest either are inaccurate because they have either unique forms of damage multiplication/addition and/or typing that most mages dont, are low-play rate champions that are played by mains, or don't really go mid anymore. Or is Annie.\n\nThis means that {{champion:136}}  {{champion:268}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}} minimum would get the shaft because Orianna and Ahri are a bit strong, and then if we include junglers and supports {{champion:432}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:37}} would get the shaft because Brand and Zyra are pretty rough.\n\nA final note on the assassins; people are failing because they are stuck with the archaic mindset of \"I go in and 1-shot\", rather than using the tools given to them in the update to make PLAYS. They are simply trying to stat-check their opponents, and it costs them. Assassins have gone from \"play faster\" to \"play smarter\". Most just haven't caught on, and as a long time talon player myself, he's been working great for me, but I've been watching his playrate, ad it's way higher than it used to, which tells me people are picking him and thinking he functions the EXACT same as before.
