When I click 'download the game' on the League of legends website it asks to make changes to the hard drive I allow it and then it opens the league of legends installer. I proceed to click next then agree to the terms and conditions, click next again it begins installing LOL and gets right up to unpacking files and then spews out the following error code: \r\n\"There has been an error.\r\nUnknow error unpacking file C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/League_client/releases/installer/deploy/libcef.dll\r\nThe application will exit now.\"\r\nAfter this i click OK and it closes everthing and leaves me staring at my background. I followed the file path in the error code and found libcef.dll but had no clue what to do from there, have been hunting for a solution for hours but cant find any.\r\n \r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Claymeir","date":"2017-12-23T00:29:17.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any new ideas on this one?
