Is it related to the current ward skin bug being looked at if not here's a new bug and plz help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T21:11:20.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue is *in fact, * related to the ward skin display issue that's been going on lately. The button completely disappears if you've previously selected one of the skins that don't currently show up in the client in champ select, which as a result, prevents the ward selection button from displaying. Unfortunately, there's no fix at the moment, so you'll be stuck with the currently selected ward skin until we're able to roll out a fix for this.\n\nI don't have a date on when that fix will roll out, but please let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf60402183","date":"2016-08-14T22:12:40.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I also have the same issue, ty for your continued effort rito :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"H3artRockNRoll","date":"2016-08-14T18:01:33.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the exact same issue!
