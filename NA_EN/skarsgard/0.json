I played Vayne on bot and I got Veigar as a support, whole game stealing a farm, Lucian top who had 0/2 in 5 min, and JARVAN IV who didn&#039;t come even  once in 17 min to gank, and he started to talking about my farm... VEIGAR STOLE MY ALL FARM and when I said i will report u Veigar for stealing a farm, Jarvan said so what, he is better than u. Whole game provocated and when I respond to them, RIOT gave me perma ban. I&#039;ve been playing this game for 5 years and can&#039;t get promote in bigger division because of players like them. I said, just go in my games and watch what&#039;s happening and all would be clear. Everyone has been starting to provocate and flame, and when i respond them, they report me and then RIOT gave me ban or restrictions, but when I report them, nothing is happen. I admit it that i flame them, but just look when, when they start first and when they are unskilled players for ranked games ! 5 YEARS AND CAN&#039;T GET OUT OF SILVER because of low players. That&#039;s unfair, every normal player will flame that he is in situation like me. Give me another chance RIOT !! I spent a lot of time and money on this game and I think i deserve another chance. I&#039;ll shut my mouth from now, but u also have to look on what they talk to me at first.

Try to keep your cool and dont let people bait you into getting your self banned. They cant just allow retaliation like that when we have rules like we do. That would be absolute chaos. The second someone deems it as \"provoking\", everyone is suddenly able to type all the shit they want even though its against the rules? Nah, Riot wouldnt allow that. Sucks it was a permaban dude.
