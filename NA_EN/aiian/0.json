Many attempts later, I give up and double-check my account parameters. Nothing seems out of place, so I shrug it off and just reset the password like nothing happened.\r\n\r\nToday, i try to play the game again. Same problem again - password doesn't check out anymore. But this time it's slighty different - I go on the board to check my account parameters (I can still access it since you're not logged off when you close the session) and surprise surprise, my linked mail account has been modified too this time.\r\n\r\nhttps://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/346704lol.png\r\n(After a quick Google research, it appears to be some sort of chinese mailing service. Fishy.)\r\n\r\nThis was especially suprising for me as I'm a security nerd. I don't click unknow links, don't download suspicious materials, never give my IDs to anyone - in fact, as soon as I realised what happened, I verified all my other account linked to that mail (nothing out of order there), changed all of them to another email account and came up with fresh new passwords from every single one. That hack is both singular and out of the blue.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I reported all of this to the EUW customer service with as much details as possible. So far, after a full afternoon, I'm still waiting for an answer. Any way to speed up the process ?","replies":[{"poster":"AIIan","date":"2017-07-13T20:56:10.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, thank you for the words.
