So I guess I'll make a list of champs that I think don't belong on the list.\n\nThresh: I don't really see why he is op, I think he is fine as is but he does too much damage if building full AD. That's not the design of the champ's fault but rather AD items giving too much AD right now.\n\nRengar: Same as Thresh, not really the fault of the champion but rather AD items give too much AD right now.\n\nIllaoi: Same as Thresh, not really the fault of the champion but rather AD items give too much AD right now. However I do understand why she is on this list, she is a very hated champion.\n\nXerath: I think he is fine as is, I don't get why he is on the list.\n\nNidalee: I have faced a few games against Nidalee's. She seems fine, Yeah she does a lot of damage but she has to get close to you when in melee form and she does not have a good gap closer like other assassins. Sure she may be able to poke you with her spears, but that is very slow and she does not have cc to help that spear have an easier time landing like a certain other champ (Cough, Cough, Zoe).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-17T04:11:53.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, no.\n\nA bunch of those are not even over 50%, on top of not being oppressive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pixie Storm","date":"2018-06-17T04:22:31.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just like can only laugh in frustration I come back and im like you know what: I think Im gonna pick up ADC.
