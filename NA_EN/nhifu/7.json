Dealing true damage and reducing healing while giving vision sound slike great things for a kill secure/duel summoner.\n{{summoner:7}} Heals you and an allie and also gives brief movespeed. Great for clutch saves or baits. Great in 2v2 lanes.\n{{summoner:51}} Increased mobility designed to help you get picks, escape, or even engage in a situation. Mobility is a very strong tool.\n{{summoner:4}} Instant blink. Obviously the best summoner i think by far seeing as almost everyone takes it. its great offensive and defensive as well.\n{{summoner:12}} Map pressure and tempo play. Teleport is more for macro use and is for objective based play. lets you pressure the whole map with a threat of a tp flank or tping to an objective when its available. Also used for beter base timing or in bad lane match-ups.\n{{summoner:3}} Late game defensive tool. Slows for 30% and reduces the damage of the target by 40% for 2.5 seconds. Does its job well seeing as when you use this on a carry you effecitvely take them out of the fight for 2.5 seconds or you at minimum reduced all there damage output by a whole 40% during it.\n{{summoner:21}} A shield designed to deny burst. Good dueling ability and has great use vs ignite.\n{{summoner:1}} Removes summoner spell debuffs and all disables (except surpression and airborne) does what it was made for it. Exactly what it says it does.\n\nSo it seems all the summoners do as they are intended. Now i would enjoy some getting a bit of buffs or tweeks but not anything close to what you said. They aren't as you claim them to be","replies":[]}]}
