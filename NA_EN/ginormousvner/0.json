S3-6 the only things that could one shot were high single target damage assassins such as leblanc, now if you build for it a majority of damage dealers can oneshot someone.\n\nBack  in s2-5 CC was an actual consideration for team comp, nowadays your whole team could random select and 99 times out of 100 you’ll have enough cc to chain cc at least two of the enemies to death in a team fight.\n\nBut yeah, more balanced than ever","replies":[{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2018-04-20T20:28:07.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's \"more balanced than ever\" but there's always been problems of this magnitude that people on this board whine about nonstop.
