When everyone else is 100% in loading screen and your 0%, this probably means your client has crashed and you need to reconnect back in.\n\n2. Try using the Repair client tool and re-starting your league of legends client.\n\nIf this is an issue for high ping, try the following:\n\n1. Turn your Router/Modem off for 20-30 seconds than reboot it back up and test if the ping is better in a custom game.\n\n2. Try contacting your ISP about your internet service plan you're paying for. If you had lower ms normally and recently have been getting very high ms, it may be on there end. You will have to ask about your download/upload speed.\n\n3. Try contacting Riot through the support ticket and see if it's on there end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T22:26:35.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue you're describing is generally caused by an unstable connection to the server.
