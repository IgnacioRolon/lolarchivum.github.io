Hard to say without knowing more about the details.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-09-08T13:17:16.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, you know how, in Legend of the Poro King, the Poro King has a radius around him where if any snowballs from the enemy team enter it, the snowballs get redirected to the King and can't hit his allied players?\n\nHow feasible would it be to get something similar for Galio, where he redirects all ranged attacks in an area around him to himself, maybe with some kind of boost for each time he redirects magic damage?\n\nLike, he could pop this projectile absorbing field and temporarily gain +20% movement speed and tenacity for each time he takes magic damage while his field is up, or maybe gains charges on a flight mechanic ala Aurelion Sol, where if he gets hit enough, his ult turns into a \"take flight mode\" where he flies forward at high speed and then ults on the second press of his R button instead. Since you guys are rightfully planning to keep his ult, it would allow him to be designed as a defensive or anti-siege/poke tank, while giving him something that helps him get to the enemy team so that he can utilize his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-08T17:56:55.941+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically it should be pretty straight forward. Main concern would be that there's potentially a lot of overlap with Braum there, with that being his signature thing and a really clear niche.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-09-08T20:49:49.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is some overlap, but I think the main different between the two would be--Braum is all about the peeling, while Galio is looking to turn things around into an engage.\n\nSo let's say, his ult is split into two components.\n\nThe first component is his normal ult, an AoE taunt.\n\nThe second component, one he gets by intercepting enough damage for his allies, gives him a sort of Zac-range \"fly forward\" mechanic with a second cast activating a stronger version of his normal ult that gives him CC immunity from the point that he starts his flight.\n\nSo, Galio would work a similar niche to Braum, but Braum is all about damage reduction, peeling, and stopping enemy engages, while Galio is more about self-sacrifice. Taking damage in his allies' stead empowers him to strike back, and his ult is literally \"HEY EVERYONE HIT ME INSTEAD\" (which it has always been) so it's quite a fitting thematic for him to absorb damage for others.\n\nI also think you should rework his passive to something that reflects this. Maybe a bonus similar to Wukong, but where Wukong gets boosted resistances per nearby enemy because he wants to fight, Galio's passive gives him boosts per nearby ally because he wants to protect them. And then pass on his current passive by giving him MR scaling in his spells to reinforce the idea that he should want to be building anti-mage. Maybe his passive is some kind of health regen increased per nearby ally and increased by missing health to encourage him to sponge up damage without getting forced away? And then give his \"redirect\" spell a long cooldown so he's encouraged to use it only when he thinks the enemies are going all in, while their goal becomes to bait it out and otherwise to try and siege by hitting Galio's allies and NOT Galio himself.\n\nAnd I think I'm rambling now. Sorry >_>\n\nEDIT: That would be an interesting thing to give him for a passive: have his body stop skillshots that normally pass through enemy champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-09-08T18:13:19.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum's identy is \"stand behind me\" he himself is the shield (he just holds a door)\n\nGalio projecting his shield at range opening up himself, that could be the distiction if you wanna play with simmilar effects.\n\nAlso if you keep the shield, please finally adress that issue, where \"shield\" effects (Windspeaker, Idol, Catalyst) don't work on resistance \"shields\" like Galio's and Annie's that don't have a HP value. \n\nAthene was galios core item and the changes would have been perfect for him if not for that limitation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-09-08T05:09:47.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do consider giving him a new ult, turning his old ult into a basic ability  (though smaller & weaker, but with a much shorter cooldown & lower mana cost) is an option if you want to keep the old ult in some form.

MAW (or did you forget that one), SCIMITAR to remove CC (how does mage remove CC?????)  GHOSTBLADE for increased movement speed, STERAKS for a big shield  and even side items that just PLAIN reduce overall damage like phantom dancer and don't forget lifesteal for sustain.   AP assassin has really one option, Zhonya's.  Mind you, it should be a melee only AP item and something with shields should be given to AP ranged instead.  Zhonya's is horribly abused on long range champions and thus the constant nerfs and suffering of melee AP (and why the melee AP go tanks instead of their squishy assassin builds).  AP assassins need MUCH better itemization to have them in a place where they don't require bursting their target 100 - 0 in sub .2 seconds or their AP burst builds are just not viable to kill anyone.\n\nI propose a MELEE ONLY ITEM for AP that has AP, magic pen, armor and a small base shield that scales well with TOTAL AP to prevent ranged and tank abuse.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-09-08T14:54:32.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your idea a lot.

Before when it was built out of large rod ever mage would get it because it was the best choice out there. Then after the nerf (increase in combine cost) mages were kicked out of the meta because their builds and gold requirements were just silly compared to ad champs. Now that the hourglass is a complete defensive/utility item it only fits certain builds and you take a hit to your damage output if you trade it for a rabbadons. On the other hand, now that rylas is so over tuned (great stats, utility and combine cost) everyone is buying that item and the meta revolves around it. The problem was that the new ap items (hex tech) are extremly gimicky and have weird build paths, so theyare only optimal on a handfull of champs.\n\nYou can apply that same logic to your proposed ad hourglass and see that a similar trend would happen. An item of that caliber would be either completly op or useless (come think of it that exact same thing happened to guisoos some patches ago; it went from mandatory to fun, useless fail in about 3 patches)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-09-07T22:43:48.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i heard something a while back about galio getting MR scalings on his abilities. was that true?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-08T02:47:02.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was a concept we kicked around a year or two back, no plans to go through with it though.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-09-08T11:54:42.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"never digested too much well defensive items scalings on champion skills personally :P but either way i am no galio player.\n\nDo you see in that regard Galio the mr version of Rammus in terms of scaling?

And if the interaction with Braum is fixed then he would be able to be played as a support as well.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2016-09-09T17:49:37.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are having a hard time distinguishing usefulness from interactivity.\n\nYes galio's kit does work, but its very one dimensional and doesn't offer much variaty gameplay wise.\n\nHis w is good, but neither he nor his opponent will change gameplay patterns based on it. Galio will use it as soon as he starts fighting and then it will go on cd. Look at other shields for example, morgana has to choose which target to protect from cc which provides significant gameplay choices for everyone else, naut offers extra damage (this shield is also meh but the all other 3 abilities and passive offer cc so this is ok), Sion can do damage with it so the enemy has to try to burst the shield down or run away, janna gets to boost someones damage/protect them at specific times. Galio by comparison 90% just serves as a stat boost on himself while fighting and occacionally can be used on an ally tank but that almost never happens.\n\nThe e is also very uninteractive. Yes it works, im not devating that. But take karma's shield by contrast. It feels way more powerfull and impactful than galios because the movement speed game is not constricted to a specific vector.  also i have no idea how you concluded I said most of his dmage came from his e haha\n\nHis q and ult are unique but the ult is very unreliable and ebcause it is so powerfull it has a long cd\nGalio being different is not a crime, singed is different ant he is not getting a rework. Also come on, if you are telling me galio is not gated early game by mana costs then you haven't played him. You can´t compare morgana's and galio's mana costs because their mid lane play patterns are VERY distinct from each other. Mid lane morgana just spams w to push wave until roa and then waits for a gank. You and I know she is mostly played as a support where her Q and E have very high rewards and because of window of opporunity and having an adc to push wave for you have not to be used as often. So yea you are forgetting to take into account cd time in addition to comparing mana costs\n\n\nJust a last thought, but having galio as a support is WAY sub optimal because he has no real peel and his passive is completely counter intuitive for that role because outside of a locket as a 3rd item you wont be building much mr. Not saying he can't be played support, just that froma competitive stand poitn there is no reason to. and if they \"fixed\" his interaction with braum, for consitency terms he would not be able to have his ult stopped by stuns, which balance wise might be too op since outside of really smart positioning there would be no counter to it.\n\nSorry man but in statistical, objective terms most people think galio is boring to play and Riot's approach to kaizen (continious improvement) prevents them from having assets on the game that make it  seem unfinished for a majority of the player base. YES! there should be more tanky champs in other lanes! that is what riot is trying to accomplish by reworking galio, make a feasible, fun to play mid tank laner.\n\nTLDR: you are failing to see that by \"fixing galio's small problems\" he would become too op because of all the utility, tankiness and damage he would bring. Riot wants to make a long term change that allows to balance galio and make him fun to play for most people","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-09-08T11:09:15.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he's more of a warden honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2016-09-08T21:20:20.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see him being a warden, but current galio's e totally disconnects from that view.

But paper is a flimsy thing that breaks apart when wet, so his abilities in practice do not work well.","replies":[{"poster":"AA Tyrael","date":"2016-09-08T14:50:46.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are hitting the minions with your spells then you are playing Galio the wrong way.\n\nYou are supposed to spend your mana blasting  the mage that is in the lane with you. Not the minions !\n\nDon't get me wrong. Galio definitely has some issues and they should be dealt with. \nBut do you really think that wiping his whole kit is the solution ? \n\nGalio has one of the most unique kits in the game. He is the only tank champion that can play in the mid lane. He deals a fair amount of damage and all of his abilities resolve around the control of the battlefield. There's literally no other champion like him !\n\nSo why not just focus on fixing the issues that Galio suffers from?\n\nHis mana problems could be easily resolved by tweaking his mana costs. For example you could make his Q(Resolute Smite) have a flat mana cost (right now it increases per level) .\n\nHis ult interaction with champions like Braum could be easily fixed by changing the spell from a taunt type to a charm-like effect so the affected champs can no longer break the spell.\n\nWith some additional changes he could also be played as support in the bottom lane.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2016-09-08T21:23:04.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho gath can also play in the mid lane so ye haha.
