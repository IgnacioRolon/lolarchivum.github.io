I don&#039;t see it dealing that much damage as the ADC.\r\n\r\nThanks for replies","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-14T08:27:54.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It procs on physical attacks, and a ranged auto-attack based champion is in the best position to get it off; A tank with slow melee attacks or someone that doesn't auto much at all isn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Spotexx","date":"2015-11-14T08:29:53.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does it stack then? say i auto'd twice before  the buff wore off.

If you can weave your auto attacks in between your casts while not putting yourself in danger, someone like Malz *could* utilize it just as much as Lucian, but it's less likely for him to do that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spotexx","date":"2015-11-14T09:06:43.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the replies guys it really helped clear things up","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-11-14T08:40:43.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's better having a champion with this one specific role(as a beefy tank with tons of CC), and another champion with his own specific role(a carry who deals tons of damage).\n\nIt's not really a nice sight having a champion to have like 90% tank & an unnecessary 10% red buff effect. The red buff would have been used better by the latter champion to improve his damage output since that's his job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-14T08:34:23.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You give the red USUALLY to the ADC because the ADC typically lacks a form of CC. Some ADCs also lack slows, i.e. Sivir. The slow helps the ADC kite a little bit better while they also are capable of putting the DoT to slightly more use.\n\nTwitch and Ezreal typically put red buff to the most use with Ezreal's Q poke and Twitch's R, which procs on-hits to -every- champion hit, thus providing ungodly amounts of red buff havoc everywhere. Before you ask, no, Jinx's rockets do not apply red buff. Her rocket's AoE do not apply any on-hits or even lifesteal on anything other than the first target hit. \n\nIn some cases, Bruisers and tanks can put red buff to as much use as an ADC, especially when you have lots of peel for your ADC, but one of your bruisers lacks stickiness such as Shyv, Renekton, and Poppy who have issues when their target decides to use a dash to escape after they've used their own long CD gap closer to get close to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Poetic Zed","date":"2015-11-14T08:33:27.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and adc's are likely to attack everyone at some point. most tanks are melee (are all? i think there's a few that aren't), so an adc is best suited to apply the burn to all enemy champs, rather than one","replies":[]}]}
