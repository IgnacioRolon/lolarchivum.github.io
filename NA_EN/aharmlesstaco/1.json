Doubled for melee champions taking damage from ranged champions. Your basic attacks against enemy champions disable this passive for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nSeems pretty simple to me, if Cait hits you from 500 range, you take 10 less damage as a melee champion, 5 if you are ranged. If you engage on someone,  your defenses are penalized. If you engage and the enemy adc kites well, your defenses are still compromised briefly.","replies":[{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-22T02:56:39.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Dorans shield needs a small buff.

Honestly, I just tried to add in enough specifics to make it stronger against what people want it for without unnecessarily buffing it in cases where you are ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-22T04:03:15.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:126}} *thumbs up*","replies":[]}]}
