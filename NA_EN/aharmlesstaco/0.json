It looks like in the recent 3v3 games you've played, there was actually someone in your group that had a low priority queue. Since they had an LPQ, everyone in the group would have needed to wait.","replies":[{"poster":"AHarmlessTaco","date":"2017-06-05T15:56:50.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yessir, my buddy was the one with the LPQ and he hasnt played in 2 years. I helped him submit a ticket but we still arent sure why he had it in the first place. I'll check back in when I hear from his ticket. \n\nI dont think he dodged games so I just thought it was really weird and wasnt sure how to get rid of the restriction. Thanks for looking into this. We appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
