If you are on the side of the fence where you think JGs are not obligated to gank then i would agree but i am on the side of the fence where i think it is a team game therefore when the team can they should help a teammate which includes gank from both laners and junglers alike. The double standard occurs when one group expect ganks but wont gank for the other group when they need help. Not only is it extremely easy for mid (for example) to gank an invading jungler but most often leads to free gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scoroct","date":"2016-01-23T02:15:31.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while i agree its not their job to help them out, its generally a good thing to if you can","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2016-01-22T20:03:12.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pick an all rounder jungler good chance you will be able to kill enemy jungler including shaco and if you ended killing them good chance they screwed themselves up for the reminder of the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2016-01-22T18:55:40.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you can fight fire with fire. I was Mundo last night, and I wasn't even paying attention, I was killing red buff then noticed I had no red buff when it died and I was like \"...huh? thats weird.\" and then died to Lee. First thing I did when I respawned was go to his red and steal it.\n\nI find a common issue is that people afk and go to mobafire or google \" my champ vs their champ\" and sit under tower and ignore the jungle completely. \n\nIf they invade at the start, I'd ward up and start at the other end of the map, I cringe when I see 3+ teammates flash just to stay alive because they really want their red buff. Not worth it IMO. \n\nIt helps to have a rough idea as to what they like to do. I know Lee likes to start krugs, then go to red, and then do his shenanigans, probably invade blue since he has red already. If I start red side as Bard support, I will \"collect chimes\" but really ward their red, and then when he takes red,  \"collect chimes\" again and murder him for his red. Having deep ward vision helps sometimes too","replies":[]},{"poster":"NickWithTheWin","date":"2016-01-22T18:15:58.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice :)","replies":[]}]}
