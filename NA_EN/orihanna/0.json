I just came off a 14 day ban because i had a feeding troll, i moved past it because i knew i did wrong by adding fuel to the fire, but this, this i feel like it was unjust, it's 3 games you flame and they gave me 2 and one  of the games i didn't even flame, i was being flamed and i muted and moved on, once he started cooperating i unmuted and i tried to be a good person and help him, but they just gave me a reason such as \"You berated teamates and spammed the chat\" when i didn't even spam the chat or Berate teamates, can you look into this please, sorry for such a huge reply, Thanks!!!\n\n\nI also didn't recieve ANY emails for my 14 day or my Perma ban, like i have recieved NO Emails!","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Seraphane","date":"2017-01-18T20:32:42.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I Last Breath l,\n\nDue to the age of this thread, I have went ahead and locked it to prevent further discussion to avoid necros.

Honestly, it's probably only a mild inconvenience at best. He knows what to do, he can basically beat everybody pre-30 and get back to where he should be very quickly.

Hitting 30 just means you can play ranked. Big deal if you don't have the champ pool or runes to really play it well, though. This is less of an issue for a high-caliber player because they have the raw mechanical ability to play well, and can do so even at a handicap.\n\nI was mostly past the grind for content before. I had friends and a job to help me get through it the first time. Now I have neither, and there's MORE junk I have to grind for than before.

Everytime you get punished, you move up the tiers (extreme cases can skip tiers). \n\nSo with this new system, its lesser about \"MY CHAT WAS SUPER OFFENSIVE!!!!\", but more about \"how often were you offensive\". You've accumulated offenses (and were reported) enough times to work through the punishment tiers, and now the final punishment has arrived. \n\nWe don't want your current behavior in the community.

I was already disappointed when I heard that he got a 2 week suspension on this account but I never expected that it would go over that.
