Assuming 13 bonus AD ONLY, that would still be 226 True damage.\n\nThis does not include potential Rune Bonus', such as- Press the Attack, Coup de Grace, Last Stand, Electrocute, Predator, Cheap Shot, Scorch, or Grasp of the Undying. \n\nIf your issue is with his damage, try taking a different Keystone, Press the attack seems rather good, as you should already stack his passive.\n\nIf your issue is with his playstyle, I recommend another champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kuma","date":"2017-11-06T22:35:30.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" do you even play this champion or are you just being retarded? \n\nalso they changed press the attack its not like fervor anymore, also maybe you shouldn't be commenting here if you dont even play top lane and acting like a true dumbass gold 5 low elo player","replies":[{"poster":"Rebel Fox","date":"2017-11-07T20:40:11.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Kuma,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ui8N0Jsr,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-06T22:35:30.135+0000)\n>\n> do you even play this champion or are you just being retarded? \n> \n> also they changed press the attack its not like fervor anymore, also maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be commenting here if you dont even play top lane and acting like a true dumbass gold 5 low elo player\n\nAre you saying that because you disagree with my numbers?
