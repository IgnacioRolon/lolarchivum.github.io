Having even heard Riot mention Evelynn. Evelynn is one of my favorite champs and I love playing her. It would be nice to get a new skin for her rework. I think Riot isn&#039;t prioritizing champion skins very well. Rumble needed a new skin, thumbs up you got one down, but you really need to focus on champs in need instead of making skins that &quot;fit the bill&quot; and calling it good. Aurelion Sol, Urgot, Kled (not as much but still), Taliyah, Evelynn all need new skins more than any other champ. Anyways, I know Riot appreciates some opinion from players.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-17T20:11:42.805+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.
