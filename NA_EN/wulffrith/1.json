But at the same\nTime their throwing more power in behind changes that nobody wants.  They feel clunky and just terrible.

This might be a more healthy balance but I'll reserve judgement until I see it live. I still hate the changes to his R though.","replies":[{"poster":"Chimeu","date":"2016-04-26T11:10:34.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you send me the Viktor rework?

Sure, they are putting considerable power in his kit - while simultaneously making it extremely clunky and delayed. Viktor will have two and only two possible game scenarios:\n 1.) When facing opponents that can't escape his stunfield and/or having an ally lockdown for him he will just melt through anything in 2 seconds it takes for both his laser and ultimate to hit. Note that his laning will still be complete shit; as seen in Veigar example (was shit tier and had to be repeatedly buffed)- you can't just remove large part of reliability from a champion's kit and expect them to remain good.\n2.) Facing someone with any form of mobility (aka 90% of popular/viable picks). It doesn't mean shit if they up your laser to 1000 true damage if you can't ever hit it on someone. You're useless.
