For example, they nerfed Veteran's Scars because they said it would make it more attractive for ADCs. However, ADCs do not put points on the Resolve tree. Even if an ADC were to use the Resolve tree they would probably use Runic Armor for the higher healing with potions early game, as well as increased lifesteal. Riot didn't wanted to admit that the real reason why they were nerfing Veteran's Scars was due to the tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Shenmue","date":"2016-05-16T13:37:54.338+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes !!!??? more like every damn times since season 4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2016-05-16T15:54:00.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"To be fair, the resolve tree was OP as fuck and they did also say on the boards that they wanted to remove one of the multiplicators for late game tanks.
