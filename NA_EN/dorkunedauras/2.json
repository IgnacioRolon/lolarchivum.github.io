It&#039;s the reason that she&#039;s a tank in basically every pro game. And it&#039;s something that&#039;s demonstrated perfectly in the game I linked.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t scale.\r\n\r\nCompare her to ANY bruiser, and her scaling is garbage. \r\n\r\n.2 Bonus AD on her Q (it&#039;s .5 on Xin&#039;s Q), max damage of 165 + .6 bonus AD\r\n\r\nHer W is 40 + .4 bonus AD (until you level it up, which is last, and its ratio doesn&#039;t change).\r\n\r\nHer E, which while it scales at max 240% total AD, has no base damage, and only does 120% AD without fury. Most of the time you&#039;re getting about 160-180% AD, which while amazing, it super mitigated by the fact that the ability has no base at all. This means that you need huge amounts of AD to compensate for this fact.\r\n\r\nThis is all of her AD scaling. She also has her Prey Seeker (up to 180 magic damage, .7 AP which you SHOULDN&#039;T HAVE ANY).\r\n\r\nHer ult doesn&#039;t do damage, though it does give a nice 20/40/60% AS. this at least lets her get away with no AS investment, though going heavy damage you still need.\r\n\r\nThese ratios are pathetic. While someone might turn at look at her E for damage, it&#039;s not impactful. It&#039;s on a semi-long CD that limits its usage to once per fight, twice if it&#039;s long. Combine that with the fact that you start most any fight outside of top lane at 0 fury, and you don&#039;t get real enough damage from it. \r\n\r\nShe simply cannot be a proper bruiser with her current setup, regardless of how insanely you snowball. If you saw a jax get 10 kills in lane, the game&#039;s practically over. If you saw any top laner with that score, you&#039;re hoping you&#039;re wearing your brown pants. Rek&#039;Sai though. She has a good early game, decent mid, and has fallen off a massive cliff by late game. \r\n\r\nPlease riot. Let her do damage. I know you&#039;re going to have to take power from somewhere, but for pete&#039;s sake. Let me be a threat to someone who has more than 0 defensive items. I need 2 heavy damage item investments just to threaten a squishy.\r\n\r\nI want to play my main in ranked, have her carry me up, but I&#039;m scared too. I feel like a liability. It&#039;s like playing reverse nasus. If the game hits mid game, I&#039;m losing all relevance. I don&#039;t care what happens, I&#039;m becoming useless, regardless of how awesomely I play.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot, Rek&#039;Sai is my favorite champion in League by a massive margin. I have mastery 7 and 254144 mastery in her for a reason. Let me use her to rank up. Let me be a carry.","replies":[{"poster":"dadimplayingrn","date":"2016-06-14T08:56:42.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're lvl 7 with her and only 250k mastery? why so low?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-06-14T06:41:25.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can I get a rioter in here?
