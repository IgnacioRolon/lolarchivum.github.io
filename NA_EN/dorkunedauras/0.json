I've been getting the same error message as the OP of this thread. Do you know how long the PBE sign-ups will be available for? Also, do you know if will the sign-ups close after a certain date/time or will they close after a certain threshold is met?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-12T21:41:16.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of any limits, but we're not part of the PBE team.  I don't imagine sign ups going down unless there is a major issue that requires taking it offline temporarily.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
