I love almost everything about the new kit. Faster healing on passive, higher Ratios so she can actually do damage. Far lower tunnel reuse CD. Everything feels great. Except for one thing. The lynch pin that&#039;s supposed to bind everything together that fails to do so. Her ult.\r\n\r\nHer ult feels pretty terrible to play. Sure, it&#039;s visceral as all hell, and thematically cohesive, but all it can do is execute. It feels impossible to follow up on your ult as Rek&#039;Sai. You dash to them and you spend so much time sliding afterwards, and travel so far, that you cannot attack them afterwards. I understand that it has a massive missing HP ratio, so it&#039;s implied to be used for the kill, but any sort of large dashing ult should be designed with entering a fight in mind, not just ending it. It feels like ulting to enemies is just a way to do some damage and put myself in a really terrible position, unlike so many other dashing ults. The fact that she ends up so far from the target just means that it&#039;s virtually unusable for actual combat.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot, Improve something about this. Let Rek&#039;Sai follow up on her own ult. Here are some ideas I came up with to improve it:\r\n\r\n* Attach a slow to it (unlikely, but hey, brainstorming)\r\n* Make her travel less distance through the target.\r\n* Make her stay locked on through the whole dash, Warwick Style\r\n* Make her recovery after the impact faster\r\n\r\nIf anyone has other ideas, I&#039;d love to hear them. If we can get a nice big discussion going, maybe we can get the designers in here for a discussion, because honestly, it just feels bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Legacy Hydralpha","date":"2017-05-22T22:56:37.290+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen Rek'Sai is meant to solo dive a target with her W and then keep on them with ult.

I haven't played Rek'Sai yet, but the intention is not for you to use the ult to initiate, but rather to reinitiate.\n\nThe intention is to play Rek'Sai as you do currently, sort of, using your tunnel as your main gap closer. Knock up the target, do some damage, and then escape through your entrance tunnel before ulting back in.\n\nBut again, I haven't had the chance to play her yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-05-23T09:02:12.476+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it is meant as a reinitiation. But that means OP is absolutely right, if the skill is meant to go back in the fight it doesn't make sense that Rek'sai is \nA) landing far away from her target\nB) taking alot of time to recover so she can proceed fighting.\n\nThat definitely should change, Rek'Sai shouldn't have to still close a gap if she used the ult to reengage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneKiller02","date":"2017-05-22T21:36:06.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe they should give it a 20% current health or 20% missing health, and you take the one that deals more in the current situation (kinda like old WW Q who did flat dmg or % health dmg, which was greater).\n\nI think the 2 scenarios where you will use ult the most are : \n- You spot someone with W, land Q and R them for a niche kill coming out of nowhere (where the current health would be much better, and the missing health wouldn't scale only from the Q damage) \n- You gank, they flash, you ult to secure the kill (where the missing health would be much better, since they already lost some HP from the gank).\n\nI tried her as well (against Target Dummies though, lol) and I gotta agree I didn't like that she went so far from them. \n\nIf it's not planned, to make her be able to R in W (if it already works this way, please excuse me but the ability was a bit bugged) so she has a full second to assassinate someone before dashing out. In the other case, she has to W then W to knock up, which slows down her combo and can give just the extra second her enemy needs to join her team. \n\nOverall I'm pretty satisfied with the rework, she seemed really weak before, so that's that. I OTP'd her for a full season before stopping playing her almost completely. I'm glad they gave her more damage, but I still felt the ult could be a bit better. Maybe her Q could have a small reduction in scaling (~~0,4~~ -> 0.35~0.3) and shift that loss of power into her ult, to make her more of a threat once she hits 6. \n\nShe was played mostly as a counterjungler (we could even see E maxes for the 2 secs tunnel), so adding a % current health on her R would still encourage that playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-05-22T21:43:11.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can ult from either above or below ground, but when you finish it, you're always above ground, so you aren't in position to follow up with a knockup, let alone the fact that you're so far away. It does not apply the knockup.\n\nAs for the two gank scenarios you mentioned, the ult seems geared exclusively for the second one you mentioned, as killing someone in follow up of the Ult seems incredibly difficult, if you use it to engage on them.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneKiller02","date":"2017-05-22T22:07:41.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thus why they should add the % current health. \n\nHer damage seems to be back from what she had on release, I think she'll still be able to assassinate anyone within a knockup like she used to.
