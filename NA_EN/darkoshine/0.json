I'm still looking into it and talking with them, but do me a favor and try waiting a few hours and refreshing your clients to check for those capsules. \n\nIf you don't see anything in about 12~ hours, please reach out to the EU agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) until my tools start working again!","replies":[]},{"poster":"mooncake","date":"2018-01-14T14:44:19.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same happened to me, the collection had the small orange dot next to it as if I had gotten one on level up, but loot tab did not and when I checked no capsule was there.{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"mooncake","date":"2018-01-14T19:07:52.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they fixed it! got the capsule. {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dræberen","date":"2018-01-14T17:36:01.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here :( pls fix","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadBeemo","date":"2018-01-14T16:11:20.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-14T07:39:41.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More often than not, people open up their capsules and don't realize it, or forget about it. They can check whether or not you've obtained and opened a capsule, and can tell you what you received from that capsule, and whether or not you already disenchanted the shards to Blue Essence.\n\nBased on the number of EUW responses, and Broporo's response, it seems like it was actually an EUW issue.
