Does Riot not realize how unappealing this game is after having alternative game modes to draft and blind pick? That is how inferior draft is to the new champ select. Ranked is not even worth playing without the new champ select. Blind Pick normal games can never be taken seriously; they are all troll games.\r\n\r\nThe only way for things to get worse is if Riot disabled the champions that are due for a rework. Whoever goofed up the new champ select equipment is costing Riot money due to the lack of interest in League of Legends from only having Solo/Duo draft and Blind Pick.\r\n\r\nRight now the only thing interesting about League of Legends is the Boards when there's news about the status of the new champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-01-25T03:14:11.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**I **agree with you that Draft/Blind pick modes are extremely disappointing after having the New Champ Select, and that I thought about not playing until it was finished.  However, in the end, people that really love this game (myself included) do not play LoL for the client visuals or UI.  We play for the actual GAME, the stuff that comes after Champ Selection is done.\n\n**  Please** don't bash Riot for taking it down after the first test run.  I would rather it work right every time in the end, then some bug cost me a Promotion in ranked, or spending all my playing time waiting for a game the server cant handle putting together.  Let them do their jobs.  They know better then anyone how much this is/is not hurting their business.","replies":[]}]}
