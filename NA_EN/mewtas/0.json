I've had Soraka teammates that've not just dominated fights but carried *games*. Since her heals are less powerful, it makes sense to not build supportively...and with AoE slows and silences, with the second also having a root, plus a global heal that gains more power depending on the current health of your allied champs, you can use your abilities more for utility instead of support.
