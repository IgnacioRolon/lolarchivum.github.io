During this whole game nobody was being toxic towards anyone at all we were all having fun because we had a huge lead, which lead up to use throwing. to tell you the truth i dont even think anyone on my team reported me i barely talked in all chat other than the one time at mundo as well. i just simply feel that this ban was a mistake and need help. i dont believe that these logs are enough to ban me because even on the riot website they say what can get you banned \"Here are some common examples of why a suspension might be issued: Use of offensive language Deliberate verbal abuse Naming and shaming Tribunal ban on your account Hate speech Posting malicious phishing links\" when did i use offensive language towards my team in any way. i didn't abuse my team at all i was just trying to communicate to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-26T03:13:31.143+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dinerø,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EYNn9EHm,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-02-26T02:58:27.689+0000)\n>\n>  i dont think calling somebody a fool is \"toxic\" or flaming. \n\nThat's where you are wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Dinerø","date":"2020-02-26T03:21:32.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"but how though it was just at a point of the game where we had to go get drag and we just didnt rotate good. even so. at the end of the day me and my teammates were just talking to each other we weren't being toxic towards each other at all","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-26T03:32:49.726+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dinerø,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=990yGJEX,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-02-26T03:21:32.510+0000)\n>\n> me and my teammates were just talking to each other we  weren't being toxic towards each other at all\n\nYou think like that cos your definition of toxicity is incorrect. \n\nThe toxicity in your chat is minor, but since the system punishes based on consistency x severity,  minor toxicity over many games will still get you punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-26T03:23:44.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, I guess you did communicate that you think your team was trash cancer script fool trolls, but that's not really what Riot has in mind when they give you the ability to chat, y'know?\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dinerø","date":"2020-02-26T03:27:42.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"i think you might have misunderstood i never said my team was cancer in that way i was implying our team comp is really strong. for the scripts part i was telling my team that the mundo had scripts cuz he was dodging all of our abilities as a joke lol. i said my team was trolling didn't call them trolls just simply said we were trolling. i wish you could see the time stamps and all chats but it doesnt show. i didnt call anyone on the enemy team trash","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-26T05:13:12.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dinerø,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=990yGJEX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2020-02-26T03:27:42.746+0000)\n>\n> i said my team was trolling didn't call them trolls just simply said we were trolling\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fAVr5d9.gifv","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Du Ma Mi","date":"2020-02-26T03:43:43.704+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I normally come into these threads to laugh because people almost 100% of the time deserve a perma. I cannot believe you were even chat restricted. A few little annoying comments \"gg\" and \"our team is trolling lol\" but overall the only legitimate put-down was \"u fools\" and I can't fathom how that's a bannable word. I consistently have games where people call each other \"bitch\" and \"fucker\" and \"Re-----\" (won't finish that one, but you probably understand). The fact that the auto system picked up on \"u fools\" is kind of a head scratcher. Good luck with Riot support pal, I honestly don't believe this was bannable, ESPECIALLY permanent (unless of course, you have a multitude of punishments and you were on your last leg, in which case I get the perma).\n\nPS.
