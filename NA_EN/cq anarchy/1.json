I have tried restarting the client about 3 times and it will continue to stop at 75%, just be applying patch for about 3 hours and I have kept it for 2 hours straight and it still is applying patches forever.

Your specific issues might be due to a poor network that's having trouble specifically staying connecting to our patching servers.  It's being blocked from downloading updates and applying them, so it will get stuck or try to backtrack and fill missed data.  Your best bet would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is in top shape.
