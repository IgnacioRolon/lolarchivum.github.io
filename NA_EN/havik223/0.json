It makes smart casting near any minions impossible and it's way too easy to screw up in a hectic team fight. If someone is burrowed, trust me when I say they know when they want to unburrow. Having the right click do it for them is painful and incredibly annoying. Please change this for the love of the void.","replies":[]}
