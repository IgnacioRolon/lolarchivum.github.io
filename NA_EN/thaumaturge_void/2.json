Something like 5% missing health plus current numbers might work, but IDK. Alternatively, allow her every couple minutes to utilize her old ult as her passive.\r\n\r\nQ:\r\nUnburrowed: For every stack of fury, increase this abilitie&#039;s range and basic attack range by 1/7 of what it is now. \r\nBurrowed: Increase it&#039;s hitbox by a small amount.\r\n\r\nW:\r\nUnburrowed: Maybe deal a small amount of damage in a very small area when burrowing.\r\nBurrowed: Reduce the lag between an enemy moving and the tremor telegraphing it. Allow tremor sense to see cloaked and invisible champions, because even if they&#039;re out of sight doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t interact with the physical world.\r\n\r\nE:\r\nUnburrowed: Add a DoT poison after the bite that scales off AP. Not much damage, but not a negligible amount either.\r\nBurrowed: Increase the distance between created tunnels slightly. For the love of god, make it so that most forms of CC and displacements don&#039;t affect Rek&#039;Sai while she is tunneling. Don&#039;t make her untargetable, just make it so that things like Yasuo&#039;s empowered q or Thresh&#039;s q will only damage her while things like Braum&#039;s ult will. \r\n\r\nR:\r\nSame thing with tunneling; when I&#039;m underground, after I ult but before I actually start my attack, I shouldn&#039;t be able to be decimated by Illaoi&#039;s tentacles.","replies":[{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2018-12-11T19:51:03.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her tremor sense does show stealthed enemies.  You can see Shaco, Eve, Akali, Teemo, Vayne, Kaisa.   I just wish it worked all the time not just when she was burrowed.\n\nThere was another post with similar QoL changes.\n\nThe Passive heal could be 1% max HP (+1% per 100 tAD) consuming 25% max Rage.  So max 4s for (realistically) ~400 AD 5% max hps per/s for total of 20%.  Not even close to Pyke but notable.\n\nFor her W make the knockup prioritize champions over minions.\n\nFor her E make her untargetable while in a tunnel.  Fixes the who CC when engaging and allows her to tower dive some but not like Akali.  She could stop one turret shot with it or maybe more if there are a lot of tunnels under the turret but she is not attacking when in a tunnel so its ok.\n\nFix the delay that her E bit has.  So frustrating.\n\nR should also make her Untargetable.  I think it suppose to be but I get CCed/Killed while in it too often.","replies":[{"poster":"Thaumaturge Void","date":"2018-12-14T17:26:46.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew that she could see tremors in brushes and suspected she could see cloaked, didn’t know about full on invis though. Somewhat wish they’d make it so the screen zooms out while burrowed optionally. \n\nThe heal seems a bit much with max hp, since it’s intended to be used multiple times during a fight. W is fully agreeable. I don’t really like being untargetable potentially every 2 seconds, but again I still think certain abilities shouldn’t interrupt her tunneling. Dunno about the E delay. And entirely agree with R. I’m not even on the map visually but still getting killed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-12-10T01:58:31.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek'Sai... So much potential. Ult really should make her untargetable. Since she is already required to hit them beforehand, doesn't cc them, and usually ends up poorly positioned.\nI think burrowed gaining 50% tenacity would do the trick and help it feel like a positive overall.\nVoid Venom on the bite would indeed be good, especially working with her R. Since it might let them get away but take enough damage over time to kill with R.\nDefinitely agree.\n\nStill waiting for a new skin...","replies":[{"poster":"Thaumaturge Void","date":"2018-12-11T14:13:36.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the reason I’d like the venom is because her only ability that scales off AP is her burrowed q, which is pretty much a void-charged spit ball. It’d only make sense that if she bit a huge chunk out of someone that some of this spit would get on them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2018-12-10T02:47:40.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if they made her sightrange the same range as blue smite or buff her move speed, she'd be good since she could actually catch people","replies":[]}]}
