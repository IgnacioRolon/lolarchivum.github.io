{"poster":"Thaumaturge Void","date":"2019-01-14T21:32:51.438+0000","title":"[Champion Concepts] The Voracious Blade","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated 6/22/2019\n\nAppearance: The wielder is a younger gentleman with particularly damaged/dirty armor and lighter build just barely fitting of a sword wielder. The sword resembles a very fine greatsword covered with patches of a glowing purple-to-blackish substances that gradually cover more/less of the sword as hunger/unlocks/abilities interact. Possibly ancient Blessed Isles origins for the blade, likely Amarantine Coast/Plague Arbor origins for the wielder.\n\nLore: Sent into Runeterra at the tail end of the creation of the world, the blade has lied dormant for many a milennia. Discovered by a tribe in southern. Valoran, the sword’s power awoke and almost instantly consumed those immediately around it. Though initially terrified of it’s power, the tribespeople were lured back to the sword by haunting nightmares and dreams of pure and unmatched power, and came to worship the sword as a deity whose chosen few have unmatched might. Thousands of years later, the secluded tribe has sent a boy chosen by the sword in order to evaluate the outside world in preparations for an upcoming event that will almost certainly end the tribe, mayhaps even the world.\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive: Hunger Undying\nThe champion will only begin to generate hunger after the first time it enters combat after spawning. Hunger will gradually improve or impair abilities and statistics the more empty/full it is, and will change the play style of the champion dramatically. The only way to satiate hunger is to kill enemies, with hunger slowly generating until this champion enters combat and after a short period of non-combat. The less hunger there is, the stronger abilities will be though the longer their cooldowns. The more hunger there is, the less health and resists will be worth though the faster one can attack. \n\nKilling certain types of champions, dragons, and large monsters can unlock additional effects or completely change abilities. Only one line of unlocks can be used at a time naturally, and can be chosen similar to how Kindred chooses targets. (Unique Icons for each line) Unlock lines include: Magical, Warrior, Blood, Draconic, and Beast. Can only switch unlocks after a long-ish period of non-combat, and each switch consumes all stacks of all lines.\n\nThe Magical line requires killing enemies who mainly deal magic damage, such as Ryze and Caster minions. This also includes the Blue Sentinel. The Warrior line requires killing enemies who mainly deal physical damage, and includes enemies like Zed and Warrior minions. This also includes Siege and Cannon minions. The Blood line is a bit harder to collect; If your team kills the Rift Herald or Baron Nashor then it permanently increases your Blood stacks even if you weren't there. This line can also increase by killing champions such as Aatrox, Vladimir, and Warwick. The Draconic line increases by defeating Dragons, obviously. Finally, the beast line increases by killing any monster or non-standard minion except for the Blue Sentinel, Drakes, Rift Herald, and Baron Nashor. This includes voidlings spawned from Zz'rot and Yorick's passive.\n\nQ: Corrosive Wounds\nAfter activating, the next 4 strikes will deal an additional small amount of magic damage over a short time, each strike potentially stacking. If a single target reaches 3 stacks, they will be momentarily stunned and take double damage from the corrosive effect.\n\nHunger: More hunger causes corrosive damage duration to be increased.\n\nUnlocks: \nMagical: Targets hit thrice will slowly gravitate towards this champion when not moving and be slowed by 60% when moving for 10 seconds instead of stunned. (5)\nWarrior: Temporarily increase attack damage by up to 15% until corrosive effects wear off. (5)\nBlood: Corrosive damage will heal this champion for 80% of the damage it deals. (3)\nDraconic: Corrosive damage ignores 25% magic resist, increased to 50% on targets hit thrice. (1)\nBeast: Summons two small monsters that will prioritize targets hit thrice. Deals 10% attack damage and 5% ability power as damage. (4)\n\nW: Worthy Host\nPassive: Inflicting lethal damage to this champ causes you to become cursed, which may stack. When this champion kills a cursed target, they will gain a hunger-based small amount of health and attack damage or ability power per stack permanently. \n\nActive: This champion teleports behind a target enemy within 325 units and will decrease their attack speed by 15%. Cannot target champions with shields or active resurrection effects. (Not affected by things like Sion’s Passive, is affected by Aatrox’s and Zilean’s ult.)\n\nHunger: Low/no hunger instead makes it so that the champion reduces incoming damage by up to 33% for 7 seconds after teleporting.\n\nUnlocks:\nMagical: Teleporting behind a champion roots them for a second. (5)\nWarrior: Damage reduced will instead be reflected to the attacker, though the duration of this effect is reduced by 2 seconds. (5)\nBlood: Temporarily increases lifesteal by 15% after teleporting. (3)\nDraconic: Reduced damage slowly piles up until the effect ends, whereas this champion can reactivate this ability again to knock back enemies in an area. Distance increases by amount reduced. (2)\nBeast: If medium or high hunger, this will summon a flock of flying monsters that will follow the target for up to 10 seconds to deal small amounts of physical damage. If low-no hunger, instead summons a large rock monster to shield you from a single ability or 500 damage, after a few seconds healing you for it’s remaining health. (8)\n\nE: Impact Crater\nThis champion jumps high in the air and crashes at a target location, creating a small crater. While this ability is being performed, can be cast again to smash the Voracious Blade in a target direction, dealing 5% of all enemies' current health to all enemies. Champions hit by the crash are temporarily knocked up and take a medium amount of physical damage.\n\nHunger: Less hunger results in a larger crater.\n\nUnlocks:\nMagical: Impact Crater will deal an additional 15% of the damage initially dealt as magic damage in an area over 5 seconds. (5)\nWarrior: This champion can recast for a small dash. (5)\nBlood: Impact crater heals for 33% of the damage it deals. (4)\nDraconic: Larger crater in general and 10% increased damage. (3)\nBeast: A large phoenix appears over this champion to increase attack range by 25% for 10 seconds. (10)\n\nR: Darkest Knights\nThis champion is fully enveloped in shadows, causing their model to become completely black. They gain the option of recasting 1/2/3 times, becoming invisible and untargetable for 3 seconds at the cost of locking an unlock line for 2 minutes. While this effect is active, all unlocks will become active as long as you have fulfilled their requirements. If you have all unlock lines fully complete, you will lose the ability to recast in exchange for somewhat stronger versions of your basic abilities and a 200 point increase in armor and magic resist. Hunger effects will be considered at 50 for the duration of this effect.","replies":[]}
