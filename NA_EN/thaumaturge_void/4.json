This resource can only be interacted with by Krollax, with few exceptions. LE regenerates at double the rate a unit's health does, and is restored and protected by shields as well. LE regenerates when the unit has been out of combat for 10 seconds. When an enemy's LE has been drained completely, they will be more vulnerable towards Krollax and his Animates for up to 3 attacks or until they regain some LE. Allies can never have their LE drained below 50%, while Krollax can become weakened from draining all his LE.\r\n\r\nKrollax's Animates will attempt to shield him after his HP has been lowered below 30% and he is still in combat with a Champion or Epic Monster. These animates cling onto Krollax, decreasing incoming damage by 5%, for a max of 20% at 4 Animates until they die or combat ends. While this effect is active, Krollax's LE will be constantly drained by 5% of it's current amount per second, with the decreased damage amount lowering the less LE Krollax has, down to 7.5%. Krollax can Alt+Right Click himself to end this effect early.\r\n\r\nQ: Grasp of Death\r\nKrollax drags an enemy within a short range to him and begins Choking them for 4 seconds. Enemies under the effect of Choking cannot cast basic attacks, summoner spells, any ability that causes crowd control, any ability that can move any champion, channels, or non-transforming ultimate abilities. Krollax drains the life out of his victim, dealing up to 10% (+0.5% AP) of their missing health in magic damage and up to 300 LE. When this effect is over, Krollax throws the enemy a short distance in a 180 degree arc in front of him, Grounding them for 1 second and dealing up to 130 (+8% AD) physical damage.\r\n\r\nW: Breath of Life\r\nKrollax spends some LE to resurrect a fallen allied minion or non-large or Epic monster, and they gain 10% of his health, attack damage, and ability power. This resurrected minion/monster will follow Krollax until they die or a 4th minion/monster is resurrected, for a maximum of 3 at any one time. Alternatively, Krollax can imbue a bit more LE into terrain or damaged structures to create an Animate, which is a unique Golem created from the materials around them, for a max of 6. Animates share a collective health system, so when one of them are damaged all of them will be damaged. Consequently, you cannot kill all of them at once through 1; lowering the Animate health pool to 83% while there are 6 active will cause the Animate that took the most recent damage to die and the rest to temporarily gain increased armor and magic resist, and Krollax creating a new Animate while the health pool is at 83% with 5 Animates will fully restore the health pool. Because of this, Animates cannot attack natural structures nor can they attack them back.\r\n\r\nAnimates and will naturally follow Krollax, but can be ordered to travel a lane instead by Alt+Right Clicking a tower and then the Animate in question.\r\nAnimates can mimic Krollax's Q and E, though they do not displace or place crowd control upon their targets and are much weaker overall.\r\n\r\nAnimates gain special traits based on what they're created from. Animates created from Walls or Player-Created terrain are naturally more resistant to physical damage and may cause minor bleeding effects. Those created in the river are naturally more resistant to magic, and will recast enemy spells that hit them back at the enemy for a portion of the effect. Those created from damaged Turrets have a long range and will fire delayed AoE spells, much like a mortar, at enemies. Those created from bushes are invisible until they attack. Those created from the ground regenerate health quickly. Those created from damaged Inhibitors/ the Nexus gain an aura that slightly boosts nearby minions. There can only be a maximum of 2 Animates per type.\r\n\r\nE: Bolt of Harmony\r\nKrollax spends some of his LE to fire a magical bolt of energy towards an enemy, lightly damaging them and causing them to become slowed and reduce their attack speed. When fired at an ally instead, it will lightly heal them and cause them to regenerate LE more quickly.\r\n\r\nR: Fickle Threads\r\nPassive: Krollax can see the threads of life in the universe all around him, creating a web of them only he can see. Areas where many deaths have occurred or terrain/structures have been destroyed darken the web around their location, empowering Krollax's Q and R while he is standing in the area. Areas where much healing, shielding, or creation of player-made minions lighten the web, making Krollax's W and E empowered. Areas where a life-altering event has occurred (Like Stopwatch or Guardian Angel, but not Tempered Fate) weaken the web, and cause Krollax's damaging abilities to deal an additional, small amount of True damage over time while he is standing in the area.\r\n\r\nActive: Krollax strengthens the threads of life of a large area, causing the next Animate created in it to become a massive version instead, gaining much more health, damage, and resistance. This Animate is temporary and doesn't contribute to the Animate health pool yet counts as 3, and cannot be destroyed or dismissed by Krollax.\r\n\r\nMega-Animates created from Walls or Player-Created terrain are extremely resistant to physical damage and will occasionally cause an attack that knocks everything up in a small area. Those created in the river are extremely resistant to magic and will passively ground enemies they are attacking or are attacking it. Those created from damaged Turrets can fire 3 shots at a time, and have slightly increased range. Those created from bushes are no longer invisible, but passively reveal nearby hidden enemies with a faint glow and have an ability that drags a target enemy closer to them. Those created from the ground last longer and have the greatest health. Those created from damaged Inhibitors/ the Nexus can create their own Animates with their own separate health pool, and can't be controlled by Krollax. These Animates will persist through their Mega-Animate's death, but will take low, continuous damage until they die each time they are attacked, stacking.","replies":[{"poster":"FURRY V2","date":"2019-07-31T07:00:41.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This {{champion:90}}  **[Q]** seems legit.\n4 sec stun + 1 sec root after.\n\nOnly this **[Q]** wins bot alone if this champ is brought to support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PugsAus","date":"2019-08-02T06:37:28.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also agree that the Q is way OP.\n\nAlso, the whole kit is really complicated.  The 'Life Essence' part is hard to understand and doesn't seem to add much to the champion.\nThe 'Treads of Life' part of his ultimate is not confusing but would require some sort of visual effect over the whole map for players to be able to see where the threads are weak and again doesn't add anything very interesting to the kit.\nThe golems part is more interesting, I like the shared health pool idea, but you've got 10 different golems types being summonable, and up to six active at once which is a lot to expect someone not seriously familiar with the champion to be able to keep track of.  (Remember opponents need to be able to understand what the champion does also.)\n\nI think summoner type champion concepts are one of the hardest to make, so good on you for trying, but I'd suggest lowering the complexity of the kit and giving it more focus.  You've got 3 unique concepts packed into one kit, none of which actually require the others to function.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rootScythe","date":"2019-08-02T06:08:47.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Q literally does everything.
