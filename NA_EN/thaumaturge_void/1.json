The golem itself had flattened ends on its limbs, measured several meters tall, had an exposed magical core in its chest, and was mostly featureless but exceptionally smooth otherwise. The biomass now covering it hides the magical core, almost entirely encapsulates its head, randomly covers the rest of its body, and it’s right arm is merely the base of a much larger and longer organic arm.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nPrimary: Tank\r\nSecondary: Support\r\n\r\nAttack Form: Melee\r\n\r\nTop / Support\r\n\r\nCC Mage / Group Supporter\r\n\r\nToughness\r\n2/3\r\n\r\nDamage\r\n1/3\r\n\r\nMobility\r\n1/3\r\n\r\nUtility\r\n3/3\r\n\r\nControl\r\n2/3\r\n\r\nHealth: 710 (+48)\r\nHealth Regen: 3.1 (+ 0.73)\r\nMana: 345 (+31)\r\nMana Regen: 11 (+0.575)\r\nRange: 225\r\nAttack Damage: 62 (+2.7)\r\nAttack Speed: 0.485 (+3.3%)\r\nArmor: 34 (+3.3)\r\nMagic Resist: 32.1 (+ 1.25)\r\nMovement Speed: 325\r\n\r\nWeapons/Pets:\r\nBiomass (Has a hidden intelligence Deriyum can understand)\r\nCreatures \r\n\r\nGender: Undefined\r\n\r\nBirthplace: Unknown\r\n\r\nResidence: Unknown (Nomadic)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpells\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive: Brood Skin\r\n\r\nDeriyum passively collects biomass from enemies it slays. It is able to spend this like a currency to upgrade his Creatures in the shop. Upgrades include basic Health/Damage/MR/Armor upgrades, some life steal upgrades, and the ability to grant them an ability similar to his E.\r\n\r\n\r\n Q - Rapid Consumption\r\n\r\nPassive: Killing an enemy unit increases Deriyum’s attack range by 5, up to a max of 330. (This is reflected by his living arm growing in length.) For every 40 extra range, \r\nDeriyum will be able to attack another target with his basic attacks. All stacks are lost upon death. \r\n\r\nActive: Deriyum consumes all stacks of Rapid Consumption to heal for 120/145/160/180/190 (+1% Max health) (+1% per 25 stacks Missing health) over 2 seconds and fearing all enemies within 400 units for 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n W - Invading Biomass/Benign Biomass\r\n\r\nInvading Biomass Toggle: Enemies damaged by Deriyum will take 2% of their missing health over 6 seconds, refreshed once if they are damaged by Deriyum again. After the refresh, targets become immune to Invading Biomass for 14 seconds. If a target dies under this effect, they will become covered in Biomass and resurrected as a Creature, having 20% of their health, armor, magic resist, physical damage, ability power and dealing mixed damage. They also apply Invading Biomass themselves if it is active, but their version only deals 25% of the damage it normally does. These creatures keep their method of attack from when they were alive, and will follow Deriyum until killed. Max of 2 minion/small monster creatures, 1 large monster creature, and 1 champion creature.\r\n\r\nBenign Biomass Toggle: Enemies killed by Deriyum or a Creature gives them a stack of Benign Biomass. At 10 stacks, or upon death, Benign Biomass shields the nearest allied champion within 500 units for 105/130/155/175/190 (+10% Ability Power) (+4% Current Health) (-10% strength for every missing stack if triggered by death). This shield cannot stack and will rapidly decay once the ally enters combat. If no suitable allies can be found, the shield will then try to target Deriyum, then any Creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n E - Grapple\r\n\r\nDeriyum grabs a hold of a target enemy within (his range plus 300, minimum of 525 units and maximum of 630 units) units, damaging all enemy units his arm passes through by 40/65/80/95/115 (+5% Attack Damage) physical damage, with the target enemy being rooted for 4 seconds. Deriyum can then throw the target enemy 300 units in a chosen direction, stopping if they collide with another unit or terrain. Upon collision, the target enemy (and the enemy they collide with if they do collide with one) takes 40/65/80/95/115 (+15% Attack Damage) (+5% for every 100 units traveled) physical damage and are stunned for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n R - Full Control\r\n\r\nPassive: For every Void related item bought or champion present on Deriyum’s team, Deriyum will appear more covered in biomass. This doesn’t affect the game at all.\r\n\r\nActive: Deriyum surrenders to the Void for 8/13/19 seconds, growing in size by 30% and massively empowering Invading Biomass and Grapple. All Creatures are affected by this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuotes\r\n\r\nUpon Selecting\r\n(Loud growling sounds)...I hunger...\r\n\r\nFirst Move\r\n(Low growl)\r\n(Short grunt)\r\n...my heart grows weaker...\r\n...this filth consumes me...\r\n....the veil is weakened here...
