I have 15mbps DSL which is crap but all I can get at my location and my average ping on the loading screen is 85-115. Once I get in game it constantly jumps from 85-350 and some nights after 10pm it will get to be unplayable. \r\n\r\nAre there any in game settings that could help this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T03:58:15.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inconsistencies in latency (ping) are often caused by routing issues to our servers, however, they can also be caused by certain local network settings.
