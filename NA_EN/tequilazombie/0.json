Is there any idea of the direction you want him to go?\r\n\r\nFrom the little fragments we could get, I think the 2 things that we can sort off confirm is that you want to double down on his trickery aspect (no more box stacking, but longer duration / illuminati triangle on ult) and the fact that you don&#039;t want Shaco to have Lane Poke (making his E much weaker early game / in the former Shaco VGU project making him turn in the dagger he throws - possibly overriding the function of his current E and turning it into an engage).

And his AD variant is still loved by many of his mains, specially the ones who've mained him long before the update came through. Mostly because AD Shaco is able to control objectives and push much better than his AP variant, at the expense of some killing power and powerful traps.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of Shaco is that he's able to build however he wants: AP, AD, Bruiser, Full Tank, CDR. It's all viable and there is no reason why take away a playstyle from the champion if it won't hurt the others.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2017-01-26T21:31:45.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"once you get lichbane, you can  chunk towers and since they changed the way ap scaling works against towers, having a clone dealing damage to towers is just as fast, if not faster than AD.\n\n(noted that AP doesn't build attack speed, so you would win a push contest as AD shaco) But this doesn't seem to be the goal of playing shaco anymore, at least in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2017-01-26T23:10:39.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Split pushing and controling objectives were never Shaco's *goal*, but merely a fallback pattern if for one reason or another he's unnable to be a killing machine. AP Shaco might even be decent at chunking towers (given that they are made of wet paper right now), but good luck at pushing through minion waves to reach the tower. Not to mention that he's 100% unnable to do it if the enemy team uses a {{item:3512}} or {{item:3060}} on the lane.\n\nAP Shaco is indeed better than AD Shaco at taking 1 target down, but for everything else AD Shaco has an advantage due to how versatile AD is in comparassion to AP in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2017-01-26T23:15:35.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of the above problems are a problem for me, i build protobelt first, its a 40s cooldown and i can choose to push a tower by 1 shotting a minion wave or saving it against a champion.\n\nKilling buffed up minions aren't a problem either since later on in the game q hits for 1000 against minions when u have lich bane, and E executes them.\n\nAlso, ap shaco is best for teamfights because of how explosive he is.

All AP Shaco has against it is 117*1.45 damage every 3 secs. Q will deal a hefty amount of damage, but it won't proc {{item:3100}} {{item:3285}} due to it's immunity to magic damage. So to deal that 1k damage, you'll need over 1k AP (about 1.2K to be more precise). And even with 1.2K AP, it won't be enough to 1 shot a Promoted Cannon Minion, meaning that you'd need 2 Q to take it down. That's 23 seconds without your Q while split pushing. Doesn't get riskier than this. And AP Shaco can obviously forget about that E execute  against them.\n\n> Also, ap shaco is best for teamfights because of how explosive he is.\n\nGranted, AP Shaco is indeed better than AD Shaco for team fights right now. Although I'd argue Tanky On-Hit Shaco takes the Team Fight cake right now.\n\n> I can set up for barons / dragons and if they dive to steal or just try forcing a fight, i can box off the entrances so they take heavy damage.\n\n{{item:2055}} {{item:3364}}\nNot to mention that AP Shaco deals about zero damage to Baron and Drake. Nevermind solo'ing them.\n\n\nSeriously, AP Shaco is extremely good at killing things (which is an Assassin's main purpose) and provides some really welcome AoE damage for team fights, but aside from that, there's no denying that AD Shaco does everything else better. The wave clear is more consistent, the damage to structures is higher, the control over neutral objectives is uncomparable.\n\nI just wish there was a way to get a middle ground for both builds in which Shaco had a decent Team Fight power (but maybe not as abusive as it was post update) and still have a fallback pattern.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2017-01-27T00:25:26.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q damage is phys.

I just don't enoy it because of how simple the AP playstyle is. I've mained AD Shaco since 2011 and I can assure you that it's MUCH more versatile.\n\nAsk any Shaco main (and I mean a real main, not someone who started to use him as Freelo after the update) if you doubt it.
