Since Morgana no longer has her wings she instead has learned to use her negative emotions as a battery for magic instead. \n> \n> Then if you wanna make things REALLY interesting you could have {{champion:266}}  be a manifestation of her madness or something. Her dark reflection and a literal shadow of war and bloodshed. \n\n\nAnyways I just think if you guys DO choose to update Kayle and Morg you should expand upon why Morgana and Kayle dislike each other so much and reflect that in their ingame VA (currently they basically have ZERO lines directed at each other ingame).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2017-02-05T05:39:11.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"urgot and eve are after galio ( upcoming rework.)

Other than that the majority of Vanguards are fairly solid and at most need minor changes to one spell.\n\nI think your time would be best spent doing a small number of larger scale reworks and a large number of item and system reworks.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2017-02-05T04:04:54.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could this be the time to finally get some gameplay improvements for Nasus (the supposedly *archetypal* Juggernaut who...uh, was completely ignored in the Jugg update and since)?
