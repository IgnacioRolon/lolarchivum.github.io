So really we should have more servers because of this and having to cover 2 countries. Where it comes in favor of China though is population. China has about 1.3 billion to USA 319 Million and 35.5 Million in Canada. So by population we don't need as many but when you do the math that means there is 1 server for every 50,654,074 people. If we wanted the same for USA AND Canada  we should have 7 servers for both USA and Canada for the same size population.
