It&#039;s sad to see that so many people who were clamoring for the return of U.R.F. are already complaining about you guys delivering it to us. We can all agree that U.R.F has some balance issues, but I just want to let you guys know that many of us players actually appreciate that you guys brought back U.R.F., and we thank you for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-04-04T01:03:24.327+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Offering a balanced game experience isn't really what URF is about (or NURF for that matter).

There are definitely certain champs that are much better than others in ARAM, but it's ok because ARAM is for taking a break from all the stress that can build up when you play SR all day, and that's what alternate game modes are for, offering a different experience that may not be balanced but are instead fun and refreshing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-04-04T03:20:07.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But don't you balance TT, CS & HA too?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tidecaller Nami","date":"2015-04-04T23:45:53.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0HF7Ttvw,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-04-04T01:03:24.327+0000)\n>\n> Offering a balanced game experience isn't really what URF is about (or NURF for that matter).

If it wasn't about game balance you wouldn't have disabled champions last year / nerfed champions this year. If you're going to try to defend a shit gamemode, please at least try\nAnd we can see the \"The team\" didn't really try too hard to make sure the same champions weren't played every game\nI wish I could go 2 games without seeing a Zed, Lulu, or Maokai. \nMaybe next time \"the team\" will come up with something new instead of just recycling gamemodes from last year","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2015-04-02T12:46:56.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh, only had 4 games and i already got tired of it.
