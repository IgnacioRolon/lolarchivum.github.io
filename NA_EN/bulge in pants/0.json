They buff easy champs while nerf high skill champs and also like the change to riven which made it easier to animation cancel. Also the way solo queue works like how a toddler can win a game just by being lucky. While fortnite even tho its cartoony it is a high skill game, it rewards skill but league rewards luck more than skill. Say you put 1000 hours into league what now? You get better at the game but still wouldnt be able to do anything if you dont get lucky, thats how this game is reliant on your team (luck = better team). While if you put that many hours you will be extremely good at the game and probably gonna be at popular fortnite streamers level.","replies":[{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2018-05-12T19:56:56.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious if Fortnite issues punishments as much for chat. Is this becoming the new normal for competitive gaming?\n\nAlso, theoretically, balance means that every champ is equally viable for its niche. Easy or hard doesn't matter. Ideally, anyone can play whatever champ they enjoy to any level. In practice, I agree that you might feel someone playing Garen shouldn't win as much as you spending hundreds of hours on Riven.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-12T19:59:51.185+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It becomes a requirement as soon as a game gets a large community, if they want to keep any adult players.\n\nGames aimed squarely at teenage males typically dont care.","replies":[{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2018-05-12T20:11:52.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fAEEdZz5,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-05-12T19:59:51.185+0000)\n>\n> It becomes a requirement as soon as a game gets a large community, if they want to keep any adult players.\n> \n> Games aimed squarely at teenage males typically dont care.\n\nReally?
