And now league won't load. It shows the League Of Legends icon thing but the actual program won't load, I've tried running as Administrator but that doesn't work either. And i know you're probably thinking \"Just submit a ticket\" I rather not have to wait 3 months for someone to do nothing when i'm sure someone here has had this problem and knows what to do. \r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T01:05:39.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it almost sounds like something went wrong with some of the game files if it reverted to a previous patch to update again. Most of the time that will only happen when some of your game files become damaged or somehow corrupted. \n\nIf you can grab the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with a **Force Repatch**, you should be able to get back on the Rift!","replies":[]}]}
