I am just so confused on why riot bans people so easily for such a little offense. Give us a tool to disable the chat box or something because just a small argument without even a curse word being said can get you a ban or chat restriction. LCS pros say worse stuff on stream and on stage but yet they can represent the esport, their team brand, and riot games?\r\nToxic is such a vague term, same as the word bullying, and I feel as if the report system works off of quantity over quality. There are people out there that ruin games on purpose but the system can't detect them running it down mid, but it can detect a small heated discussion in chat. I am in no way a \"toxic\" person, everyone has arguments, everyone has bad games, everyone has bad days. I have been playing video games all my life as have most of you guys and league is the only game where my personality is questioned. Why have I never been banned, muted, chat restricted or warned in any other game? \r\nTwo small arguments out of 146 games shouldn't mean anything, that's 1.5% of my games where I have an argument that is considered \"toxic\" in riot's eyes... I miss the days in gaming where the stress of being \"toxic\" didn't exist... \r\nI enjoy playing league of legends, I enjoy buying skins because I'm a cosmetic junkie, but if riot keeps the crazy bans up, I can't see their numbers player and skin wise increasing.\r\n\r\nall you forums junkies can now comment;\r\nGG n00b\r\ndon't be toxic next time\r\nyou were banned for toxicity, deal with it\r\nall bans are deserved\r\n/mute all","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-31T21:05:07.065+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"First of all, I don't think streamers represent Riot Games or the E-Sport. Streamers represent themselves first and foremost, and what they say in their streams (not in their League of Legends matches, mind) is not within the jurisdiction of Riot Games.\n\nThey can yell, gripe, whine, bitch, and moan all they like on stream, but if they do so in League, _and_ if they're reported for it, they'll get punished for it.\n\n---\n\nMoving on, you say you got punished for a \"small argument\" - it is possible, sure, because an argument is still an argument, and it detracts from the game, but I'm wholly disinclined to believe you since you didn't provide your chat logs from the gate. Without your chat logs, we can only take your word for your punishment, and we tend to try to avoid doing that.\n\nToxicity, I'd agree, is a mildly vague term. I personally use \"toxic\" to refer to players who go out of their way to be assholes to others. Toxicity and rule-breaking go hand-in-hand, but one can break the rules without being toxic.\n\nBullying, though, is not a vague term. Bullying is harassment, plain and simple.\n\n> ...and I feel as if the report system works off of quantity over quality.\n\nIt doesn't. There's no focus on quantity in the IFS. Any report past the first is disregarded, and there's no other signs that any quantity is taken into consideration beyond number of recent negative games (in the case of lighter chat-related punishments).\n\n> ...but if riot keeps the crazy bans up, I can't see their numbers player and skin wise increasing.\n\nYou probably can't see it because you're looking at it from a small scale perspective. There's millions upon millions of people playing League of Legends, and the playerbase is fairly likely to keep increasing, as are their sales.\n\nIf you want to call the ban crazy, provide proof that it's crazy. Show us your chat logs, and also, tell us if you've had previous punishments (like a 25-game chat restriction).\n\nOh, and, one last thing...\n\n> all you forums junkies can now comment;\n> GG n00b\n> don't be toxic next time\n> you were banned for toxicity, deal with it\n> all bans are deserved\n> /mute all\n\nAre you here to discuss Riot's punishment system, or are you here to try and make yourself a forum pariah?

I'm well aware that you're not trying to appeal your ban, but regardless, your discussion does involve saying that the IFS punishes for ridiculous things - yet you don't provide any evidence to that effect.\n\nYour chat logs would either prove that mild offenses can trigger a punishment (and, bear in mind, if you've had previous punishments, there's little reason for the IFS to let up, and you're only naturally going to go to the next tier), or prove that your particular offense was less mild than you try to sell it as.\n\nEither way, little discussion can be had about Riot's \"crazy bans\" if you're not gonna provide proof.\n\n---\n\n> Riot games employees have stated in interviews there is a decrease in LCS viewership in all regions, and I'm assuming their player numbers are also going down just from seeing how fortnite and other games are kinda taking over peoples interest.\n\nSo......What? Battle Royales are just a new fad. That doesn't mean that League of Legends is gonna die in the next month because a new Fortnite came into its own.\n\nLeague has already cemented itself as a super-popular MOBA game, just like Overwatch has as a Hero-based Arena Shooter, and Fortnite/PUBG are starting to cement Battle Royales.\n\nOverwatch hasn't died because of PUBG/Fortnite, and League hasn't died because of Overwatch. New fads don't kill good games.\n\n---\n\n> Also, those terms I used at the end were there as a joke, considering they offended you, I guess that proves my point that forum junkies use those terms more than they should. Maybe I deserve a ban from the forums for \"offending\" you since that's all it takes these days.\n\n_Oh, no, god help me, I'm so offended, my chilled snowflake veins are crisping up as we speak!_ /s\n\nIf I took offense, you'd _really_ know. There would be no subtlety about it.\n\nSo, going back to my question: _What is the point of this post - to discuss the punishment system, or to incite a reaction for the luls?_\n\nChoose your point now, 'cause I'm not gonna bother with someone who uses the facade of genuine discussion to try and poke fun at those who would try to discuss with them.","replies":[{"poster":"Napöra","date":"2018-03-31T21:40:59.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"You seem to spend a ton of time on the forums writing huge posts according to your account history, I frankly don't know why you assume I said the league is dying, of course, league will not die in a month, no one said that.
