It's way better balanced than TT, and has come a huge way from its beginnings.  In the maps' current states, Dom is more deserving of the ranked queue, but they both really need balance team to get off their asses and make some changes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AkabaneKun","date":"2015-04-15T14:39:00.116+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only want draft pick, seriously the mode is absurdly unbalanced, and getting couterpicked in TT most of the time spells gg wp since you can't even farm and get pushed into your tower meaning they can invade your whole side of the map free, a mode like this shouldn't even have blind pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sìel","date":"2015-04-16T02:44:56.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a ranked SR player...I would also queue for TT if it was soloqueue because TT can be fun...just not in blind pick...and I don't have friends...","replies":[]}]}
