Just fucking trade with them so I can shield you and we can win! Graves/Janna works! Just quickdraw in, I'll shield you, and buckshot their faces off! Janna does not mean that you stand at max auto attack range the whole lane and farm because 'Janna is a passive support.' I'm tired of people picking Graves and then moaning when I lock in Janna. You picked Graves; He's a man; Stop being a bitch.\n\n    I play an engage support vs Nami. She puts her bubble on cooldown and I engage. You do nothing. \"Thanks for helping me outsustain them.\" \n... wow. Ok.\n[/rant]\n\nI'm so angry after last game; I wanted to break things in my house.","replies":[]}
