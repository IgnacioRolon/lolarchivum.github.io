Can you regain honor 5?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I was chat banned in May. I appealed it via a support ticket as at the time I did not think it was worth the ban, (trash is a bad word), but I accepted that I got it and moved on. Now when I appealed I was told there is a chance I could make it back to honor 5 (was that for the last two seasons) before the end of the season if I played enough. It is now mid September (4 months) and I (sadly) play this game almost every day for about 5 to 6 hours and I am still just level 1 honor 2. I constantly get the little pop ups when I log on that I get X amount of honors so here is a fragment and all that, but my honor is just STUCK. After making some easy changes to not tilt I've grinded to the highest rank I've ever had (G2 currently) and I am really sad I won't be able to get rewards this season. But what I am really sad about is next season I will go down a level in preseason and it will be impossible to climb back out again. Can someone just let me know what I can do to get out of the cycle? I would love to one day get rewards for gold and above and not be stuck forever just because of one game ...\r\n\r\nThank you for any guidance anyone might be able to give me.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-12T04:38:55.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes time, you cant get to 5 in half a season.\n\nI consistently get honors nearly every game and have gone up one level since the system was introduced.

I get I may not make honor 5 specifically this season but I was hoping to be at least 3 or 4 and it seems I'm not going to make it out of 2 at this point. This means I go back to lvl 1 next preseason and it starts all over...","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-09-12T05:01:00.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're at a rank you're happy with, maybe you should put ranked games on hold for a bit.  If you want to concentrate on grinding back to honor 2, perhaps sacrifice a few days or weeks playing exclusively co-op vs ai or aram.  Those are much shorter games and people tend to be less stringy with honors, especially when you have high kill counts (for AI).  I've went from honor 3 to honor 4 within maybe a month or so playing just ARAM and a lot of AI when I did missions for events.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hazardus ducees","date":"2019-09-13T17:09:14.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why people make new accounts and make lower elo super annoying to play in.
