My friends say that theirs is displaying though, and I have no issues playing a game. \nNothing in my network has changed as far as I am aware. \nI am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.\nClicking 'retry' simply yields a retry, followed by the same error.\n\nEDIT: It started for me on October 5th, in the evening, after clicking a \"Skip Waiting for stats\" that was taking an annoyingly long time to display.\n\nRESOLVED? : It now appears to be fixed. The issue was still occurring when I logged off at 11pm EST on 10-6-2014.
