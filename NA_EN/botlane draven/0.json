There is a reason for this. Disciplinary actions are meant to be handled by Riot Games and the only people who are informed of their punishments and can discuss them are Rioters and the punished player. Riot recently implemented a small card that says \"Hey, a player you reported recently was given a punishment. Thanks for helping out.\" This does not show up every time (it only shows up about 10% of the time) but it's Riot's way of saying, \"We got you\" and \"Don't worry, the reporting system works.\"\n\nIf you're expecting to be rewarded by Riot for reporting a toxic player, that says a lot about you. The report system is not there to make you feel better. It's there to inform Riot of players who make the experience unpleasant so they can encourage reform through punishments or remove them entirely if they refuse to change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PathToImprove","date":"2019-08-10T02:58:19.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo, don't type because this appears to be low rank and theres legit no way you can win if you are typing that much and trying to have punctuation proper. just hit mute.... nothing you say is going to penetrate the THICCCCC skull teammates you have. Better off just pinging and muting because Riot tends to punish the people that type back rather the people trolling or flaming you. If you have a lot of messages you are more likely to get banned just keep it short sweet with a GJ when they die and then mute them. Can't get banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-10T04:09:38.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, it has come to this: someone displayed misbehavior in a LoL match in flagrant disregard for the game's rules, ToS, EULA, and Summoner's Code. That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nLiterally every single chat message you wrote during and after the game was to argue, spam \"?\", call teammates toxic, condescend, and be passive-aggressive. Clogging chat with that kind of drama is annoying for everyone, not just the one you're arguing with. If you find it \"sickening\" that someone lobbied (not \"lobby'd\") for you to be reported (not \"report'd\"), what would you call your post-game chat, where you complained about the Lux and accused them of breaking the rules? If that wasn't intended to get people to report that player without technically using the word \"report,\" then what was the point? Were you venting? In short, it looks like you were trying to misbehave as much as possible without getting a punishment, but you don't know where the line is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-08-09T22:36:31.301+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Theres no way for you to know if they recieved any penalty, so maybe edit that part out. It only hurts your arguement when you make things up like that. You were penalized for excessively arguing over shit that doesnt benefit the team in any way. It actually negatively impacts everyones experience because now they got two teammates spending their time arguing in chat the entire time. \n\nLike who wants that? I wouldve muted and reported you both. Just drop it and play the game, like why is discussing who is being toxic important at all? It distracts from the task at hand (which is playing the game we all signed on to play) and so Riot punishes for it, the person who started it, and anyone who argues and keeps it going. \n\nThats the motive. To deter petty bickering amongst teammates so that those who just want to play hopefully wont have to deal with people holding arguements and debates in the middle of their games. Im sorry you had to learn this by getting punished. I wish they were more clear in the rules, perhaps they are, idk, ive never actually read the rules lol.
