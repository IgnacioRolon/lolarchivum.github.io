You're free to ask for a human to review it and revert the punishment if it was unwarranted. The IFS is actually more accurate and consistent than Riot.\n\n4. Actually, statistics show that most permanently banned players never return on a new account.

In fact, the punishment system is based on Tribunal, in which most cases ended with over 80-90% player participation either for punish or pardon. There were very few \"edge\" cases. Further, less than 20% of players ever get punished. Lastly, publicly traded does not mean a company must follow what the \"majority\" wants. It only means that the stock owners have some input as to directors/company boards.\n\n3. Your emotions do not excuse toxic behavior.\n\n4. They *have* released it.
