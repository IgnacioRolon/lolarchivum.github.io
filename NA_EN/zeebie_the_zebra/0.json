Even though its an alpha seems fairly stable atm. In the alpha we all know ranked play is disabled :( so i wanted to launch my old client, but i can no longer do so.\r\n\r\nIt goes through the calculating differences stages, and then throws an &quot;Update failed : Unspecified error occurred.

Happy testing!\n\nI am glad that my posts where completely over looked. Too hard basket?\n\nWell I've spent a few hours working on this and i am making some progress on this one, \n\nIt seems the logs are throwing back an MD5 Hash error in the \"Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/0.0.1.201/releasemanifest\". Deleting that file and re-downloading it didn't seem to help, but make the error appear quicker on the launch of the launcher.\n\nI am going to assume that it is possible that something somewhere in that folder is cactus. Ive had enough time and patience so i deleted the entire 0.0.1.201 folder and now the launcher is re-downloading the contents.. yay 1.85gb download.. Australian internet.. it would be faster to mail the folder to me on an USB. I am hoping this resolves the issue.\n\nEither way Ill let you know.\n\nI really appreciate the lack of support so far. \n\nIll let you know that if re-downloading that folder works. If it does not which i suspect might be possible, ill have to wait until the next patch release, in that case i am going to be rather annoyed..","replies":[]},{"poster":"zemian","date":"2016-05-19T19:36:20.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im also experiencing this issue, opened the old client and after i installed the alpha i closed it and went into alpha, then wanted to play ranked with a friend but can no longer open the old launcher.","replies":[{"poster":"LiL Batman","date":"2016-05-19T20:29:28.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey @zeebie and @zemian\n\nWould you be able to share your logs with me? Either through Google Drive, Dropbox or Pastebin (http://pastebin.com/)\n\nWere you guys switching between regions or doing anything outside of the normal flow? Normal flow would be something along the lines of: Launch League Client log in, interact with client, maybe get into a game, log out, launch League of Legends.\n\nJust trying to narrow down what might be causing the issue so I can try to reproduce it but if you send me your logs I can get a better picture of the problem you guys are experiencing. Logs are located here: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\LeagueClient Logs \n\nJust send the LeagueClient.log (not UX) but the more logs you can send me, the better! If you choose to use pastebin, please copy/paste the name of the log file into the title section.

Also, how much free disk space do you have on your hard drive?\n\nAlso, generating a system  report would be extremely helpful.\n\nYou can do this in Windows by opening run window (Windows+R) and typing `dxdiag`. After that, click the Save All Information and upload that for us.\n\nOn OS X, you hit the Apple menu in the top right, click About This Mac, click System Report, File -> Save. \n\nCheers!\nRiot Venia\nPatcher Team","replies":[]}]}
