When she has no boots she should be upright but clearly she is not. Then when you get tier 2 boots, she should moving at an angle not the atlantean syndra walk. I have tried this on all the other skins (Syndra is my favourite champion). I hope you will fix this issue. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-11T18:16:45.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Moncho! \n\nThanks for the report! We made some small adjustments to Syndra last patch, and it looks like her run didn't make it in properly. :c We're aware of the issue and are working to resolve this!","replies":[{"poster":"Shavidar","date":"2016-03-13T18:21:52.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What small adjustments ? :p","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-14T16:18:35.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just making the size of the files a bit smaller and more manageable.

It was detected on the PBE some months ago when others were being changed, but it vanished in the next patch. Around the start of this season, however, Syndra's size dropped noticeably compared to pre-season. As there were no notes, I'm not certain if this also bugged somehow, or an extreme degree of perception bias is occurring in my comparative screen shots.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-15T22:58:33.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm, doesn't look like she was part of the champion resizing we did in patch 5.23.
