To quote you (an entire paragraph that you quoted in another board post):\n\n>Since youโll be getting so many more shards thanks to the new leveling system (and with other recent changes to honor and events), **weโll tune down the relative value of the essence you get from disenchanting shards of all typesโchamp shards, skin shards, and ward skin shards**.... To offset the disenchant rate changes, weโre going to change the way loot chests work so youโll have a chance to get two drops in each chest. Get ready for chests inside of your chests. Weโll also add โbad luck protection,โ so you wonโt ever go on long streaks without getting a skin shard or a gemstone from chests.\n\nIn fact, I believe the first messages about Orange Essence specifically came from you a few days later in [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/fRZopjhE-bring-back-the-old-value-of-orange-disenchant-riot?comment=0009)\n\nIf there's another post from you specifically mentioning OE earlier than this, either on the boards or on Reddit, I couldn't find it.\n\nI hope this helps.  I do believe you tried your best to get the message out.  (Hell, I lost my internet during most of the year and I was able to hear about the Preseason changes.  However, I do believe that you weren't 100% clear about the actual nerfs to OE (purely unintentional, I'm sure).\n\n> That being said, I don&#x27;t wanna just dismiss your feedback.

Its always awesome when Rioters get on to explain and clarify.\n\nI would like to make one comment tho. I understand that Riot has to be profitable and I love that they give me a chance to earn skins without paying. But the changes to Orange essence and not being able to combine champ shards to get a permanent feels really bad. Since the Preseason changes it feels way harder to get skin shards. It feels harder to get chests, and almost every chest I have opened contained a champ shard. As a player who already has every champion it feels irritating to get a champ shard which provides no real value to me. I guess what I am trying to say it that the system felt better and more rewarding before these changes.\n\nI mean it doesn't feel awesome only earning 50 Blue Essence for a first win and then nothing else until I Level up and  have to harvest BE from whatever skin shards I randomly got. It would feel much more natural to get a little XP and BE every match. But I understand that it is more directed to new players that are working towards acquiring champions.
