Say 10 randoms at approx. The same elo spectate and vote, if 7 or 8+ think the individual is trolling then you can temp ban or elevate it to Riot employee for evaluation.\r\n\r\nThings to note,\r\nSomeone who played in the game can&#039;t vote on their own game\r\nNever permanent ban off of random community voters\r\nMaybe provide some sort of incentive  (1 game IP boost anyone?)\r\nWithin 1 tier of player In question because something that may be a legitimate strategy in Bronze may be considered trolling in Diamond.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas or thoughts on for improvement?","replies":[{"poster":"Awkward Couch","date":"2017-01-19T17:41:33.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're gonna have a hard time with participation, kind of like the old tribunal.  Personally, I don't need any more IP, I don't need another boost.

Are you talking about duo-jungle Singed, a Quinn player who buys Aether Wisp just so she can run at enemy turrets faster, or a player who dies every 2 minutes trying to 1v1 the Riven they've been feeding? If it's the latter (careless feeding), then I may have a solution for that in a post that I made recently. Since this is something you seem to be interested in, I'd like to hear your opinion on it (over on that page, though, preferably). http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/6qUT19A0-intentional-vs-careless-feeding","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-19T17:31:58.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everybody would just vote yes as soon as they could like they did with the tribunal, and what does elo have to do with whether or not somebody was trolling?","replies":[{"poster":"VillainousMonkey","date":"2017-01-19T17:35:23.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7A9YOWuj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-19T17:31:58.686+0000)\n>\n> Everybody would just vote yes as soon as they could like they did with the tribunal, and what does elo have to do with whether or not somebody was trolling?\n\nJust a thought so that you are evaluated by your peers or someone you might actually see in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-19T17:42:10.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but we have had a system like that before.
