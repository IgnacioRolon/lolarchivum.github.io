It was always fun and engaging. but recently some events have occurred behind the scenes that have completely ruined this aspect of League of Legends for me. \r\n\r\n   I am Very displeased with the way you have been handling your LCS competitive rulings lately. There are massive inconsistencies that show Bias towards certain teams and has completely ruined the LCS for me. More specifically your ruling on REN/TDK and G2/FNC are so different that it disgusts me. I dont understand how you can completely screw 1 set of teams then turn around and turn a blind eye on another. \r\n\r\n&gt; Rules and context copy/pasted out of your public articles concerning these punishments\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/competitive-ruling-renegades-and-tdk\r\n3.1 Team Ownership Restriction\r\n\r\n...Any buyback provision, _**right of first purchase**_, or similar interest in a team shall be treated as a controlling interest in such team for the purposes of enforcing ownership restrictions&hellip;\r\n\r\n...any present or **_future right to ownership is considered a firm ownership stake _**regardless of the date of effect...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/competitive-ruling-g2-esports-and-fnatic\r\n\r\n...which essentially means that Hilgers gets**_ first rights on aforementioned equity_** if Sannpa defaults.\r\n\r\n...it does not create a future state wherein he would be guaranteed control of Fnatic...\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n        By Hilgers making his loan so that he gets First rights on the equity in Sannapa which, is the parent company of Fnatic, which means they own a controlling interest in the team, if they default does that not create a possible future where he would be guaranteed partial ownership in Fnatic. How is this any different than Monte promising (There is NOTHING in writing supplied to the viewers and fans proving this) Badawi a stake in Renegades. therefore creating a POSSIBLE future where he would be guaranteed partial ownership, as we don&#039;t know if they ever created a legally binding contract concerning this matter. According to riot any such condition will be &quot; treated as a controlling interest in such team for the purposes of enforcing ownership restrictions&hellip; &quot; so the two instances should have been treated similarly.\r\n\r\n    I am sorry to say that I will most likely not be watching worlds this year and possibly LCS ever again. As nothing you could do now could ever reconcile the damage done to renegades as a team, not just the league team. your lack of consistency when you decide to dole out punishments has left a poor impression on me as Riot as a company and League of Legends as an esports platform. I can only urge you to be more consistent and transparent in your rulings for the future \r\n\r\nWith Many Regrets,\r\nA past LCS Fan{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2016-09-08T22:26:18.633+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey look... more people who like to pretend they understand what's going on so they can be mad at riot...","replies":[{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2016-09-09T00:32:56.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not really pretending, riot offers no proof that wrongdoing actually occurred (in the renegades case), bans the team (basically ruining the business), then proceeds to just forgive the same offense for two other teams even though there actually is proof of wrongdoing in their case.

It's a much less egregious offence whose only similarity is 'money is involved'. In one case it was the actual owner, in the other case it was a minority shareholder. That's a BIG difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2016-09-10T15:39:00.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot banned Montecristo because they claimed (they have yet to provide any evidence whatsoever that this happened) that he promised a previously banned individual a future stake in his company. This is a possible future share of ownership entirely dependent on Monte agreeing to give up a share, and Riot secondly agreeing to Badawi being allowed ownership. Since Riot would have to agree to Badawi being an owner, it's pretty ridiculous for Monte to be banned for supposedly doing something which is not possible for him to do. Riot MUST approve all owners before they are allowed. So it is possible Monte agreed that Badawi could be given a share of Renegades (we have no proof of this) but even if this had occurred, it would have been a pointless agreement since Riot would have to approve Badawi themselves if or when this happened. \n\nG2 got in trouble because their owner had a possible scenario where he could own and/or exert influence on fnatic, which is not allowed, owning two teams is not allowed and everyone knows this. In this scenario there is actual evidence of wrongdoing. \n\nThe cases are the same because they both got in trouble for promising or being promised ownership that they were not supposed to have or give. The cases are different because one has evidence and one does not. The cases are different because one owner lost literally nothing, and the other owner lost his entire eSports business ultimately.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2016-09-10T20:00:11.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mazariamonti,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=LT1qOcse,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-10T15:39:00.364+0000)\n>\n> The cases are the same because they both got in trouble for promising or being promised ownership that they were not supposed to have or give.

One being the fact that in one case it was ACTUALLY the owner committing the error and in the other it was a MINORITY HOLDER. In the one case, it was a controlling interest that is being discussed, in the other it's a minor financial interest. In the one case, it was direct involvement of the team itself, in the other it was a stage removed(financial interest in the parent company as opposed to direct controlling interest in the team).\n\nRen/TDK the accusation was that Monte was planning to give Badawi a controlling interest in the team.\n\nFNC/G2 the accusation is basically that Fnatic's parent company and G2 both took out a loan from the same bank.\n\nI have no reason to believe Riot is lying to us or that they don't have the evidence. And I understand that it is not always legally permissible to provide incriminating information about an individual in a public place, so I can appreciate why they cannot provide the evidence.\n\nUnlike a lot of people around here, I simply don't have any irrational feelings - positive or negative - towards Riot, so I'm able to think of the situation from a logical perspective as opposed to immediately jumping to the 'RIOT IS THE DEVIL' cries that most of these posts basically amount to.\n\n\n\nThat being said, I fully expect you to not believe a word I said and for this to be a waste of my time because of your final statement.","replies":[{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2016-09-10T20:49:52.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Accusation in G2/fnatic is that Jens Hilger  loaned fnatic money for fnatic to pay for some line of merchandise.
