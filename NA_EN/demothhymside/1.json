I swear, everyone there is 12. Literally 12 years old, and no older.\r\n\r\nGrammar and spelling is horrendous. Every question could be answered with a 5 second Google search, OR going to any game info site.\r\n\r\nNon-stop nitpicking about game mechanics that make you wonder if they have any idea what the genre entails (blocking in a fighting game?!?!?!? OMG so cheap!)\r\n\r\nTop it all off with the weeb factor being through the roof, that GD can only achieve when trying to bait. And I am not using, \"weeb\" like I normally do... I'm talking full on, \"sugoi kawaii deso neko neko nyan!!!\". For any non-anime game, there will be 3 threads on the forums with suggestions about adding their favorite anime character.\r\n\r\nI apologize, GD, for taking you for granted. You might be like a swimming pool that someone peed in, but I've forgotten that so many other places are like having a wading pool filled with watery diarrhea, and having someone stronger than you pushing your face against the bottom, drowning you.","replies":[]}
