I made that quote in response to one of the common responses that you see on gaming communities, which is that if you just let highly skilled players balance a game, you’ll get better results. I was trying to point out that playing a game and designing a game are different skills, just like building a car and driving a car are different skills. Does understanding one make you better at the other? Absolutely.\n\nI was an oceanographer once, but that was over 20 years ago. Back then, there were no professional game designers who came from game design college or something similar. Even today it’s not super common. Most of the designers of the games you play probably got their start doing something else.\n\nI was never on the balance team for League. I bring that up because I think sometimes players conflate design and balance as the same thing. In reality, balance is only one aspect of game design, and many designers go their entire careers without doing that aspect pf development. When I was lead designer on LoL, I was accountable for balance (meaning it was still my fault when something went wrong) but I didn’t sit with the team deciding when to nerf Irelia etc.\n\nHowever I do agree a lot with the sentiment above that interpreting data is a big part of both science and game balance. I wish schools and colleges focused a lot more on teaching data analysis because it’s such a useful life skill. By comparison, I have found little application of say calculus in my life, and I was a legit scientist.\n\nFinally, I’m not actively working on League much at all these days. I took on a different role at Riot focused on telling stories in the League universe in and out of games.\n\nI thought maybe providing more of that conetext might help with your mental framework for how Riot or any game studio makes decisions.","replies":[{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2018-09-28T14:53:32.501+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tennis players don't make their own raquets.\n\nFilm critics aren't directors themselves.\n\nThis is par for the course: different skills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-09-28T15:44:51.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont get why people still try to quote that and think they are showing the world that they are hot stuff. \n\nYou would think by now, that quote and the response should have been slaughtered to death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bijeesny","date":"2018-09-28T16:31:29.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E7KMbPBu,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-09-28T14:49:59.502+0000)\n>\n> Finally, I’m not actively working on League much at all these days. I took on a different role at Riot focused on telling stories in the League universe in and out of games.\n\nYo GC I have a question regarding League's lore. Soooo I heard a lot of people praising it, but I always thought the lore consisted of individual stories about champions, and some of them being in some kind of relationship (either rivalry or love).\nBut recently I saw that you have stories about the history of the entire territories, if I'm correct.\n\nSo because the lore expanded so much I would like to try to get into it, but i don't know from where to begin. Is the lore ordered by some timeline or something like that? If not, can you recommend me what to start with? Any idea which part of lore should i read first?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-09-30T04:01:14.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you fill us in as to why Morello was \"moved\" to another project?
