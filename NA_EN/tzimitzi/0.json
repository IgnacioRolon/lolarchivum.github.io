Not he regular type something out chat I'm not quite that stupid. I mean the commands that pop-up on screen like assistance requested, caution and warning pings, group up requests, things like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-28T18:10:41.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a [chat commands guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752704)(and recently updated) that might help!  You'll need to go into your options to enable seeing enemy chat if that's something you want.  Otherwise Enter is ally chat and Shift+Enter is All chat.  Holding Alt or Ctrl will show the [Smart Ping](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752974-Smart-Ping) bar to select which ping you'd like to use.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazutadashi","date":"2017-10-28T03:26:27.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are using default key bindings, the chat is used by pressing Enter, followed by what you want to say, and then Enter again to say it. Note that the enemy chat will be disabled by default and you will need to change it in the settings menu. For pinging, hold the G key and move your mouse to the command you would like to ping.","replies":[]}]}
