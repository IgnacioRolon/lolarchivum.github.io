But let me get to the point. I&#039;m having some troubles in choosing a champion to &quot;main&quot; but more specifically &quot;onet trick&quot; to use to climb rank. I&#039;ve narrowed down my choices to three champions, Irelia, Akali or Riven. Could I get some help in deciding in which of these champs I should one trick. In terms of playstyle and difficulty, which one is more mechanically hard to play. Which is better rewarding if played right and correctly. And also in terms of which could most be beneficial to a bronze player if played correctly. Or if there are any better champs to so call main or &quot;one trick&quot;. My main is currently jax with over 100 000 mastery points and level 7.  The reason I want to move on from jax is hes quite simplstic and all and can&#039;r really outplay insanely unless he&#039;s fed. So any tips on which champ???\r\n\r\nYour help is greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-22T00:16:37.023+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simplistic is _good_ in bronze. \nYou want to outplay with strategy, roaming and objectives, not 1337 LCSBIGPLAYZ mechanical skill (that you may not have, considering bronze).\n\nMost of the {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:55}} ect players i see in lower ELOs are complete garbage at the mechanical skill side of their champion and just coast on a combination of oppressive laning, pressure and luck.\n\nPlaying a high-skill champion does not make you highly skilled, is basically the lesson here. Most of them (especially riven, kat and zed) have high skill ceilings and no skill floor at all - you can be absolute trash and still carry with them by facerolling your keyboard. The high-skill tricks just help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2017-05-22T00:04:30.936+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking for difficulty, Riven is probably the hardest one to play out of those three. Akali is also pretty challenging to play effectively, but she's really powerful when played right. \n\nIt also depends on what type of playstyle you like. Riven and Irelia have aggressive playstyles early game, while Akali can't do much until she hits 6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2017-05-22T00:56:25.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick a champ you enjoy.\nPlay it till you get really good at it.\nProfit.\n\nThere is no best champ to climb with than the champion you enjoy the most.\nDon't try to learn something that is \"OP\" and get burnt out learning to play something you have no fun with.\n\nI'm a zilean support main and have 2 diamond accounts, 3-4 plat accounts and he's hardly meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-22T00:29:39.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't on Jax, I don't know why you think you can on other champions.

He can jg and he can top. \n\nI mean yes try another champion. But Jax isn't too simple or anything. Even Annie can climb to Challenger. The \"mechanical outplay\" is just another form of distraction.","replies":[]}]}
