Then when Dota 2 came out 4 years ago people said LOL will die. Yet even now League  is 10x larger than DOTA 2 and never showed signs of decline. You will never get account back. And League will last for decades more. Hell its even starting franchising next year with professional teams. YOu know how much investments that will bring?\n\nAnd please stop bringing Dota as an  argument. Its like telling Apple that they will go bankrupt because of Fidget Spinners. Sure they have high prize pool for their WORLD series. But they dont have yearly League like LCS/LCK/LPL... they just have ocasional tournaments.
