It sucks when I have the bulk of the tournament ruined because of aggressively placed spoiler promotions. This has happened with worlds the past 2 years, and now you&#039;re starting to do it on less major tournaments as well.\r\n\r\nI understand that you want to promote your esports, but can you at least bury an option in the client to hide spoilers? You may be advertising to others, but you&#039;re losing my viewership by spoiling the tournament =(","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-05-10T15:56:41.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bookmarking the vods page is the only way I've found to get there without hitting spoilers along the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Sunitai","date":"2015-05-11T02:43:29.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still can't play the game without running into a spoiler though when they have a big graphic promoting a match between two teams on the launcher.  The only way those teams are playing is if they won their previous matches already. (hence spoiled)  I think that's what he's trying to say as well is that you can't even play the game or watch anyone stream the game without running into the placed ad.\n\nI find myself in the same position and it really ticks me off every time Riot does it because it's incredibly rude and makes watching those vods far less exciting when you know the outcome.","replies":[{"poster":"djump","date":"2015-05-11T04:53:25.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed. the biggest problem is you can't log in to the client without getting spoilers. it's quite a pain","replies":[]}]}]}]}
