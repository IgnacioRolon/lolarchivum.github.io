I got High Noon {{champion:202}}  since I enjoyed the champ and recently got into a game with an enemy {{champion:202}}, with the default skin, I thought nothing of this and continued the game, but I saw, sometimes when minions or champs would walk into my traps, the animation for the high noon and default would be swapped, I don&#039;t know why this happened but I doubt anybody will read this &lt;3 GL HF.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-03T23:07:07.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Teemushrooms - \n\nThanks for the report! Looks like this is a case of particle theft (mirror matches are the culprit here). We're aware of this issue, and it appears we'll need a systematic fix for this (particle theft happens across more than one champion/skin). That said, it may be a bit before you see a fix in game. Wanted to pop in and at least explain what's going on here, and let you know that it's on our radar for something that needs to be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mowzigre","date":"2016-02-03T23:16:33.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, im sure it will be fixed asap.","replies":[]}]}]}
