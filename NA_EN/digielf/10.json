While covert operations were often a part of their duties, open combat was something that they would be hired for as well. Shen would likely be one of those 'thugs' used in a more combat orientated role, nothing about his character is stealthy, hes a powerful fighter, so him wearing some measure of protective armor wouldn't be odd. It would probably be leathers of some sort rather than metal armor however","replies":[{"poster":"ShadyWolfe","date":"2015-08-10T00:27:51.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Espionage,  assassination, sabotage, and infiltration were what Ninjas were trained for historically in the villages of Iga and Koga.  They were hired for combat too but they are not as good as Samurai or typical mercenaries at combat.  A lot of people are misinformed about Shinobi except for the mythical aspects(like being able to make clones, summon animals, turn invisible, walking on water) and using hand signs to make magic) of them which were lies spread to drive fear into people.   They did use hand signs to throw off enemies and ninjutsu was just tactics ninjas used for example fire ninjutsu was to tactically use fire to destroy or distract.  Shen would be trained in Ninjutsu in the lore but he is in more of a support combative role in the game.  In my opinion I would like his VU to be like his splash art as I like the pop culture Ninja design best.  Ninjas wore mainly disguises during daytime and wore something similar to what pop culture ninjas were during nighttime in a dark blue color.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2015-08-10T06:52:10.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ao Shin confirmed","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MtnDewsh","date":"2015-08-09T16:56:22.440+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yessssss.
