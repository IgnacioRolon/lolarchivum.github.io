The scenes take place IRL and IG, and every character is basically the champion himself. This is why Riven is a guy and Orianna is not a robot. It's a mix between battling, student life and gaming. The dialogues are in Chinese but there are English subtitles on YouTube. \n\nAn episode is very short for an anime, i guess it's worth giving a look. \n\n( Sorry for bad English btw )","replies":[]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-07-25T09:40:07.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dafk did I just watch...","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldyRey","date":"2016-07-25T06:11:35.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is a girl right?
