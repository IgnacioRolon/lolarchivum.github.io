Thank you in advance for these issues I hope you can get to the bottom to, but since I'm pretty sure today's the end of the cycle I'll go through the pain of 40kBps of 2g speeds so I can at least play when the high speed part comes back, I'm looking forwards to seeing how Zoe plays, and if it isn't a problem to ask, will the blue eccense be easier to obtain at one point? Grinding levels out is hard when pit against some high elo players that I occasionally see","replies":[]}]}
