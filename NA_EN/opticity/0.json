{"poster":"Opticity","date":"2017-12-01T12:03:48.869+0000","title":"Disconnected (but not really) while in game","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't a video of this, but this happens to me at least once every game. Sometimes, randomly and without any warning, the game \"disconnects\" in a sense, but the \"Attempting to reconnect\" message does not appear. Meanwhile, the game proceeds normally. I can click to move around, but the problem is I do not see any new animations playing. If I was attacking when the issue occurs, my champion will be looping the attack animation even when I'm casting an ability or moving. The same goes for every other champ and minions. I can see health bars update and drop/increase, and if anything dies, their health bar disappears but their model remains in place (looping whatever animation they were stuck in). Using movement abilities won't play their animations, but I'll see the model teleport to their destination.\n\nAfter a random amount of time (5 seconds to 1 minute+, I haven't bothered to wait longer than that), every single animation up until that point plays simultaneously, including announcements of champion takedowns and such. The only way I know of to fix this issue is to Alt+F4 and reconnect immediately, but having to do this every single game is not really feasible.\n\nI have a ping test running the whole time to try to catch whether this is an issue with my connection, but whenever this issue occurs, my internet is fine with no lag spikes / packet losses.\n\nTo reiterate, my game sometimes happens to \"disconnect\" and cause all animations to be stuck in a loop. However, I did not actually disconnect because I can still play normally, but all models are stuck playing the same animations regardless of what they're doing, and game events such as takedown announcements do not play. After a random amount of time, every single animation that should've been played occur at once, and the game \"reconnects\", as in everything becomes normal again.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T18:34:43.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you haven't disconnected entirely, but something is throttling or bogging down your connection.  I know you mention it not being packet loss, but these symptoms really sound like it.  It could be issues with game files, but the looping and details here suggest packet loss.  Just to help me rule this out, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on these impacted games and let me know the score you get.","replies":[{"poster":"Opticity","date":"2017-12-02T02:57:21.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall score: 62 / 100\nAverage latency: 273.84 ms (this is normal for me)\nAverage packet loss: 0.63%\nAverage jitter: 5.16 ms\n\nI found 4 network logs for the same game. One is the log before I Alt-F4'd and reconnected, one is the log after I did that.

I've been monitoring my games lately, and it happened again once at the end of a game, so I got a complete network log for the game. Interesting to note that if this happens at the end of the game, the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message appears after the Nexus explodes (of course, I couldn't see it exploding, but I could see its health drop to 0).\n \nThe log definitely indicates [packet loss](https://i.imgur.com/PfI3yCw.png) when the issue happens, which means my connection somehow starts dropping packets at random times. This is not reflected in my ping test to Google DNS 8.8.8.8 though.\n\nThe question remains, why is everything else functional except for models and animations? Regardless, it's gotten less frequent over the past few days, so it may just be connection issues after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-07T17:20:30.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you have packet loss throughout the whole duration of your match, it just spikes higher towards the end.  After the Nexus explodes, your network needs to transition you out of the game server and back to the client but struggling to make that handshake.
