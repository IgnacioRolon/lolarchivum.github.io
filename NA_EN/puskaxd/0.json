With this said, in any instance you go on the offense, unless Eve is behind, she can simply angle her counter-offense for free and fly in. She has a speed buff to catch you, so you won't out-run her. She can build to be a bruiser while building very little ap to do it, so the odds of killing her are low unless you get another bruiser on her or take her on with numbers. She's basically like how tank Ekko was...just more invisible with less utility. An assassin built like a bruiser always causes problems with the game's balance because assassins are supposed to be almost as squishy as adcs on paper. What's worse is that you can't really see her attack coming. Sure, some people have a tad more range. Sure, her longest ranged attack is 650. How are you gonna escape someone that's flying at you with a speed buff on when you only have 700 range to do it and they're cutting off your escape path? The point is practicality. Malz and Annie have to burn a highly valuable resource for their solo plays. Rengar has to use ult or be in a bush. Even can literally just walk around willy-nilly, aiming for the perfect angle to flank and murder you.\n\nAnd a side note: Being forced to play passive all lane just because Eve exists is stupid. The only counter-play to her outside of hopefully starving her of early game kills is to buy a pink ward over and over. That doesn't even kill her...it only lets you know she's near the pink ward.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2015-08-04T18:49:25.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GBmfblap,comment-id=0005000100000000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-08-04T08:04:27.039+0000)\n>\n> Ok, lemme break this down one last time:\n> \n> We use wards to keep vision on things we have no eyes on, but Eve can easily bypass these wards.\n\nWard her jungle camps.\nThis is what is done at high level of play to counter her stealth. \nIf you cannot afford a pink, you throw a ward into her jungle at one of the camps.\nJunglers tend to be weaker than laners due to the nature of gold and exp.\nYou can easily establish some vision through your first back, or through your jungler's capability.\n\n>this said, in any instance you go on the offense, unless Eve is behind, she can simply angle her counter-offense for free and fly in.

She can build to be a bruiser while building very little ap to do it, so the odds of killing her are low unless you get another bruiser on her or take her on with numbers.\n\nEvelynn builds bruiser because she is a squishy champion, not because she is naturally tanky.\nIt is why Evelynn has a rough time in her first/second clearing of the jungle. SHe doesn't get tanky until she has the items to do it unlike some champions such as Sion who has the natural base stats.\n\nOn top of this, yes she has a MS buff, but so does Udyr.\nWhat is the counter for Udyr? Slows and roots and CC.\nEvelynn is easily kited because her Hate spike's projectile decays in speed.\nSo at max range, simply running in a straight line can cause it to mis..\n\n\n >She's basically like how tank Ekko was...just more invisible with less utility. An assassin built like a bruiser always causes problems with the game's balance because assassins are supposed to be almost as squishy as adcs on paper.\n\nHave you looked at her stats?\nEvelynn IS squishy like an ADC.\nThe only reason she seems tankier is two things.\nHer ult grants her a shield, her ULT, and she BUILDS tanky.\nOtherwise, Evelynn dies very quickly and very easily like every other assassin.\n\nIt's like stating Zed is a bruiser because he built bruiser items.\n\n >What's worse is that you can't really see her attack coming.

You have hope, others clearly don't. Instead of being offended when some one tells you that you were wrong about something you think about it critically and weigh the merits of the statement. This means you can improve. There are plenty in this thread who will never amount to anything in game or in life because their minds are closed. That's sad.

My only problem is when people troll around in the game, intentionally ruining it for their 4 teammates and creating a negative environment, and don't get punished for it. Yet you can say, in exact words, \"dude stop trolling please\" and get punished for calling him a troll and \"ruining his fun\". What's worse is the community actually defends it. E-sports will never be respected as a real \"sport?\" with the mentality that they have. Literally any other sport I've played, you would get bitched at for trolling. The coach wouldn't defend the player that intentionally took the ball and scored the game winning touchdown for the other team lol.","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-03T22:36:07.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck pro, if you did that shit in highschool you would be off the team lol.

You think I don't know the difference between having a bad game and running down mid lane with Lulu (5th pick mad that she didn't get mid) feeding kills to the enemy Zed? No, it's not having a bad game and missing a tackle. It's taking the ball and running into the other endzone with it. Then they saying stupid shit like, \"this community is so toxic\". Well no shit! When behavior like this is encouraged, obviously the community is going to be shitty. It's like people aren't smart enough to realize that the majority of \"raging\" comes as a result of people intentionally dicking them with no consequences.
