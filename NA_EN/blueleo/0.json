I would click on the shortcut and the logo quickly appears then quickly disappears. Then I would wait, but nothing happens. I went to the forms and tried to look for solutions, but none of them worked. Please help. I just want to play League of Legends for a little bit more before I have to start college. :c \r\n\r\nIf there is anything I can do, please let me know, and if anyone can relate to this problem, please comment or thumbs up this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Blazar","date":"2014-09-17T22:16:14.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah same here... I can only connect if I use my phone's HotSpot to log in.
