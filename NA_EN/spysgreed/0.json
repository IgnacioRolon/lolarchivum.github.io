Although this isnt the most important bug, it could definetly be exploited by people.\n**How to do the bug**\n1. Use w\n2. Basic attack, but then move at almost the same time you basic attack\n3. Wait until your normal five seconds of empowered basic attacks run out (Dont do anything)\n4. Now you can basic attack any target for an empowered attack, meaning you can basicly use w twice\n\nIn terms of how difficult this is to pull off, well i whould say 7/10 times you try you can pull it off as long as you have praticed it for a bit. This is how it looks when you stop the attack https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/638738773605351437/642101409071759409/unknown.png and in this one you can see me using the saved w https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/638738773605351437/642102142659854347/unknown.png","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Maxw3ll","date":"2019-11-11T21:31:12.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo friends!

You're merely canceling it. It's an empowered attack and since you didn't attack anything it'll work the next time you attack someone. I mean I don't play Malph tbh.

His w makes his attacks also deal damage in a cone and deals a bit more damage to the target for the 5 second duration.
