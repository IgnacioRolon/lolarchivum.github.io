I don't know what is the level of toxicity for punishment but they can find a lot of players who needs to be punished if they don't use their riot profiles. I stand up to toxicity and BM and get reported myself for no reason. Many think getting involved into this will get them reported so they stay out of it. Under cover riot guys can reward those who are good examples of summoners and monitor the behavior of toxic players before punishing them. \r\n\r\nRough idea still a lot to be thought on.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this .\r\nComment on what you think can be done more or even if you disagree with this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-01T19:46:27.053+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":1,"body":"A lot of Rioters actually don't have a Riot tag.
