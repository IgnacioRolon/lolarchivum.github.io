The whole hunting prey to consume and evolve from it, taking their strength to grow stronger himself. It made me think, what if we had a skin that actually showed this in the game, rather than it just being in the back somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile I have no real idea of how it would fully work, especially design wise as I am not a designer, I think it would be incredible to have a skin where as you kill other champions as Kha'zix he would take little aspects of that champion and add them to himself as he evolves and becomes more powerful. Like killing Kayle and his wings becoming more angelic, killing Twitch and perhaps a little rat tail sprouts out, things like that. I don't even feel like the changes have to be all that radical considering how many champions there are, but the idea of getting a unique look at how Kha'zix might change for every game could insane to see and it would really bring the idea of his character alive.\r\n\r\nIt would feel like the absolute ultimate skin for him, kind of like how Spirit Guard Udyr does for, you guessed it, Udyr.\r\n\r\nI have no more detail than that, I just felt like the concept of this was too cool not to plant somewhere hope it sparks something.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-09-28T14:24:22.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While that is a good idea, it would take sooooo much work to do all of that","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-09-28T15:37:20.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they got time to make sylas ults and 10 ultimate lux skins they can do this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-09-28T15:45:16.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=TzVYjfIg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-09-28T15:37:20.959+0000)\n>\n> they got time to make sylas ults and 10 ultimate lux skins they can do this one.\n\nSure, they had time to make 10 skins for lux\nBut league has about 150 champs, so that's 150 new models. Or even more if OP meant that he could have something from each champion at the same time\nSo it would be really much work, and it wouldn't be worth it most likely\n\ni don't know how Sylas ult works exactly, so i'm not going to comment on that, but from what i know, they didn't have to make 150+ completely new models","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-09-28T14:56:17.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doubt that will ever happen, they would have to update the skin with every champ that comes out.
