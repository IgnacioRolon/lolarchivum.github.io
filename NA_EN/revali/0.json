If you don't mind, send this trace over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well as your network logs. They can take a much closer look at your logs there and should be able to spot anything else that might be making your ping spike!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
