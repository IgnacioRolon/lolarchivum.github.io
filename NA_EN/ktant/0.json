After I get in game it freezes and completely crashes my computer. The longest I've sustained a game so far is about 10 minutes but it always crashes the game and my computer freezing it to the point that I have to hold down my power button. It was working perfectly until about 2 days ago and I'm not really sure what changed over night to make it stop functioning. I've lost LP and am in leaver queue. Please help. I just want to play league.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-22T23:29:45.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may have installed the Windows 10 Anniversary update recently, which enabled the Xbox Game DVR feature by default.
