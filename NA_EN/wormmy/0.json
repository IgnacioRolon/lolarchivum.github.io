I tried the suggested fix from BroPoro but that didn't do the trick.  I have tried signing into multiple accounts across NA/LAN/EU regions and get the same error every time - \"Unable to connect to the login queue.\"  The server status is good and the Hextech Repair Tool does not fix this, even with a patch reinstall or reinstalling League.  I have deleted the game including the Riot Games folder and installed a new, clean copy and that didn't work.  I also followed the DNS guide and set it to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and that didn't work.  \n\nI feel that this is more due to the Windows 10 Security update that you can't stop and not League since my League works just fine on my Macbook Pro.\n\nLeague, please find a fix to this Windows 10 issue, please!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Caelum Solaris","date":"2017-06-29T05:06:11.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having the same issue since the windows 10 update on my laptop.

However my laptop that currently has the NEW WINDOWS 10 UPDATE doesn't work at all.\n\nThe LOGIN issue is RELATED to WINDOWS 10 UPDATE! I am almost 100% positive. I want to fix my laptop to play League but it just doesn't seem fixable right now until Riot comes out with a fix for whatever the new Windows 10 update did.\n\nBroporo I am hoping that a solution comes out soon for the Windows 10 bug :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeusVulting","date":"2017-07-10T01:09:14.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone fix this yet, I cant even roll back the windows update so im stuck","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T03:17:08.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing more and more of these login issues pop up. Previously we were able to get this fixed up by following these steps:\n\n- Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Open \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" with notepad\n- Find the line: gameflow-patcher-lock:\n- Delete this whole line\n- Save the file, restart your LoL Client - and you should be able to log in again.\n\nLet me know if that's able to help, and if not I may have another trick up my sleeve that other players have found helpful. This first method is much easier and safer to perform, so let's start here!","replies":[{"poster":"Wormmy","date":"2017-06-20T00:33:51.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, this didn't work for me.
