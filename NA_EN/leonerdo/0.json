It's disheartening to see that specifically happen to Shen, who was only recently reworked, and whose more controversial changes were accepted with the promise that he'd be easier to balance overall. This is definitely not unique to Shen, and it's become pretty clear that the game has, in many ways, fractured into two: there's the League of Legends for top-ranked players, with its own meta, its own Ranked queue and its own balance changes, and then there's the League of Legends played by the vast majority of the playerbase, where champions who should normally feel good end up feeling unsatisfying due to changes that are not immediately obvious (Rek'Sai having her damage slashed in favor of her knockup and utility is one of the biggest examples), and where some particularly irritating champions or builds don't receive as much attention as they should (Heimerdinger, Master Yi and Tryndamere don't feel particularly great to play against, for example, but aren't prioritized for kit changes because they're extremely easy to counter at higher ranks).\n\nOne of the issues behind this is that Riot has, as they've mentioned a few times, mostly given up on balancing for lower ranks. To a certain extent, this is fair, because most changes that seem minor at below Plat (e.g. a difference in 3 base AD) tend to disproportionately affect higher-level play. However, what this fails to acknowledge is the _feel_ of these champions: putting aside how some champions are essentially near-unplayable at lower levels of mastery, like Azir or Kalista, a great deal many \"easy\" champions, like Alistar, Lulu and Rek'Sai, have often been the target of nerfs to features that only became truly relevant in high-level play (e.g. Ali's minion pushing power, solo lane Lulu's safe utility or Rek'Sai's vision) without much done to lighten the impact of those changes at lower tiers. As a result, these champions ended up feeling weaker than they should be and, often, more difficult to use properly, particularly since many of those changes didn't fully solve their high-end issues (Rek'Sai's still getting nerfed, for example). Balancing purely for Plat and above, and sometimes even higher, has effectively created an environment where many parts of the game just don't feel right for most players: no matter how you decide to present it, i.e. it being a problem of game knowledge, mastery or team cooperation, there's an innate failure on Riot's part in making the game feel as good as it can be to everyone.\n\nWhat's disappointing about this is that balancing for below Plat _can_ work, and Riot's done it successfully a few times before, such as with the changes to Lee Sin that made his passive and ult more rewarding in situations that didn't really affect pro play (kicking the tank into the carry felt better, and that was fine because most of Lee Sin's kicks at higher tiers were either to peel, disable lone targets or Insec the carry to his own team). The changes Aurelion Sol's receiving right now, while mostly a nerf, also include a buff to his E that will make the ability easier to use. These are the kind of changes we need to see much more in the game, and Riot needs to look specifically into ways of buffing or nerfing champions at lower tiers without having too much impact on pro play. Basically, a lot more champions need to be made easier to use, or at least more rewarding to start with, while scaling up to similar levels at higher tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"Leonerdo","date":"2016-09-09T05:45:25.114+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you like, copy-paste this into it's own post.

His base stats are ass and a huge plethora of champs can easily bully or otherwise at least zone him just by stat checking alone.\n\nLogically, you would nerf his global presence and keep his lane phase the same/give it a little bit of love (please god give shen a small boost in base stats because he has the bases of a legit squishy).\n\nThey could have added a small increase on ult cd, or lower the shield amount base and maybe increase scaling off of his tank stats.

Eventually, pros are going to stop picking shen because even though he has good global his bases and lane phase are going to be too shitty to justify.

I actually agree with you mostly, but I'm gonna play devil's advocate for the discussion.\n\nIt's possible Riot did consider nerfing his ult instead of his lane strength and they felt that wasn't the best direction to take him. Why? Probably because his ult is key to his identity, and if his ult is weak he just feels like any other top-laner. And yes nerfing the shield a little bit could push his ult over the edge into being garbage, because if his target dies then the TP doesn't even go off. Also his ult is one of his most nuanced abilities, and changing it could have unanticipated effects on his gameplay; it could mess with the pacing of his rotations and his macro-play in complicated ways. And the pros only get a short while to get used to these changes after all.

It is huge when it comes to play making, so he has a strong tool to get ahead, specially when the team has LCS level of coordination. Riot wants him to not be such a safe pick.

They nerf him since 5 or 6 patches withoutany success so far. \nBecause they don't nerf what is problematic.\nThey could just give dmg back into Q or E or passive three hit and completely remove his W dmg which would significantly hurt his tank build. \nThey could also remove either his bonus movement speed or his W slow. Which would also hurt his tank utility build but not his AP build. \nActually they could remove slow AND movement speed. To get close he already got his E blink and his W situational stun and a slow on his Q. \nHe gets movespeed from lich bane and ludens echo already which would favor his AP build again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"genya03","date":"2016-09-08T22:32:24.820+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"eSport is one of the reasons why this game isn't fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-09-08T23:42:32.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Also one of the reasons its so successful and boomin","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-09-09T00:52:05.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never used to be, look back at the first 2 seasons; it's not why the game became popular to begin with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
