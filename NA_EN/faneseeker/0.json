I can&#039;t find that post anymore so I&#039;m wondering if something transpired while I went out to refill my salt. \r\n\r\nI was quite curious about it because it was very suspicious and that got me thinking:\r\n\r\nYou guys know those people that got boosted to plat or even diamond by someone who does it seemingly effortlessly? (A few were caught red-handed on this forum not too long ago) Here is my thought, what kind of player can boost someone else to such height? and then it hit me; Challengers. \r\n\r\nThere is less incentive for pros since they have a team and most likely sponsors, that leaves us with one tier left; Challengers. \r\n\r\nlol, my 2 cent conspiracy theory with a sprinkle of fresh salt.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2018-11-13T23:17:05.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Red post that it was supposedly a ban for wintrading and having his account piloted.
