If that doesn't help let's see if we can help you raise the attention of RIot by continuing this thread or posting on Reddit.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-01-31T01:05:02.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the first response is not \"a bot response\" unless you mean the automated email which says your ticket was received.\n\n* ***Automated Responses*** -- We do have some automated responses, but they are extremely limited in scope.  The opening line in the automated response clarifies immediately that it is an automated response, and if you would like a human response, you can simply reply back to the ticket.  Otherwise, all of our tickets are handled by a real-life human, which is why these kinds of mistakes do happen.\n * ***Copy/paste Responses*** -- There is no way to sugar coat this, so I&#x27;ll just tell it to you straight:  We do use macros in many of our responses.  There are two main reasons why we do this:\n  * On average, we get thousands of new tickets every single day (in NA alone), not counting the tickets that take multiple responses back and forth that get added on to this.  Our goal is to make sure you get a full resolution within 24 hours of you submitting a ticket, and to hit this mark, our agents need to respond quickly.  These macros are reviewed constantly to make sure that they resolve the vast majority of issues that you all have, and if it doesn&#x27;t, we re-write it.\n  * When answering tickets, we tend to see the same type of issue or question over and over again.  Even if we customized every single response, an agent tends to get very efficient at explaining what the issue is and how to solve it.  Over time, the variance between every response gets less as less as we tend to figure out what works and doesn&#x27;t work and soon you end up with pre-written responses.  We can absolutely make a push to ensure every response is unique, but then we encounter a trade-off:  More customized response or faster response time?  We have surveyed thousands of players about this, and faster response time wins out almost every single time.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/RbRZFBHn-lol-riots-trolling-me-guys-wtf-is-this?comment=000200000009","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMagicalVeggie","date":"2017-01-31T01:01:03.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=o0O Madoka O0o,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UT3wlrEn,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-01-31T00:52:56.514+0000)\n>\n> Try to reply to a single ticket with additional information.
