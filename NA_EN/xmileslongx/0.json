We can't alter game stats or remove [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalties, but I'm happy to help troubleshoot this \"error.\"  Can you provide some more info on what happened exxactly, or what the error message said?  Even if it's something you had no control over, leaves still causes others a negative experience and you've left enough games to give a lower priority queue.  Let me know so we can work towards prevent further penalties and get you back in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PyroShizZz","date":"2017-02-11T19:12:29.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on the same boat, lately my game has been crashing multiple times, I try to restart it and it says that there's already a session and I can't do anything, my poor pc takes for ever to restart and when I log back in it says that leaverbuster had displayed that I have been placed on this 20 minute ban for 5 games. and if this is the case, HOTS sounds very appealing.","replies":[]}]}
