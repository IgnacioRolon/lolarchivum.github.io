I signed up on the pbe signup page and it said i was eligible for one. I read that this would link my regular account to a new pbe account. However, I'm unable to log in to the pbe using the username and password that I'm using for my regular account. Any help? Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T23:04:27.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your PBE account is not the same as your live account, so the credentials should be different.
