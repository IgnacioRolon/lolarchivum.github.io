When you turn on the W active, this is disabled, making him do less damage to towers while he is holding his active. I believe this is because his W active's damage component is specifically designed to not affect towers, but instead of being an additional component of damage ontop of the passive, it disables the passive and becomes its own bonus all together. \n\nTo replicate, load a custom game. I chose howling abyss. Put a point into W. Go up to tower when creep wave spawns. Hit the tower. Notice your damage against the tower is around 50 physical + 13 magic or whatever. Turn on your W. Damage per hit drops to only 50 physical per swing while W is active. Returns to normal when it expires or is used.\n\nI don't know if this is intended but it seems counter-intuitive.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mormonator","date":"2014-10-12T23:02:55.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Someone please help this person, I can't bring myself to.","replies":[{"poster":"GenesisV1","date":"2014-10-12T23:14:13.720+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"PASSIVE: Kassadin's basic attacks deal 20 (+10% AP) bonus magic damage on-hit.\nACTIVE: Kassadin charges his Nether Blade, causing his next basic attack to deal bonus magic damage, gains 50 range (200 total range) and restore a percentage of his missing mana (quintupled against champions).\n\nPlease explain what part of my report doesn't make sense. Why would triggering your active cause your passive to stop triggering on towers. His active being on cooldown does not disable his passive. It's not Master Yi's Wuju Style. Do some research before you make a rude remark.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mormonator","date":"2014-10-13T00:18:10.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was hoping that someone could word it a little easier than I had planned to. But it seems you aren't getting any luck with that so allow me. You're right that the passive damage from Nether Blade turns off when the Active is turned on. This is because the passive damage and active damage do not stack. The active damage of Nether Blade replaces the damage of it's passive until the active is consumed or expires from not being used. If you activate Nether Blade while hitting a tower, you notice that active is not consumed because Nether Blade does not proc on towers and you will continue to simply basic attack the tower until Nether Blade's active goes back on cooldown and is replaced with the passive damage that does proc on towers. And I've done all the research even back to when they disabled the procing of Nether Blade on structures back in Season 3,  Patch 3.03. If you have any other questions please reply but to put it simply, as I said, the passive damage is replaced by the active damage until the active is consumed. If this was not the case than the correct ability details would be (below). Good luck in Solo Que and have a great day.  \n\nPASSIVE: Kassadin's basic attacks deal 20 (+10% AP) bonus magic damage on-hit.\nACTIVE: Kassadin charges his Nether Blade, causing his next basic attack to deal bonus magic damage 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 60% AP) + 20 (+10% AP), gains 50 range (200 total range) and restore a percentage of his missing mana (quintupled against champions).","replies":[{"poster":"GenesisV1","date":"2014-10-13T01:07:09.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand how it works. Your response is literally exactly what I meant when I wrote \" I believe this is because his W active's damage component is specifically designed to not affect towers, but instead of being an additional component of damage ontop of the passive, it disables the passive and becomes its own bonus all together.\"\n\nMy point is that does that not at all seem counter-intuitive to you? That he does less damage to specifically towers only when his active is on? His next auto will pretty much deal more damage to anything that isn't a tower, inwhich case it will deal less. This isn't necessarily a bug as much as it is inconsistent or counter-intuitive design. Does my inquiry make more sense now? Also, Season 3 kassadin had a different W before his rework. Did not have a passive damage steroid, only mana on hit. The active was the damage per hit. Different case.\nI'm well aware the passive and the active do not stack. My point is they can just make it so that the active does stack, reduce the active's bonus damage component by the passive's damage amount, and still let him deal damage to towers with it on. Or they can just keep the numbers/wording and change the code behind it. It just makes less sense for Kassadin to go \"I'm charging up my next auto attack to be stronger\" and hit less damage than he normally would to a tower.

The passive should remain passive against towers even if the active is used. It's fine that the active doesn't proc on towers as long as the passive still works on towers while the active is on. Normally losing the passive damage is no big deal against other targets because the active damage is much more, but that's not the case against towers specifically. I think having the active work against towers might be a bit much because it adds just a tad too much split pushing power for someone like him.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mormonator","date":"2014-10-13T02:58:52.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah that's where season 3 patches come into play.
