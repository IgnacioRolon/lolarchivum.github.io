Coupled with the fact that urchin strike can be dodged if the target is not CC'd and has any form of mobility, Fizz being ahead does not give him an advantage in the game that is comparable to other mid laners. \n\nSo it is indeed more Riot-style nerfs. Doesn't change potential by a lot, but hits upon the reliability and accessibility (a.k.a game and item progression) of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-02-01T16:13:35.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how any of your post applies to my own post.

His other 'dash' is a targeted skill shot. I know, most are going to be like 'Wait, targeted... skill shot?'. It's Lucian's Q pretty much. You target the champion and you have a second to press a dash to the side and you've dodged it or if he's done it from max range, you can also just dash forward to avoid it. You can also dodge his Q by simply knocking him back, up, or otherwise stopping him in place before he hits the target, which is... kind of like a skill shot, except... he's the skill shot? He becomes a projectile and he's stoppable, let's put it that way.","replies":[{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-02-01T10:09:45.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But nooooo\n\nFizz urchin strike is targeted ability so it has zero counterplay whatsoever!","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-01T10:12:35.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And now it has counterplay by physically dodging 'him'. lol.

I like that he has to use his ult in order to get a kill, since i think an assassin should need his whole kit to kill you...but that when he does it you WILL die without proper response. \nThese were the first four that came to mind. \nZed needs his ult, but it is targeted. \nTalon needs his ult, but it is aoe  and not a skill shot\nAhri \"needs\" her ult, but all the damage from it is targeted\nAkali needs her ult, and it is targeted\n\nThe CD being close to that of the hougrlass however isn't really worth mentioning. Since Zed and Talon would have to deal with the same thing, and hourglass is a even better item against them since it gives armor and they are AD. Soooo again, not even worth bringing up. \n\nI'd be fine with Fizz getting a bit of his Q damage back in exchange for his E getting a longer CD, but i don't see them changing his ult. \n\nI DO however, find it very strange that they take out the DFG...take the damage amp off of charm...because it is similar to DFG...then do what they did to Fizz ult.
