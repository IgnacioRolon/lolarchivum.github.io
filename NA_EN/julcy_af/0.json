The fact that Lucian is in every game means something is wrong. If Lucian were to get nerfed a bit it would lead to people picking late game scaling adcs again (Jinx, Cait, Vayne, Twitch) because what can ezreal do to them in lane ? Nothing he's just gonna get out teamfighted, and outscaled leading to a decrease in his playrate as well. MF has been nerfed multiple times since Preseason and she's never felt that bad unless we're talking about AP MF \"support\". MF got nerfed. It's Lucians time as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-02-06T06:51:13.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want to make him garbage again because he's too popular?","replies":[{"poster":"Legacian","date":"2016-02-06T06:53:33.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Enter the Lucian main that doesn't want Riot touching their \"baby\".\nHe's brutal to trade against because of his passive, his Q is enough poke to still deny his opponent creep, and his R is like a confined MF ult that allows you to move while casting.\n\nHe's just not fun to play against...

When you have a champion who can remain strong and relevant throughout pretty much all phases of the game, in addition to the fact that he snowballs pretty significantly and can 1v1 duel other champions late game on his own... I'm not so sure I agree with you. He's substantially harder to trade with than most other marksmen, and with a support that's worth a damn, bot lane basically just becomes a kill lane because of the damage potential he has when he gets good peel.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-02-06T08:23:29.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Legacian,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=7zj3c6lN,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-06T07:35:58.729+0000)\n\n He's substantially harder to trade with than most other marksmen, and with a support that's worth a damn, bot lane basically just becomes a kill lane because of the damage potential he has when he gets good peel.\n\nYou clearly didn't play much against Season 4 Lucian when he was actually a dominant laner. The Lucian we have now if nowhere near the laner he was a couple seasons ago. If you're still struggling badly against him, you're honestly just a bad laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-02-06T09:24:22.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sound like a favorite of Lucian who wants to keep telling themselves that their really good at Lucian, and the champion is not carrying you.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-02-06T09:29:30.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I don't even play adc, but ok.

I don't main ADC. Quite honestly, I don't main any role, but from what you're saying, it sounds like I sure as hell spend a lot more time bot than you do. When you play a role to an extensive amount, you learn about the champions in that role. _All_ the champions. If you don't play Lucian, why are you here? To argue about why a champion you don't **ever** play as **or** against shouldn't be nerfed? Why do **you** care? Where are your grounds for even making a valid argument? You have none. I digress. Lucian's kit puts him in an awkward position... You can't nerf him that much without really hurting him, but right now his damage output with minimal effort is just unparalleled, the only exceptions being Graves and Miss Fortune who could also use a step back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-02-06T09:22:51.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does alot of damage too... don;t forget that.
