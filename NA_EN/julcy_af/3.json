It seems that your balance team does not take action until the boards continually complain about champions and since the majority of the people on the boards on silver they do not see how abusive and exploitable gangplank and jhin really are while not being that difficult of champions to play. Look at previous actual high skill champions {{champion:238}} and {{champion:268}}, both of these champs are honestly trash now there is no reason to play them over the meta mids who are easier to play with greater pay off.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-07-26T03:51:58.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Jhin is balanced. He is immobile when ulting and easily assassinated. Get a {{item:3082}} and he loses like 20% of his damage. Even more if {{item:3143}} and he has some crit, which is every 4th shot.","replies":[{"poster":"JUlCY AF","date":"2016-07-26T04:28:39.386+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"No offense but I cannot take anything you say seriously. GP and Jhin are extremely exploitable especially in higher levels of play. You have about 650 ranked games stuck in silver as a support main. Your adc winrates are extremely poor except for Jhin at a 65% WR.

Use to be Jinx until her nerfs. And to be fair, you can not carry a team as the support, like 98% of the time. Also most of my games are/were soloQ. Up until about 1-2 months ago, I very rarely premade with others. But I also only play ranked, save for the few times I am  premade with someone or waiting for their game to end. Earlier this season, DQ was a nightmare for soloQ layers if you remember. So I took time off of adc and went to support or top to try a new angle.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AstÃ´lfo","date":"2016-07-27T23:48:38.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> calling GP and Jhin not hard to play\nlmao okay bud.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-07-26T23:12:26.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"skillcap does not dictate balance","replies":[]},{"poster":"theonlyaustin","date":"2016-07-26T05:20:15.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude.
