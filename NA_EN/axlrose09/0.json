I won't load into game and my only option is to restart my computer completely. This has been happening for a few days now and I've tried reinstalling League but no use. \r\nI'm also on a Mac, I've downloaded macOS Sierra but it worked fine the first day I had it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T21:36:40.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a network issue that's failing to establish comms with the game server, which would result in black screens like this.
