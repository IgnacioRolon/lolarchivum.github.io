I'm not sure why this kept happening, but no matter how many times I selected \"Reconnect\", the same thing kept happening. \r\n\r\nSo I tried uninstalling and re-installing the game, and it finally worked last night. However when logging back into the game tonight to play a match, the game yet again started to crash. At this point I tried troubleshooting the client itself and I tried clearing my computer to see if it was just the excess clutter in my PC that might have been slowing the computer itself down. However, none of these worked. I checked my Firewall and that didn't seem to be causing the issue either. \r\n\r\nThis is getting pretty frustrating so if anyone can help me that would be really great. \r\n\r\nMuch appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"coreaneggroll","date":"2016-12-31T02:49:06.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this means anything, this was based off of my last R3D report.\n\n000005.332|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::IO::OpenFile: RADS cannot open file \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.155/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\" because it's not in the manifest.\n000005.332|  ERROR| Missing file on r3dGFile open :C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.155/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\n000005.332|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::IO::OpenFile: RADS cannot open file \"\\Bin\\Data\\C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.155/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\" because it's not in the manifest.\n000005.333|  ERROR| Missing file on r3dGFile open :\\Bin\\Data\\C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.155/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml","replies":[{"poster":"FikiFiki","date":"2017-01-01T01:30:00.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also reinstalled yesterday and it started working again.
