Squishy supports are getting nerfed while their tankier counterparts are still amazing. Jungle and Support gold income are still unimpressive. Jungle XP is ridiculously low. Champs who has so many free stats or multiple effects on a single skill and so many more issues that are so blatant right now.\r\n\r\nIt feels like the balance team is playing a different game than us. They even admitted that Lee and Zed are really strong, and yet they nerf Sona again. Their goal was to have a more diverse jungle, but they increase the cost of the jungling item, punishing the squishy/tanky junglers who cleared a lot slower than the AD/bruiser or junglers with sustain.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS HAPPENING \r\n\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-01-29T19:51:03.210+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":36,"body":">Now it feels like, the jungle is super unfair cause only a handful of champs can excel in it, \n\nThank Fearless for the jungle changes, *and* the Sona rework to boot.

It only seems like really negative posts get the attention of rioters while threads asking what's going on in earnest are all ignored.\n\nMore specifically I'm concerned about all these mana nerfs to make mana a resource in lane instead of just spamming spells when they have blue. Fair enough and yet there are older champs that have been completely forgotten that have had that mana gate in out dated mana costs for years such as Anivia and Swain that have been hit hardest of all. There hasn't been a rioter that has talked about these types of champions and it worries me. I really wish there was a way to get a response even if it's \"oh we should check that out.\" I mean it's just assurance that yeah they're looking into those old champs that no one plays anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2015-01-29T22:22:49.697+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":6,"body":"That is a really fair desire, and is exactly the sort of dialog I'd like to have more.

We recently shipped the small update to Anivia's Q visuals to help her have some better feedback on her threat range. Not a huge change, but want to point out that we are constantly thinking about ways to make those champs a little kinder to the players that love them, even when there are bigger changes needed for them down the line.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WooBeeWoo","date":"2015-01-29T22:06:06.990+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":23,"body":"Love how the only thing I've seen you respond to is someone potentially misquoting you.

Mid is a copy and paste of five champs and for some reason the balance team thinks adding mobility will help diversity. (RIP Ahri)\n\nThis season is honestly the absolute worst i've ever seen the game in, it actually does not require a brain to itemize an AD champion the only thing note worthy is if you are ranged or melee. Mid laners have to brain storm an hour and a half to think about what is the most productive way to use two spells before running oom for items or having no damage for buying a tear.

Otherwise Elder Scrolls Online would still have 1+million plus subs and not be going F2P as all predicted.\n2.  \"Meta\" is relative, and more of an illusionary concept then reality.  The \"meta\" exists because others think it does.  Kinda like money.  Or Government.\n3.  A \"business perspective\" is about making customers happy.  We are the customers.  IF we are not happy we are far likely to spend time in LoL, buy micro-transacions, and new players will \"stay away from evil MOBAs\".  So yes our opinions, whether justified or not, do matter, and must be addressed AND resolved.\n\nWhat \"would I do to fix the game?\" you ask?  Not including champion-specific issues:\n\n1.  Remove concept of \"last hits\"... make gold locally shared or otherwise (few ways to go about it) but don't allow minions to \"last hit\" or otherwise KS laning phase.  Game needs to be more about trading between champions and not just AFK farming for 10 min.  This concept is especially true in LCS whereas both sides basically agree to not attack each other without a gank and just farm the whole time.\n2.  Jungle needs to be far easier.  Jungler needs to be more fed then rest of team at early game and thus a bigger threat because the jungler has no purpose late game... and with current jungle he probably isn't even a threat to your lane (if you either ward/guess correctly) of course unless he is {{champion:64}} .  Otherwise Top lane is usually most fed first, then mid, then bot, then jungler.\n3.  Boost gold for kills/assists; lower gold for minions.  This can be time adjusted as to not affect late game farming (if losing team is pushed and farming only way to survive).  You shouldn't be able to \"outfarm your way\" out of a good kill as is commonly done if you watch gold scores in LCS.  The effort it takes to make a kill is far greater then effort to AFK farm.\n4.  Get rid of {{item:3026}} \n5.  Make {{summoner:1}} remove EVERYTHING like {{item:3140}} .  Right now the \"current meta\" only includes a few of the total number of summoner's skills.  The others need to be buffed.\n6.  Boost defence of inhibiter/nexus turrets.  Right now they are far to easy to seige down in even 5v4 situations if you take out the right target.  This game allows a slightly ahead team to push too aggresively especially late game at full build.  The turrets don't even cause damage.  Counterplay to this is items such as {{item:3056}} \n7.  Create new item slot used only for potions.\n8.  Buff {{item:3340}} and its upgrades so it can be a viable (if not entirely) replacement to {{item:2049}} .  Warding shouldn't take up a viable slot, nor should it be relagated to only supports.  If \"too many wards\" are on the map then items can be adjusted thereof.\n\n\nThere are problably some others I have to try to remember everything but yes.. there is like 139471043 7 things that can be done to change nature of game.  Point is RIOT just goes about it the wrong way every time.\n\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-01-30T15:26:33.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Companies do \"research\".

Otherwise Elder Scrolls Online would still have 1+million plus subs and not be going F2P as all predicted.\n\nElder Scrolls Online is a completely different game and was doomed to fail from the beginning because it was up against an already extremely popular game (WOW).  They couldn't even come close to the amount of success that WOW has and it flopped.  It was a great idea, but it was already too late to implement.\n\nCompanies do research, but it's not always going to be about what you want specifically.  How many people do you think play this game?  Just the amount of people in the boards?  \n\n> \"Meta\" is relative, and more of an illusionary concept then reality. The \"meta\" exists because others think it does. Kinda like money. Or Government.\n\nAh.  You're one of those people.  The meta may be relative, but it is the best representation of the game.  There are multiple ways to play the game, but this way seems to work out the best and people like it.  You can play the game however you want (duo top w/ no jungler, duo jungle, duo mid, whatever you want), but you can't deny that the majority of the community plays this way on this map because it is the best and most strategic way to play that specific map.  Again, the only way you can change up the \"meta\" is to play a different game style or play with your friends in a custom game or have a 5 man team ready to all play the way you would like to play.\n\nMoney and government are not relative.  It needs to exist.\n\n> A \"business perspective\" is about making customers happy. We are the customers. IF we are not happy we are far likely to spend time in LoL, buy micro-transacions, and new players will \"stay away from evil MOBAs\". So yes our opinions, whether justified or not, do matter, and must be addressed AND resolved.\n\n\nA business perspective is partially about making customers happy.  It is also about testing out different things (PBE) and getting feedback.  The PBE is where they test out all of their ideas with a limited scope of players.  The one's who provide a rational opinion rather than bring in the pitchforks and torches.  A lot of the opinions on here are definitely not justified.  They are the product of angry whiny teenage angst and very few give opinions in a calm fashion.  Too many in this community are toxic when they complain.  Y'all remind me of Dudley from Harry Potter.\n\n\n\n\n\nI never said \"fix the game\"  I said \"change the game\", like change the way it is played.  Way to go off topic, but here you go:\n\n\n> Remove concept of \"last hits\"... make gold locally shared or otherwise (few ways to go about it) but don't allow minions to \"last hit\" or otherwise KS laning phase. Game needs to be more about trading between champions and not just AFK farming for 10 min. This concept is especially true in LCS whereas both sides basically agree to not attack each other without a gank and just farm the whole time.\n\nThis takes strategy out of the game.  Why bother having minions in the game, then?  Just have a continuous gold income.  It just sounds like you are wanting to not think about decisions and tactics.  \n\n> Jungle needs to be far easier. Jungler needs to be more fed then rest of team at early game and thus a bigger threat because the jungler has no purpose late game... and with current jungle he probably isn't even a threat to your lane (if you either ward/guess correctly) of course unless he is  . Otherwise Top lane is usually most fed first, then mid, then bot, then jungler.\n\nI don't see why everyone thinks the jungle is so hard?  Is it because everyone was so used to having it easy with more pots and being able to stay in longer for your first run through?  I am not a jung main, but played it last night and had no issues with my clear.  I made it from toad over to wolves, recall, then other side and gank.  What is so difficult about it?  Is it just that some are having a harder time (Eve)?  I played with amumu and I kept up pretty well.  Sure I was more behind, but I also get the buffs from the jung to help me out when I come in for a gank.  If you were to say anything, I would say make it so they are more on par with lanes by giving a bit more xp/gold, but they should definitely NOT be the most fed early game.  \n\nThey are also not useless late game.  Have you not seen the most recent changes they did to Jungler items?  You can now smite enemy champs for damage and other debuffs.  They are most certainly not useless.\n\n> Boost gold for kills/assists; lower gold for minions. This can be time adjusted as to not affect late game farming (if losing team is pushed and farming only way to survive). You shouldn't be able to \"outfarm your way\" out of a good kill as is commonly done if you watch gold scores in LCS. The effort it takes to make a kill is far greater then effort to AFK farm.\n\nIf someone is AFK, then that is not the problem of the player that IS there farming.  Again, yo uare taking strategy out of the game by making it \"fair for everyone\".  You are doing what Mario Kart mothers did to the new MK.  Everyone has to finish the race before it ends instead of just ending even if 12th place is a lap behind PLUS giving 12th place a point because \"oh my son didn't get a point and he should to make him feel better\".  You are babying the players because some people are AFK.  You should be able to outfarm someone and have the gold to show it because you were better at CSing than your opponent.  It helps show who is the better player.  \n\n\n> Get rid of {{item:3026}} \n\nI could see this one.  A lot of people buy it for their main source of defense, though.  I could see maybe nerfing either the passive or the stats a bit, too, so as to keep it in the game instead of getting rid of it completely.  No explanation from you as to why getting rid of it so can't really counter why you think this.\n\n> Make {{summoner:1}}  remove EVERYTHING like  {{item:3140}}. Right now the \"current meta\" only includes a few of the total number of summoner's skills. The others need to be buffed.\n\nThere have been...talks...about reworking summoner spells.  Nothing is set in stone.  I don't think removing them is the answer.  Maybe increase the CD for them so they can't be used basically every team fight.  \n\n> Boost defence of inhibiter/nexus turrets. Right now they are far to easy to seige down in even 5v4 situations if you take out the right target. This game allows a slightly ahead team to push too aggresively especially late game at full build. The turrets don't even cause damage. Counterplay to this is items such as {{item:3056}} \n\nAgain, you are babying the losing team.  You are making me think that you lose a lot with all of these benefits for a losing team.  They are losing.  They are not the better of the teams.  They CAN come back and win by farming, but it's a battle.  In a real war, do you think the little guy can come up with money or get better defenses?  Not likely.  It takes strategy and teamwork.  \n\n> Create new item slot used only for potions.\n\n........no\n\n> Buff {{item:3340}} and its upgrades so it can be a viable (if not entirely) replacement to {{item:2049}} . Warding shouldn't take up a viable slot, nor should it be relagated to only supports. If \"too many wards\" are on the map then items can be adjusted thereof.\n\nAgain, no.  It should take a viable slot.  It is a strategic item in the game that should take up a slot.  I could see buffing sightstone, but not the trinkets.  They are supposed to be slightly weaker.  If everyone were to upgrade their trinket in game like they are supposed to, you could have the entire map lit up.  But it should not replace sightstone.\n\n\nFrom my perspective of what you have describe, you are all about babying the losing team.

I'd much rather focus my time on the game's problems and making the game better for every player.\n\nFearless, I appreciate your boldness walking into a firestorm like this. And I know you're under tons of pressure from all directions with regards to design. And I realise you've got a huge load of work on your plate, and that the community feedback is just as often uselessly unhelpful as it is helpful.\n\nYou are a leader. You are a Rioter that people look up to. People will make degrading comments, people will misinterpret information, people will  question your motives. And as both an Eagle Scout and as the \"leader\" so to speak of a nationally recognized ethics debate team (since everyone else graduated, I'm now in position to help get everybody on the team currently up to speed), I can understand how bad it feels when a statement made is derogatory towards you, whether it be from simple miscommunication, or opposition to a stance, or simply nothing aside from unpopularity with the crowd. Granted, none of these are on the same scale as a multi-million dollar company, but I can sympathise with how it feels to a certain extent.\n\nHowever, these are the burdens of being a leader. And a leader's job, as you've said so many times, isn't necessarily to be popular, or to be perfect, or to even make 100% certain that he's interpreted correctly by the people he leads. Granted, these are all goals and pluses, but they aren't the core purpose of leaders. However, one of the core aspects of being a leader is being able to communicate with those that follow you. Yes, it means there will be criticism. It means there will be opposition. \n\nWhat's important to understand from a leader's perspective, though, isn't that people hate you making posts and hate that you're posting to us. People may dislike the content you post, but despite the downvotes on posts, and despite the criticism, I guarantee that you will never encounter a post that reads, \"Fearless, stop posting on the forums.\" Criticism of content is inevitable, but communication between a leader and his followers is necessary and of utmost importance, despite being very time consuming. Giving an unpopular opinion is one thing; these opinions may indeed be for the better of the whole despite the cries of the few.  However, leaving a group of followers in the dark, wondering, is an entirely different beast.\n\nAs leaders, we are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the whole mechanism. As leaders, this means making sometimes incredibly controversial decisions. There will never be unanimity with regards to anything that requires a decision to be made. But as leaders, it is our job to inform those we lead about the decisions we've made and why we've chosen to make those decisions, regardless of the recoil we may receive.\n\nIn the end, the entire community is aware that you are acting in the community's best interest, even if it doesn't appear to be so from the initial feedback. Most of the crew here understands not all changes can happen immediately, but people are impatient. It's part of the human problem. Just be patient with the community, be a leader, and realise that even if we \"boo\" your content as it stands when it first is released, we truly appreciate the fact you cared to post and give us context about changes.\n\nWe are on your side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-01-29T23:39:38.718+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, Fearless, this is mostly just pedantic, but when I hear that a rioter is 'talking to everyone' I assume they're replying back, and your last post in that thread was 15 hours ago.

Being misrepresented can be annoying, but if you present yourself logically and people take the time to read your posts, there will emerge useful discussion on the topic and maybe even support for your changes.\n\nI don't know who was behind the changes to Ahri, for example, but I think they also did a poor job in explaining any reasoning to us.  It seems Ahri was changed from an assassin into a mage because \"Thats how we want her to be\" and I saw nothing mentioning her on these forums aside from the small quip in the DFG removal post.  It made me angry to see her archetype change for seemingly no reason, and while her new version is quite fun and powerful, I still have a hard time enjoying her because of how little whomever was in charge seemed to care about her as an assassin and that huge aspect of her identity.  It left me bitter.  And while I may have disagreed if someone came on here and posted logically why they changed her into a mage, at least I would feel better about the end result if they had.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2015-01-29T21:44:09.313+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly that 100g change was unneeded.\nthe chilling smite and sabre nerfs were needed (and imo chilling smite should be weaker like 15-10% MS steal instead of 20% but thats another conversation)\n\nI think the new jungle is an interesting start.\nBut I also think its far too taxing on the weaker clearing junglers.\nI have alot of issues clearing as eve in particular for example.\nMost the champions with a shield or percentage damage are perfectly fine.\nthe hp on these monsters is high so its very useful for someone like j4 or shyvana.\n\nI'm not saying buff eve I'm saying you need to consider alot of champions that don't have percentage damage and have poor sustain already.\nYes obviously buffs mean the stronger ones get stronger.\nBut thats fine.\nThe more picks you can have the better.\nyou guys want diversity? \n\nwell here you go.\n\nyou guys need to really jack up the exp+ gold gained.\nyou take so much damage and gain very little.\n\nI honestly went from 100% to 40% fighting the second spawn of wraiths one game as eve despite having armor boots and the tier 2 purple smite \n\nIts redickulous the amopunt of damage you take.\nI think alot of the attack speeds on the camps should be lowered if they're going to hit hard make them hit less often.\nYou'll still take damage but it will be slower.\nI think that would help even out the champions with a weaker clear time then others.\nLike rammus right now is really hurting same with alot of the tanks tbh.\n\nthe mana issues are a thing but I think if you guys added a bit more gain per camp on mana refunding on killing camps that could help as well.\n\nYou guys did alot of interesting things.\nthe issue is you're not fixing it up you're leaving it for months on end.\ngotta be quicker and more decisive.\nNot everyone loves the changes.\nBut something is better than nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"IronChefBoyardee","date":"2015-01-29T21:47:25.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you kill the small wraiths (er razorbeaks w/e) first? that's the trick to that camp, they do just as much as the big guy almost. kill them first and you'll be alright.","replies":[{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2015-01-29T21:50:01.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is eve's Q honestly it has the Ai of a gragas IRL.\n\nIt will target 1 minion in the middle of nowhere isntead of what you're auto attacking.\nIt should prioritize the enemy being auto attacked always this allows you to position the camp better next time.\nThere are work arounds to this like kiting the camp a little to line up the smaller ones better.\nBut it shouldn't be a hastle to make it work and regardless the amount of damage per camp does not equal out when you're gaining little to no exp and hardly any gold for the damage taken.\n\nThis applies to every champion.\nIf I lose 300~ hp a camp I should be gaining 70-200 gold(obviously this would scale)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-01-29T23:13:13.041+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The links are from what you said.
