It's still a bad matchup, but it becomes impossible if you play passive.\n\nTrivializing mana as a mechanic sounds pretty good when the flavour of the season has been resourceless/energy(lol) champs (such as Zed, surprise surprise). \"But but they get to ignore their mana after buying one item\" sounds ridiculous until you consider the VERY large proportion of in-meta champs who get to start buying damage or resistances instead immediately. Nerfing mana regen and shitting on mages, many of whom are also immobile, is just another example of Riot's balance team not knowing what game they're playing. (The correct answer was to BUFF immobile mages, but that might hurt the adc's ability to right click to win so it'll never happen.)\n\n Also, seriously? Right click Zed, eat a shuriken and maybe a shadow+aa if he feels like it. That sounds like a trade in Lux's favor. Just because she isn't Sona squishy doesn't mean she isn't like #2 or #3. Lux vs Zed is a pretty good example of several different ways this game is currently slipping off the rails; mobility heavily favored (and Lux's ms gets a nerf, bravo, Riot!), no resources celebrated while resources punished, skillshots rewarding less than point and click. Lux can play perfectly and still get outfarmed and outroamed due to Zed's inability to leave lane, whereas the slightest misstep on her part is an instant, practically auto-scripted death. Meanwhile, getting a kill on Zed requires several mistakes on his part thanks to not being the squishiest squishy who ever squished AND get out of jail free cards. (You trapped him under turret with a binding. Great. Now he's out at half health and you're probably dead anyway.) It's POSSIBLE to win it, I've certainly done it, but two brain cells in Zed's head to rub together and any Lux is going to have an awful time being forced to choose between building mana regen to not have to back every three minutes and Armguard to not instantly disintegrate at 6 (but still back a whole bunch). \n ~Uiru","replies":[{"poster":"Unironic SJW","date":"2015-01-08T23:31:59.767+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"buffing immobile mages so that fizz/zed/akali/etc are played less is a nerf to adcs\"\n\nok","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-08T21:37:49.884+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Uiru,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7tkEUggF,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-08T21:19:12.494+0000)\n>\n> Trivializing mana as a mechanic sounds pretty good when the flavour of the season has been resourceless/energy(lol) champs (such as Zed, surprise surprise).\n\nThe correct solution here isn't allowing everyone to ignore resources and spam abilities.\n\nIt's making every resource mechanic a reasonably balanced limiter on ability use.\n\n>  Also, seriously?

However Annie is the exception. Her q+w can actually wave clear insanely fast. Her q alone will push it decently if you are concern about her mana. Add a Teleport instead of your flash (don't forget to ward) and you can roam quite as much as any other assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-01-08T21:37:50.986+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not taking flash on Annie?

I feel like mages need an item like QSS, with armor, that stacks into an AP item in the end.
