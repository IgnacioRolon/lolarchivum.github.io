Off-topic, I know, but indulge me for a moment, please; Fiora got changed basically thanks to her kit focusing too much on her ultimate, yes?

He dodges a skill with his Q and maybe blocks another one with E if he's smart, but other than that you get to put damage on him because the bulk of his DPS is just AAing. \n\nWhereas old fiora was basically get a tiamat and abuse the fact that you can get 5 procs of it with every ult. \nI.E. while she could run at people and AA them, she couldn't do it for any extended duration so was much more about landing 1-2 decent AAs and then ulting... preferably into a bait ball so the tiamat procs will do work.\nSo in her case, a good portion of her DPS was done during her ult where she could not be touched. \n\nNow, we can talk about AP yi.

Which, as a fan of the old Fiora, I consider highly unfair treatment. \nBut, and this is my point, my beliefs on this may be biased and incorrect due to a lack of knowledge on how the two abilities really works, and if there actually are differences (albeit subtle ones).","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-03-21T19:45:56.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the question that is important is not what the technical differences are, but rather:\n\na. how much can you do, if you do not have access to this ability? Do you have a follow up to after it ends? do you have a setup that you can/need to do before you use it? Is there anything Mr Yi. is good for, outside of alpha strike?\n\nb. how much are you getting done, while being in the untargetable state? Is it a bit of damage and a dodged skill and after that you need to have some good follow up, or have you just won the team fight  right there? Are you doing the equivalent of a single AOE skill in damage, or are you fully DPSing whilst being CC-immune? \n\nTechnically alpha strike and blade waltz are similar but not identical. Blade waltz procs on-hits and interacts with AA modifiers including defensive ones (yes shen's circle will completely delete blade waltz's effect), alpha strike is pure damage. I think Blade waltz also \"waits out\" momentary untargetability effects instad of canceling, and it doesn't reset firoa's position if it cancels or kills target. \n\nFiora has one thing that is a problem in her kit. Her \"gameplay fantasy\" is me>you. Which is something you can't ever really give regardless of \"oh she's supposed to be a duelist\". \n\nOld fiora i think lacked distinction. What was she aside from her ult? another Irelia? another Xin? take their ults and put them on the bench, what difference do they have? New fiora has low CD dashes and she has a spell shield so she's not Xin Zhau with a different ult.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-03-21T17:19:21.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2017-03-21T21:07:40.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lulu W is also extremely buggy from what I have seen from playing her straight the past week or so.
