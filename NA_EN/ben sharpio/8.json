This buff is in relation to the item: {{item:3800}}. It&#039;s one of my most favorite items to build for its passive. One thing i wish was for Sion to have more of an interaction with it. \r\n\r\nThe buff i ask for is for Sion to be able to activate it&#039;s passive while he ults. Why? I think this would be a great addition for Sion because if you jungle him (like i do), you would initially gank with his ult. With that being said, as you zoom by your teammates, they may not have the same movement speed or mobility to catch up once he hits the target. A good example of this would be with {{champion:222}} {{champion:202}} ect. \r\n\r\nI feel that if he was able to activate the righteous glory passive while ulting, it would add for a stellar engage in team fights and ganks and give him a well deserved buff of some sort. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"VictoryDance96","date":"2016-02-03T15:02:03.346+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this happened, MRW I see a team with Sion:\n\nhttps://nypdecider.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/jurassic-world-dinosaurs.gif\n\nhttp://images.memes.com/meme/425319","replies":[{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2016-02-03T15:09:15.311+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/a24e1e15c4c2f3703206473b5b871071/tumblr_njm54pDT9v1qhz95yo1_500.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2016-02-03T15:03:46.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahahaha!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2016-02-03T17:52:12.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":48,"body":"Too strong.
