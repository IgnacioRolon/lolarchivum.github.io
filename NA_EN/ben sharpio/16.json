So to be honest he's in a good spot . The only problems I see is \n\n1. His passive is almost useless after level 2. It's good for early 1 for 1 trades or for when you invade and die early and just go HAM. But other that that late game you just use it to suck up so cc and most of the time if your dead that early odds are your losing that team fight.\n\n2 his w Early game. His w early game is almost a joke. It's can barley tank a few caster minions . It'll probably eat 1 champ basic attack and it's done the shield early needs a buff maybe make it bigger early the 3 second wait is ok but at least let me tank something lol.\n\nOther than those two things Sion is great and I plan to main him again this season. Oh yea and remember when they were gonna make it so when he killed so body while ulting he would keep running ?
