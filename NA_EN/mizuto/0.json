While the current system is somewhat effective at punishing those who are toxic, it is NOT effective at deterring toxicity in the first place. In order for punishment to work, it must have two features: **swiftness **and **certainty**.  The current report function has neither of those features. It is uncertain whether someone you report will get banned. Additionally, the person may not get banned until days or even weeks later. That is not swift.\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are meant to BUILD ON the current system, not replace it.\n\n**Remedy**: With enough reports from enough -separate- games, give the reported player a temporary time ban. This allows the player to have a cool down period. You are removing the player from the stimuli that causes negative behavior. You're also preventing him from carrying that behavior to additional games in the same day, creating a domino effect that breeds more toxicity.\n\nNext, work on a system of REWARDS. This is crucial and severely lacking in League of Legends. Players are usually reported for negative behavior after a game, but if that same player displays teamwork and positive behavior--nothing really happens. Yes, there is a way to honor players but that system is hugely dysfunctional. You need a ridiculous amount of honors before you get a tiny strand next to your portrait. It is not a good enough reward for good behavior. Again, swiftness and certainty still apply here.\n\n**Remedy**: With enough positive behaviors in enough -separate- games, provide the player with an IP bonus. Money is one of the greatest reinforcers in real life. IP is also a good reinforcer because it is a currency that can be exchanged for other things. **Take advantage of this!** Something as little as +20 IP (Influence points) a game for positive behavior can make a HUGE difference. This bonus can be taken away if a player gets reported by multiple people in -separate- games.\n\nNotice how I keep saying separate games. That is because you don't want a single game to affect a player. The current punishment system does this well. Build on this. \n\nI am sure there are plenty of other ways to reward players and promote positive behavior. Let's brainstorm and make League of Legends one of the best communities that we can.\n\nPlease provide CONSTRUCTIVE criticism after reading AND understanding this post. Show me that understanding by paraphrasing it in your post. If you feel obligated to post daft one-liners, do not expect a reply from me.","replies":[]}
