Heck, Brand even has the 12th highest win rate out of the 28 supports. \n\nFor me, since Brand only has a skillshot stun in his kit, I like to play him with ADCs that also have crowd control like slows or stuns. {{champion:202}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:22}} are the first three that comes to mind. He also works well into squishy supports, and struggles against initiators. Long story short, like every champion, he thrives in certain match-ups and struggles in others.\n\nAs for the lack of crowd control, I find that {{item:3116}} and {{item:3030}} are good at protecting that weakness. Rylai's is a given, and since my damage spreads to other targets so do my slow. I would buy RoA if I was going mid, but GLP-800 gives me similar stats and a way to land my skills easier on close targets. Of course, {{item:2301}} and cooldown boots are also essential for Brand support.\n\nTo wrap it up, let me summarize; Brand has a place in the bot lane just as much as he has a place mid lane. Just because a champion doesn't technically 'support' the ADC doesn't mean that it's bad. Let Brand's win rate of 50.75% tell you such.

I refuse to refer to him as a support because he is a goddamn carry even in a \"support\" role due to his huge damage output even without items, which is a problem, it is one of the reasons why vel'koz support was once really popular and too good.\n\nBrand is simply too strong as a support and he is simply a mage.\n\nI am honestly tired or seeing mages on bot lane, because they fuck up the conventional supports and take their roles.

The NEW player guide that actually is better for new players on the website) states that a mage's common positions include mid lane AND support.\n\nPlus, if you find that you can't beat Brand as Bard (which, if Brand plays around your stuns, would be normal since Brand counters Bard), then play someone like Leona or Alistar, who can jump on Brand and lock him down. Or play away from Brand; his skill shots (Q and W) can be easily avoided if you are aware.\n\nAnd if his stun and slows (with items) aren't enough for cc, how about death?\n\nCuz death is the best CC.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-12-05T17:55:44.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, mages can play in the support role!

Not even lux or goddamn annie approach that kind of damage without their ultimates up.\n\nHowever brand can easily pull his combo off (Because using e-q is not a hard thing to do, so please don't try to show it as if it the slowest projectile ever, because it isnt). And he can poke heavily with his w, which hurts shitloads and is easy to hit because the enemy adc HAS to farm.\n\nWhen a \"support\" can almost solo kill an adc in around 2 seconds, THERE IS A PROBLEM. And even lockdown supports dont do shit, because guess what, their initiation will be stopped with his e-q (Which will be even ieaser to hit because the enemy is coming to him), and he can just simply focus and kill the adc because he will outdamage any lockdown support.\n\nIf riot wants him to support, then they have to adjust him to the role, because having a \"support\" that can nearly solo kill your adc with 1 combo, is not fun gameplay.\n\nI read your comment, but unlike nay other mages i am not accepting a \"support\" that does as much supporting as a top lane nasus ganking.
