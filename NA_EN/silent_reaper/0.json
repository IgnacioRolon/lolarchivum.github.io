Well talking over your point we can notice that Skarner doesn't fullfil the requierements to be a Juggernaut, he is not inmmobile at all, his W plus shrines makes him fast enough, he is high durability but he doesn't lack of heavy cc, his R is the most powerful cc a supress, his E is a slow that after a basic attack turns into a stun, he is no a threat in terms of damage right now is the jungle that deals less damage, so maybe I'm confused or you are wrong with the definition of juggernaut or riot made a huge mistake with Skarner class at defined him as a Juggernaut, because for me IMO he was a tank and still being a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2016-04-16T15:30:43.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said that including him in the juggernaut update was a mistake.

But I find him to be quite useful for a range of things other than killing enemies. For example, my favorite thing to do as Sion in top late is to rush Zz'rot first, then get tiamat. When these are done, you just lay zzrot behind tower, and farm. If your lane opponent leaves, you just shove it and gank mid or bot with ulti, then return to lane with TP.\nThen go into Titanic Hydra, and tank items to follow. \n\n\nIn late game, its all about spliting a side lane with zzrot then forcing a teamfight with ulti. If you farm proper with Sion, usually, Titanic will give you that extra damage edge you need, and more so, When Zz'rot kills a minion, you get the gold and passive HP stack from it.\n\nSion also is a late game super-tank. So early is not supposed to be easy for him, but that doesn't stop you from being dominant.
