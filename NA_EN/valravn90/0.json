Please check the log for more information.\" Has anyone come across this error and got past it or is it now impossible to put your client in Korean?

I'm obviously from OCE and our only \"supported\" language is English and yet I can change to every language except for Korean and the Garena languages. It seems the \"supported languages\" have more to do with what servers Riot has control over.","replies":[{"poster":"NA Wolfrick","date":"2017-07-31T17:39:07.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akuen,realm=OCE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=w3E4M3h3,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-05-03T00:35:29.886+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s interesting you say something that&#x27;s blatantly false.

I have a friend that moved from Korea and she wants to learn the game but it's extremely difficult when she can't even set it to her native language. She hardly knows what anything says. {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
