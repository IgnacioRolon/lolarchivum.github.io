And thanks for your time._\n\nThis is going to be about the psychological \"bandwagon\" effect of the boards community. For instance, lets say a new post received two down votes within the first 10 minutes. Everyone else will already have a subjective attitude towards the post, either creating less traffic by not clicking on the post, or by furthering the downvotes. Even if the idea was good, the first 20 that viewed the post and two disliked, it will dictate the future of the post. Same thing happens with upvotes too, it will create a snowball effect. What this means is that a select group of people, usually the first 20-50 readers will create a bandwagon effect. For example, if a meme or gameplay post has no up votes or downvotes, the post is looked at objectively. On the other hand, a post with 4 downvotes will create this perception that &quot;This post has downvotes, so whatever is on it must mean its bad.&quot; Although, **if you take the same exact post**, and put 10 likes on it with your alternate accounts, it will create the opposite perception. This is why sometimes you read a post with some downvotes on it, then read the same post from another well-respected individual that blows up with over 100 upvotes. How do I think this can be fixed? Hide the upvotes/downvotes for the first hour and replace it with a (?). What this will do is it allows everyone to dictate the post by themselves and not let a couple downvotes discourage an upvote. It also fixes how the first 20-50 readers do not dictate whether the post dies or blows up to over 5k readers. If you don&#039;t think this solution would work, tell me why.\n\nAlso posted this in Boards Feedback. It fits well in both categories but since _Boards Community & Moderation_ is a new category, I thought it would be best to bring this topic up in it first.","replies":[{"poster":" Milla Jovovich","date":"2017-05-11T20:24:49.256+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"I see your name around... \n\nHave an upvote amigo\n\nWon't read this essay tho","replies":[{"poster":"Metallmeister","date":"2017-05-11T20:31:37.171+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks, but that's another reason to have (?) upvotes for the first hour.

Already saw few topics (and couple of mine comments) being initially downvoted but then more traffic happened around specific hours and the post that was -3 a while ago is suddenly +15.\n\nAnyway, I had an idea of simply separating downvotes from upvotes. Upvotes would start with 1 and would be seen and you could either ignore or upvote, giving the post more credit. In case you found the post bad, either because it was offensive, non-contributing or contra-productive, you could give it downvote where you would just see whether you downvoted or not but wouldn't see how much downvotes the post already has. The downvotes would be hidden and only work in the background for tresholds. For example, at 10 DV it would be displayed in list of topics/comments with less priority, at 40 DV it would get hidden etc.\n\nI don't think the time-based hiding would work perfectly as most of local readers are NA and so you would only get the right result at specific hours when most people are likely to be here and judge the topic before the votes are shown. This hurts (or leaves with no effect) those in different timeline or people who like to post in non-traditional times.\n\nBUT NA is still majority that should dictate and it would work, not perfectly, but would work, so in case no better solution would be found, I support this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-06-08T16:06:03.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree with this, a trial period for any new thread could go a long way towards preventing it from being dead on arrival just because of an initial downvote. However, I don't think that will fully address the larger bandwagon effect, which is that some topics are just more popular than others. If a thread goes on in Gameplay that makes a witty joke bashing Lee Sin/Yasuo/whichever champion is unpopular at the moment, even if its upvotes are hidden it's still very likely to get dozens of upvotes within the first few hours, and shoot to the front page after that. Similarly, a thread making a well-reasoned argument about a point people disagree with (let's say someone wants Sion to be reworked, for example) might still get buried simply because people in general will want to shoot it down, even if they don't see its score. This could help alleviate issues with the Boards' upvote system, but this might be more of a band-aid than a full solution in itself.","replies":[]}]}
