I&#039;m perfectly fine with that. I&#039;ll also admit that I&#039;m a one(three rather, but you get the point) trick pony, which of course would make succeeding as other champs very difficult. I&#039;ve put myself through hell today trying to get crates because I have five keys stockpiled away (as in actual keys, not just fragments), and since Normals are apparently fucked up as far as I can tell, I&#039;m being matched up with people three times my skill level.\r\n\r\nI understand the thought process behind wanting people to play different champs, but if I try again and again to have a good game with them, and end up constantly either failing that and getting a C+ or lower, or getting carried and only getting a B, I&#039;m going to end up just not bothering with it. I&#039;m hoping that in the future, for next season or whatever, Riot will consider making the hextech crate distributions a little more lenient, so that I can be able to experiment with other champs, while also not torturing myself playing fifty games of that one champ just to get a crate.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-15T10:50:08.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to get boxes is to pair up with somebody who has a champion they can regularly get Ss on.
