That can make for a somewhat easier learning environment. Having said that though ranked as a newly level 30 player can be pretty challenging and a lot of people will recommend learning a few champs for a couple of roles fairly well before diving into ranked (with appropriate rune/mastery pages set up too).","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2016-01-19T16:15:56.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great advice^^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"PDE5 Inhibitors","date":"2016-01-19T16:14:01.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not anymore.
