Should there be a tutorial specifically for it?\r\n\r\nThis is sort of a branch from the last thread I made, but as I went through the toil of leveling my first account up, one of the hardest concepts for me to grasp was jungling. Laning was easy enough, just CS and win your lane. Support was kind of like that too, except for the need to provide vision and support your teammates. I think that jungling requires much more game sense than all the other roles, when it comes to knowing what buffs to get, how to control your jungle, drags/baron etc. and when, where and how to gank. It all seems very overwhelming, which is why I suppose most people in my last thread said that gating smite at level 10 is a good idea. But I think it would be easy to become complacent with top/mid/ADC if that was the case. I think it would be worthwhile for Riot to make an updated-ish tutorial telling people about the basics of jungling. What do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-26T23:55:26.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This falls under the same problem the rest of the tutorial update has.  Its just not the priority right now.  Riot can only focus on so many things at one time and there is already such a large library of high quality tutorial material on youtube and with practice mode the band aid for that problem is already in place and will hold until they get around to it in a couple years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"His Dinoboy","date":"2017-03-26T23:16:11.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah jungling is pretty overwhelming, but i feel like {{champion:19}} makes it easier for people to focus on other things besides there health","replies":[]}]}
