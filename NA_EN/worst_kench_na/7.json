Riot seems to want EVERY champ to be flashy and do tons of damage. This of course, has ramifications that make the game even more unfun. Garen is probably the biggest example of this. He basically takes over the ADC's job with how much damage he puts out. Add the fact that he's unkillable as well (which to be fair, he should be) and the fact that he can go fast. It's terrible design that I really don't want a champ that I genuinely enjoy to have to suffer through.\n\nMarksmen. Mages. Assassins.

Supports. Be. Supports. Brand, Ziggs, Zilean, Zyra, Bard etc. I'm fine with them doing damage. They're AP supports. The job of enchanters, tanks etc. should be to PROTECT the carry who does the damage, not get kills themselves. If I had to guess, this design choice is part of Riot's inclination to make supporting feel more special i.e. like every other role. It's not supposed to be, though. I don't give a damn if performing the role as it's intended isn't popular. There were people that enjoyed the role as it was before, and it should get back to that status. If anything, this Kench change is worrying because of the effects that it could have on other supports, with the increase of damage to everyone. It's not a good design choice.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-07-25T22:54:19.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Worst Kench NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v22GEkQF,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-07-25T20:23:43.006+0000)\n>\n> Yep.

If you're a tank, you're basically a support in your own right. That's how it is in pretty much every game as it stands. You sacrifice your own ability to be able to kill things, so that your damage dealers can better do that. Sure, tanks CAN do damage. In WoW, which I realize isn't exactly a 1:1 comparison to a moba, but there, tanks can do damage. They just don't do a lot though, certainly not enough to get the job done themselves. As a tank, your job is to frontline for your team and deny the enemy DPS access to your DPS. That's accomplished through you being tanky, causing their DPS to focus you, and utilizing CC to slow their advances on your DPS if all else fails.\n\nKench should be tanky. I'm fine with his E being strong in that regard. He has CC in the form of applying stacks to enemy DPS and slowing/stunning them so that they can't reach your DPS, and if worst comes to worst, he can eat his own DPS to take them out of the battle if they get too low. Whether that mechanic in its own right is toxic or not is another debate, but it's one that clearly marks him as being able to fulfill both his supportive role, and his tank role. Nowhere in the equation should his damage be any large factor in to how he works. And really, I think that should go for all tanks. If you bring a tank toplane, you should accept the fact that you sacrifice agency in lane against something like a bruiser or a marksman so that you'll have a better frontline when it comes to teamfights. How would you beat a bruiser in lane, then? Get your jungler to realise that your matchup isn't good, and have them react accordingly to that information, whether they choose to help your lane out, or get another lane fed so that even more progress can be made in a lane where the matchup is better.\n\nKench is a tank. He should not be a dominant force toplane. You're more than welcome to do that, but there should be counterplay afforded to classes that are designed to shut your class down.","replies":[{"poster":"BEK Makadur","date":"2018-07-25T22:35:51.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kench is imo more like Mundo than he is like Malphite i.e.\nHe relies on his stacks to be able to win fights, he can´t 1v1 most bruisers after the early game unless he is ahead.

I don't see him being able to reliably do both without being problematic. As it stands, this change will absolutely kill his potential to support, and it contributes to this awful trend to just slap damage on everything so they can compete with everything else that's had damage slapped on to it. And as I've pointed out, adding damage to the classes that are supposed to. by design, do less than, you know, damage dealing classes is not a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Done25","date":"2018-07-26T18:08:05.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

I'm not good at Nautilus, Blitz or Thresh. I don't like playing Alistar, Braum or Leona. Taric used to be my favorite tank support, but he's not really a tank anymore. Kench had the one kit I liked in a tank support, and it seems like Riot doesn't want that to be a thing anymore. Do I just tell someone who'd like a tank support that I'd just rather not do that?\n\nI do feel for the people that wouldn't like to lose the value that top Kench has, I really do. But I guess I'll just have to suck it up then that they (Riot) don't want support Kench to be a thing?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2018-07-26T17:01:33.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I disagree.

If his damage were kept the same, I would be okay with that, honestly. The thing I'm concerned with, is that this is a direct nerf to his ability to support by making it much harder to handle devouring teammates away from poor decisions that they make. Also, he is a tank, and I still believe that it is problematic to give tanks more inherent damage than actual damage dealers.\n\nLet's say this change goes through, as it is.

Then, people of course get tired of these abominations, and they just gut them.\n\nIs that difficult to have tanks who actually can TANK, in this game? :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-07-25T22:18:53.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Saving allies shouldn't be as reliable and easy as clicking them and running off, though.
