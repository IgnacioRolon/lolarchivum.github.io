I don&#039;t get this feeling in any other competitive game out there, like Overwatch or Counter Strike nearly as much as I do in League. I don&#039;t understand it.

I know a lot of people don't use it, because the other player will almost argue back 99.9% of the time.\n\nJust accept that you will get bad games, and unlucky match making, it's what you signed up for playing this kind of game.\n\nI have some what of a grip on my anger, but league does seriously draw the most out of me compared to everything else..\n\nIf it really does become a problem, maybe just quit lol. Never look back.\n\nWhats your reason for playing? you don't really have anything to prove, unless you're Diamond trying to become Master.\n\nEven then, you should ask yourself what purpose do you have for doing it, and if the sacrifice will be worth the reward in the end.\n\nBe rational, be a loser, whatever it is.. just keep your mind healthy and swallow your pride.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hauling Ashe","date":"2016-12-17T20:10:01.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just realize that **how well you perform at a video game has no relevance on your life**, and suddenly the urgency of winning all your matches is no longer so strong.\n\nMaybe ease back and just play normals. With the exception of a few games I have with trolls, I find normals to be stress-free.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im Genie","date":"2016-12-17T20:07:10.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know your feeding bruh, i used to be nice guy, but this game is making me angry every single game. You just wanna play game and win with ppl, but they are not smart enough to understand that this game requires IQ to play. They said \"it's just a game, have fun\". WTF, you troll in ppl game and only you have fun because you are laughing everytime u fed them, you fail somebody game and said it's just a game. go fuk yourself. \nJust imaging, you are in a meal and somebody just come and shiit on your table, they have fun so how about you?

I am a very competitive person at heart and as such I get super frustrated whenever I keep making mistakes that I know I shouldn't be making. The only advice I can give you is that you try to do the following: \n\nA) Try listening to some relaxing music that you know will help you calm down more than normal.\nB) Try to take a break from the game whenever you start to get super frustrated. I know that this is easier said than done believe me (especially when you're on a losing streak), but just taking a step away from the game for a while can usually help you to calm down and relax without having to worry about anything else while doing so.\n\nI hope I helped some.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-12-17T09:49:58.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"goosfraba","replies":[]}]}
