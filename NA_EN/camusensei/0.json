Your operating system may\r\nask for Administrator permissions.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nAfter having clicked \"OK\" over a hundred times, I'm really annoyed by this message for two main reasons:\r\n1 - I am already adminstrator with UAC disabled so I won't receive a message from my OS anyway\r\n2 - I don't have any League desktop shortcut!\r\n\r\nSo I tried the impossible to get this damned message to disappear: I tried creating a desktop shortcut.\r\nSo \"Desktop\\Play League of Legends.lnk\" -> \"P:\\LoL\\lol.launcher.exe\" (yes, that's where it is installed)\r\nI lauched the game, pressed \"OK\" and looked at the new shortcut:\r\n\"Desktop\\Play League of Legends.lnk\" -> \"P:\\LoL\\LeagueClient.exe\" (which **does not exist**)\r\nSo I looked online and saw people telling me to launch a full repair. I found the option after clicking \"Launch\", in the settings named \"Initiate full repair\".\r\nLaunching that crashes immediately with a bugsplat.\r\nI then found the other repair option, under \"?\" before clicking \"Launch\", and repaired my client.\r\n\r\nThis did not change anything. (The \"Full repair\" still bugsplats, the \"shortcut update\" still creates a **broken shortcut** to LeagueClient.exe and that file still doesn't exist).\r\nI can still play, but cannot get rid of that **stupid message**. Any clue on what is wrong on my installation? Do you even have a .exe other than lol.launcher.exe and lol.launcher.admin.exe in the League installation directory? What is your desktop shortcut pointing to?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\nCamusensei\r\n\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n- W7 x64 with admin rights\r\n- I'm posting here because every time I tried to contact the support in the past, they would always tell me: \"please ask your question in the boards/forum\"...","replies":[{"poster":"Camusensei","date":"2017-10-30T23:28:48.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, reinstalling worked:\nI now no longer have to click \"launch\" at the beginning nor \"OK\" for that message I described earlier.\nAnd my LoL installation folder no longer looks the same AT ALL.\nInstead of just\nConfig/\nLogs/\nRADS/\nlol.launcher.exe\nlol.launcher.admin.exe,\nI have now the same folders but a lot of .dll files plus the LeagueClient.exe and some other exe files.

It tells me to select LeagueClient.exe which does not exist!!! Well, it technically does exist in subfolders (RADS/solutions/league_client_sln/releases/0.0.0.70/deploy/ RADS/projects/league_client/releases/installer/deploy/\nand RADS/projects/league_client/releases/0.0.0.100/deploy/) but selecting one of those makes the hextech repair tool crash.\n\nI finally copied one of them in the root LoL folder, to prevent it from crashing. I wonder if I'm the only one in such a bizzare situation...\nI launched a full reinstall because I have nothing to lose.
