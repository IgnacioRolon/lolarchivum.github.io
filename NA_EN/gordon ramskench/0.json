I&#039;m an Urgot main. Maybe not the best one, but I&#039;ve been playing Urgot a looooooooong time. And am just about ready to write a massive textbook about how to build, counter, and effectively play Urgot. This a fully serious proposition that I will follow through with. I plead for Rito to hear me out. Do not rework Urgot. Buff him, change his texture, nerf him, I don&#039;t care. But he DOES NOT need to be reworked at all. \r\n\r\nThe text I&#039;m planning to write would include anything and everything Urgot. Statistics, match ups (For every champion), various possible positions (even support) builds, personal stories, counter tips, countering counter tips, team composition and lastly I&#039;d like testimonies and peer reviews of other Urgot mains. \r\n\r\nIf there are any Urgot mains out there please contact me so we can collaborate on this project. I may even start a kickstarter/go-fund-me campaign if enough support is accomplished so this text can truly be a masterpiece. \r\nOf course the text would be updated (as any normal textbook would be) as the game updates. But it would all be in vain if Urgot would be reworked.\r\n\r\nEverything that I&#039;m proposing would be done for the purpose of educating individuals on the power and art-form of Urgot as a champion. \r\nSo please, Rito, and the league community... Tell me what you think of this proposal. Offer me so support or incentive to go through with the project. It is a serious proposal that is feeling and looking more possible day by day.\r\n\r\n-Yours truly: Urgotimus Prime (An Urgot Main).","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2016-06-15T15:33:11.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be interested in seeing this, although not for the reasons you probably think. :P\n\nI completely agree with Riot that Urgot needs a full rework, and actually did an Urgot survey on the League boards and the League reddit page that I got about one hundred responses to. The results were...interesting. There was NO agreement among players (regardless of how much they liked and/or played Urgot) on what sort of character Urgot was, where he should be played, what he should build, what role he filled, or what abilities were core to his identity. Literally no trends in the data at all -- the highest confidence results were 61% of players saying a lock-on feature was core to his playstyle and 51% saying they feel he should play like a Juggernaut.\n\nSo I'm curious, because I'm interested in seeing all view of Urgot -- not because I think he's fine, but because I'm interested in proposing an Urgot rework that targets as many of them as possible while retaining some of his current feel.","replies":[{"poster":"Gordon Ramskench","date":"2016-06-15T15:52:37.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see I see.

The next most common group was people who rated him between a 1 and a 2, suggesting he has some serious issues that players are super divided on.\n\n> I still retain the idea that he should not be reworked. However, if a rework would be put in place I could enlighten my own preferences of his new/coming form. \n\nHe *will* be getting reworked. This has been definitely confirmed. The question now is, I think, what SCOPE of rework.\n\n> PS: Juggernaut is a terrible idea for Urgot. You already have one undead Noxian juggernaut: Sion. You don&#x27;t need two. Especially a ranged one :3\n\nI actually disagree -- I think Urgot could make a really cool Ranged Juggernaut (I have some ideas along those lines from the feedback my survey has gotten), and one that's very different from Sion. Also, we have a spinning Noxian Juggernaut with an execute and a spinning Demacian Juggernaut with an execute, so I'm not too concerned with having two undead monstrosities, especially since they're so very different conceptually.\n\nMy personal rework is aiming to make him a Ranged Caster Juggernaut who can pivot into the Marksman role in terms of damage output.","replies":[{"poster":"Gordon Ramskench","date":"2016-06-15T16:08:29.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did any of the survey responses bring up Urgot as being an anti-tank/anti-assassin character? Currently he stands to be a powerful armor shredder. One reason I believe him to be so effective is that his passive cuts down assassin damage while his other abilities are able to lock on and prevent assassins from dodging/Jumping. But his true power is being the ironic adc who can take on tanks like Nasus and Rammus. \nUrgot's E posses massive armor shredding ability that is dangerous to tanks.

Black Cleaver was one of his most desired items, but the specific \"anti-tank\" or \"anti-assassin\" role was rarely mentioned.\n\nNow, I *do* think that the core of why he's good at this remains -- people like Black Cleaver's shred on him, and his ability to reduce enemy damage is the second-most loved thing about his current gameplay (behind the lock-on mechanic).\n\nAlso, as you might find it interesting, here are his top class role results (players could choose multiple options for roles they'd like to see him able to perform, hence the >100% total).\n\n1 -- Juggernaut (51%)\n2 -- Artillery Mage (41%)\n3 -- Marksman (35%)\n4 (tie) -- Disruptor (20%)\n4 (tie) -- Vanguard (20%)\n\n> Urgot&#x27;s E posses massive armor shredding ability that is dangerous to tanks.

Exactly ONE response mentioned his E's armor shred, and I left several free response sections for players to put in what they liked most about the character and his gameplay.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nick Da Chip","date":"2016-06-16T06:31:07.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Urgot quite a lot.

Urgot is a powerful 1v1 champion, its difficult to beat him in lane without the help of the jungler. Urgot's biggest vulnerability is his lack of mobility which he tries to make up for in his ult and kiting skills. His ult (when active) allows him to escape lane from ganks or catch enemies trying to get away from him. Late game, the range is huge and it can easily be used to engage the enemy team. Especially with the new buff of fear, his ult is a very powerful ability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-15T04:52:53.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"No, everything about urgot is terrible and he needs a rework.
