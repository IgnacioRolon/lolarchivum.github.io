Midlaners with the slightest amount of CC can 'support' and do so while building full ap, and never touching Sightstone.\n\nTanky supports just got Knight's Vow and Redemption, and both items are fantastic, but it forces the support meta in a dangerous direction, especially with what a convoluted MESS Soraka's kit is.  She's punished for building more health, but it makes a super-high health build more viable, thanks to the changes to Warmog's.\n\nOverall, I'm not happy, no, especially with how Support GP got eradicated, and some of my other favorite Niche picks.\n\nAlso, Blitzcrank.\n\nBlitz is singlehandedly the most game-skewing champion in the game, because he can miss fifty hooks before 10 minutes in, but if he lands one lucky shot, then it's game over for your bottom lane, and then for the rest of the team.  Blitz doesn't seek picks, he MAKES picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2016-11-30T15:22:28.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, there are many problems with a poll like this, such as bias and a limited sample of the population, so I don't know if Riot would want to use this as official data.\n\nHowever, I think it's always cool to see what people on the boards think, so I hope more people see it! In my case, I am a support main, and I like playing ranged supports. The only tank I truly like to play is Taric, and maybe if I get better with Thresh I would pick him too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best of the 3","date":"2016-11-30T14:36:54.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you get a compliment from your ADC / team mates for doing a good job. Even if what you did was just par for the course with supports. Those games really are lovely.\n\nSometimes you get blamed for all of life's problems by your ADC / team mates, perhaps for a simple mistake or just for being a support. I'd rather choke on my own fist than play those games. \n\nAlso depends on what you play, I find Sion / Leona support a lot more fun than heal bot Soraka.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2016-11-30T11:02:02.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like the way is been played in the League. I've been playing Supports in other games and felt way better than the league like Priests who buffs and heals allies, Warlocks who curses enemies\n\nAs far as i know Riot said the support role is not created by themselfs but by the community itself but if I think about it there was Support in champion description so i don't really truly know actually. Its based on \"You are last pick so you are Support\" stupid dumass logic so therefor its has no roots on how it should be played correctly which means \n\"No one else wants to play it so you have to play it\"\n\nAnd if we look the way the item build the support has to buy - Sightstone on lets say Nami. Its far better a Tank to have Sightstone but since Nami is the support then Nami buys it. Then goes to ward the bush and dies to enemy that is camping that bush\n\nIf i decide i wanna play Nami as Assassins would i have enough scaling to do that? Probably not right?\n\nSo there is mastery that if enemy minion dies you got 1 gold... Seriously? 1 gold? 1?\nI should be getting 40% of minions value for been near it so i get supported by gold correctly.\n\nI am not suppose to buy items cause they give gold. Giving gold to get gold is mindless logic\nYou get items because of their stats and actives not because they give gold","replies":[]}]}
