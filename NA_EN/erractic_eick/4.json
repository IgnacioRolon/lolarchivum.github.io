The more people who play ARAM, the fewer bots there will be as a percentage of players.

At least you still have the chance NOT to encounter one of 20 overpowered champions on there and even then they work drastically different in a single lane environment. \n\nAnother big bonus is the fact that games tend to end a lot quicker thus reducing the frustration of having to put up longer than necessary with blatantly snowballing teams which is a concept that personally has ruined the game for me. There are simply no comebacks anymore, so just let's get this shit over with so that I may get to queue up again.\n\nOh, it also made me love some champions I never got around to play as before.

Naturally, this makes metas a problem, but it also makes the options you provide a problem: Why play ARAM when you cannot build a team comp, causing a big chunk of games to be entirely won at champ select, just like summoner's rift? There are champions like Jax, where if the enemy has a certain character or two, you're just completely fucked and useless all game. Feeling completely helpless all game due to being a melee character with shit utility in a teamfight gamemode makes players like me hate the game mode.\n\nWhy play TT when Riot hasn't even tried balancing it for foreverness ago? Last I checked, there were still 65% winrate characters, and I haven't seen any changes for it. It's not a game mode that Riot shows any signs of supporting. This means, yes, the meta is strong there too, and if you don't pick top tier you lose.
