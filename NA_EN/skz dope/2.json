Usually the ADC can identify if the Support is good early on and vice versa. \n\nThe only thing that slightly irks me is that Top or Mid have no way of identifying if a support is good, so if I choose not to use my ult in a bad fight I sometimes hear things like \"Nami ult???\" like I'm some kind of scrub who doesn't know how to play my role.

You arn't immune to criticism just cuz ur playing support..  Again, I respect all lanes and roles equally for their contribution for the team.. I don't really have a \"special treatment\" for support or any other lane..  Support players just tend to hold a double standard more than other roles, thats my only issue.\n\nEdit: I'd also say the enemy team is generally the first to give you the extra recognition you are looking for.. if your ADC is fed and the end game chat is blowing up, sm1 is bound to point out that they are only fed cuz X support carried them.\n\nOr, \"holy shit my team wouldn't focus soraka\" or... \"jesus that jana was so annoying i couldn't even touch the adc\" or \"my god that alistar wouldnt die even though he was in the middle of all 5 of us, fucking broken\" ...or.......\"jesus why does support brand do so much goddamn damage\"\n\n...
