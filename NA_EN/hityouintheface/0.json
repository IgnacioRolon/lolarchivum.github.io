I have been looking at big gaming companies to see what opportunities they have available - so far I've been eyeing jobs at Riot, Twitch.TV, and ArenaNet. \r\n\r\nHere is a little background before I ask any specific questions:\r\n\r\nAs stated I am a junior in college. My degree is in Business Finance. I am looking into any job related to my degree, directly or indirectly. Positions I am interested in are any finance positions within a company, an account management position (ex: Twitch's Partnership Associate), or any marketing/sales/data analysis position (the data analysis position would probably have to be in line with money or using similar techniques that financial advisers use to analyse numbers).\r\nNote: The position I am MOST interested in is twitch's partnership associate.\r\n\r\nNow onto the questions:\r\n\r\nWhat do I, as a fresh college graduate with a **bachelor's degree**, need to know in order to land one of these jobs? \r\n     -Data analysis/coding languages? (SQL, Python, etc)\r\n     -Social Media Management?  \r\n     \r\nI want to know now what I can add to my resume that will lead to my success and growth within this industry. :)\r\n\r\nIf any Rioter's who deal with anything I've listed could comment that would be awesome! Or if anyone just has advice in general, I would love it! I am deeply considering learning SQL and maybe Python, but I do not want to invest in something that will be useless or outdated. I would appreciate in depth, detailed advice - I have heard all the basics, I want the specifics xD\r\n\r\n&lt;3\r\n\r\n~HitYouInTheFace (◕‿◕✿)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-04T22:47:41.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of wicked helpful people in this [LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Inside-Riot-Games-People-Game-3544410?gid=3544410)!","replies":[{"poster":"HitYouInTheFace","date":"2014-12-05T00:32:32.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Kateykhaos\n\nDo you have any specific advice for getting a job with Riot (or twitch if you have any experience w/ them)? \n\nEmbarrassingly enough I was looking at your twitter earlier and considering messaging you for advice.

I've programmed everything from assembly language on embedded and customize hardware systems to game consoles to super computers. I've used various assembly languages (RISC and CISC based processor architectures), C, C++, all but the earliest flavors of Fortran, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Bash, Basic and others. Language is irrelevant. \n\nPython has pros and cons like any other language. It's good for some things, absolutely terrible for others. Java is good for somethings, not so good at others. C/C++ is good for some things, not so good at others. So on and so forth. It all depends on the problem and/or requirements. You're not going to write a device driver in python, and you're not going to write a web application in assembler.\n\nA real software engineer analyzes the problem and determines which tools he or she needs in order to solve it. They don't try and shoehorn a particular language/framework/library into a solution just because they happen to really like a certain language or technology. That's how you wind up with problem projects that are error prone and difficult to maintain.\n\nBack to the OP, if you're going for the finance angle the likelihood of you actually cutting any code outside of maybe spreadsheet macro is small. Most companies use standard financial management, analysis, and reporting software packages. If you're talking about deep analysis and modeling, you're probably going to need something stronger than a bachelor's for that, and becoming familiar with R (a popular statistical analysis language) probably wouldn't hurt either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-12-05T17:10:47.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be interested in the chatroom RiotImminence.","replies":[{"poster":"HitYouInTheFace","date":"2014-12-06T01:32:05.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why so? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-12-06T01:46:32.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a place where people who are looking to apply to riot can discuss things, usually about their applications. you could probably find people (rioters and people with similar experience to you who are applying to riot) who are willing to chat with you.","replies":[{"poster":"HitYouInTheFace","date":"2014-12-06T02:17:43.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!!
