Should a tanky top rush it and pressure their lane with the extra minion? Should a jungler buy it and use it to help out a lane instead of ganking? Should a support buy it?\r\n\r\nCome boogey and brainstorm with me.

That said:\n\n1) please dear god don't rush it. If you're putting an extra minion in the lane, you're giving your opponent more gold and xp, they're never going to gain a big enough advantage if you put it down early,  This sounds like a late game item! \n\n2) it's probably best used when you need a minion to tank a turret and lanes are pushed opposite you. This could work great on a split pusher with teleport, who can push an objective even without a pushed Lane. \n\n3) it might be a viable counter to super minions if the minion it spawns is stronger than normal minions.  At least to the point that a champion doesn't need to consistently babysit that Lane,  only needs to check in every few waves.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-12-04T18:48:59.889+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The minions providing gold is a bug on PBE.

That it attacks minions is more of a weakness than a strength.\nWord of caution: Do NOT buy it against a Nasus. That's just asking to feed him free easy Q farm.\n\nThe usability range on it extends beyond that though. Internally, people have used it as a slow-to-activate blocking tool (think Trundle's pillar). I've also seen it used as a vision tool, since it provides a \"line\" of vision for 2.5 minutes.

The Void Gate is worth gold and if the disparity is too much, we can increase the value of the gate itself.\n2.

I would say any solo lane looking for a defensive item could take full advantage of it, it gives a nice handful of stats, and some tower pushing power. If I were a tanky top, I would buy this later on after a couple large health items, If I were a damage focus tp laner, I would buy this shortly before the first tower falls and then use it to fast push for the second. I see it as being a good defensive item for a mage as well (If they plan on buying a defensive item that is, mostly I just build a ton of AP and go relatively glass cannon), since it would help them push towers faster. I would probably use this item on champs that don't want to roam too much, since then they leave their portal undefended, and not being a roaming type means you can push your lane especially hard when you roaming opponent leaves lane.\n\nI predict that this will actually put a lot of pressure on roam focussed champs, and may put less mobile champs in a position of dominance. I can also see this as a game winning type of item, you got one inhib, you have super minions, then you also have you voidspawn.
