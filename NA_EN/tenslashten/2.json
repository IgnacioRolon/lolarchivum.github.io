Was it really? Because a comment like that just tells me (and probably everyone else) that you're a diehard super LCS fanboy that thinks Riot can do no wrong. If you seriously believe everything you said in that post, you're seriously not paying attention.\n\nI have always been a fan of Riot supporting LCS. I am not against LCS in any way. LCS is where Riot Game(s) makes most of their profit, and they definitely should be focusing a grand chunk of their energy on making it more profitable for them. ***I*** don't like how they've consistently shown that they care less about their player base as a whole in favor of LCS. Focus on the championships, but don't make it the core of the game with the rest of us maybe an afterthought at the end of the night.\n\nThey are getting better. Or, rather, they're either getting better or hiding their indifference better. There's no way a company that made a billion dollars at the end of 2014, half a billion at the end of 2013, and a quarter billion at the end of 2012, still can't afford to put servers on the east coast of the country they founded their company in. There's no excuse the LoL client is still running on Adobe AIR. There are several other neglections I could mention.\n\n I am not saying Riot doesn't care, I am saying I can't tell. I love this game, and I want to feel like the company cares more about making their customer happy than only increasing their bottom dollar. And if they can't muster that, at LEAST make their customers feel like they care about both equally.\n\nIt's like banging the gorgeous sexually pent-up college senior every night of the week, and only wiping your dick off at the end of every night. Sometimes you gotta hop into the shower instead and show your rod it's not just a tool, that it deserves a little care sometimes as well. It's not just your money maker, it's an important part of the team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-03-28T14:56:12.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Eve just needs to be scrapped and reworked. The most hindering aspect of her kit is her passive stealth, which is why Riot keeps her neutered. If they scrap her kit and give her stealth to her W active or work it into a new ability to make it non-permanent, they could really balance her and make her viable again.","replies":[{"poster":"TenSlashTen","date":"2015-03-28T17:18:43.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what you're saying...
