Teemo is either a short range tanky bruiser who does less damage then a most tanky bruisers at the cost of having better survability from ganks, but in turn, he is subpar to every other champion with range who builds the same, so champions like Kayle, Nidalee, and Gnar all out DPS and our tanky then he is.\n\n> And no, \"True Mains\" will stop playing their champion if they're is literally zero reason to pick them over other champions.\n\nBullshit.\n\n> Edit: Volibear top was more popular than jungle until recently.\n\nNo he was not.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-28T14:02:52.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol mk buddy.\n\nAlso, you used the term \"Fotm\" wrong, as Akali is not anywhere near Fotm, and buying a champion for her skin does not make it a fotm purchase.\n\nBased on that, and your flat out statistical lies, and lack of knowledge (Last time teemo was played in the pro scene, he was built mostly AP, and once full AD.
