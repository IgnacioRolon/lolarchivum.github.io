Kind of pointless then dont you think?\nE: Change range to use E onto your W, change travel time(shorten it i've missed people with it because its so slow)\nAdd about 10% more shield to the max rank shield to make it worth getting in their face, its just too weak to justify  using this spell for anything outside of a last ditch effort to secure a kill/run away.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Cubism","date":"2014-09-16T19:39:07.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I was going to play him, but then literaly a minute after I got on he was disabled.

Boohoo. \n* **Second **his Q felt clunky as hell, soldiers never went where i wanted them too. I dont know if it repositions them at the tip of the arrow of at maximum aa range. Very confusing.\n* **Thrid **the circled indicator to spawn a turret is huge, twice i spawned a turret when i did not want to while trying to push minions who where close to a dead tower.\n* **Fourth **worse still was the fact that there is no range indicator for when the soldiers become \"inactive\"(you cant give orders). Often times i found myself wondering at what range do i need to be to attack, they just randomly stop.\n* **Fifth**, late game, i really felt like i needed to be able to store 1 more soldier. I wish his lv 16 ult gave some sort of passive which allows you to store 1 more. :/\n* **Sixth**, and worst of all, is the fact that you have to move and right click inbetween soldier attacks. **WHY**? As long as an enemy is in range, Azir's soldiers should \"LOCK\" onto that target, and attack it whenever and as long as it remains in range (S key exists if you wish to stop), the fact that i have to stop and keep giving them orders is stupid. I should be able to freely move around without having to stop and tell them \"KEEP ATTACKING DAMMIT\".\n* **Seventh**, i come back home from the gym, and hes disabled.... BOOFREAKIN HOO. I spent 1500 extra IP for nothing. I hope this bug dosent last, or i want compensation.\n\n\nOverall, he felt very clunky and unresponsive, but with the potential for a lot of fun, i did really feel like a commander.

I was also doing it like every 2-4 seconds with max CDR though... it might need tuning. :p\n\nI assume the reason it is this way is because the previous iteration of letting the soldiers attack towers still gave him the ability to attack towers, but let him switch from attacking towers to harassing (and back) too easily, so they let him keep the cool tower damaging but made it have a real cost.

Q_Q), I find the way it announces \"your turret has been destroyed\" or \"your team has destroyed a turret\" for his passive, anti-clarity and that it either should say it's own thing, or should just say nothing at all, as this could be bad for morale, or just make your team overconfident for no reason. The icons help, but you can't always be assed to look in the middle of a fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue3345","date":"2014-09-16T20:36:39.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I found him fun, but I can't wait for the ditto matches to die out so it'll actually be you know... fun. That said, I feel his early game damage is pretty poor, and people can walk out of the soldiers' range like nothing, even with Q, but late game the opposite is true. The soldiers destroy anyone they see. He's definitely a late gamer.\n\nThat said let's get to the \nBUGS I've noticed:\n\nQ + E is very buggy in that, if you use your Q to move the soldiers, then try to E right away for an escape or just straight up to move, it doesn't work until you stop button mashing and push it again calmly.\n\nThe E tooltip should state that it goes toward the soldier closest to you for clarification reasons.\n\nThe Soldiers seem to be clunky in terms of attack range. I feel it needs some kind of quality of life change, but I can't put my finger on it. (Please keep locked screen users in mind! Despite most people using unlocked, some people DO use locked!)\n\nAllies see the passive for turrets as well, which is useful for knowing if Azir can use it, but the problem is you can accidentally target them, which as you can imagine really throws you off if you're chasing/running away.\n\nEdit: Another bug I experienced was I ulted a Nasus away from me BEFORE he even PUSHED Q, but he managed to push it while being pushed away from my ult and it went off and ended up killing me despite being on the other side of the area.\n\n-Balance-\nAzir came out surprisingly more balanced then I had expected. Especially the turrets. I feel the turrets are still slightlyyy on the strong side for a passive especially... but the 3 minute cooldown is pretty good, and the damage isn't on-par with real turrets, BUT it is too tanky in my opinion, granted they can be ignored to make pushing progress, but it does stop minions for a while and distracts the team, so I feel a nerfing to it's defenses is in order. Even with Azir away I saw minions take quite some time to take down the turret. I'm satisfied with the fact that the more time that goes on the HP gets lower, I feel that really helps balance.\n\nHis early game cooldowns are a bit unforgiving, but the late game ones are next to spammable. I wouldn't say this is a problem, but it definitely puts him at a late game mage status. \n\nRealistically, his soldiers' range isn't that great, people can just straight up walk out of it preventing any real early harass, and it's really problematic that his W's range is almost melee, especially when you want to be clever and use it as an escape, you can, but you need to Q first, which has a cast time and a wait time for the travel, making it unreliable, not to mention the chance of the above stated bug with Q + E. As for the range issue, once you get to the later game and get something like Rylai's this isn't as much a problem. Maybe a natural slow would be helpful? A small one, nothing big.\n\nUsing E as an escape is slightly risky, being that a champion can walk in front and screw you over. Whenever I do this I feel like it's gonna be like Jarvan's Q + E, but it's not, BUT I don't want that to change. I feel it's a really important part of counterplay to him.\n\nThe other thing with E as an escape is that it often looks like you can E away, but you're actually not in range, therefore nothing happens while you spam E, and it's not really a good feeling, maybe some clarity or a QoL change would be helpful here. I don't think I'd really mind a nerf on the range you can leave the soldiers to actually know when I'm out of range of my E rather then be fooled by the fact I have one just out of range.\n\nEdit: Reguarding the ult, I don't think that it should be able to block dashes. I know Riot likes to add \"extra\" to make the character stand out, but recently Riot has been adding a lot of broken things, like the spell walls. I'll tell you, it's not a fun feeling ulting as MF at a choke point and a Yasuo just puts up a wall and blocks the whole ult. Same feeling for dashes.\n\nTL: DR: I think he's in a good spot, but just needs a few QoL changes and clarity/bug fixes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vartanis","date":"2014-09-16T20:03:39.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was a fun first few games but there are a few problems; his passive seems to activate on it's own at times...literally walked down mid while pathing to enemy inhib and it just went off on the first turret for no reason, also got hit by a fiddlesticks silence and couldn't auto attack for the duration, not just using the sand soldiers but normal auto attacks as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fozin","date":"2014-09-16T19:33:19.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q seems to be very buggy.
