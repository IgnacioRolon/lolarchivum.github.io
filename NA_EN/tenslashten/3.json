I once had a guy in rank troll me for picking him. He told me since I went shaco he's going to do whatever he can to stop me from doing it. So he went duo jungle panth and needless to say fed like hell while I went like 4/0 the first few minutes. \n\nRegardless of how well I did he still chose to troll and despise Shaco. \n\nAnother game I called Shaco jungle someone banned him right off the bat and told me he doesn't want that trash champ on his team lol. \n\nThere's just a lot of Shaco hate since most people are fking stupid with him. They try to copy people like the Illuminati Shaco and end up feeding hard","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-28T18:49:30.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Torasuto,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=RxAAi1aR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-28T18:17:29.251+0000)\n> There's just a lot of Shaco hate since most people are fking stupid with him.

Shaco's decent skill curve with his reliance on map awareness, target selection, and surprise all add up splitting Shacos into one of two types of Shacos.\n\nThere are good Shacos that can pick of ADCs, counter jungle well, and otherwise play Shaco well.  Then, there are Shaco players who, while playing a game as Shaco, are also eating a sandwich, and therefore do poorly.\n\nThe problem is that if Shaco is eating a sandwich, he tends to feed.  So he falls into a feed of fed sort of niche, and nobody wants to gamble on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-03-28T18:44:53.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco penalizes people who aren't playing safely, that's why people hate him so much.\nJust about to barely finish your red buff at 200hp? Shiv throw and ignite with maybe a Q backstab thrown in for good measure.\nPlaying riven and barely won that trade with the enemy pantheon?  Shaco just backstab ignited you for firstblood and now you're behind.\n\nShaco is there when people dont want him there, he is what people fear COULD happen if they extend past the middle of the lane.\nHe is similar to evelynn, in that a good player can avoid all wards and be right on top of you before you know what happened.\n\nAll this being said, I love shaco, he is easily my favorite champ.  I own all of his skins (ty self-gift for workshop shaco) and would gladly play him anywhere, other* than adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-03-28T22:17:23.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mystery gifted a friend who got workshop shaco.
