They can get so bad that I disconnect, and sometimes I'll just manually disconnect and reconnect to see if it helps, but it doesn't {{champion:32}} \r\n\r\nThese periods of lag include not being able to see any ability or attack animations and units losing their health bars but not going through the dying animations. The game usually catches up around 20 seconds later, causing every single animation to play at once, then it just starts lagging again.\r\n\r\n**Are there any known solutions to this problem?** Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

When your connection is coming to our servers it carries bits of data called packets. If some of those packets get lost or corrupted along the way, it causes pretty heckin' weird stuff like champions sliding around or the game seeming to pause completely. \n\nGrab the network logs from that match if you can and pop them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). That'll be able to tell me what your connection looked like during that game, so take a screenshot and post it back here for me!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProblomaticRoot","date":"2017-10-22T21:21:58.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i feel your pain, been having the same thing for two weeks since the 7.20 patch went live.\n\ndid everything that was suggested by riot themselves threw a support ticket and i was told it was networking through my IPS and to contact them.\n\ndid that too, twice, second time was all i needed to conclude that Patch 7.20 is probably causing an issue in the games that i play when logged onto league, yet all the other online games have stable ping issues. So my ISP,(after remotely ping tracing straight to riot's NA server found no issues at all), concluded with the earlier assement i had about the Patch causing the rare issue of connection and networking from my computer to their servers.\n\nKeep in mind that the only reason i am convinced now it is the current patch is the fact that they traced the ping the same time i did while on the phone with my ISP with only one difference, my ISP does not have league downloaded on there computers for the same test i was doing and i never had a problem with the service or an entire year with my current ISP.\n\nSo yes i believe Riot needs to take responsibility for this issue and fix it.","replies":[]}]}
