It sounds like something is failing to render the game, which is what would cause these bugsplats.  They are generally caused by bad game files that have become corrupt, outdated drivers, or even hardware problems.  My suggestion for your specific issue is to go over each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.  If you installed the new client, then a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)may be necessary but I recommend double checking your drivers first.  Your connection should not be an issue here, and instead with the game rendering.
