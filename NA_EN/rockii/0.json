Always have. he is my most hated champ in the history of league. Always has been and will continue to be. But I will give Riot this much in that new Rengar is WAY more tolerable than he has ever been.\n\nI'll stick to my assertion that if he is that close to you to begin with, you are probs positioning badly anyway.\n\nOnly walls i can thin of where this can realistically be useful is Baron and dragon pits, in which case, i have to wonder what you are doing in the back of them.\n\nother areas like blue and red pit  and the ledge in the rivers already have bushes all around them for him to get to you, and therefor him being able to get to u from those points doesn't even require his ulti, which makes it a question of your positioning.\n\n\n> Another case can be a mental game... Ok rengar ulted, how far away did he ult from(unknown), which direction could he be coming from(unknown)\n\nThat's... pretty much the entire point of his ultimate. And lucky for you, most Rengars don't even utilize this aspect of it.\n\nIt doesn't matter tho. What matters is if he can see you with it, he is coming for you, and it is in your prerogative to hide behind Teammates or run for cover as soon as you notice he is coming for you.\n\nIt doesn't mater if he is at base when he ultis or in the river. Don't take your sweet time thinking. \"oh he wont reach me for a good 30 seconds, i can chill for now\". That's the fools move and how all morons die in monster movies.\n\nNever make decisions based on info you don't have unless you have enough reason to make the educated guess.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-02T17:35:21.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks god rengar can still assassinate people with a ful ad build","replies":[]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-01-01T09:05:56.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I was 0/20 vs a 30/1 rengar, I'd die in 0.3 seconds too...","replies":[]}]}
