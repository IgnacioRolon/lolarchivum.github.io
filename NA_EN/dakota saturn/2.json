I just laned against the first mordekaiser top that I&#039;ve seen in 3 entire seasons, and he was basically useless beyond being a pushbot.  I was LB top and crushed him with almost zero effort.\n\nI actually liked Morde before the rework - he felt like a decent balanced champion - high damage, sustain, but zero mobility or CC.  \n\nWith or without Rylai&#039;s he couldn&#039;t do anything the entire game, even with Eve camping for him.\n\nalso pls revert {{champion:7}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:105}} rework kk ty bye bye","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-09T06:52:38.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}} Hi","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2017-01-09T07:14:41.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:16}} \nShe is now a stupid healbot. She has pretty good AP rating on heal and ult, but you can't go ap because then you just die without helping your team. Q range was nerfed, so you don't have enough safe range to regen your hp, and regeneration is plain shit, and ap ratio is worthless. Going ap is just a disadvantage right now instead of being viable strategy.\n\nP.S. Also, i miss giving mana to people :(","replies":[{"poster":"morris1","date":"2017-01-09T10:19:31.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't play long enough to know this, what was the reason for her rework specifically? It seems like if you wanted to harass you'd have to be very close to the enemy team and you'd get rewarded with good damage and her heal wasn't nearly as frustrating as it is now.","replies":[{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2017-01-09T18:18:31.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont remember either. Maybe it had something to do with midlane soraka being a thing. Maybe it was because they wanted to get rid of mana giving ability in league, and also remove point and click silence. Anyway, first rework wasn't that bad. Her Q had a sweet middle area, bigger range, and landing it felt like doing damage. Also heal was pretty good, was instant, and scaled with number of champions hit. Over time they nerfed her range, and in patch 6.5 changed her again. \n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes#patch-champions\n\nFunny enough, they aimed to remove passive sitting in a backline. But they made it so it's only viable strategy for her to play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"L Rayquaza","date":"2017-01-09T05:43:22.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner Passive, makes his jungle busted as shit but cripples his power to 6 points in the map that he may not even control and removes him from top lane","replies":[]}]}
