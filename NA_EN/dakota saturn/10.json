I know these matchups are heavily in LB&#039;s favor, but I have a really hard time on LB lately, esp versus long range poke mages.\n\nIt feels like all I can do is farm until 6 and hope I haven&#039;t been chunked too much, and use the extra jump to close the distance, and finally have the ability to trade / poke without getting stunned and deleted.  It feels like I can&#039;t W on top of them or I&#039;ll eat a full combo to the face, and a W -&gt; QE isn&#039;t enough dmg and is too unreliable.  Whenever Xerath charges his lightning, I run back as far as I can, which I know isn&#039;t the right thing to do, but it&#039;s so easy for him to just throw a stun and put the trade heavily in his favor, if he doesn&#039;t just simply kill me.\n\nI know these matches are supposed to be braindead easy, and Vel/Xer have huge difficulties with ranged assassins but I can&#039;t consistently win this lane.","replies":[{"poster":"SirM0rgan","date":"2016-10-13T12:22:27.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Xerath main, I think you're over-complicating the match up against him.  The stun duration is based on the distance it travels, so if you get on top of his face, it will only be a .5 second stun.  Just wait for the W, then go all in.  He'll hit you with Q, but after that all he'll have is autos.  Make sure he doesn't have flash up though, otherwise he'll jump away before he stuns you and you'll be sad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2016-10-13T12:08:24.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually the meta is in favour of waveclear mages, LeBlanc as a hard time at the moment.\nProbably this is going to be completely different after her update.\nThose matchups are easy as long as you are able to predict their skillshots and to dodge them. As an assassin you have a strong all-in, and you can even go into melee range against Xerath and Vel'koz.\nPush your minion wave with your aa's away from your turrets as good as possible during the laning phase so both can't push you under your tower that easily. Last-hitting with LeBlanc is not easy since her aa's are not perfect, but that improves after a lot of practice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-10-13T04:50:17.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have trouble with velcoz cuz of the knockup, but xeraths stun is slow and easyo to avoid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2016-10-13T00:52:31.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see Xerath charging his Q, Distortion in an odd direction near him. Then you can then combo him and wait out his Q to Distortion back for no damage and a won trade. Same for Vel'Koz.\n\nJust be careful with pushing. You need the lane on your side without getting it reset.","replies":[]}]}
