This isn't directly style related (though creating all those nested styles would be annoying), but due to how the boards were built. I took a peek at the markup in this thread, and it appears that, at some point, the code that generates the posts stops trying to be nested, likely to ensure that it doesn't get too narrow. If it kept getting narrower and narrower, it would eventually get to a point where there is no space for the text, and it is entirely illegible.\n\nThe easiest solution would be to get used to chronological view, which does not suffer from this shortcoming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-06-21T22:29:37.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AyreBiRabak,realm=EUNE,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=koYRPJlE,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b,timestamp=2019-06-21T21:41:12.299+0000)\n>\n> Now if you don't mind, we got a dude named hammermancer acting all \"AMERICA IS SUPREME\" and going jerk rule all around.\n> Might go mod his ass while you're at it.\n> Deep topic is going...holy shit...I'm actually sad...\n\nSometimes it can take us a while to get to things.
