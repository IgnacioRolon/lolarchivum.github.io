He sent them an email saying what skins he has bought and birthday associated with the account along with a lot of other specifics. Yet they say that it's not enough information. He cant lok back at his history to see his first purchased champs or skins bought because he doesn't even have his account anymore. so how is he supposed to get more info without his account? and also his email is no longer even tied to his account somehow but his profile doesn't have any games played since the account was taken. the last thing he posted was \"Hi\" in our group chat, but it was sent AFTER he lost his account. Does this mean he just spent all this money on RP only for him to never get his account back?","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-02T11:29:47.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, for obvious security reasons he has to prove he is the creator of the account. If he can remember anything super precise like the champion that was released when he created the account, date of birth, refund tokens he used, maybe a RP purchase for Xmas,  you also get an email every time you purchase RP, etc. Player Support will ask as many questions as necessary, it is not abnormal to not remember certain things from years ago.","replies":[{"poster":"PrecisionFlood","date":"2016-10-02T17:25:16.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well he gave them a ton of info on recent activity (skin purchases and who they were given to) and the birthday on the account. there is no receipt in his email about riot points so we couldn't put that in. but they responded saying that the info he gave them isn't enough.  but the problem is that he cant really give any more information because he doesnt have the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T20:50:20.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the information we request isn't stuff you need the account to grab, and for security reasons, some of it may not be recent information. \n\nI recommend your friend continue to work with the account specialist in their ticket and do their best to remember the information they've either skipped or haven't recalled correctly.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"PrecisionFlood","date":"2016-10-04T18:29:37.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he gave all the information he could remember (including birthday with the account and other non-league info) but how s he supposed to find out his first 5 champions if he made the account so long ago and cant remember such things","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
