It seems like its severely tilted towards the opposing team. The best part is im not even allowed to dodge when I know my team is going to troll the fuck out of my series and give me an instant loss. Thx rito. Just what I need: a severe MMR handicap and an inability to leave a situation that I know is going to end in a loss regardless. Its almost like playing the lottery tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-19T02:13:51.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not really logically possible, since other people also have to play promos.
