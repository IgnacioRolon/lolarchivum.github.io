Riot isnt responsible for protecting your feelings. YOU ARE. The universe doesn't owe you anything man. People are gonna say mean things to you, and the riot police arent gonna be there to protect you. YOU need to learn how to deal with feeling insulted, and so far it seems your way of dealing with it, is looking for someone with authority to punish the person who said the mean thing. Thats just not realistic in a country with freedom of speech.\n\nYou see, the reason they punish toxicity IN GAME, is because they lose players due to toxicity IN GAME. Their rules are not a moral lesson, or some boundary of their morality. Its simply there to get rid of players who drive other players out of their game. They are a company in a capitalist society. Bottom line is money. Playerbase = money. \n\nSo when players leave because they constantly get flamed in game, Riot tries to fix that by banning people who flame in game. Theyve decided that the cost of losing those players is less than the cost of losing players who leave due to toxicity.\n\nOnce players start quitting in large numbers due to being flamed by people in their friends list, Riot will start punishing for that. Outside of in-game, chat is a completely opt-in experience. Its your choice to talk to whoever you want to talk to. They dont deal with it. You do.
