Here is my experience.\r\n\r\nI ran into this player (see picture below) about 2 weeks ago. Long story short, he would pink the monster camp so he could continually aa-reset it and be able to afk without leaverbuster triggering him.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gODNyl4.jpg\r\n\r\nI reported this player, obviously, as it ruined the game for our top laner that had to 1v2. I sent in a support ticket to rito about this player.\r\n\r\nHere is the awesome conversation that went on with rito guys:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xmCDUyS.png\r\n\r\nNow, the problem is that this person was given 100% proof that the player was afking using the method that I had described, yet the rito guy wants to say they need to investigate the person. The proof was given 2 weeks ago. Once we got past the this is 100% an afk player hurdle, he then goes on to say that it IS punished. Excuse me, but I gave you 100% proof of this guy 2 weeks ago, and his match history (see below) shows him doing it for a long time before I even ran into him. So no, obviously you don't punish this behavior. If this player was punished, he wouldn't be doing it over and over and over again.....including a lot of times AFTER I gave you picture evidence of it happening. They want to continually say that they punish them, it just takes time to detect them. No. Players like me send in support tickets and nothing still gets done. Why? My only guess is because that account is one more account that will be sold to a banned player and they will probably buy skins on it.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZFekHnA.png\r\n\r\nTL;DR: We have a bot problem in this game because rito refuses to address and punish the players that are doing it.","replies":[{"poster":"TheAce123","date":"2016-06-24T18:10:30.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dam first trash legend skin now this sht happens ^^ no wonder people play Overwatch now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ethyreon","date":"2016-06-16T19:44:57.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the age of computers, a picture is quite frankly not 100% proof. I can think of several things off the top of my head that could be going on: A) You were upset with the player and lied about the situation in the picture B) The picture was doctored via photoshop C) The player only AFK'd one game and therefore should not be banned. I'm not saying I don't believe you that the player was exploiting the system, I'm just saying that it's important for Riot to explore these other options. Juts because it is clear to you does not mean it's clear to Riot. It would be unfair to the player base for Riot to punish players without due process.\n\nRiot DID punish this player, it just took two weeks for them to establish the precedent for it while also working on the numerous other cases the undoubtedly have. You obviously don't understand what is entailed from Riot's end. You just seem mad that the player wasn't banned as quickly as you wanted them to be. Get over it.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPharmD","date":"2016-06-17T01:43:16.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">A) You were upset with the player and lied about the situation in the picture\n\nRight, he is level 1 18 mins into the game with a pink ward by the monster camp while I'm level 11. Not sure how else that situation would go.\n\n>B) The picture was doctored via photoshop\n\nNo. His match history would show that is simply false.\n\n>C) The player only AFK'd one game and therefore should not be banned.\n\nAgain, match history shows that being false.\n\n>Riot DID punish this player\n\nFalse, the player is STILL playing games.\n\nYou are the reason this community is considered toxic.

They do ban waves so they can put minimal effort into punishing people. Which means you get extended periods of people doing the behavior that ruins games for everybody else before they're finally punished for it. This guy will probly get banned a few months down the line with all the other accounts at once and until then, he gets to ruin everybody's games. If Riot punished people immediately, not only would they save people from having to deal with these jerks, they would also actually discourage this behavior from starting in the first place. \n\nThe irony is that they don't even have to put that much effort into it. All they really need to do is bring back the tribunal with a video evidence feature. Have games auto record and then when submitting a report, people can list the time period the offense was in. Tribunal users view the offense in action and vote guilty. This would actually take ridiculously little effort from Riot if you left all the fact checking in the hands of the players. Not only that, it would actually provide a valid way to catch people intentionally feeding, afking, and trolling. But Riot would rather not do anything about it even though all the tools to solve the problems are readily available.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPharmD","date":"2016-06-17T01:49:20.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They claim that the reason is that it takes time for \"due process\". There is no clearer proof than this. So I don't believe them. They want this player to level up the accounts so whoever is buying it can buy skins and then they can ban them for the inevitable \"toxicity\" in chat that they show. I'm not sure if they simply don't understand that this type of behavior causes the toxicity (our top laner wasn't happy with the afk player since he got fucked), or if they hope that their playerbase is too unintelligent to realize that's what they're doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atronthor","date":"2016-06-16T21:30:19.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drugs are bad, girl.
