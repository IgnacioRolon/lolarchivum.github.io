This doesn&#039;t exactly address the rating/ranking system, but it sure as hell fixes the main problem solo players have with dynamic queue. 5v5 queue times would be similar to what they were with ranked 5s obviously, and there are plenty enough of groups of 2 and 3 that the queue time wouldn&#039;t be crazy. One queue that satisfies both player bases.\n\nEdit: \n\nSo some of you are concerned about queue times, specifically with the 2&3 groups. One person had a good idea of allowing 5s to play vs the groups of 2&3. I don't know, I don't seem to love this idea too much, but I would be more than pleased with it if it meant the other factors are done as well. And to be honest, no 3 man premade would have the right to complain about it being unfair to be against a 5 man since they don't have a problem being a trio against 5 solo players. So I would be fine with that.\n\nAbout the 2&3 queue. It's hard to say whether or not the queues would skyrocket as a result. There are A LOT of people playing the game. A lot. And since you have to select multiple roles, I personally don't think it would be that big of an issue. One thing that could possibly be done is to let the solo player have the option of being ok to play with premades. This would allow some solo players to \"fill\" the 2&3 queues without forcing them to. I think this would shorten queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2016-06-04T15:01:09.415+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":13,"body":"What about people who want to play as 4 or solo people who want to play with and against premades?\n\nThe only solution is to have two separate queues.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf22147970","date":"2016-06-04T15:07:42.436+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"No solo player in their right mind wants to play with or against premades...
