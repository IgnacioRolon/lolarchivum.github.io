To resolve this, I suggest running our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi), checking the box for Reinstall along with the box for a Clean uninstall. After League is reinstalled, ensure it has the right [system permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions#wq3) to run properly.\n\nIf you have any issues after running those steps, let me know.
