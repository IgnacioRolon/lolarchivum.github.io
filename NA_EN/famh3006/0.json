I know i have internet connection cause i am skyping with friends to play the game. If you can please help me fix this or tell me what can i do, i will appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T00:14:22.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These issues are largely caused by certain network settings that conflict with your client's ability to stay connected to our servers. While your connection to Skype is good, our servers reside in a different geolocation than Skype's, therefore you could still be experiencing a routing issue to our servers. I'd strongly recommend going over our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are in good standing before we investigate further.\n\nLet me know if you encountered any changes after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"FAMH3006","date":"2016-12-16T05:23:09.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried and nothing has changed :( right now i tried to play a flex ranked game (and again a server problem stating a unable to connect to server notification) and now i am up to a 20 minute queue for 5 matches, i dont know if there is some other way I can fix this problem, i have never left  a game on purpose and its unfair that a server problem punishes me and make me  wait so long for a match...i am grateful for your response and time!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-18T22:46:50.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unfortunate that you've received a Leaverbuster penalty due to your disconnections, but bear in mind these are not caused by a server issue since there are no server issues going on as of late.
