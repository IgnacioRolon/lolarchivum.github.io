I think one of the worst parts is how often some of my mates still refer to me by that name lol. I have now moved on from that time where I was way too invested in the game and I can now play it calmly and respectfully to other players. Honestly, I still kinda miss that account so, I was wondering what a reformed player could theorically do to get his banned account back?\r\n\r\nMuch love\r\n-Smarties","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-12-10T19:55:38.395+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait and hope that they do another unban experiment.

Tyler1 has had many accounts permanently banned and has gotten exactly 0 of those accounts unbanned. The only ban he had lifted was an indefinite player/ID ban, where he was allowed to make accounts without them immediately being banned upon Riot identifying the accounts to be his.\n\nThis is not the situation that the OP is in.

Meh, its okay, it happens.

At the end of the day,  money will override any \"values\", \"policies\", or \"stances\".  Rumor has it  that is why the experiment last year took place. NA lost a lot of players with dumb decisions Riot made in that year (season 9).  \n\nI do agree that perma-banned should be given a legit chance to prove they have changed. Esp those banned 3+ years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jojobees","date":"2019-12-13T06:49:13.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the same situation and recently posted a new thread about it. It'll be 4 years in February for me. I got nothing. Support agents stopped responding to my tickets. Live support suggested making a forum post about it so I did. My last forum post was 11 months ago and had 15k views and 22 net upvotes and nothing happened so idk m8.\n\nI will always be Jojobees or Jojo for short to my mates and that's the name I use in all my other games. I think the thing that hurts the most is the nostalgia. I mean I still play the game and I've got 3 accounts in good standing, no punishments since the two permabans 4 years ago. But yeah. I almost deleted my account but I couldn't do it.

And all those several people who keep coming back, trying to login to their accounts after 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.. 9 years. Hoping that they are magically unbanned. They make threads, wondering if Riot will ever unban them. Talking about how they have matured over time and grown to be more respectful to others. It makes me sad when people do that because I can relate to how important that first account you personally leveled up, went through with making new friends on league and had awesome moments on, _is_. \n\nUnfortunately, Riot doesn't unban permanently banned accounts. Unless, they do another reforming experiment. But having read that thread of the guy who did it, he expended a lot of resources on it. And it didn't quite pan out the way that they had hoped. So it looks pretty bleak in my opinion. But there's always a _possibility_. I can only suggest that you keep a lookout for this. Because when they did the last experiment, a lot of people who had quit after being banned missed out on it.","replies":[]}]}
