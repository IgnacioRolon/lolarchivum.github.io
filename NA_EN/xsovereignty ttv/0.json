I think he is going to be more healthy than ever both AP and AD and after his release he will be tweaked for the better. as for E targeting a champion with W, your supposed to reward risk and not playing safe otherwise you would just have boring safe lanes all game. anyway I will let you read the post below tell me what you think.\n\nDude you are too focused on the \"AP\" part of Ezreal. AP Ezreal will still be viable, but what you are not looking at is hybrid or Double tear Ezreal will be absolutely disgusting. I am even thinking it would be broken strong and will have to be tuned down. with his New W he gets mana sustain, and high single target damage just thinking putting the numbers alone here lets look.\n\nOld EZ Lvl 18 with just Lich Bane\nATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nLich Bane - 80 AP - 75% base AD + 50% AP (76.875 + 40) 116.875 damage\nOLD W rank 5 - (250 + 80% AP) (250 + 64) 314 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 112.75 + 32) 259.75\n\nTotal combo - 116.875 + 314 +259.75 = 690.625\n\nNew EZ Lvl 18 with just Lich Bane\nATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nLich Bane - 80 AP - 75% base AD + 50% AP (76.875 + 40) 116.875 damage\nNew W rank 5 - (255 + 60% bonus AD + 40% AP) (255 + 32) 287 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 112.75 + 32) 259.75\n\nTotal combo (Q damage + Lich bane and W proc) - 116.875 + 287 +259.75 = 658.625 damage\n\nNow looking at this with 80 AP with the Lich bane you only lose 32 Damage. What you haven't though about was how much better his lane will be. He gets a refund on mana, and now AP Ezreal scales really well with Gun blade I want you to look at this. This would Make AP ezreal able to sustain in lane no problems.\n\nOld EZ Lvl 18 with just Gun blade\nBase ATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nGun blade + 40 AD and 80 AP\nTotal AD 142.5\nTotal AP: 80\nOLD W rank 5 - (250 + 80% AP) (250 + 64) 314 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 156.75 + 32) 303.75\n\nTotal combo - 314 +303.75 = 617.75\n\nNew EZ Lvl 18 with just Gun blade\nBase ATTACK DAMAGE 102.5\nGun blade + 40 AD and 80 AP\nTotal AD 142.5\nTotal AP: 80\nNew W rank 5 - (255 + 60% bonus AD + 40% AP) (255 + 24 + 32) 311 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 156.75 + 32) 303.75\n\nTotal combo - 311 + 303.75 = 614.75\n\nThat is a total loss of 3 Damage from 1 combo, and you now have passive sustain from W for mana and heal for all damage dealt.\n\nFor AP ez I would recommend\nStarting either  + or  or  or \nWith mana not being as much of a concern as there was no mana refunds on EZ's you can build much differently\nI would go with either  or  (I wonder if Luden's Echo Passive procs new Ezreal W)\nFull build I would think\n     \n\nAlthough This Build would probably be disgusting for AP ezreal for straight damage with the AD and AP scalings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2018-09-27T21:16:58.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think an important aspect of his new W that you're overlooking is the mana sustain. The spell he used to pop it has its mana cost refreshed, plus an extra 60 mana. That's a pretty big deal in terms of lane sustain, especially when you consider his ult counts. The new Ezreal can stay in lane longer, get more gold, and deal more damage because he doesn't run out of mana as fast. \n\nThere's also the issue of consistency. The old W had a very slow projectile speed and less range than the new one. Even though you had more chances to throw it out there, you were also more likely to miss. It's quite easy to proc the new W with an auto.","replies":[{"poster":"xSovereignty TTV","date":"2018-09-27T21:43:18.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you only get the mana back from a spell hit, which means trying to hit a Q through minions or Eing into the enemy and getting trade damaged back in most cases.
