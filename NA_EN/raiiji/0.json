Ive followed most of these steps and still encounter the same issue. Ive never encountered this issue atleast not as badly until this recent patch. Its not my internet (atleast i dont think) Ive done the speed test and I used to be able to have up to 3 friends play LoL all at once on my internet. But Now I can barely play a good game. My friend using a Mac on the same internet also encounters the problem. \n\nI dont know if its League itself, My connection, or my computer. simply lost. please help.","replies":[]}]}]}
