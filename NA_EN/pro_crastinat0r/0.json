I would also like to thank my three brothers, whose taunts about how big of a nerd I am will finally be silenced when they realized just how awesome I am for hitting gold. Finally I would like to thank my girlfriend, whose pleas for me to \"stop playing fucking video games and pay attention to me\" have fallen on deaf ears for three years.

I've been playing for about a year and a half, have made it up to gold 2 this season but can't seem to get past gold 3-2 (keep dropping, going back up, dropping). I really want to hit plat but this seems to keep happening: \n\n\"Nice, 5 wins in a row I'm carrying a lot, oh I made it into my series again. 2 out 3 should be easy.\" Queue people trolling/afking/playing well below what the tier would imply. Every series. It make you dread going into series even after win streaks. Sure, it's \"bad luck\" when that happens. But it's also just a really terrible system that doesn't even make sense mathematically, it requires you to have 66% win rate (much higher than what it takes to gradually climb) in a course of 3 games which is too small a sample to show any kind of trend. And if you fail it, it drops you way down again.\n\nBasically, climbing up the ladder requires skill, but suddenly you hit your series and it's all about luck. I don't know why you would design a competitive ladder like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BuyMeSkinsPls","date":"2015-06-13T02:50:13.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha. +1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-11T18:06:39.505+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":1,"body":"Congrats! :D","replies":[{"poster":"pro crastinat0r","date":"2015-06-11T21:17:30.444+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG two life goals completed in two days!\n\nGet to gold, check\n\nHave a Red respond to one of my posts, check","replies":[{"poster":"Treyen","date":"2015-06-12T09:27:30.143+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"grats but...you have some pretty limited life goals if those are on the list","replies":[{"poster":"pro crastinat0r","date":"2015-06-12T18:11:08.674+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Limited life goals?????
