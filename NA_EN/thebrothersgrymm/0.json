Hextech skins are very exclusive. You can only get them through gemstones. So, do you really want someone like Ornn's only other skin to be something that you can't immediately get? Victorious skins are the same way. Champions with very few skins aren't chosen for them because they don't want a champion's only other skin to be something so exclusive.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBrothersGrymm","date":"2019-08-05T08:51:32.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:26}}  all havnt gotten skins in awhile and would be better","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-05T08:55:07.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heim's last skin was last year.\nZilean is confirmed to be getting a skin this year.\nMorde just got reworked.\nHextech Xerath is basically the same as his base.\nRek'Sai doesn't have enough skins, and I don't think Skarner does either.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tailypo","date":"2019-08-05T05:07:54.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus doesnt have many good skins.
