She can all-in incredibly early and reliably, and if she takes ignite and lands even one cc, you're probably going to have to back, if you're not dead, and you can rest assured Riven took a LOT less damage than you.\n\nIn my experience, anyway.\n\nHowever, to the \"no champ is truly high skill cap\" I think Azir would be considered a true high skill champ. Lots of fun and very strong but it really is a struggle for the average (i.e. non-challenger) person to be aware of your soldiers positions as well as your own in a hectic teamfight where a slip up could mean chain-cc to death. It gets easier with time, obviously, but still requires serious micro. \n\nRiven?
