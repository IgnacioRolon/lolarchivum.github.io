But I'm concerned that doing so will actually harm his identity as a burst mage. But at the same time, his W really feels like half a spell without his E to land it reliably.\r\n\r\nAlso, since veig's Q has been able to hit 2 creeps for a while now, do you  have any data to share with us showing just how much the average stacks as increased? Do these numbers seem low, high? expected, unexpected?\r\n\r\nAnd finally, after this patch goes through, what are your hopes it will have for veigar? How much of an impact do you think they will have on him?","replies":[{"poster":"Conturbatio","date":"2015-03-25T12:02:09.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Actually, {{champion:134}} is a burst mage. More fun to play than the current {{champion:45}}. Her Q is much easier to hit (since it deals damage to all enemies) and has a shorter cooldown at all ranks. She has a higher range, and doesn't rely on her stun that much. And her ult deals way more Damage than Veigar's (against non-AP champions).\nWith just 840 AP, {{champion:134}} can deal a maximum of 1260 + (140% AP) = 1260 + 1176 = 2436 damage with just a click (assuming she spawned 4 more spheres) on a higher range (750 range) at level 16. While {{champion:45}} has a base damage of 500 + (100% AP ratio), he can only reach 2436 if he gets around 1963 AP from items + Q, which is impossible unless the game lasts 2 hours or longer. Even {{champion:134}}'s minimum damage at lvl 16 deals more base damage than Veigar's ult (540).\nI remember destroying too many pre-nerf {{champion:45}} in mid. Didn't even have a hard against them, they fed me so much + I rushed a bit tanky (RoA) so I wouldn't get bursted from their 80% enemy ap ratio on their ult. Even when their jungler ganked, I still got either {{champion:45}} or both without dying.\n\nCurrently {{champion:134}} is my favorite champion because she's also a **\"Single Target Burst Mage\"** and still able to teamfight after using her ult, unlike pre-nerf and the current {{champion:134}} who either dies after killing 1 champion or just watch the teamfight since he can't do anything anyways.\n\nBut, if they nerf {{champion:134}}.... I'll be so fking done with this game. I'm playing her atm mostly because her lore matches her playstyle (a dark sovereign bringing destruction and fear to the battlefield with her immense powers) unlike {{champion:45}} who's only good at speaking and telling fairy tales.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-03-25T14:49:36.926+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"syndra has too much range/utility/aoe to be called a dedicated single target burst mage.
