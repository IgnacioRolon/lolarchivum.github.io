The only thing is that when i open \"the client\" my internet stops working properly. Also i have tested this connection and it seems that \"LOL\" is the only game that gives me this type of errors/failurs any help is appreciated. thanks for your time! \r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-08T01:49:04.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since League seems to be the only thing that isn't connecting successfully, it might be caused by either firewalls/antivirus blocking that connection to our servers or it could be network settings related. Let's take a few minutes to step back and troubleshoot this problem before hopping into more matchmade games that could get you longer LPQ's from this.\n\nGo through the steps outlined in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as well as disabling any firewalls/antivirus while League is running.
