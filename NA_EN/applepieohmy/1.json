There are people who actually come back to league JUST to play URF. I cannot for the life of me understand, how allowing it be a custom game mode, like ARAM was back in the day, harm anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Kusinator","date":"2018-11-09T17:13:55.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play the game from time to time when URF is not out, but I play a lot more when URF is out.
