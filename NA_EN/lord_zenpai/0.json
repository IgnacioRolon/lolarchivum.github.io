In game, i can be playing normally and then all of a sudden i will start lagging extremely hard. I check my internet, and nothing is wrong. I check all my settings and diagnostics, and nothing is out of the ordinary. My in game ping stays at a steady 47-48 m/s. The problem has gotten to the point where I can type or use an ability and not see it happen for upwards of 2 minutes in game.\r\nIf anyone has any thoughts or suggestions to help, i would love to hear them because this has made League practically impossible for me to play at this point. Thank you!{{champion:85}}","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2017-05-03T04:31:06.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm, with only this context, this does sound like traditional lag/packet loss.
