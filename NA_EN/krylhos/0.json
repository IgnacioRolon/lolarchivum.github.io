{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2014-07-11T23:58:41.727+0000","title":"Change Log","subforum":"Boards Feedback","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"*There’s some changes coming to the community beta next week; check out a live preview here: [boards.na.leagueoflegends.com](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/).  It’s new and shiny, but it’s mirroring the content from the current design. Any discussions or comments you create will populate in both versions.*\n\n###**Change Log**\n\nWelcome to Boards beta!\n\nIt’s been a while since we introduced the Community Beta. Over the months since the CB debuted, we’ve been posting and commenting, lurking and reading feedback. Today, we’re rolling out what the team has been working on. We’re still in beta, and we’ll continue to respond to feedback and make changes. As a result, the Change Log works just like the Patch Notes, just with 100% less Pwyff.  Whenever we make a change to the boards, you’ll find it neatly annotated here with an explanation of why we did it. Let’s saw into the first edition of the Boards Change Log.\n\n-Boards Team\n\n\n####**General**\n\n> *So generally speaking, we’ve integrated a new visual style that enhances clarity and addresses a ton of player feedback. We’ve added enhanced moderation tools including action notifications you’ll hear more about below. For those of you who prefer a “flat” or chronological viewing format, we’ve overhauled the way it works on the boards. With additional improvements to discussions and commenting, we’re attempting to solve the problems you identified and build a platform that fits what the community needs.*\n> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n> *-Not Pwyff*\n\n####**Boards (formerly known as “Communities”)**\n\n> *It was kind’ve presumptuous for us to call these “communities” as if we were making them. With the new name and style, we took the opportunity to establish the boards as gathering places for content and discussions.*\n\n> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*-Not Pwyff*\n\nWe’ve changed, added, and removed some boards (listed below) from the Official Boards list. We’ve also updated all of the Guidelines for each board to help clarify general culture and etiquette.\n\n* “Site Feedback” has been renamed **“Boards Feedback”**\n* “Live Gameplay” has been changed to **“Live Gameplay Balance”**\n* “Summoner’s Rift” has been renamed **“Maps & Modes”**\n* “Riot Official” has been renamed **“Announcements”**\n* “Fan Creations” has been renamed **“Community Creations”**\n* “Pentakill” has been removed, but will return as part of a new board we’re planning in the future\n\n####**Moderation**\n\n> *We heard loud and clear that accurate and fast moderation is really, really important to a ton of you. Equally important is knowing why an action has been taken, and knowing that your reports are reaching real people. We’ve added a number of tools to our moderation toolkit, and poros.*\n> \n>*-Not Pwyff (note: there are no poros)*\n\nWe’ve focused a majority of our time lately rebuilding our moderation team and approach. Our biggest addition to this version of the boards is Moderation Action Notifications. Now, whenever a moderation action is taken within the Boards you’ll be notified in your boards profile.\n\n* Moderation Action Notifications\n  * You will receive Notifications for the following actions:\n   * When discussions or comments are deleted\n   * When you are suspended from the boards\n* Report button added on all comments and discussions\n* All reports go into a queue monitored by our moderation team 24/7\n\n####**Discussions**\n\n>*Participating in discussions is literally the main function of the boards, so we’ve concentrated a number of our redesign efforts improving embedded media, attachments, share functionality, and thumbnails. Sprinkle in some additional improvements to creating discussions, and finish with clarity and a more defined visual hierarchy.*\n\n>*-Not Pwyff*\n\nBefore our recent focus on moderation, the actual discussions that would happen on the boards were some of our highest priorities. We needed to expand the supported media types, and make it easier to add attachments. Taking into consideration feedback on the Community Beta, we simplified sharing to Twitter and Facebook. There’s a number of other discussion-related improvements, especially when creating a discussion whether from the homeboard or within a board.\n\n* Improved Embed media (a few supported examples below)\n  * YouTube\n  * Twitch\n  * SoundCloud\n  * Vimeo\n  * Spotify\n  * Vine\n  * Instagram\n* Share to Twitter and Facebook from individual discussions\n* Thumbnail/image support on boards list\n* You can now create discussions from the boards home screen\n* You can now select the board you want to post to during discussion creation\n* Improved clarity and visual hierarchy\n* Cleaned up attachments \n\n####**Commenting**\n> *Creating discussions is great and all, but being able to comment and join in is also kinda crucial. We’ve removed the reply limit and made it easier to see new comments when you’re in discussion view. For those of you who prefer to view all posts in chronological order (like for role-playing--that’s for you, Kaz) you can now switch to chronological view and the boards will remember your preference. This is only the first step towards the completion of Skynet, so we’re okay with it.*\n\n>*-Not Pwyff*\n\nWe got a ton of feedback on how commenting worked on the Community Beta. Some of the biggest changes include the removal of the reply limit, and tweaking the way Rioter comments look for readability. Feedback regarding necessary features often centered on “flat” or “forum” view options, so we’ve added a suite of enhancements like a Quote button and the ability to select Chronological view as your preferred way to browse.\n\n* Removed reply limit\n* Flat View is now ‘Chronological View’ with the following changes:\n  * Comments listed from oldest to most recent\n  * Added Quote button\n  * Replying is now included in this view\n  * Reporting now available within Chronological view\n* When switching to Chronological view, this selection will be remembered as you browse the rest of the Boards\n* New comments are now easier to see in Discussion View\n\n####**Bug Fixes**\n\n>*Bugs happen, we exterminate like Blitzcrank when we can. Not much more to add. We’ll update the Bug Fixes section pretty frequently. If you find any bugs or have additional feedback, please [head to the feedback section here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback) and create a new discussion.*\n\n>*-Not Pwyff*\n\nThe following bugs have been squashed:\n\n* Attachment difficulties in IE\n* Speed issues on boards listing and when searching\n* Hover on player name sticking to the wrong place\n* Minor issues within Rioter Comment box\n* Chronological view info not updating as fast as Discussion view\n* Permalink acting weird in URL strings\n* Profiles were getting confused, basically dopplegangers in your profiles","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-07-12T00:41:24.292+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure I'm a fan of you, not pwyff.","replies":[{"poster":"Ashe Jungle","date":"2014-07-12T16:30:42.016+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"I assure you, the feeling is mutual.\n\n2016-2-28 edit: Before the name change today, this account was named \"Not Pwyff.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"randomy","date":"2014-07-12T06:18:09.796+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"BRB naming my Pokemon rival \"Not Pwyff\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zerglinator","date":"2014-07-12T00:13:12.384+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa, it's dark in here.

As clunky as that system was, something similar is going to be necessary if we're all going to be able to talk to each other.  I mean, if it was just a traditional message board, presumably we'd all quite each other all the time when responding, but if other posters are going to have nested discussions, we'll need some reference while in chronological view to see what's going on.\n\nOtherwise chronological view is going to be nothing but a stream of non sequiturs. In fact, I imagine that communication going the other way is also going to need help to make sense  Direct quotes and responses in chronological view would need somehow be fitted into the nested conversations of discussion view, otherwise we might end up with a similar series of non sequitur posts that that start new branches while trying to continue ongoing discussions.\n\nAlso a little more robust quoting would be useful, hopefully including the quoted party's name and a link to their original comment? Right now it's just a slightly formatted copy and paste feature.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bourmegar","date":"2014-07-14T19:03:46.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dear Riot Gods, when I try t upvote on the new Board I get asked to login while I am already logged in and when I do Login trouth that, Nothing happens\n\nwill u gods pls fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2014-07-14T19:49:55.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That sounds like a bug!

The page lags, especially when loading (because you parse markdown in javascript instead of server-sided parsing, because you generate ALL the vote buttons at page load time). The time up to load is about 20-30 seconds, according to YSlow and Firebug.\n\nI have already posted about using cache and no-cookie domains (especially important with your sick cookie over-usage). So please, take a look on these things! I know this is beta, but debugging is also MUCH easier when the page loads faster!\n\nAlso permalinks are still very bad, partially because you use GET parameters to pass them and your page loads for  20 seconds as I mentioned. Before the script that handles permalinks takes effect I'm already scrolling and reading posts.\n\nPlease don't lie to me, you won't get far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MajorPain9","date":"2014-07-12T18:59:56.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chronological should be default.
