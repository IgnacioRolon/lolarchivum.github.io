There was an extremely salty Taliyah on the other team, and she posted a link in the after game chat. I clicked on it because I didn't know she was that mad, It was a big mistake however.. When I clicked it I got an image on my screen that said \"now I know your IP\" and my ip adress was displayed to me on the screen. What should I do that this person now has my IP? Today he added me, I was kinda worried about what he was gonna do, so I accepted then he posted my IP adress and kept sending it to me over and over again. Telling me he was gonna post it on 4chan and he kept repeating stuff like \"youre terrified right now, arent you?\" And he said \"It wont be a nice day for you.\" Can anyone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T22:58:28.661+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as others have suggested, I'd strongly urge you to shoot us a ticket with any screenshots of those messages you may have gotten. We can definitely look into it because that's really not cool to have other people possibly harassing you like that. Shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and make sure to give as much relevant information (like screenshots of chat logs) as you can!","replies":[]},{"poster":"legands","date":"2017-05-11T03:19:14.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should probably send a ticket to riot for further security","replies":[{"poster":"xZed Pool","date":"2017-05-11T03:29:29.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right I should.

However, if that isn't fully comforting enough for you,  If you have browser logs of connection activity you can look back over, you can see if anything was downloaded when you went to the sight as well as who/what/where your connection was to (look for address forwarding etc to sketchy domains and IPs in the private domain), and if you were to compare those with any changes in registry/system files at/around the same time, then it may be a slightly more worrisome incident. The likelihood of some troll doing that is a bit slim for game-rage, but not out of the question.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
