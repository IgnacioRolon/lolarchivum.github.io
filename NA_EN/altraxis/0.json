MAC user","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So a few days ago I bought a new router (Belkin N300 from a Netgear). Had league do its updated and tried to play a game. Every time I'd get into a game or even the loading screen it would disconnect/crash. It has been like this for a few days. I've changed the DNS, done the port forwarding, even uninstalled and did a fresh install. It continued to pop up with the error. I now went to the actual folder with LoL and went to the deploy folder, etc until i got to the LoLPatcher and right now I have that loading to see if it will do the same thing. I can get as far as 60% before the error pops up. Help please!\n\nThis is a Mac Mini (I believe), its just a small motherboard. I'm also up to date with the latest iOS for Mac.\n\nEdit: I was able to complete the download but when I try to get into a game, it just crashes on me. I will try restarting my router and see if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T18:12:49.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this happened just after replacing your other router, I recommend swapping your old router back in to see if anything changes. If you're able to bypass the issue, then the new router may be faulty. Additionally, you can try a wired connection to your router to see if this is caused by the wireless adapter in your Mac (if you're connected via WiFi).\n\nLet me know if either of those caused a change.","replies":[]}]}
