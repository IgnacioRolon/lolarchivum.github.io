And when it does hit it's actualy able to infinitely stun the target. It's worked on jungle camps, creeps and most importantly champions. Although it was kinda hilarious to see at the start it would get pretty hectic if it stayed unnoticed.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-27T19:10:39.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya MsGreatness,\n\nThanks for the report!
