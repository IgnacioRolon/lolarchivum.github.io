When the League of Legends logo appears, the patcher itself needs to check if it is properly up to date by checking files found on your computer to make sure it can launch properly.  Once it checks this, it contacts our servers to see if there is any update that needs to be downloaded for the patcher itself.  \n\nIf the patcher allows the logo appears, but then goes away and ***nothing happens***, this does appear to be the patcher failing to patch itself.  The steps in this guide should help resolve this issue:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/28732434-Patching-Issues\n\nIf you are still unable to get the patcher to appear normally, regardless of the steps in this guide, then make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us.
