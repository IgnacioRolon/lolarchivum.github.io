I have a 4th Mission where I have to either \"win a game with a Noxian champ on team\", or \"Win 2 ARURF games\", did not complete for me when I won 2 Normal Summoner's Rift games with Noxian champs (1st game: Riven; 2nd game, Talon, Darius, and me playing Cassio).\n\nSo no, the bug exists, but its triggered, or present because of another factor.\n\nJust GREAT.... will loose much valuable blue and orange essence because I'm going on Vacations to the wilds in 2 days. Thanks RITO again for removing IP Points and replacing them with something that requires mine constant participation in every event you throw at us, just to get that new champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHASE EM ALL","date":"2018-07-01T02:12:01.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same (NA)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wihtiw","date":"2018-06-30T21:35:52.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here I finished 2missions (8th and 7th for 2times)(eu west)12hours its a bit late","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunkerchef","date":"2018-06-30T18:57:11.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same (eu west)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GangerHrolf","date":"2018-06-30T14:32:03.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"XDethRoweX","date":"2018-06-30T14:27:25.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue.
