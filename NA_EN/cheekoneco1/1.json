I know Katarina has 2 Limited Edition Skins and are unavailable to purchase, but on the League of Legends Wiki it says that the Slay Belle Katarina skin is \"Available during Snowdown 2013\". Unlike the Limited Edition Skins the RP price for the skin is not crossed out. Does this mean that Slay Belle Katarina will possibly make a return in a future Snowdown?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-29T21:11:11.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Slay Belle Katarina is a legacy skin, which means that it makes periodic returns to the shop. :]","replies":[{"poster":"ONZED","date":"2016-09-17T00:12:02.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok is slay belle Katerina coming back waiting for 3 -4 years still not here","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-19T21:52:26.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She comes around during the winter season. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Relic Fades","date":"2016-11-29T02:10:52.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so will she be back this Christmas?
