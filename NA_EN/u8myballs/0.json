However, today I realised that I couldn't use them in game anymore. I'm not sure what the problem is, as I can still use them in other games and in web browsers. I am not sure what caused this problem and I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the mouse drivers and I have troubleshooted my league client. I don't know anyone else who is having this problem but I would appreciate any help on this. Thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T01:17:27.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been a lot of reports from players running the Windows Creator Update who haven't been able to properly bind those mouse buttons anymore. We can try a couple different quick steps though.\n\n- Try going into a practice game and changing those keybinds there instead of on the client\n- Force a manual config reset by going into the install directory and deleting the Config folder\n\nLet me know if either one of those work, and if not I can do a little more investigating!","replies":[{"poster":"u8myballs","date":"2017-06-01T22:16:34.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any word on when this is going to be fixed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"u8myballs","date":"2017-05-15T23:40:38.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither worked sadly.
