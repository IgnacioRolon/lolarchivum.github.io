I tried numerous times, running a VPN, restarting my computer, disabling my antivirus, and restarting my router to no avail. I can't uninstall league to reinstall because it gets stuck on \"preparing to uninstall\".","replies":[{"poster":"Lights And Magic","date":"2016-08-02T23:13:29.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay turns out I had some drive errors that I had to fix.

A setting with your OS may be preventing your files from completing the scan, and needs access.  As a first step, I suggest going over our [permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide which will provide a series of instructions to restore permissions to your game files.  This should get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
