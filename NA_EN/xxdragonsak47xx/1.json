So if both wraith camps are dead, and she kills a marked Scuttle, the OTHER scuttle will 100% be the next mark. She can go and wait for it, and kill it the very second it gets marked. And then the next mark will 100% be the opposing jungler's Wraiths. Meanwhile..... the other jungler is trying to get reds.... blues, gank, etc, and can't get around the map as fast as her.

It's also not an option for close range combat for that reason, despite doing a good chunk of damage.) \n\n--> Increase her AA range to 525 - 550 (This to compete with other ADCs if they want her to be viable bot lane)\n\nThis all depends on where they would like to see her. I really like her as an adc personally, but I definitely don't really pop off until two items in (plus boots) and that's a long time to wait. She can't take the typical spread of one damage item, one AS item early like most adcs to give them better rounded stats, because she needs to prioritize her first upgrade.
