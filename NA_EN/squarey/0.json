The automated system picked up this behavior right after the game finished.\n\n> I could understand a chat restriction but I was even clearly sarcastic with most of my trolling\n\nZero tolerance is a special area that automatically escalates your penalty; it will always result in either a 14-day ban or permanent ban depending on the severity.\n\nWe take this type of behavior extremely seriously. Telling people to kill themselves and hate speech are big no-no's.

Especially if they can't tell the difference 1/2 the time anyways. My classmate who I play with during our 2 hour break between classes got escalated to a 14 ban for saying \" That's my %%%%%!\"  after a lulu ult save.

To certain groups of friends that isn't, but that still doesn't make it acceptable to bring into a social situation where you don't know the perspectives of the other people.\n\nAnd saying the only choices are hate speech or no chat at all is a little ridiculous. There are many places that put reasonable limits on how far you're allowed to take a certain activity, and Riot saying hate speech crosses a line is far from unusual.","replies":[{"poster":"Squarey","date":"2017-10-09T21:37:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"LOL.
