That's not how the process of conversion works. He builds 50% AS and benefits from 50% AS because 50% AS gives him +12.5% AD.\n\nBut the funny bit is how you assume that high AS inherently means higher dps. That is not the case. Anyone who has raided as a hunter in WoW for progression can tell you about clipping auto-shots. Why isn't haste amazing on Hunters? Because haste doesn't make your spells faster and most of your damage is white damage but yellow damage. You couldn't auto-shot while moving or casting steady shot in Wrath.\n\nThis is extremely similar to ADC behavior; you can't attack while moving or casting spells. The conclusion is the same: moving lowers white dps. Jhin's advantage is that he has a much larger window to move without clipping autos. This is in fact the reason why Kog is hard to play; the tinniest amount of movement significantly lowers his dps whereas maximizing dps makes you stand still and opens you up for retaliation.\n\nBut finally, *Attack Speed on Jhin makes all of his abilities hit harder*. Ignoring abilities that have INSANE AD ratios is ridiculous. Of course the conversion ratio isn't going to be 1:1.
