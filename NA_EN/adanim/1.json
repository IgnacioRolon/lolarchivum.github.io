In his lore it is said that the scroll which Ryze keeps on his back is indestructible, but in the video \"A Twist of Fate\", his scroll is cut by Nocturne.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ryze/SkinsTrivia","image":"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120801131905/leagueoflegends/images/c/ce/Ryze_OriginalSkin.jpg"},"up_votes":63,"down_votes":5,"body":"&quot;In the U.R.F game mode (available in April 2014), Ryze was disabled in non-custom games.

His previous iteration was unhealthy because there wasn't any moment where he was especially stronger or weaker, and so led to this really flat power expression where he was either too weak to do anything or too strong to ever be approached, with no middle ground in-between. Currently, Ryze has an issue with being able to perma-root targets while empowered, which is obviously not healthy, but that's being fixed next patch via reductions to Arcane Mastery's uptime and Rune Prison's duration.","replies":[{"poster":"dr lichdeath","date":"2015-06-12T21:30:22.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i really dont get it why do they feel the need to nerf the w duration its not even a second? might as well remove the root and replace it with an instant dmg skill","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-06-13T04:08:24.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rune Prison's duration scales from 1 to 1.4 seconds on the PBE.

They changed his E to reduce %MR, it was flat before. % Is worse than flat in almost every situation, the enemy would need to have over 200 MR for his new 12% shred to be better than the old 24 flat shred. The mana ratio on his E was doubled and it's a lot more reliable now, you don't have to hope for lucky bounces.\nThe movement speed on his ult wasn't changed.\n\nOh yeah, and his passive reduces cooldowns by like 4s instead of 1s when it's active. He can get off 4 snares in a row before the previous snare wears off, old Ryze couldn't even get close to that level of bs.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-14T08:32:42.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol no","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"manliestdino","date":"2015-06-12T21:36:51.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhhhhhh....
