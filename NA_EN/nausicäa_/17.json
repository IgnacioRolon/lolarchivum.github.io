Runes that give movespeed such as Predator, Relentless Hunter and Celerity.  Regardless of how good or bad champions like Hecarim are in the current meta, should a build that involves running at you with 600+ movespeed and one shotting you really be supported? Giving already highly mobile champions more move speed serves only to remove counterplay and increase frustration.\n\nMobility Runes mainly benefit champions that are already highly mobile giving them insane move speed and engage potential on immobile champions. In the build up to last pre season Riot showcased Predator as something to be taken on champions like {{champion:91}}. Why would you create a rune specifically to add more mobility to a champion who already has a dash, and movespeed increase and the ability to jump over walls???? This shows that the intent of this Rune was simply to make mobile champions more mobile. Talon as it turns out does not usually take Predator, and its uses are just a bunch of niche/abuse cases allowing for cheesey engages/one shots.\n\nMobility Runes are usually not taken by and considerably less effective on immobile champions(%move speed increase is lower with lower movespeed giving little benefit) so their existence is essentially just to make champions with gap closers stronger.\n\nSecond, some champions with high mobility need trade offs. \nWhy do  some high mobility champions sometimes have more damage,cc and more innate durability than immobile champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2018-09-30T07:44:22.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":">Why do some high mobility champions sometimes have more damage and more innate durability than immobile champions? \n\nwell thats pretty vague \n\nalso Annie is immobile and often goes predator","replies":[{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2018-09-30T07:47:56.863+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is consistent with what i said about Predator mostly being used for cheesy abuse cases.

Compare champions who have mobility to those who don't? They often have superior base damage, ratios, or resource costs. If an Assassin like Ekko can keep up or clear just as fast as a mage like Lux with a single skill that also has a lower cooldown, lower mana cost, and higher damage? Being able to wallhop is also pretty huge.\n\nSome of these new champions like Camille make Riven look modest in comparison.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-09-30T14:11:53.732+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding the fact that there are some choices regarding mobility that don't even make sense\n{{champion:142}} using a summoner spell giving her a huge burst of movement speed, even if it's her own spell (why the fuck is this a thing)\n{{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3095}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}} Hail of blades, yeah \"immobile marksman\" my ass","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-09-30T20:04:12.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get really annoyed when people say move speed isnt mobility.

Unreliable spells are the most common. Try landing lux's or zigg's q at max range. Its almost impossible.  Even xerath's q is difficult to land if the enemy is constantly on guard.
