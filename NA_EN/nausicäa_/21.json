Riot nerfed Athene's because they thought that it limited item diversity. Well now everyone merely builds a different item instead and there is still no diversity in AP item purchases.\n\nMorellonomicon has more regen, more AP, is 600 gold cheaper and has a situationally powerful and underated grievous wounds effect. Meanwhile all Athene's has over Morellonomicon now is a mediocre amount of Magic resist.\n\nI think that the items are currently in a decent spot in terms of stats, with Athene's being a more defensive item and Morellonomicon being a more offensive item. The main problem is that the cost disparity is way too high. To solve this i would suggest slighly reducing the cost of Athenes to 2500 and slightly increasing the cost of Morellonomicon to 2300. This way there might actually be a reasonable choice rather than Morellonomicon automatically being the superior option.\n\nEdit according to lol Wiki\nStatistical Value\n\n80 ability power = 1740g                                 \n100% base mana regeneration = 720g\n20% cooldown reduction = 633g\nTotal Gold Value = 3093g\n\n60 ability power = 1305g\n25 magic resist = 500g\n50% mana regen = 360g\n20% cooldown reduction = 633g\nTotal Gold Value = 2798g\n(The new Athene's passive is significantly worse than 50% base mana regen  so its safe to assume its gold value is roughly around 250g, even with this passive included Morellonomicon's stats have a higher gold value)\n\nMana Font: Mages average between 1100-1200 Mana at level 18. If you have 0 Mana you gain 18 regen, if you have 50% mana you have 9 regen. The extra 50% base mana regen on Morellonomicon gives you 10 mana regen AT ALL times at level 18.\n\n\nMorellonomicon is way too gold efficient.","replies":[{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-12-08T01:35:16.798+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ironically enough, what limits item diversity in LoL... is a lack of Item diversity... smh\n\nThey even removed Negatron Cloak...

Examples would include the Hexdrinker, Abyssal Scepter (even though it built out of, and apparently will again, a Negatron Cloak), or Wit's End.\n\nI think the fact that a Carry would build a full tank item (pretty much the only option at the moment, given that Banshee's is just too good right now) is absurd.

I think the change in preference has more to do with the changes to mana regen: before Preseason 5, Morellonomicon and Athene's had the same amount of flat mana regen, except AUG also had Mana Font and its regen-on-kill/assist passive. Now Morellonomicon's 100% base mana regen is a buff to its late-game regeneration, whereas AUG's 50% base mana regen and different Mana Font passive makes it a less attractive choice for early game mana sustain.\n\nWhile Morellonomicon perhaps needs a price increase, I think Athene's has more of a problem here: for all intents and purposes, it's pretty much a Morellonomicon that trades 20 AP for 25 MR (or, alternatively, Morellonomicon is an AUG that ditches the small amount of MR for a more straightforward AP boost), so they're both competing for the same niche. When AUG is strong, Morellonomicon gets rarely picked, and vice versa. However, from the past seasons AUG was a consistent mage pick because of how {{item:3028}} was practically compulsory to getting an edge in lane. Its MR allowed you to take less poke, and its mana regen allowed you to poke without having to worry too much about mana conservation, so an AP-versus-AP mid lane tended to be an arms race where the first one to get a Chalice could out-perform their opponent on every level. Grail exacerbated those issues by letting the wielder cast stronger spells a lot more frequently, all while mitigating the enemy's magic damage. Making Grail the dominant pick again would just reinstate the arms race, whereas the build path for Morellonomicon doesn't immediately solve the wielder's mana issues, nor does it guarantee defense against the enemy's damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2014-12-08T02:52:28.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Morellonomicon don't immediately solve the wielder's mana issues\n\nForbidden Idol, a component in Morellonomicon has 60% base mana regen for 600 gold.\n\nGrail is 1000 gold and has 50% base mana regen.

When Mana Font is sufficiently strong on its own, particularly in the early game, it just means your champion doesn't have to worry about mana problems at all.

So maybe i misread, but you chose to completely ignore that it even existed just to fit your idea.\n\nMana Font: Mages average between 1100-1200 Mana at level 18. If you have 0 Mana you gain 18 regen, if you have 50% mana you have 9 regen. The extra 50% base mana regen on Morellonomicon gives you 10 mana regen AT ALL times at level 18.\n\nMath isnt your strong suit either.","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2014-12-08T21:04:44.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok...you want to do this lets do this.\n\n1200 max mana\n\nat 0 mana you will get 1.5% of missing mana per 5. 1.5% of 1200 is 18 mana per 5 <---thats just mana font\n\n50% base mana regen at level 18 is about 4 in addition per 5\n\nso if 50% is 4 then 100 is 8 in this scenario\n\n\nso base of 8 plus 8 bonus= 16 total...not ten at all levels, so math mistake 1\n\n18 plus 8 = 26 which is greater than 16 so wrong again...i dont know how to say this, but maybe you got too excited at your golden opportunity to be asshole that you made a slight miscalculation?","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-12-08T22:11:45.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"At level 18 Syndra, for example, has 1184 mana\nAt level 1 she has 6 mp5 with a growth scaling of 0.8 per level.  This means at level 18 Syndra has 19.6 base mp5\n-------------------------\nMorellonomicon will give an additional 19.6 mp5 at level 18, up to a total of 39.2 mp5 or 7.84 mana per second\n\nAthenes will give an additional 9.8 mp5 at level 18, up to a total of 29.4 mp5 or 5.88 mana per second.  The breakpoint for Athenes providing more mana return is at (39.2 - 29.4) = (0.015)(missing mana), or missing mana = 653.33\n-------------------------\n653.33 mana is 55% of syndra's total mana pool.  This means for the tooltip-stated athenes to work at efficiency when compared to Morellonomicon.  This leaves 531 mana for syndra to work with in order to maintain item efficiency, but now let's look at her mana costs:\n\nDark Sphere - 80 Mana, Cooldown 4s (reduced by 25% with athenes + mastery = 3s)\nForce of Will - 100 Mana\nScatter the Weak - 50 Mana\nUnleashed Power - 100 Mana\n------------------------------\nAnalysis:\n\nI listed the cooldown of her Q because this is essentially Syndra's auto attack in the later stages of the game.  You can expect almost 100% uptime on this ability when it is off cooldown in fights.  All 3 abilities are often used for waveclear and poking.  330 mana is required for her 'full combo' and therefore must be conserved. 410 if you want to consider that most Syndra players will Q twice before ulting.  So this leaves, generously, about 854 mana that can be expended before Syndra is forced to stop using her abilities for a little while to regenerate.  \n\nKeep in mind that when the value goes lower than 653.33 Athenes is no longer the efficient choice.  So you essentially have a 200 mana gap to work with between what is considered efficient use of athenes versus blowing your entire load and becoming useless for a really long time regardless of your mana regen item. \n\nWith Athenes you get 42.21 mp5 if you are missing 854 mana.  The theoretical maximum.  With morellonomicon you have 100% uptime on 39.2 mp5.  So you tell me, which is better?  I think the answer is obvious.","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2014-12-08T23:13:37.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so in your analysis you have to be at 45% or less mana for athenes to be better? ok sure ill just go with that.

You're about as useful as an ADC that can auto attack every 3 seconds.  Good players manage their mana to keep it above that threshold in the event that a fight breaks out. Therefore theoretically you should never be below 330 mana unless you're playing poorly on syndra, or unless that fight literally just happened (in which case you have plenty of time to conserve mana anyways).\n\nSo are you spending so much time in that 200 mana threshold that athenes is better?  For 500g more and 20 AP less and no Grievous Wounds?  I sincerely doubt it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
