Her E change was 100% unjustified. Her E is the crux of her entire kit, without the ability to make picks/self peel with E she is utterly worthless.\r\n\r\nPerhaps her E hitbox was too big, but these changes made it way too small. \r\n\r\nAlso can you explain why you would apply a nerf to her Q base damages when in the previous patch you also massively gutted mana regen basically double dipping a nerf?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-06T02:00:16.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut. Her E's hit box used to be so big that you didn't have to even have the ball hit anyone. If you were close enough to the person and you hit a ball with your E and hit the person with the E itself, it didn't matter of the ball went to the far left with your opponent on the far right, they took damage for the ball and got stunned. lol.","replies":[]}]}
