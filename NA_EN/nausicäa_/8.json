Heck look at after shock.  Why does it have damage on it?  I fill like everything is damage happy.\n\nExample of better runes\n\nElectrocute.  Your 3rd spell / attack you hit become a small AoE of lighthing.  (notice damage on the champ did not increase be might hit other targets.\n\nAfter shock changed to proc a small slow instead of damage.\n\nAery is just for shield and slows (increases the slow amount)\n\nComet lowers MR and AC of targets hit.  (might have to play with range and speed)\n\nPhase rush is ok because it adds game play not mindless damage.\n\nChanging some damage to true or the reverse damage (AD because AP and AP become AD  This might be a better option then \"true damage\")\n\nSee with old runes you can Micro your way into different play styles.  The new runes were made for Macro play and too MMORPGish.  These would be great as AA from EQ or talents from WoW because they effect the over all performance of the Boss fight or raid.  The old way would like you customize for the match your going against.  Example.  AC for zed mid.  Run Quince / MR against mage bot.  AC / lifesteal for jungle.  You can change it for the style of the lane and match up.  Now with the new ones its all the same and you might change one rune because its might be better.  This is compared to changing your whole page and all your stats.\n\nIf you look at some of the new runes.  You have to give someone 100 resist and level 1 or 2 just for fill tankish….. does that not seem a little crazy?\n\nThen look at how easy it is for mobile champions to proc or use all the them.  So what advance does an mobile mage have?  I mean you have to crazy buff Lee Sin because he go out champ creeped by {{champion:104}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:164}}  etc.  Its almost like dashing / mobility / cheesing is now a must for jungle.  I'm not saying these champs are op or not.  But look at the kits/damage/etc and think what if this champ was in the game 2 or 3 seasons ago as they are now.  Would they be totally busted.  If you say well times have changed.  My response would be well most of the champs you could and they would be fine so maybe newer champs went \"too far\".\n\nI don't know.  Before I  could get about the same ap starting out without all the effect / proc damage from the new runes.  Why don't you just leave the increase stats ones and removed the straight damage ones.  Its ok to increase AP/AD from run speed because that is a play style.  Its ok to do a little extra with poke, but why add two ways for the same tree.  Only one would be ok but two is over the top.  that is a play style.  Its not ok to add extra damage into a tank rune because it seems cool.  Its not ok to add ALOT of extra damage because your cool and look flashes ( looking at Electrocute).  I mean you can dodge comet so it isn't too bad.  Extra true damage because they are slowed.... just extra damage for playing your class\n\nNow we are nerfing champs mana and spells because of the extra damage from runes.  You are kill the identity and play style of champs because of your dumb runes.  Look at fiddle.  70 mana for 60 damage.  wow.  That nerf will kill him in the jungle and mid.  Instead maybe you should look at aery and scorch procing to do the same damage as the spell.  NOPE nerf fiddle.  So now once you \"fix\" the runes.  What are you going to do about the champs you killed because of the runes.  See fiddle was up for buffs / viewed as weak until you gave him a way to proc aery/comet, scorch, cheap shot (with {{item:3116}} then burning with {{item:3151}}.  So its it the spell or the 4 procs I can have that will do more damage than the spell?  But hey there hasn't been any damage creep.  I can double the damage of the spell (not counting AP either) when I use to poke.  Oh you have a diving comp.  Let me get the rune that gives me 100 to resists and then blows you up for damage at lvl 1.  Yep fear is broke.   Well sure because its a one shot meta.  Any cc is broken because it means death.   Unless you can proc your op rune that give you 100 resists for a 75% damage reduce starting at lvl 1.  You are making an op rune to counter an op rune then you have to make an op item to counter that op things and we get into the mess we are at now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2018-08-03T05:29:27.567+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be mistaken here but isn't that a very generous cooldown reduction early-game for the small damage reduction?
