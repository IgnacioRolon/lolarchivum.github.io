I didn't talk about his kit at all so comparing him to Garen diesn't concern me. But if you insist, Chogath is centered around hitting a delayed skillshot (Q) and you can even predict and outplay his silence because it's not point and click either.\n\nI actually mentioned that Garen does magic damage if the enemy is not a villian. And I also said that building MR vs him is not a good idea. Can you argue with that?\n\nHis personality has nothing to do with game play. Garen is a champion with no mechanics and if you play him 2000 games you will never do something new. Gnar has 2 forms, rage bar, and 6 abilities. It's so satisfying to make playes with him (that 4 man ult to the wall maybe). And even if looking at personality, there are many champions with deeper personalities and interesting past rather than \"the guy of justice\".\n\nThere are tons of mechanically easy champions that give more satisfiction playing them. Champions thatcan actually change games and make playes (even Annie if she can get a 4 man stun in a team fight). People do get bored. They will only play such a boring champion to gain ELO.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Garen","date":"2019-01-18T14:52:21.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"They will only play such a boring champion to gain ELO.\" \n\nTry getting diamond with Garen, I dare you.

You at least need a hexdrinker to survive a champion who is supposed to deal physical damage.\n\nRight after the crit rework, people replaced ADC bot with mages, so most team comps had no DPS. Then this happened:\n\nhttps://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/cQeYE4AX-the-most-noob-champ-has-54-win-rate-in-diamond\n\nHe was busted to the point he was the 5th most picked toplaner in Diamond+. So, yes people did abuse him in Diamond and masters.\n\nNow? They are playing another big guy with massive sword and 2 wings. He ia called Aatrox. If people liked Garen, they would stick with him because he is not weak now even in high elo statistically.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Garen","date":"2019-01-18T15:25:30.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the only reasons he was picked so much is because he did well against jax, irelia, and pre-buffed aatrox. He was a counter to these guys who are picked a lot in higher elo top lane.\n\nAnd no, ninja tabi's doesn't help with his ult. But it makes it a LOT harder for Garen to get you into execute range. His only two damage abilities are an auto attack and his spin. Most champions are mobile enough to stay out of his E range, and since his Q is an auto attack, and most Garen players max it, being able to take off 12% of it's damage plus your own armor reduction severely reduces his damage output.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-18T12:59:44.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why don't you just buy a ghostblade if you're looking for damage, it'd give you more for Garen than DD i'd imagine","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-01-18T13:06:08.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aEo0RcEl,comment-id=0003000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-18T12:59:44.294+0000)\n>\n> why don&#x27;t you just buy a ghostblade if you&#x27;re looking for damage, it&#x27;d give you more for Garen than DD i&#x27;d imagine\n\nghostblade is usually my first choice. but i was looking into combat sustain options.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-18T13:08:36.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't imagine DD would be good on Garen since he's not quite doing *enough* dmg that DD's healing becomes significant. especially with how spread out it is; if E counted as single target IF it was only hitting one person it might be decent for dueling people\n\nsuppose the bleed would be good for him but that'd muck up your healing out of combat ","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-01-18T20:36:48.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aEo0RcEl,comment-id=000300010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-18T13:08:36.533+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t imagine DD would be good on Garen since he&#x27;s not quite doing *enough* dmg that DD&#x27;s healing becomes significant. especially with how spread out it is; if E counted as single target IF it was only hitting one person it might be decent for dueling people\n> \n> suppose the bleed would be good for him but that&#x27;d muck up your healing out of combat\n\nq and auto attacks deal decent enough damage to heal a bit over the course of a fight. since they changed death dance to proc on everything, it also increases the heal on grasp.\n\nbut the main reason i tried it was for the burst heal on the ult together with triumph. there is the option to amp it up further with spirit visage.\n\nits okish to help you live through a fight. i cant decide yet if its good enough. main problem is that the item is really expensive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-01-18T20:42:21.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When tank items were good juggernauts would buy more damage because even when tank items were good there are still not comparable to damage items not instadieing if you dont have tank items mean that you can dip into heaveier damage items {{item:3812}} {{item:3080}} {{item:3508}}  if it wasnt getting reworked to only be used by 3 champions again.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-18T21:03:52.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that's not true at all, many juggernauts could even afford to buy Sunfire on their first item as far back as season 4 in top lane, and we also had many juggernauts who could jungle -- most of them built tankier than they do now. it wasn't until the official juggernaut patch in season 5 which gave us Black Cleaver that they had a \"definitive\" core item and buying more AD became encouraged.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-01-19T18:57:28.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Juggernaut was a season 5 riot mind baby so i dont know what you talking about season 4 season for most Juggernaut's were considered tanks thus they built like tanks did and even bruisers built sunfire cape first item season 3 and 4 until riot gutted the damage on the item.
