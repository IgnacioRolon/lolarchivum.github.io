This is already bad for snowball reliant champions. Then they also have free reign to spam gank bot lane (Think ASol and Taliyah especially). This accelerates game pace naturally (cause typically one team will be able to get first tower with all the ganks), which helps the ADC on their team.\n\nI mean look at how LCS has changed. In S3/S4 it was normal for midlaners to actually duel each other in lane and now they never need to do that because it's become an unnecessary risk.
