That's ult-grade material in addition to his ult-grade ultimate. Having a high cooldown on his W helps keep him somewhat weak in lane, before his power spikes, but he isn't weak enough to justify the way he scales.\n\nI agree that making Yasuo scale more gradually would greatly help him, balance-wise. Once he buys Statikk Shiv and reaches level 6, he goes from a fairly weak lane opponent for most midlaners to an excessively dangerous assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-05T00:55:05.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Braums shield has a lower cooldown than Yasuo's and it blocks EVERYTHING.

Flip, why am I wasting my time arguing with you!?\n\nI don't remember saying that Braum's shield isn't similarly problematic. I remember talking about Yasuo.\nYasuo's crits still do plenty of damage, and he can afford to build fewer crit items because of his passive (meaning he can afford to build more raw damage or other items). Infinity Edge more than makes up for the decreased crit damage, and Yasuo tends to build Infinity Edge.\nI think that a character that's mobile and is capable of one-shotting enemy carries if he lands a single knockup can be considered an assassin.\n\n\n>His Q is not steroid. His damage is not as crazy as you say, in fact it is comparable to other carries. He is easy to deal with as his play pattern is very predictable.\n\nYou do realize that we're talking about League of Legends, right? Most champions have predictable playstyles. That doesn't prevent champions from being powerful. (ex: pre-nerf {{champion:13}})\n\nFlip, why are you wasting time arguing with me?","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-05T01:08:02.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo's double crit passive is his damage steroid.

I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.\n\nYasuo's double crit passive effectively allows him to do more damage, and his ultimate gives him temporary armor penetration. That's a steroid. If your argument was that he doesn't have multiple damage steroids, and you classify his doubled crit chance as a steroid... Well. Good luck; have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-03-05T01:35:51.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just jumping in on the conversation here.\n\nEarlier I mentioned Yasuo's power curve; most Melee Carries even without bonus Critical Chance will very quickly approach 100% or near 100% Crit Chance by the late game. What this effectively means is that Yasuo's double Crit Chance is not a late game steroid, where you'd expect all his power should be in seeing that he is, again, a melee carry.\n\nIt's funny to think about it. As a melee Carry, his steroid favors his mid game strength (when Melee Carries begin investing in crit chance but aren't anywhere near 100%) but bites his late game strength (most Melee Carries late game approach 100% crit chance anyway, but Yasuo's Crits are weaker). It's almost strictly a mid game steroid. (something I'd personally only expect to see in Assassins)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2015-03-05T00:22:43.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one plays Yasuo expecting to be like LeBlanc or Zed. He is one of those champions such as Azir, Vayne or Akali whom the champions he is suppose to counter is legitimately better than he is early game.\n\nHowever, likewise, champions that are suppose to be good against Yasuo loses to him late game. Expect for a few mADC (Tryndamere, Xin Zhao), Yasuo's damage absolutely destroys enemies in a few autos. His Q is essentially a 100 ad AA canceling steroid that comes with a knock up with a CD that also scales with AS. His ult also gives him 15 seconds of 50% armor pen.\n\nThe only other AD champions that can access such powerful stats are Riven, Vayne, and Tryndamere. I am not for buffing Yasuo since the devs will likely just nerf him immediately after.\n\nHowever, it does really irritate me when people lose and feeds Yasuo in lane and claim he is OP. He has one of the lowest base health, resistant stats, and AD of any champion. If a Yasuo leaves lane with 3+ kills, the problem isn't him.","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-05T00:51:48.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"His Q is not steroid.

Secondly his passive is his damage steroid that all MADC's have: Yi has double strike, and Wuju Style, GP has his E, Xin has his AS speed, Tryn has his rage, ect. Mathematically Yasuo will only roughly deal 23% more damage with his passive than he would without. Other ADC's are higher, like 30%+. Lastly his shield is an integral part of his kit, all MADC's need a way to survive! Yi has meditate, GP has Oranges, Tryn has heal, xin has heal, ect. Yasuo has his flow shield and a very long CD windwall. Yasuo has the most coherent MADC kit to date. He's neither OP nor UP. He's perfectly balanced. Snowballs hard but also is trash if he falls behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-03-05T00:50:36.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, I'd say Rework.
