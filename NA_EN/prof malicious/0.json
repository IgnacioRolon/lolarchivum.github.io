While I&#039;m able to change the actual content, I can&#039;t change the name, thus not knowing what page does what for me while in champ select. Sounds like it&#039;s not so big of a thing, but once you have 20 rune pages you&#039;ll be glad to not need to look up each one.\r\n\r\nDetails: When changing the name of a runepage _before_ changing the content, then removing or replacing any rune will result in the name resetting. Also, the &quot;Save to Runebook&quot;-option is **unavailable.** If the content is changed and then the name, the save-button will stay available, but the name won&#039;t actually change. It just jumps back to what it was.\r\n\r\nWorkaround I found: To change your runepage names, there is still a workaround I found. You need to change the content, **not** save, rename the page and instead of saving you click the &quot;League of Legends&quot;-logo in the upper left of the client to return, which will face you with the &quot;You got unsaved changes in your rune pages. Want to save now?&quot; message. Click &#039;yes&#039;, go back to your runes, and the name of the page will be saved. This workaround does not work for already assigned names. \r\n\r\nTechnical: EUW; 15.01.2016 was the first appearance of this bug I noticed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ianzangi","date":"2016-02-05T17:26:47.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very annyoing...
