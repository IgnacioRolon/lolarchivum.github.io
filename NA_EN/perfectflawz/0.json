Freezing problem.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just bought a new laptop to play League on the go like a true nerd. And I thought I got the minimum system requirements to play. I started a game and played fine on max settings with 60 fps and everything, no problems whatsoever. The 2nd game I played, almost every time there was a team fight, my laptop would freeze up for about 10 seconds and make an obnoxious loud, collaboration of sounds until the screen was restored. Even after lowering the settings all the way, this still happened.\r\n\r\nI don't completely understand tech things, but since it was running fine. smoothly, no problems on max settings, is it possible that my laptop technically can not run the game still?\r\n\r\nI have a Lenovo with 4GB of RAM, Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6100U CPU @ 2.30 GHz processor. And an Intel HD 520 integrated graphics card.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T19:46:52.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on your new rig!
