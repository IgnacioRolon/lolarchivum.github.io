Also, if I were to download a portion of the client, run out of data, close the client, shut down and come back a week later would the downloaded percentage save?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T22:00:57.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently our client doesn't have a way to pause downloads or updates, but I can definitely feel the struggle you're going through :(. You might be able to have a little more success getting the client downloaded by going to a friends house or somewhere with public wifi if you can't get past your data cap.","replies":[]}]}
