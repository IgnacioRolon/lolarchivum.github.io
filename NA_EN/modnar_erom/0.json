Return the charges to the final items and just have a constant minion gold debuff applied when such an item is in a players inventory.  Doing the math this works out to about 60%, so anyone with a support item only ever gets 60% of the gold from any minion kills, at all times.   This way, if a laner wants to take the support item they can, but they will have to use it to full effect just to break even with the gold they would normally get from minions.  It also prevents supports from generating more gold per minute than laners under any conditions. \r\n\r\nAnd to be extra safe, maybe change the stats on the items to be more appealing to supports and less appealing to carries. \r\n\r\nTada, support items can no longer be abused, and supports can have their income back.\r\n\r\nBonus QoL suggestion:   switch the targons/execute passive on the \"tank\" items to the coin passive upon quest completion.","replies":[{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-26T01:40:22.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, there is, and no they are not.  But it is cool though.  They will either be fixed, or I won't be playing support.  Quite simple really.  Who knows... maybe I won't be playing league.\n\nI would also wager a _huge_ number of people will feel the same way soon enough.  And once players start to checkout, Riot will backpedal quick, fast, and in a hurry because while they may not understand logic, reason, or basic mathematics, they (or their bosses) do understand less $$$.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2019-11-25T23:02:36.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean... there isn't any reason to rework them, they're fine as-is. You don't NEED the gold generation passive late game (Well, Tribute at least, Spoils of War gives tanks the ability to actually wave clear which I do actually miss), especially since the 1100g you aren't spending on upgrading your item is straight cash flow back into whatever else you could need. By the time having your gold gen passive in the late game would exceed that, all six slots of yours would be filled anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JPlayah","date":"2019-11-25T17:52:51.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot should just hire you tbh.","replies":[]}]}
