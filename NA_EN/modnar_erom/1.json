Cloud drake offers cooldown reduction on ultimates.\r\n\r\nChance of at least 1 cloud drake:  75%\r\nChance of only one cloud drake (in a cloud drake game): 67%\r\nChance of multiple cloud drakes (in a cloud drake game): 33%\r\n\r\nChance of only 1 cloud drake overall: 50%\r\nChance of multiple cloud drakes overall: 25%\r\n\r\nSo in half of all games, 1 team is going to have 10% shorter ultimate cooldowns than the other. \r\n\r\nNow let's take a look a what champions are doing well in each position and see if they benefit from CDR on their ultimate:\r\n\r\n**Top:**  Garen, Nasus, Mordekaiser, Malphite, Yorick, Dr. Mundo, Urgot, Quinn, Kled, Singed\r\n\r\n**Jungle:** Tryndamere, Warwick, Nunu, Ekko, Jarvan, Ivern, Elise, Olaf, Vi, Nocturne\r\n\r\n**Mid:**  A Sol, Heimerdinger, Annie, Malzahar, Kassadin, Rumble, Ahri, Cassiopeia, Kayle, Ekko\r\n\r\n**Bot:** Heimerdinger, Senna, Jinx, Ashe, Jihn, Kog Maw, Miss Fortune, Veigar, Caitlyn, Twitch\r\n\r\n**Support:** Kled, Heimerdinger, Syndra, Katarina, Ahri, Mordekaiser, Malphite, Fizz, Rumble, Akali\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the above champions get huge value from CDR on their ultimate.  Then there is the ultimate hunter rune, which may be taken.","replies":[{"poster":"Xanlardis","date":"2019-12-13T05:16:34.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cloud drake is Far to strong and completely useless at the same time. For instance nocturne ult at max level has a base cd of 100 seconds with multiple wind drakes and ultimate hunter i was ulting every 25 seconds, where as champions like jayce and elise see no benefit or worse yet Shyvana a champion designed around taking dragons See no benefit in taking a cloud drake, the effects of infernal where reduced greatly so that it that taking objectives wasn't as snowbally yet the cloud drake cdr has massive impact on the game for some champions and shows no benefit at all for others","replies":[]}]}
