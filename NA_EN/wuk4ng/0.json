I&#039;m a Platinum 2 player and I&#039;ve been wondering how one starts as a coach. I&#039;ve just started focusing on what I wanted to do with my life and my skills show me that I have a knack for teaching and mentoring. My questions are: \r\nHow does one become a coach?\r\nHow does one find clients to coach? Do I just add random Bronze/Silver/Gold players?\r\nWhat tools/programs should a coach use?\r\nI&#039;ve researched the pay coaches get and it ranges about $15-$30 per hour for coaches that coach for TEAMS. I was looking to charge only $10 and hour(maybe less) since I&#039;m only Plat 2, but I&#039;m climbing extremely fast. I&#039;ve only been in Plat for a few months and got out of Gold. \r\nHow does one gain presence on Social Media platforms and also which ones are the best for LoL coaches?\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;ve done: I have hitted up a few people and asked if they have anyone I can coach. Fortunately, there were at least 2. I&#039;ve also researched about the basics and tips and tricks of League of Legends(e.g. How to Escape Every Elo and Climb by Phy) and a few more videos like coaching sessions from LS and xFSN Saber.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading a long thread like this one :) I appreciate it.\r\n\r\n-The &quot;Garen/Wukong Cheezer&quot; Pro Munchlax","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-07-06T22:31:02.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep advertising yourself until you get someone who wants to be coached by you.","replies":[{"poster":"WuK4ng","date":"2018-07-06T22:42:28.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And by that you mean consistent posting and finding random low elo players while making videos of every coaching session I do just to post it on YouTube or some sort of platform?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-07-06T22:51:44.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pro Munchlax,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=g6W2wtH1,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-06T22:42:28.099+0000)\n>\n> And by that you mean consistent posting and finding random low elo players while making videos of every coaching session I do just to post it on YouTube or some sort of platform?\n\nBasically yes, cause all you need is a platform for people to see and want your services, eventually someone will come to you.\n\nIt's like when an artist is trying to get his name out there, just keep advertising yourself like you currently are on the boards, to people on your friendslist.\n\n\nYou can even make a smurf acc for bronze, play Extremely well, and ask if someone wants to be coached, proven skill results will eventually bring someone","replies":[]}]}]}]}
