I've tried to counter Darius... i've tried and tried. Yeah.. teemo might counter him, but he gets just one pull early game... he will crush teemo with little mr and damage out put. I recently played rammus top lane vs a darius. Play that passive taunt into tower gameplay style.. I don't know what else to say besides I got my ass handed to me by a full ad darius.. I went {{item:1029}}  and 5 {{item:2003}}  in the beginning... you can't really trade off because your rammus and he doesn't have a good 1-3. Passively I waited out all the way out to level 6 without going back. i sort of kept him but he was winning trades. I went back picked up {{item:3111}} {{item:1029}} and a few more {{item:2003}} . Well, he got a {{item:3077}}  and {{item:1001}} . So I thought to myself tenacity and mr for the bleed than go straight into either {{item:3075}} or {{item:3143}} .. Sure enough with just {{item:3077}} he murdered me under turret and I even taunted him knocked him up... ulted...  I quickly got {{item:3075}}.. and he continued to stomp me. I couldn't get near him even under tower. Please if that's not broken than i'm not sure what is.","replies":[{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2014-12-26T16:45:09.371+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, you countered yourself simple because you are playing rammus top. Second, you have no way to sustain, and darius has passive armor pen. You bought tenacity boots against someone who does more true and physical damage than magic itself. Instead of buying health and armor, you decided to buy tenacity against someone without CC ( his slow can be reapllied ). Darius loses to pretty much every single ranged champion and some melee.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHarshmallow","date":"2014-12-26T16:40:05.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is a difference between 'lane bully' and 'broken'\n\na lane bully falls off mid - late game\n\nbroken excels in all stages\n\n\ndarius comes under lane bully category\nhe WILL (or should) win trades early to mid game\nif he goes full damage and you all are able to drag the game he wont hurt a lot due to poor scaling\n\nagainst darius all you gotta do is survive and try to outfarm\n\ngaren, draven, miss fortune come under lane bully too\n\nzed, yasuo, akali come under broken (IMO)\n\nthought i should tell ya","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2014-12-26T18:39:03.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is all wrong, draven has the highest damage out of all the adcs (one shots anyone?), garen can easily laugh at everything you do cause he can get the point where he is a super tank, MF can do insane damage if built right, and darius can certainly do insane damage with few items (hydra, black cleaver, trin)","replies":[{"poster":"MrHarshmallow","date":"2014-12-29T10:27:29.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you.. but that's not what i meant\n\nthe champions i listed have a strong early game.. hence they are a lane bully\n\nbut these champions dont stay a bully the whole game\nonce mid-late game reaches and everyone gets some decent items.. the damage (of mentioned champions) comes to par with everyone** (provided they are not fed early game)**\n\nyour best bet is to play uber passive and try to outfarm them\n\ngaren falls off hard late game.. to a point where he is only a soak that cannot peel for carries\nsame with darius.. if he goes damage items (the ones you mentioned) he wont survive late game.. \nmiss fortune surely does get to par with others as the game progresses \n\nsource: experience","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2014-12-29T16:18:50.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while i agree, i've never seen a darius fall off at any point in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mikemil223","date":"2014-12-26T19:43:08.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"actually thresh has the highest dmg out of all the adc's. he can TRULY one shot ppl xD.  e passive makes him do 200% ad in magic so that would be the reason why instead of it doing ad. well it would be between thresh and draven","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2014-12-26T22:02:29.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"while that may be, thresh is not an actual (meta) adc pick whereas draven is.

You tried out 2 champions and Rammus isnt a good choice in the first place. Keep at it and you will see, Darius has some major issues that are easily exploited.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-12-26T20:25:31.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't counter Darius in lane.
