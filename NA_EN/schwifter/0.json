It's unplayable for me now that the new client is up. I go on it and I can only only play 1 match before it crashes in the next champion select. At first I thought it was just league crashing like usually but this is way to much crashing and it only happens when i try to use the legacy.","replies":[{"poster":"Schwifter","date":"2017-03-17T17:09:06.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh its just getting progressively worse now now i cant change masteries in champ select. nice upgrade with this client. now i gotta run warlords  on Darius top in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schwifter","date":"2017-03-10T23:55:05.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion select and no I'm not getting an error message. As for why I'm sticking to legacy is because the new client just doesn't work well, everything is slower and I feel like too much was added to it and it just feels clunky and overdone but for now I guess I have to use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T00:26:55.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info!  Are you running any third party programs that interact with league?  That's usually the most common cause of crashes in champion select.  \n\nRegarding the updated client, have you tried the low-performance mode?  This will disable some of the fancy stuff  that uses more processing power, and can be found in the updated client's settings.  \n\nLet me know if all that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Schwifter","date":"2017-03-11T14:01:05.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I'm not running any third party programs and as for the low-spec mode its been on the entire time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-10T22:27:18.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When exactly are you crashing on the legacy client?
