I realize it should take time, but when it goes from 32 minutes to 28 minutes after 2 hours, something isn't working as it should. I am using the new client, I thought by upgrading it it would correct this problem, but it still happens. I have closed and re-opened the client several times.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T18:19:45.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you are getting any errors, it's best to leave the patcher alone and let it do its thing.  Closing it too early will cause it to rescan your game files for corruption.  Update time can vary depending on your connection as well as how fast your hard drive can write it all down.  When your patch is done, go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your connection to the patching server.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
