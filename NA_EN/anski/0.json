Since we've established that Sierra is prone to issues because it's so new, this may simply just be a growing pains issue related to the new OS. I'd like you to check out our [Mac FPS Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#section-mac) for some common solutions for this issue.\n\nIf you continue to have FPS issues after taking those steps, then this is something we'll have to look into.","replies":[{"poster":"Anski","date":"2016-10-21T10:41:07.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I contacted support and they basically told me to talk to Apple. \n\nHere's the thing. \n\nI know it's not my computer. I know it has nothing to do with my system. I have tried literally every single possible fix for this, and I have concluded that it is not something I can fix. Riot has to implement a fix. \n\nI have tried running the game at the lowest possible resolution and lowest possible graphics, turning almost everything off giving me the worst possible quality I can possibly have, and I still have the exact same FPS. I've tried every solution on the troubleshooting guide, I've tried underground fixes from Reddit and other sources including old league forum posts. \n\nI don't recall having bad FPS before patch 6.20. Additionally, my FPS is even worse after 6.21. This game is actually unplayable now. \n\nGreat timing, considering it's almost the end of the season. I can't reach my ranked goals because I can't play anymore. Doom bots is also completely unplayable, way worse than a normal game. \n\nI also believe this has nothing at all to do with Sierra. I upgraded mid 6.20 expecting Sierra to fix my FPS. It didn't fix my FPS, in fact, it didn't do anything at all. \n\nIf you guys aren't going to fix this issue for Macs then please let me know so I can stop waiting around for a fix and waste a thousand dollars on a new PC just to play league.
