Probably should dodge MORE bad comps, honestly... \nBut my timer went straight to 30 mins.  Seems a little excessive.\n\nApparently the lock out for featured game mode dodges is TWO HOURS. xD\nGlad it wasn't one of those...\n\nBut still, has it been changed ?  Is it just 30 mins for two dodges now?  Seems a little nuts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Migel Garcia","date":"2017-03-24T17:13:56.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%. You go into a game, call a position and then you get the trolls that refuse to have any respect and then just say they are taking the spot and subsequently ruin the game because they don't want to be part of the team. The players that don't act like jerks get punished because we don't want a busted game. I can understand starting at 2 min, then 4 then 8 for multiple dodges, but the times should be far more reasonable. You can't just look at it as everyone that dodges is because they are the problem. I called support first twice in a row and then was told to f off, because they were a duo. That's not how the unwritten rules go. In regs you call your spot, first come first serve. You then ask if they would be willing to switch. Draft picks are worse because you spend 5 minutes banning champs and then someone leaves because they don't get what they want. Please think about the times and make them more realistic. Not 5 min then 15 then 30 that is just stupid","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-27T00:06:27.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo jungle is more valid than a first-time riven top.","replies":[{"poster":"JustSir","date":"2017-01-27T00:09:35.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...im in bronze...i highly doubt the player had the skill to pull it off","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-27T02:00:31.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
