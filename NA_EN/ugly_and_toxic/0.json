You literally ditched the old client for the new one to solve some problems that old client had (outdated Adobe Air stuff or idk), but the new client caused even more problems. I was in the alpha client plan, and even then people have reported terrible performance, bugs and a lot of bloat which is present today. Despite all that, you just shrug those complaints off with &quot;we&#039;ll continue to optimize it&quot;, but literally what you did is add even more bloat to it.\r\nI&#039;m so surprised that such a gigantic company like you released something like this and not get criticized to oblivion. People have been complaining for a year and you guys couldn&#039;t sit there and just fix that.","replies":[]}
