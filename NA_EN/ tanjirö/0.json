It wasn't my best game but we ended up winning thanks to teammates. After the victory symbol it said I was banned and took me to my login. Now I'm permabanned and I don't know why. I didn't type much and I'm not toxic by any means. I also never received warnings(afk warnings, chat restrictions, two day bans, etc.) it went straight to permaban. I am deployed to Afghanistan for the military so I don't know if its because of my location change or is it something I did that I'm unaware of. I put so much money into this account so I tried my best to avoid this. I never typed toxicity, inted,or trolled, unless I was in a 5 man with friends. I just want my account back its all I have out here or just a reason why I was banned in the first place for closure.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-29T19:15:02.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, fear not!
