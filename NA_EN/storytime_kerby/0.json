I've been noticing after my games, after the defeat/victory screen, when clicking to exit, i exit normally, but am greeted with a 2 to 3 minute wait of a load screen (the large \"L\" with a circling load logo that seems to be taunting me and reminds me of certain smash mouth lyrics involving the letter \"L\" and a forehead) for the end game results screen to show up. If i was to make a simile, its like pushing my patience slowly into a meat grinder. This is inconvenient not only for me, but also my few friends, and my fewer friends, who actually wait for me. I'd like to know if the problem is client side or of others are having a similar problem.","replies":[{"poster":"god vs human","date":"2017-12-05T23:21:38.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have that issue too, i just brought that computer for like 2 weeks, it looks fine when i just start to play it.

Since during this transition, you're connecting to different servers, this is probably caused by an instability in your connection. I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure this isn't caused by a problematic network setting on your local side.\n\nIf you encounter this further after working through those steps, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"jerryyyyyyy","date":"2017-05-26T17:31:02.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey mate this is after last patch and I cant fix this with Hextech Repair  tool  don't work enable/disable low spec, install/reinstall nothing work I pay for 100 Mbit internet and got this problem connection is not problem !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tsare","date":"2017-03-22T06:20:49.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also an issue for me.

I generally don't have any issue with the game or client but for whatever reason, upon finishing a game, it also takes me around 1-2 mins to get to the results screen. Just 1-2 mins of a loading L. I hear what I think are people entering and leaving the results lobby but all I see is the L.","replies":[]}]}
