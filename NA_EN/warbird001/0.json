I am pretty sure that CotC was NOT designed with {{champion:92}} in mind as it gives her two shields essentially. \r\n\r\nI agree that it is totally cool to have customization but I feel that runes and masteries are just NOT the way to be doing this. Instead of providing flat power to everything with no cost, why not introduce a system like &quot;Pokemon&quot; has where you can customize small increases of base stats to the detriment of others. (IV and EV Training)\r\n\r\nThis means that a {{champion:157}} could choose to customise his base attack but at the EXPENSE of his defense. Giving a clear trade off that allows people to find the stats that work best for their individual playstyles while at the same time, providing a double edge sword that weakens a champion in another area.\r\n\r\nThe pure problem with the current system is that the mastery tree gives a metric ton of added damage and other abilities with no detrimental cost to balance them. \r\n\r\nIf you absolutely HAVE to have &quot;keystones&quot;, then make them available at the end of a tree so that you pay a significant price for actually getting this keystone. \r\n\r\nAllowing people to customize small increases to their base stats directly while allowing them to have negative returns as a trade off for the additional stat bonuses would be a far more effective solution in my opinion. I won&#039;t pretend to be a &quot;Stat master&quot; but i think the lack of trade off is whats causing the game to become stale.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2017-01-12T12:26:04.496+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

It's the % damage buffs that have made the marksman race into a caster race .","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-12T12:36:38.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Effort Values (EV) and Inherent Values (IV) from Pokemon **are** flat stat boosts, yo. The only detriment they have is that you only have so many EVs to spread around, since IVs all cap at 31. Your analogy doesn't work because the opportunity cost of investing, say, speed and attack onto a physical sweeper is all the bulk you can't invest, but the same is also true of League. If you get loads of offensive runes and masteries then you show up without bulk and the opposite is generally true.\n\nAlso, nothing should ever be balanced like pokemon, because Gamefreak is terrible at game balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-01-12T12:24:30.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Too complicated.
