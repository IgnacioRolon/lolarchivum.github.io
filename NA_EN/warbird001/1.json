I&#039;ve never understood why people think they can report for this. \r\n\r\nThe meta is so horribly toxic at the moment, with AD&#039;s pretty much having everything they can wish for and AP/Tanks having practically nothing, that of course people are going to have a negative attitude. Nobody WANTS TO SEE THE SAME BORING CHAMPIONS EVERY GAME BECAUSE RIOT CAN&#039;T BE BOTHERED TO NERF/FIX THEM!\r\n\r\nSHOCK HORROR!\r\n\r\nPeople are getting bored of League because its only appealing to communities of CERTAIN, CHOSEN champions and not ALL Champion Communities as they should be doing. Games are a complete stomp one way or the other, so much so that winning doesn&#039;t even feel that fun.\r\n\r\nPeople are attacked if they aren&#039;t playing the BEST champion for that role... EVEN IN NORMALS. \r\n\r\nRiot, seriously, get your head out of your ass and fix your damn game before its too late and people start walking. Remember the JITA RIOTS in EvE... That&#039;s an obvious warning to STOP TREATING YOUR FANBASE LIKE IDIOTS!","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2017-02-07T16:14:36.966+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't care about anyones opinion.\nHe thinks he is right and nothing you say will change that.\nHe refuses to acknowledge that there are people that know more.\nHis attitude alone is a big barrier.\nJust let him vent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-07T15:40:36.317+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> thats like telling people they need to ENJOY a game they are losing or they get banned\n\nNo, having a negative attitude is projecting your problems on the other players, making *their* experience shitty too.","replies":[{"poster":"Warbird001","date":"2017-02-07T15:41:24.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Oh I'm sorry... the person picking the meta champions every game, totally shouldn't get called out for doing that.

I'm not normally the toxic type, and i figure, being a little snooty or distant from the game comes up a little but i don't ever take it into chat with any seriousness, Actually on the contrary, losing can be fun, cause that \"Woop woop woop woop\" ziodberg shuffle away from a gank is funny, it's funny to me. \n\nIt's funny when i win, hell i wouldn't have given this game hundreds of dollars if roughly half the time i hated their content (That's what a winrate plateau will get you if you can't play the game for fun), \n\n\nIm not saying dont try hard, don't go hard, i'm saying if you want to win you'd better focus, and you can't focus on a nexus if you're tilting harder than <Insert viable tilt reference here>\n\ntilting is such a bad thing for your team that it gets used as a vaguely legitimate strategy (Albeit a lowly sneaky bullshit thing to do) I've seen, used, and had used against me tactics that are designed to tilt players, yes I've used them.. in all honesty I felt bad after but i was too intoxicated to play well and it was ranked, a friend's promo... well so i had to use what i could.\n\n\nYou tilting gets you off focus, you tilting in chat, gets your team on tilt. Hell even if i'm not mad, i get disconnected from a game if i see the other members of my team screaming at eachother. Dude i don't care if my top lane sucks ass, that's not to say i don't actually care, but I don't make it known that i care, and i don't spite that top lane for having a bad match. I just ping shit these days, if i'm chatting it's irrelevant nonsense or competetive ballbusting, but it's never actually insulting someone, and i make sure to give out the honors deserved every match, verbally... I tell my laner when i'm having fun against him, I tell enemy jungle he did a good gank if he gets me... I remember that the people on the enemy team are playing the game too, NOBODY deserves to have a shitty time. sorry, that's not the point of video games. \n\nIf you don't like this game half the time you should probably go to co-op and singleplayer games, because you're not getting what you should out of this.","replies":[]}]}
