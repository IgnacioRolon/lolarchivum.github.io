I can&#039;t explain it, something about her ult reset if you hit her impossible to miss Q pisses me off, I always ban her if I can.

I hate  going against this fucker, especially good ones. According to  champion.gg last week he had the SECOND HIGHEST WIN RATE, only next to Morgana who came in at first. (Oh yeah, people seeing how OP Morgana is now and are playing Morgana mid, and what's with all the Blitzcranks also opting to go mid?)\n\nAnyhow, usually when there is a Blitz on my team, i  always win, or if he's on the other team, I can expect my bot lane to feed.   A good Blitzcrank don't give a flying fuck about your minion wave protecting you, he will just speed with W around and throw  a hook and get you. Once you're hooked, you're fucked pretty much.  So a hook, knock up, and ult=gg, but to have his adc hitting you? That's overkill.\n\nI do gotta laugh about one thing tho... Is when it comes to team fighting or just Blitz hooking someone in general, it's funny cause  have you seen how literally everyone goes all in once he lands a hook? Especially in team fights. So it's 5v5, everyone trying to position for that moment to get the attack going and to intitiate. Whenever a Blitz pulls someone ironically the whole other team jumps in as well tho  it's safe to assume they just lost that member no matter what. Usually a Blitz team will spam all their skills on whoever he pulls, I guess that's one way of looking at it, but just a  thought I had, everyone always goes in when he does the pull, even if they don't have perfect position.\n\nAnyhow, it's my most hated champion, and I consider him very fucking toxic. Surprise everyone! It's a supp.\n\nEDIT ALSO...... Blitzcranks are getting smart! Watch out folks, now they pop their E, and just fucking run at you to knock you up lol, then they Q and hook. Pretty smart. I been seeing this happen lately. Either way, you're fucked with this guy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2015-10-28T08:12:23.893+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{champion:64}} \nWho needs skill when you can chose your fights?\nWho needs skill when you have no risk at all going in?\nWho needs skill when you can just press R for 200% AD, %HP, huge CC knockback? \nWho needs skill when you have 43258972324589743 dashes ON TOP OF 350 MOVESPEED?\nWho needs to worry about getting nerfed when you are playing Riot's love child?\nWho needs exciting montages with never before seen outplays when you can watch the same boring Insec 500000x over in slow motion?\nWho needs a well paying job when you can just fork most of your money out to the govermnent?\nWho needs a relationship when you can just sit at your computer all day?\nWho needs - wait where was I going with this....?","replies":[{"poster":"DezeMuffins","date":"2015-10-28T23:39:48.270+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two.

Quit forcing me into idea of liking him just because he is a prehistoric yordle. Lane bully with great utility at teamfights.

While being overloaded with tons of free stats and utility he creates a real frustrating to play against gameplay against in lane with dodging the boomerang.
