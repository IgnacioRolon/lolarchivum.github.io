Which is stupid because their is no freaking update tonight.\r\n\r\nSo I would like a removal of my ban timer because 5 20 minute ban timers is a lot of waiting for games. \r\n\r\nAnd yes I know that it is a rare occurrence that bans are reversed. \r\n\r\nBut if not could you please make sure that this does not happen to anyone else. So everyone can love league as much as I do. &lt;3 .","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:11:12.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes, that does sound like it really sucks to have dealt with that =(. Kinda sounds like it might have been a crash instead of an update? Either way, let's try and make sure it doesn't happen again. \n\nIF this was some type of crash, in my experience they generally happen due to hiccups in your connection while you were downloading the most previous patch. When you get those hiccups, certain files might not update correctly which then freak out and cause a crash randomly. It can be hard to fully prevent this, other than taking steps to make sure you download those patches successfully. I'd be sure to [**update your DNS settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5), and also add [**exceptions to your firewalls**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3). \n\nIf this wasn't any type of crash, let me know exactly what happened and I can do my best to dig a little further!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShiroKiba1126","date":"2018-01-23T12:46:44.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read this from you earlier.9\n\n\"It really sucks your client was having problems which resulted in a crash, but ultimately it's up to the player to be sure their software/hardware is working well enough for the game to function correctly. The client can't tell the difference between a crash, or force closing the game. Either way is the same to the lobby, you're just leaving the game and it doesn't care why. Without these dodge penalties, anyone could exit matches without anything happening, which would mean a lot of frustrated players not ever being able to play the game without it being ruined by leavers.\n\nI'm really curious as to what error you saw so we can try to help you fix that up. It doesn't do much good to let this slide without trying to troubleshoot and solve the problem that caused the crash to begin with. I'd try a quick repair first if you haven't yet, but let me know what errors you saw so I can guide you through a few steps.\" -Broporo\n\nAnd yes i see that this is valid. And I don't really want the ban timer removal cause that would be unfair.\n\nBut I just to see if we could get a fix maybe in the near future cause it is a reoccurring problem. Maybe a official league install guide. IDK we need something. <3","replies":[]}]}
