To start, I suggest making sure your Windows is up to date to make sure it has all the necessary products it needs to download League.  Make sure that you're also downloading the correct client from the [official download source](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload).  \n\nFinally, go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that your OS (post update) settings are allowing League game files to be accessed and scanned.  \n\nI hope that helps, but let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
