'They started it' isn't a viable argument so your response of 'kys' isn't acceptable. Flaming/raging is against the [Summone's Code](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code), and is a punishable offense. \n\nGenerally, punishments are as follows - \n\n* First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n* Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nHowever, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account. Saying 'kys' isn't taken lightly, due to it's implications. \n\nI do appreciate that you realize what you've done isn't cool, and that you'll try to be a more positive player in the future. :) Here are [a few tips](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286#h2q1) that'll get you started on the right path going forward! \n\nThat said, we don't reverse/lift bans under any circumstances in these types of situations. Unfortunately, this does mean that you won't be receiving rewards this season. :c","replies":[{"poster":"Queen Of Tears","date":"2017-11-06T17:00:27.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is there any way to see how many times uve been reported? orl ike how close you are to getting banned?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-06T17:11:58.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't, no.
