Or if not increased range increased base AD and or increase AD growth per level. (Annie has like 600 why?) <--updated idea\n\n- Decrease the CD on her Q 2 seconds and decrease the root effect 0.25 seconds.\n\n- Make W do HP % damage, 2%/4%/6% etc.\n\n- E, make her shield function like heart of the mountains shield, where after the duration it explodes in a small radius dealing the amount it shields for as magic damage if it is not destroyed.\n\n- R is fine but could use a touch up on the hitbox indicator, I have hit and been hit well outside the circles indicator which shouldn&#039;t be happening imo do to riot&#039;s stance on clarity of actions and what not, but this is also the case for many aoe skills in this game as of lately and I am sure they are working on fixing said issues.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration in this topic. \nSincerely long time player, Darius Demiurge.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-04-19T03:29:50.356+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Came for the tits.\n\n\n\nDon't judge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2016-04-18T07:01:11.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone that plays a lot of Morg(most played champ) I dont think she needs a buff at all.

Between the raw health I get on top of usually always having my E up for it, the most I ever took from it lategame was like maybe 1/2. Which to be honest is well worth it since that is meant to be a kill attack, so for it to not kill is pretty major. A full combo hitting would still kill me sure. But I usually can use my E to stop the stun which nullifies it basically. \n\nNot sure about Malz, I rarely see him and the once in a blue moon I do, he usually just ults me only when someone is there with him, otherwise he doesn't usually fair well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Her Queen","date":"2015-04-21T04:24:18.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"no ty, gut morgana. kthnxbai","replies":[]},{"poster":"One Ashe On","date":"2017-07-26T22:50:55.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morg could use change to make her more toward her intended role: mid APC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Her Queen","date":"2016-10-19T00:39:15.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"still-- gut morgana.\n\nkthnxbai","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2016-04-18T02:44:29.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't really like this at all.
