Now when I'm in a game the sound goes from low to high randomly and just now my game froze and my laptop has never done that until the update.

Can you confirm there are no background programs causing this by [completing a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3)?\n\nAs for your game freeze issue, this is likely resolved by [disabling the Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) that was recently changed in that windows update.
