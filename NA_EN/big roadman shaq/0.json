I will get the iMac today and the primary use is work (Photoshop and InDesign). However, I am playing League of Legends and I was wondering if I can play we with at decent FPS on high settings?\r\n\r\nI am aware that the 5K resolution is not possible, so I will have to lower the video resolution. Will this affect the FPS when playing on high settings?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T03:59:10.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't directly tested performance with this Mac and League, so in no way can I guarantee any sort of level of performance. I can say that since your iMac will have a dedicated video card, you'll definitely blow the minimum requirements out of the water.\n\nPlease let me know what sort of performance you end up seeing with this Mac!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plektrum","date":"2017-09-05T14:49:58.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I just got a new 2017 iMac 27\" 5K. Im using it primarily for studying but also tried out League on it. I've been playing for 4 years now and always had a Windows PC. To my surprise playing League on the iMac isn't fun at all. I got 32 GB Ram and the Radeon Pro 580 and it feels laggy and specially in team fights im playing with 20 FPS and I don't know why, because this Mac is fast in all other Programms. Also the software mouse is a huge problem too. It jumps but when I turn it off I accidentally click on my second monitor. I still use my old Windows PC for League and the Mac for working. \n\nThose are my experiences I hope it helps. \n\nOh and also paying in 5k is way to tiny you still have to use HD resolution to have a proper picture and yeah the FPS are pretty bad regardless of the graphic settings in any resolution.","replies":[]}]}
