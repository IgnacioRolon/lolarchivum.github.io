I grinded all summer to get mastery 7 on all ADCs, only because it looked really satisfying and just made me proud to look at it. Now I can only barely see 15 champs and it really makes me feel like my achievement isn't that great. idk how to put it into words other than it just feels worse.  I really don't mind Riot changing it for eternals but the full splash art just takes up too much space. I'd rather there be like maybe a bar above the smaller icons? I don't have any good ideas but there are way better alternatives for this screen. Thanks for reading and please consider making your own post to bring more attention to this.","replies":[{"poster":"imtoxicxD7777","date":"2019-08-29T21:36:07.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this shit is absolute aids, please change back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Djeesus","date":"2019-08-29T01:45:03.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what he says, the new little icon info letting you know if it's free or if you got a chest is ok, I don't really mind it but the full splash screen for champs should be an option, I don't like it, I like to see as much info as possible and it makes for too long of scrolls for splash screens I well know about, pretty please bring back the smaller icons, or at least just simply give us the option. On top of those big splash screens icon, let's say I choose to look at my Chest Available Champions, there is no order so I might have a level 5 mastery champ with an available chest but he's at the bottom of the list for some reason and I have to scroll through all the way down to search for an available chest on high mastery champ and the big splash screen icon makes it just that much longer to scroll through when I could see it all much quicker with small icons and it'd be easier if they could be in mastery order so that I can quickly know which champ I have with higher mastery points that I didn't get a chest with yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-28T22:13:30.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's fine. The only problem I can see is that it's bugged as shit. It says I have mastery level 7 on champions I've never played and mastery level 0 on champions I should have level 5 on.","replies":[]}]}
