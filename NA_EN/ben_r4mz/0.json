I want this off 100% of the time.\r\nAs someone who owns all but 14 of the Champions, I would like to see the ones I DON&#039;T own when I enter the store.\r\nEvery time I want to change it it has to reload the page, which take about 5 seconds on my machine.\r\nMy only reason for entering the store is to buy something, and I can&#039;t buy what I already own.\r\nThe same with the order menu. If I set it so the Champions are displayed in decreasing IP value, I want it to be like that when I come back.\r\n(All of the above applies to the Skins, Gameplay, Accessories, and Bundles tabs of course.)\r\nThose are my thoughts.\r\nHope to see this change soon. (And in the Alpha Client..... that&#039;s where I got frustrated with this)\r\nKeep up the good work Riot!\r\nBenramz {{champion:22}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-03T00:48:52.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to have that feature too!
