Riot lie&#039;s that you can get your champs easily than before in the preaseason update(It means get your champs faster with RP---Spend Money on champs too). The new rewards system is also crap..........you get capsule for leveling up which is a gamble(RNG) and you don&#039;t get what champion you exactly want and in later stages leveling up is also hard...as they increase the Total XP meter which makes you even play more games to level up and get a capsule which gives lesser blue essence then the old ip system. \r\nIt goes like this..\r\n10 games to level up\r\n20 games to level up.........and so on\r\n(Mean&#039;s eventually dedicate your life to get much blue essence which Riot drop&#039;s less or just pay for champs.)\r\nThe first win bonus gives only 400 xp and 50 blue essence irrespective of what level are you.\r\nIts going pay to win because of this--\r\nFor instance, Enemy team picks Zoe and i need to pick Yasuo to counter her and where is the Blue essence you need to get yasuo and leveling capsule don&#039;t drop Yasuo for you.\r\nI also give the old ip rewards drop of my past 20 games and new leveling system cap increase as you further level up in Link here-[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/154708152@N05/albums)\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/154708152@N05/albums\r\nto do the math.\r\nDev team also don&#039;t take the feedback well as many of my friends and myself have given about this.\r\nAs a competitive game this is not good....Soon the end will come for this game if it&#039;s like this....and many players are quiting \r\nAnd people who still play are either very old players who have already lot of blue essence or people who has RP and no new players without paying,\r\nnew account&#039;s are smurf&#039;s.\r\nAtleast DOTA 2 unlocks all champs at level 1 itself...unlike league.\r\nRiot will also Ban this post as it is true fact and try to hide it.\r\nSorry if my English is bad.","replies":[]}
