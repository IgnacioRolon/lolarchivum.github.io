Sometimes it will jump back up, but mostly it sits really low there, and might even drop lower to 19 fps. When it does this, the screen starts stuttering, like freezing and fast forwarding quickly over and over. I've check the toll on my computer, and I'm well below half of my RAM and CPU being used while running, I've deleting all files and reinstalling, I've tried lowering my graphics in-game, and turning vsync on and off. Nothing I do changes the fps or stuttering in the slightest. I've also checked multiple networks to see if that was a problem, and while better networks run just slightly better, it didn't fix the problem. \r\n\r\nIf any of you guys have any ideas for what I could do, I really need to get rid of this, because I can't play with the game jumping all around.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T21:51:31.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS drops and stuttering are problems often caused by troublesome graphics drivers or windows power settings.
