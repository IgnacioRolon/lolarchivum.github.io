This six item build can go on any melee champion and still work: {{item:3111}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3742}}.

In Season 4 there was a less often implemented metagolem using Trinity Force, Frozen Mallet, Atma&#039;s Impaler, Warmog&#039;s Armor, Randuin&#039;s Omen, and Mercury&#039;s Treads that saw use on champions from Jarvan IV to Corki before Atma&#039;s was removed from the game. Prior to season 4 there were other metagolems like 5 Cleavers/Sunfire Capes/Warmog&#039;s/Bloodthirsters and boots or a weird combination of gold generation and health regen using a laundry list of items that no longer exist. [This dev corner post by Riot Axes](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/fWOVQoin-followup-juggernaut-items) implies that metagolems are undesirable for game health.\nI saw a [board post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/naqnZw1E-riot-so-tank-fiora-yi-and-akali-are-a-thing-a-quick-question-about-item-design) the other day and many of the comments used the term metagolem, which I had never heard before. I did some research since I was very green during season 4 and never played Twitch with 5 Sunfire Capes or Pantheon with 5 Black Cleavers.\nI&#039;ve refrained from actually stating my opinion because I want to hear what the community thinks: Are Metagolems a problem? If they are, why are they a problem and how do we fix it? I&#039;m willing to bet at least half of us haven&#039;t ever talked about or even heard about them.\nPlease comment with your ideas and opinions.\nhttp://s14.postimg.org/c00t4zfjl/New_Metagolem.png","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2016-02-29T21:28:20.959+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"For everyone asking for S2 back:\n\nYou happy now?\nHm?","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-03-01T17:26:31.805+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UEWjn3NO,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2016-02-29T21:28:20.959+0000)\n>\n> For everyone asking for S2 back:\n> \n> You happy now?\n> Hm?\n\nExcept in season 2 fights were significantly longer. Right now, there is too much damage in the game for this season to look like it did back then. But in some way, it's the same except fights are shorter. Carries deal more damage, but they get destroyed faster if they get caught. Some champions have absolutely insane true damage ({{champion:114}} {{champion:11}} ) and the fact there is so much of uncounterable damage (%health, strong arpen and mpen steroids) mean you can't make the fights last longer aka be more healthy, for everyone. There's always gonna be one guy that can't follow that rule because he has that much %health damage. And champions that are now designed on : you kill this guy instantly or you get kited to death ({{champion:429}} {{champion:67}} ) or instantly melted ({{champion:11}}), don't stay for 5 stacks or it's over ({{champion:122}} , much more than pre-rework)\n\nOnly exception there is that I remember mages being extremely good at oneshooting squishies in S2. And most versions of dfg were pretty retarded (lolol 60% current health on active).\nI feel resistances and health were more valuable (there wasn't as much true damage, %health damage) and the offensive itemization especially on ad carries was better with sustain. Bloodthirster was a first item. Fights weren't as much oneshooting each other, slightly more sustain-oriented.\n\nI feel overall like in season 2, there was way more of a strategic aspect, in buiding items, using spells such as attack speed reducing [that has been severely nerfed, removed on certain champions] to get a healthy way to deny an ad carry without hurr-durr-i-oneshot-you. I remember Shurelia as well, which was a great item that also allowed some champions that otherwise would have been somewhat bad in teamfights to actually bring something great for their teammates ({{champion:75}}  for instance).\n\nI also remember the locket that gave armor and the bulwark, but that's from season 3 if i recall correctly. Cost-efficient items, not broken in lane, that actually are a nice asset in teamfights are supergood design.\n\nWhereas right now, it's league of call of duty and all about protect/kill the carries. Teamfight comps are not based on combo synergizing with different champions, nah.. it's GET CC AND PROTECT THE CARRY. ONE SHOOT THE OTHER CARRY. CC THE ASSASSIN. Not like the good old Amumu-Wukong-Orianna-MF.\n\nI just feel like there's been a crazy powercreep over the years with mobility, damage and crowd control. If someone told me 3 years ago about, idk, Kalista's passive, Yasuo's E, Nautilus' amount of CC (why on earth was E cooldown so much reduced), Fiora's passive... I would have laughed at his face. And I think we are seeing this powercreep indirectly with towers, who aren't weaker than they were. People just deal more damage, killing faster, and escape more easily.\n\nYet, maybe my memories are a bit flawed about the overall damage being smaller, due to nostalgy, and the fact I was way worse in skill level as I am now, so my opponents as well must have sucked compared to what I'm facing now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2016-03-01T00:53:39.090+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes.

Probs a couple more I forgot.\n\nI just think there needs to be more active/semi-active abilities in League, thats it.

If properly used the active alone can add 600-700 extra burst with 400-5000 of that beeing aoe.\nSV always was the most popular mr item as it lacks competition.

ABSOLUTELY UNHEALTHY IN EVERY WAY. from when i started playing (season2) until now, i have seen more and more issues with more and more champions each patch. this is getting outlandish. i wish riot would do nerfs and balances for REAL LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, not just for the pros. that is why so many things have gone on for so long imbalanced. poor practice to forget the majority of your community(99%) who plays real league and then only focus on pros. eventually people are gonna see taht there is a problem and stop playing the game. but so much time and money investments stops most people from playing(me included)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tranoze","date":"2016-03-02T16:10:01.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Metagolem < {{champion:67}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FinalFlare","date":"2016-03-02T07:42:54.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how would you even build this, path-wise?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malfini","date":"2016-03-01T17:42:27.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those pretty much fits to {{champion:106}} .","replies":[]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-03-01T16:59:08.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive seen darius do this and i gotta admit it was pretty powerfull on him but i haven't seen other champs do it as much and i have been playing quite a bit these days. \n\nmost of these items (except spirit) have been nerfed in the last half year\n\nthe main reason you will see this build is for the following reasons.\n\n{{item:3742}} you stuffed too much mobility in this game period every tank worth his salt will need this.\n{{item:3111}} now that riot has given it a worthwhile amount of tenacity ofc imobile champs will NEED this there is no other option available it all got nerfed.\n{{item:3053}} even with going full tank assasins and adc have INSANE burst atm how else do you expect them to deal with that.\n{{item:3068}} this could be replaced by {{item:3143}}  or {{item:3025}}  or{{item:3110}}  or{{item:3022}}  so i dont see an issue here.\n{{item:3748}} how many tanks have wave clear issues? thats right a lot this is a problem with their kit not the item. if i were to go off meta and go braum top i would rush this item so i can waveclear and then build everything else that you just listed\n{{item:3065}} there are only 2 mr items currently for tanks to deal with massive amounts of magic damage. with the rise of champions like {{champion:99}}  and a whole other bunch of champions can you be surprised that people will go for an item that gives them a whopping 70 mr? i don't mr itemization is ok for the first time since they removed Force of nature.\n\nif this item path is such an issue perhaps it would do riot good to look at the REAL problem instead.\n\n\nand lets not forget that metagolem you are talking about is a 6 item build path when have you seen games go on for that long or tanks get enough gold to get that many items for that matter? currently games last 25-30 minutes and more often then not end roughly around 20 minutes without a team even trying to surrender cuz they were already at the inhib.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moulin Rouge","date":"2016-03-01T15:09:27.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'll have to give the metagolem a go.
