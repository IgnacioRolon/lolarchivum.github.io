I tried to repair it a couple of times and ultimately reinstalling the game, so i hope the errors are gone for the time being. Now, i lost 2 out of 10 ranked provisionals by remake and i couldn't connect to a few more, leading to a low priority queue penalty, so now i have to wait 20 min before i can start any of the next 5 games (pvp, coop-ai). I won't describe how irritated i am because of this. _I also now this procedure was implemented due to security reasons, in order to prevent abuses, but i find it abusive itself when people get punished the way i am right now_. A 5 min penalty wasn't that bothering, i could even go with the 10 min one, but a 20 min penalty is way to much for me to remain silent. I just want to get rid of it, so what should i do in this regard ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T02:20:31.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way to get rid of those LPQ's is to play them out. If you've been having technical issues with crashes it's best to troubleshoot those instead of trying over and over again knowing it might crash again!\n \nBe sure to first switch to ethernet if at all possible, but it'd also be really good to update your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 as well as [**troubleshooting your firewalls**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3).
