If you are spamming E during the cast time of W, and you are casting E within 0.07 seconds of W finishing, it would cost twice the mana. My bad I made a mistake on the spell-buffering on Azir's W. You can just E once, Azir will buffering the whole combo for you during the W cast time. You can just WQE and it will do all of it for you.

However, my ping often be higher than 200 pings, so ocasionally I have to press several times to do the combo smoothly. Anyway, if this bug were unfixable, I will care not to press E too much.
