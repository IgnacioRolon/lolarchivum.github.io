There simply aren't nearly as many women out there who have the skill and motivation to play LoL at a professional level. I think I've heard of the occasional woman being on a pro team, but whenever someone tries to put together an all-female team it ends up consisting of Diamonds and Masters or something, and they can't seriously compete. The candidate pool just isn't big enough. If as many women were driven to excel at LoL as men are, I'm sure it'd be around 50/50, but it simply isn't. So perhaps an entirely separate tournament, drawing from lower skill tiers so as to include more women, would be appropriate.","replies":[]}]}
