{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-11-05T13:25:38.854+0000","title":"Ban Rate shows something is unhealthy for the game/champ, not how powerful they are.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":164,"down_votes":21,"body":"Do you agree with the statement in my title?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen a lot of threads recently about certain champs asking for nerfs/changes and in many of them people post figures stating they are balanced or even weak. Yet these champs still maintain an absurdly high ban rate. Any champ with a ban rate of 20% or more should surely be looked into as to why they are banned so much and how to fix this issue and it&#039;s not just their power.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s look at some cases.\r\nAkali - Has a win rate of 46% but ban rate of 65%. Will receive more nerfs next patch. The thing complained about is her shroud but nerfing the cooldowns and lowering her damage won&#039;t fix the shroud.\r\nIrelia - 49% win rate, -5MS apparently balanced her out a little and made her main role Top again (much to Yorick&#039;s dismay). 55% plus ban rate. People just don&#039;t want to deal with her, her damage, her movement, her safety. Same issues Yasuo has.\r\nMorgana - Pretty balanced champ, in both power and role. Yet 30% ban rate (up from the last 2 years of 5-10%). This is  change in the meta, nerfs to Enchanter supports have left the most picked supports are CC vanguards and catchers, who better to stop them? What is unhealthy? The change in support meta meaning CC dominates. People ban Morgana because they want to pick a catcher and she stops you doing your job.\r\nNami - Received a nerf because her win rate was 53% while pick rate 16%. Ban rate hit 3% at one time, most the time it&#039;s less than 2%. This was a case of &#039;too much power&#039; as after the support starting items cost change as she could heal herself. So Riot nerfed the heal, her win rate went down. She was never unhealthy for the game.\r\nJhin - High ban rate while the Rageblade bug existed, ban rate has dropped after it was fixed. High ban rate during Hail of Blades bug, ban rate dropped since.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the champs who are banned most are (based on pick rate and win rate together) mostly balanced but in order for not only people to enjoy playing against them but for people to actually be able to play them, their gameplay or the game itself has to change.\r\n\r\nIn the case that a champ is banned because they are too powerful, this in itself is what is unhealthy and therefore should be look into (aka Jax, Lucian, Kai&#039;Sa).","replies":[{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-11-05T14:07:12.583+0000","up_votes":94,"down_votes":12,"body":"And zed/yasuo are one of the most banned champions that are basically always banned no matter what is going on in game, tank meta, enchanter meta, adc meta, they are the most constantly banned midlaners and still riot is not doing anything about them beside buffing","replies":[{"poster":"BigBrotherAniki","date":"2018-11-05T15:58:09.928+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Step Sis Lux,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zaApj34x,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-05T14:07:12.583+0000)\n>\n> And zed/yasuo are one of the most banned champions that are basically always banned no matter what is going on in game, tank meta, enchanter meta, adc meta, they are the most constantly banned midlaners and still riot is not doing anything about them beside buffing\n\nLike the hell Riot can   do to make Yasuo playerbase less retarded.Like no matter how you gonna nerf him or change him still you gonna have 0/13 level 7 HighNoon Yasuo in your ranked game.Like Yasuo can  even get 12 straight up buffs in a row but his playerbase would still find a way to go 0/13,he is gonna be eternally permabaned due to his playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-11-05T16:05:43.432+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just completely rework him like they did with galio","replies":[{"poster":"Cavesloth","date":"2018-11-06T00:23:41.027+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"I hate Yasuo mains with a passion, but even THEY don't deserve what RIot did to Galio.","replies":[{"poster":"Emo Twink","date":"2018-11-06T02:47:14.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"They made Galio sexier but that was the only good thing...","replies":[{"poster":"Tails Doll","date":"2018-11-06T02:51:39.159+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"Besides the fact that Galio now has an actual player base?","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-11-06T04:08:03.871+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"is he even Galio though?  he's some collossus\n\nthey could have released them as a new champion and no one would know the difference","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-11-07T13:28:51.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Inb4 Rito has to make a new champion and purposely keep the badly designed one because there were people attached to the previously outdated (and shittier) design that hasn't aged well and have to to run into the same issues of not having good balance levers to make him decent.\n\nNo thanks.\nReworks are good.

The counter to this ability is to either dodge it (duh) or fight her which is supposed to reduce the spirits length, but to fight Illaoi with your spirit there and tentacles is so punishing that it you really dont want to unless where your ahead and it barely does any damage. \n\nThis special mechanic is unique to Illaoi and it is one of the worst Mechanics I have ever seen implemented into the game on release I remember how dumb broken it was because the effect of the ability would last forever. Other than this 1 ability the champion is almost fine other than the fact that again if she is ahead and she ults no one can go in that area, but all you have to do is stay away.

Why do they get to do this? Because they lack the tools to do the opposite, iow they lack the tools to start an engage.\nSo when some moronic camille dives into an illaoi who has 4 tents, land an E and then ults it's a dream come true because THE CAMILLE JUST DID ALL OF THE HARD WORK!\nBut they have tools upon which they depends that can be played around. All of their E spells and their ultimates. These spells are so important to their success, that they are almost useless 1v1 without them.\n\nIllaoi is shockingly easy to deal with if you slow down and approach the match up methodically. It does help if you pick someone who can engage and disengage within 1 fight, like renekton or kled, champions I stated she supposedly counters. But it isn't necessary.\nBuying {{item:3123}} before you finish you first main item is a must. It counters her healing which his a huge chunk of her 1v2+ capabilities and her sustain. Not buying it is nothing short of moronic.\nPre 6, if she misses her E. PUNISH! Her damage is not that great at this point and it will take her a fair while to kill the spirit. Position properly so she can't hit both you and the spirit with 1 Q and you will likely win the trade. Hard CC helps here.\n\nIf she lands her E, let it spawn a tentacle, leave it alive and stand next to it. It will not slam you again unless illaoi uses W on you or a nearby minion\n\nPost 6 is all about baiting, which is why we want that engage/disengage. Let throw an E but keep going @ her. If she lands it 99% of the time Illaoi will be like \"haha you fking moron, time to die\" and will ult since she has 2 targets for it. \nThe moment she ults, CC her if you have CC to use and immediately disengage.\n\nThere goes the only thing she has to win 1v1's with. Her healing 1v1 has been cut down considerably and she can't 1v2 anymore. She is now a free kill assuming you haven't made a massive mistake (eg missing a CC skillshot and getting chunked).\nI handle her in this manner every time she pops up on rumble or kled.

A situation not unique to illaoi.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns with what I've said let me know. More than willing to keep chatting if I've made a mistake or if you disagree.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-11-05T16:36:35.090+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"If a champion isn't frustrating they're a minion.\n\nThe problem isn't that champions are frustrating, it's that some champions are *much* more frustrating than the rest of the roster. If every champion was as frustrating as Irelia, then it'd be fine. If every champion was as frustrating as Nami, then it'd be fine. It's when we've got a wide spread of frustration that the game feels like it's falling apart, and where it feels like so much is determined in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-11-05T18:43:15.278+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Such bullshit.\nThere are tons of champs noone minds playing against. \n\nThis is just the excuse riot uses for that shitty balancing.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-11-05T20:01:01.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name a single champion people haven't complained about at least once.
