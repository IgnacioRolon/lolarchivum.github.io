For the past couple of weeks or so I have suddenly jumped up to having 65-70ms ping. While this is far from unplayable I can notice the difference especially when I play something like Gangplank and go to do 3 barrel combos and every ms counts. I have not changed any of the software I have on my computer in the past couple of weeks and I never use to have problems so I am not sure what the cause of the sudden doubling of my ping is. I ran tracert to 104.160.131.1 and there are two weird hops at the end that I get no response from hosts and it drops 100% of the packets it recievs there but it doesnt get all of the packets. I attached an imgur screenshot of the tracert output and would love any help I can get solving this problem so I can get my ping back down in the 30-40 range.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-10T20:39:07.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the two \"No response from hosts\" aren't really anything to worry about. The details of those just aren't shown.  If it was 100% packet loss, there'd be no way for it to make it to the next hop ;)\n\nI'm not a network engineer by any means so hard for me to say if/what could be wrong with your ping, but if my Google-fu serves me correctly, it looks like it's routing you to Dallas before going back to Chicago.  I've made a note of the traceroute though to bring it up with the team to see if there's anything we can do.   If you happen to know anyone else in the same city/ISP that's experiencing similar issues, would also help to get their traceroutes as well.","replies":[{"poster":"anivanila","date":"2016-05-12T00:19:12.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm probably not on the same ISP as this guy but, many of my friends and me have had our pings rise and fluctuate from what used to be 30-40, to now 70 - 3000.
