Does anyone have an idea how to solve it? I spent 2 days already trying to solve this and I'm losing hope... tried everything. \r\n\r\nAND YES: I have all net.framework, directx etc. installed and updated. I got brand new client so deleting config can't help, I tried it. I reinstalled client many times already.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T00:47:29.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be having some serious driver or hardware failure if you're getting these blue screens.
