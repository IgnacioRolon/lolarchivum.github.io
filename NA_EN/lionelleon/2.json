It seems like they're acknowledging the give and take of maintaining a power budget, so that if you create a carry with strengths in utility and mobility, then they probably need to have low damage.  Hitting skill damage is cute, but how much does skill damage matter lategame for most ADCs?  The fact that Kalista is still using her skill lategame already puts her above most ADCs.  On top of that, most of the ADC skills that actually do get used lategame are used for utility/repositioning rather than damage, but Kalista already gets the repositioning with her autos anyway.\n\nAs for Eve, it's probably because stealth has always been hard to balance.  It's a mechanic that tends to be far stronger in solo queue than in coordinated play, so it's bound to be off-balanced in one or the other.  The other thing I could guess is concern over runeglaive on Eve, but Riot's gutting runeglaive too so that would seem a poor reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xilbur","date":"2015-07-15T13:03:01.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So champs being banned a lot with lower win rate means that it is a bad thing?","replies":[{"poster":"DrtyTrolls","date":"2015-07-15T13:07:20.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think OP is talking about champs with low WINRATES being nerfed because they got played once in LCS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2015-07-16T00:02:39.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey!
