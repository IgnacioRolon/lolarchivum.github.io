His ult is basically an undo button for being an idiot and the rest of his kit contains so many slows you may as well start the game with 100 movement speed. Then there's the high burst. Please, Riot / Meddler / someone with an insight into this. Tell me why it's ok for Ekko to be so bursty, safe and strong when you leave Kassadin in this state.\n\nLet me kick off the usual \"he's not OP because...\"\n\n1. You can dodge his Q on the way back!\nJust like you can dodge many skillshots - if you have the space and option to do so. Dodging it where you have to go closer to a tower and take a shot or are trapped against a wall means stopping or going backwards which is just what he wants with the dash blink.\n\n2. He has to plan his slowstunshieldbullshit\nOh wow. Something that does all that requires a tiny bit of planning in order to fully abuse? It's still dumb, the stun duration AND massive shield coupled with the size make it guaranteed to hit sooner or later.\n\n3. He can only dash X distance\nYes and then he blinks instantly to the target if they're within 425 range after his 325(?) dash as well as getting bonus damage for it. Why? Why does it have that? I just played against an Ekko, did poorly, haven't played Kassadin for a while but when my only escape is a blink and his blink makes him follow me what chance do other champions have? Flash away and he follows just the same. \n\n4. His ult shows where he's going to go so you can always avoid it\nOh ok. I just have to avoid the constantly moving shadow as well as all of his kit while trying to kill / escape. Gotcha. He dives in, does his combo and if he seems likely to die just goes back to where he was while damaging you and healing himself. It's a very cool mechanic but it also has far too many benefits.\n\nAm I salty? Damn right. If it's ok to trash Kassadin (still has 0 abilities that do 200 damage at rank 5) and make him take the whole game to scale into something useful why is it ok for Ekko to exist as he does in any form?","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-16T19:16:30.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Implying kass currently needs any help.\n\nBuff him and he becomes the 100% pick or ban champion again.

He has already seen amazing success in some competitive games after his small rework.\n\nThat's your assumption. I said no such thing. I was pointing out that if I couldn't get away from him with Kassadin that most champions have zero chance. The slows in his kit, all 50982309804233 of them, mean that there isn't a lot you can do to escape if he's chasing you down which is just how Kassadin used to be in the past. Now it takes Kassadin a long time to scale whereas Ekko is just really painful from the start.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dwarfykinz","date":"2015-06-15T20:17:28.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"ekko is a cancerous champ to play against, he can kill you in one cycle if you're playing the wrong champion. top reasons i ban him are \n\n1. still cancerous laning phase with too much slow to go into middle of lane even. \n\n2. get hit by shield stun and you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-06-15T20:27:27.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I ban him out because, like Katarina, it takes a really long time before you can claim that they are wrecked.

Atleast she can be stopped if she makes a mistake while ekko has an oops button with 1.3 AP scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-16T19:17:59.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, katarina has a 49% winrate or in plat+\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Katarina","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-06-16T20:10:13.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko's problem is Numbers and not his kit.

His Q is also taking a hit to the AP ratios. Which will slow down his laning phase and make him more reliant on his single target damage from his passive. (which are perfectly fine for an Assassin.)\n\n> [{quoted}](name=dwarfykinz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2i0TeANJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-15T20:17:28.565+0000)\n>\n> ekko is a cancerous champ to play against, he can kill you in one cycle if you're playing the wrong champion. top reasons i ban him are \n> \n> 1. still cancerous laning phase with too much slow to go into middle of lane even. \n> \n> 2. get hit by shield stun and you lose.\n\n1. And again, Q is getting nerfed. making his laning phase weaker.\n\n2. Stay away from the shield stun and you win.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dyonas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2i0TeANJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-15T20:31:35.427+0000)\n> \n> 2.

It's suppose to be strong but Unreliable. Realistically it's a Zoning tool, cause you don't want to get hit by it. Don't treat it as such and your doing everything wrong. The only part of that ability is reliable is the shield. Yet the duration is so short that it can be waited out. (shorter than the stun) It's practically a riven shield in it's application.\n\n\n> 4. His ult shows where he's going to go so you can always avoid it\n> Oh ok. I just have to avoid the constantly moving shadow as well as all of his kit while trying to kill / escape. Gotcha. He dives in, does his combo and if he seems likely to die just goes back to where he was while damaging you and healing himself. It's a very cool mechanic but it also has far too many benefits.\n\nIt's very difficult to benefit from all those abilities at once. He won't be in range to damage you with his ult unless he's in combat for the 4 seconds, Which is unlikely unless your building him tank. Using his ult to dive is pretty much just an escape tool. Though I noticed that this is really good at turret dives. Because you heal the damage from the turret while moving out of range. And even if you don't go out of range. Lastly he's still vulnerable to being stunlocked, but his Ult is way less effective against constant poke. Try not playing another Assassin into him. \n\n> \n> Am I salty? Damn right. If it's ok to trash Kassadin (still has 0 abilities that do 200 damage at rank 5) and make him take the whole game to scale into something useful why is it ok for Ekko to exist as he does in any form?\n\nThis is why I say he's overtuned. His Kit is dead on for a utility Assassin. So the numbers should be Adjusted. I'm thinking his base damages because he gets way much benefit from Tank build as well as High CDR builds. So make him Chose between Tankyness, utility, or Damage.","replies":[{"poster":"LionelLeon","date":"2015-06-17T01:39:23.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying ekko got hit with a  nerf on his AP ratio on his first Q( .15 AP live, PBE .1) is like saying leblanc's nerfs that changed her ratios by .05 is a big deal. his W is reliable for ganking, set it up, wait a few secs, E + aa and an AOE stun + a sheild scaling with AP, its not just a \"zoning\" tool its an initiator because u dont know where its gonna hit. his ult is way to reliable, its too easy to land it, go in, Aim W where u are, zhonyas, zhonyas over and anyone whos still around you is now stunned, stay there a sec then ult. ffs his ult has huge base damage, its AOE, it heals, and a 1.3 AP ratio.","replies":[]}]}]}
