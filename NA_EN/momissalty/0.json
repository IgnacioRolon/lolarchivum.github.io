It's really unfair for people in their promos to be held back, not because of their inability to cooperate and coordinate with a team, but because of the selfishness of a single player giving the enemy team an unfair advantage.\n\nI do have a confession to make though, I have afk'd more than once to intentionally force someone to fail their promos. I know it is a dickhole move, but 100% of the time they were incredibly rude people, and I had absolutely no desire to extend any effort they may have benefited from. \n\n\"But that about the other 3 players on the team? it's not their fault.\" No it is not their fault, unfortunately they are collateral damage. Innocent victims made to suffer because of the selfishness of two players.","replies":[{"poster":"MomIsSalty","date":"2015-04-26T22:59:32.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a dick move.

Cooperating with the other 3 to win a game where this 5th person, who is an absolute asshole, benefits the most (since he is in promos) is the problem. I do not want to do something good for that type of player.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-04-26T22:29:13.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're in bronze 5 then one simple solution if you have an afk... Don't team fight... Split push like crazy .. I know Damon well in bronze 5 people will go top for that 1 split pusher... If that happens, have everyone rush bot and take towers/drag...no buts!
