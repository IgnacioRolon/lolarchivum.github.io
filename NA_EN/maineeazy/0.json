She had the same problem that Lucian's having now where she was too good at soloing bot lane. Good damage, beautiful kiting, can dodge skillshots, and can chasedown. Too independent of her support and I guess that's not the direction they wanted for her. \n\nJust not a good time for her, especially since she can't abuse Duskblade, Ghostblade, or Cleaver like MF, Lucian, Ashe, Sivir, Draven, etc.\n\nRIP in peace Kalista <3","replies":[{"poster":"MaineEazy","date":"2016-06-02T01:27:39.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ik rito pls help her","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-05-31T23:13:36.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista's booty be hoppin?","replies":[{"poster":"MaineEazy","date":"2016-06-02T01:27:03.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mye,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mETAfN6M,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-31T23:13:36.721+0000)\n>\n> Kalista&#x27;s booty be hoppin?\n\nYou good?","replies":[]}]}]}
