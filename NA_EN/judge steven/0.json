If you feel like the game is taking a turn for the worst, then make your voice known by hitting Riot where it hurts the most, in the wallet.\n\nSimply don&#039;t buy anything from Riot while you feel like the game is in a bad state. Eventually, they&#039;ll get the message and hopefully the game can get back on track.\n\nEdit: Since several of you now have suggested that voting with our wallets might not work, and that not buying RP/skins does not equal having problems with the balance of the game, (valid point) what would you suggest we do instead, seeing as our posts on the boards don't have as much of an impact on Riot's balance/gameplay decisions as they should.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒrenet ƒrame","date":"2017-02-16T22:03:52.627+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":7,"body":"The game balance is not getting worse; the perception of what balance is just getting worse and worse. People continue to make uneducated post after post which causes people in the community to focus on the negativity of the game. In a lot of these scenarios, the people making the complaints aren't even bringing up reasonable comments. Players continue to complain patches after a champ has been gutted, complain that champs that have poor design are being ignored because riot doesn't love them and use nothing but their solo queue experiences as justification. The community also has a bad habit of arguing both sides of an argument. \"OMG I can't kill a tank\" with the next forum post complaining that a tank dies in 1.5 seconds. If you think this game has gotten to the point where it is unplayable, take a break and stop playing. You need to learn that meta does exist and there is nothing wrong with a tier 0/1/2/3/4/X existing. The important thing is that there is fair interaction between players, and while this game is by no means prefect, this still very much exists. I will continue to buy skins and contribute to this company just so they know that their are people that support their balancing decisions.","replies":[{"poster":"Boys Club","date":"2017-02-16T22:08:21.813+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Beautifully written.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-02-18T00:00:41.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Katorz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IKyYUuvK,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-02-16T22:08:21.813+0000)\n>\n> Beautifully written.\n\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/1jv7am.jpg\n\njk, jk - it's just a joke, bro!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Durfain","date":"2017-02-17T00:33:02.991+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I completely disagree.

After Season 6 and the introduction of keystone masteries, things got progressively worse from a balance point of view and I no longer feel like I can play any of my favourite champions in order to win - for the first time in League it legit feels like you need to play \"meta champs\" if you want to progress in rank which is very disappointing and takes the fun out of the game for me. Finally, Season 7 made things worse since the jungle was pretty stable in Season 6 but again got completely reworked removing two entire classes of junglers (AP  + tank junglers) making them feel terrible to jungle with so now you must also pick a meta jungler in order to ensure your best chances at winning the game. Then finally we have the most recent lethality debacle where instead of going for a reasonably incremental change from the 0.4/0.6 formula to a 0.5/0.5 formula, Riot decided to go full retard mode and change it t 0.6/0.4 making lethality broken again at all stages of the game (except now even  better late game) and we're back to having to pick AD champions again if we want a chance at winning the game.

For those of you who don't know the full story, the first Non-NPC / non-mercenary Pandaren (not just reskinned Furbolgs) was first introduced in a bonus campaign in Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne as the new Brewmaster hero class with Chen Stormstout helping you (Rexxar.)  A year later, WoW launched at the end of 2004, and since that time, players had been saying things like \"wouldn't it be cool to be Chen? It'd be funny to be a panda!\" \n\nAfter the utter disaster that was Cataclysm, Blizzard had already done an April fools day mock update that teased pandas as a new race in the \"next expansion.\"  After the numbers came back and they saw players were essentially abandoning the ship they sailed into an iceberg on purpose as they plugged their ears to the warnings, they panicked and made Pandaland the official expansion.  That alone was sad, but the fact that it was so rushed, and they were so desperate for fun elements to keep people playing (remember getting like a hundred toys that clogged your bags?) that they were willing to throw the kitchen sink at us in an attempt to stop the sinking ship made a lot of angry vets speechless.  \n\nIt started as a fucking JOKE, but they didn't know what else to do when a disgusted playerbase started leaving en mass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2017-02-16T20:06:34.011+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RookPusher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IKyYUuvK,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2017-02-16T19:39:21.431+0000)\n>\n> After Cataclysm, people started leaving in droves.

How are they then suppose to realize that you're not buying RP because you want balance changes, as oppose to you don't like any of the skins available? How are they to even know the reason you're not buying RP has anything to do with the game at all? You might have stopped buying RP because your saving up for a different game, or buying a new car, or your rent went up, or you got a pay cut, or any number of other things.\n\nSending an email to Meddler would be more likely to get Riot's attention than stopping your once every 6 months purchase of RP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2017-02-16T19:45:30.733+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep at the end of the day its a company and they wanna make money $$$$","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-02-16T22:03:19.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been doing that for quite a while now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-02-17T01:07:08.011+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem is, those who are whining about it being the worst ever, are exactly what.
