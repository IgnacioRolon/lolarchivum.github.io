I&#039;ve strive&#039;d to change my attitude because I used to get chat restrictions, I have one bad game and I get permabanned??? I mean these guys were assholes in the pregame, and I got triggered and wanted to ruin their game. I was wrong, I admit it. But permabanned? Please reconsider! I've supported this game for a long time out of my own pocket, I know that doesn't give me any right to be toxic, but cmon! I don't purposely try and ruin this game for others! I had a bad day, got triggered by some assholes, and acted out.

I had like 200 chat restrictions and got through them all and I feel I reformed pretty good. Then I took a long break and just recently (December) started playing again. Also, somehow my account was compromsied and had ppl playing on it for who knows how long but I don't think that has anything to do with my permaban. Today I was toxic in a game, and by toxic I mean I got triggered by asshole teammates and just decided to feed and make them lose. I know, dumb idea. Then I log back in later to see I got permabanned for it? And they give you your chatlogs, with no context it doesnt show none of the asshole things they say to me, and yes I reported them too.\n\nI don't intentionally ruin games, I don't like it when it happens to me either. But when I'm being trolled and people are trying to piss me off? I got triggered and had a bad game. Now I'm permabanned after working so hard to reform, and support refuses to give me any sort of possibility to reinstate my account. I think that is complete bull and a slap in the face to a loyal player who has supported the game financially for as long as I've played.\n\nWhat choice do I have but to accept it? I just hope those assholes got the same punishment, but I highly doubt it.\n\nThis system of yours Riot, it does nothing to curb trolls. Trolls do not care if they get banned. You're only hurting loyal players, who might have behavioral issues that can reform. I've honestly tried. I've had support replies saying that I've been improving. I am willing to accept a punishment, I just feel that a permaban for someone who isn't a troll whos only joy in the game is ruining others good time is extremely harsh and unfair. You're hurting players who actually want to play and not be toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-01-19T05:48:47.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you might have been gone when the punishment system changed if your last punishment was a 200 game chat restriction.\n\nLong gone are the days of infinitely stacking chat restrictions.
