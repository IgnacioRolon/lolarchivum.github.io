Last season I played jungle primarily this season though I have found top more desirable for my play style therefore this season I will be maining top.  My team experience is diamond 4  (last season as jungle for top was my secondary role at the time I got to plat 4 on a team where I was there sub top-lane). My main champions are as follows Poppy Nidalee Ekko Fizz  Naut Irelia Maokia!! and a few other picks like darius and such that are niche and I adapt quickly to the meta so if the team feels I should learn more champions then I will. =D\nMy current rank is gold 4 in promos to gold 3 I am climbing quickly and will not see myself not doing so in the future. \nI have any voice comms \nI am free any day after 3 to 10 and weekends whenever I work at the university as an intern so my time is very flexible.
