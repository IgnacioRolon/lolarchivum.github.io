Today when i woke up i asked my brother about it and he told me he was just messing with me and that it was a joke and he was gonna change it back when i noticed i then proceeded to inform the mod i discussed the \"stolen account\" with and he told me the account would not be un-banned because there wasn't enough evidence i own the account?\r\nIn my eyes this seems ridiculous i was the one who submitted the ticket (i thought my account was being hacked) and after i figure out it was my brother playing a joke and tell him i'm sorry for the inconvenience he tells me there isn't enough evidence to show i'm the owner of my account? How is this justified? I have screenshots of my rp purchases on the account and multiple confirmations from over the time i've been playing and he said they were not useful and the account would remain banned, someone please help\r\nThanks,\r\nSi Turtle","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T01:42:42.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow man, that *really* sucks if your brother was playing a prank on your and now you're locked out of your account due to security reasons. The only way of getting that account unbanned at this point is to answer the account recovery questions to show that you were the one who created to account. Screenshots of anything don't really help since, well, anyone who hacked the account could have those screenshots =\\ . \n\nThe questions being asked are most likely only going to be answerable by the person who created and consistently played on the account. If you don't remember all of them, that's quite alright, just do your best to answer the ones you do remember. Don't worry too much about getting them wrong, as we won't lock you out of trying to recover the account from incorrect answers. Take a little time, and do your best to answer the questions you can.","replies":[]}]}
