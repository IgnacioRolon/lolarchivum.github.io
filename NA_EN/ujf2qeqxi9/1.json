And play the game, but they will be monitored to ensure the Toxic, ToS offending behavior is no longer an issue.\n\nRiot has an entire department dedicated to player to player interaction, attitudes, and toxic players. They do not just focus on Pro-Players. Just like anything the only ones that make waves, get publicity, and are well known of are the PRO PLAYERS. Media outlets that cover information, multiple interviewers, and most of reddit give next to no shit, about Johnny2Shoes Silver 2, but that doesn't mean that they do not receive notifications about being able to return to play LoL if they would like.\n\nSo please, just stop acting like I'm defending Riot.

Jensen was therefore **allowed to keep playing League**—albeit not at the same competitive level he might be sans permaban—and Riot could monitor his behavior to see if he’d actually improved at all with time and experience.\n\n(Bolding mine) I'm not saying I agree or not, but later on he was allowed to keep playing while being monitored....","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-02T17:02:28.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"God, you sir are amazing.
