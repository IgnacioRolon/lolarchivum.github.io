It has been useful for me when I watch twitch/netflix on my other monitor to avoid stuttering.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-09T03:24:05.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It typically causes stuttering, there is utterly no reason it would prevent it, though.\n\nThat sounds like bad hardware acceleration configuration, honestly.

It prioritizes CPU and GPU resources to the game. So even if Netflix or twitch is running in the background, it doesn't affect my games. Yes, disabling hardware acceleration works for Twitch, but that is not an option for CPU intensive games.\n\nGame Mode never bothered me one bit except when it comes to the LoL client. For most people, it will do absolutely nothing. For me, it helps because i run stuff in the background all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-09T20:51:47.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should not needs to prioritize anything, those can handle hardware acceleration while playing without any issues.\n\nSoftware is screwed up, fix the cause instead of the symptom.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
