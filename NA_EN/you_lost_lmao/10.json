Someone who is bad at the game and keep dying to enemy and blames\r\n2.) Someone who intentionally follow you to lane to die or play poorly, or pick a very off meta champion, or type random gibberish to make the gaming environment more hectic\r\n3.) Someone who calls people names and blames them for dying and curse a lot \r\n\r\n**Example of goal of this post:** say like #2 wins, if someone calls someone a troll, and the standards of #2 isn&#039;t on there, we can just immediately know that he himself does not know the meaning of troll. Therefore we would insta mute him before making our game a hectic environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-11-05T05:09:53.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A troll is a person who causes unnecessary grief which makes achieving a goal more difficult than it should be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-11-05T13:12:39.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you","replies":[]},{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2016-11-05T06:20:34.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to make  this a poll","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamiku Entry","date":"2016-11-05T05:36:35.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only problem is neither of those options is what defines a Troll or trolling behavior. To troll someone, you aggrivate, or annoy someone on purpose, for the sole purpose of doing so, and achieving a sense of achievement in doing so. This can also include being wrong intentionally in a situation forcing the other person to correct you needlessly over and over. A shit eating grin usually gives this away. As it pertains to the game, an example is.....say I'm jungling and my mid laner is being toxic and demanding I gank him when he has 150 hp and won't back. I'll ping I'm on my way, target ping the enemy Ahri, and wait in bush. When he goes in I step out the bush, then just walk back up the river and leave. He goes into a fight he can't win and dies because he thought i was ganking. Trolled. \n\nThere are more examples, but your 3 options fall under other categories.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-05T05:03:15.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, a troll is somebody who intentionally antagonizes anybody else for personal enjoyment. \n\nThis can be done through intentional feeding, misusing abilities to help enwmies, saying things to intentionally tilt their team, or other things like that.","replies":[]}]}
