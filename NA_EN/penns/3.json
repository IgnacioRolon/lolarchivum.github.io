Like, Yasuo tornado for example can crit. Idk if it actually works like that or he only heals off the first target hit, but if he crits a whole minion wave with his Q then... well.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-14T14:30:02.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only works off of the first target hit. The thing critting MUST apply on-hits and only the first target hit by Yasuo's q applies on-hits. It used to apply to spells that crit, but because of Yasuo's Q critting an entire minion wave, Pantheon has to suffer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
