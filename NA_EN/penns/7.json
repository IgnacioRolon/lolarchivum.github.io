I've never seen the only reason ppl would build it on burst mages is because there's no better mpen alternative for them.\n\nSplitting it in 2 items is the same as removing it in favour of burst mages. The ones who like the item right now will have no access or very limited access to Mpen. Adding an alternative gives everyone what they want.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-09-23T19:04:00.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but liandry's has flat pen for anti squishy specifically and the passive for anti tank specifically.
