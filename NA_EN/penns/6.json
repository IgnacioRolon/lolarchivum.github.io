Her E is very easy to dodge, her Q is telegraphed, and without her catching 4-5 people out with a flash ult, her ult isn't actually great if say, it hits only 1 person (especially if she has no tentacles set up prior to ulting).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-12-07T06:26:13.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I hate fighting her in teamfights, you're on the ball.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-12-07T07:01:27.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PRoblem isn't that she is bad as much as she has a LOT of counterplay compared to most champions. Her power is far too specific and niche, and her weaknesses are like a grocery shopping list.\n\nIf you can play her well, she can outplay very hard.....in very specific situations IF you are set up around your tentacles, or have multiple man ults and don't die afterwards. If you don't meet the mentioned criteria, then you will get pooped on, especially in team fights. She is pretty good 1v1 with some matchups If the enemy doesn't play super aggressive. If you are against Renekton, Fiora, or any of the currently popular top laners in solo queue, she will get pushed in, and out of range of her own tentacles. \n\nIt isn't an auto win or anything, but Riot seems to have focused a bit too hard on her shtick, and didn't really think too far into what happens if even a single part of it doesn't match up. The higher you go in ranked as well with higher skilled players, the easier she is to counter just by playing around her, and less about it mattering what champion you pick. \n\nshe is supposed to be a bruiser/juggernaut, but she is much less tanky with too much focus being put on her tentacles healing her (which is easy to negate by just killing them, which yes, is rather easy), and her damage is decent, but still less than say, Renekton with more tools and mobility. She doesn't really fill her spot very well, and she is about one bad month away from being a (at best) B tier support, as she will be pushed out of top lane very soon, as people in mid to high diamond and above already are saying how useless she is past laning phase, and easily countered in lane and giving up on her. (The amount of streamers I see straight up making fun of her as a champ is kind of depressing, but I guess it counteracts how ridiculous Tahm Kench is :P)","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-12-07T08:11:04.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly want to hold my opinion on Illaoi for now.

Just so she can build AP items at all.\n\nI think the difference between the champions you named, and Illaoi, is the actual depth of character. \n\n- Oriana has full control of the manipulation of her ball, as well as being able to combo it with others like putting it on malphite for the \"ball delivery system\" and so on. There is a lot of surface depth, and real depth to playing her at low and higher levels.\n\n- Lee Sin has a lot of ability to outplay with his kit that is hard to see on the surface, but it has a lot of depth to it that takes a lot of skill realistically to pull off fully.\n\n- Yasuo I think is more towards the Illaoi side of \"depth\" as his stuff is pretty obvious, just not as easy to pull off, but he has more very blunt tools so to speak to just whack you over the head with (free crit all over the place for example and synergizes well with so many champions).\n\n\nIllaoi however isn't actually very deep, concept wise. Her skills are very obvious, as is her power. She has no direct synergy outside of what other champs would have with the same champs. She needs to play around her tentacles, and everything is that. No other champion puts down tentacles, so no synergy there, her ult is just, put down even more tentacles, and spam W to make them hit people. It LOOKS like a lot going on, but realistically, she has a very shallow playstyle, that when you dig deeper into it, is very easy to counter because when she has to play around her kit to succeed, that makes it easier for others to simply do the same and play away from her strengths, and her whole shtick falls apart very quickly the further from laning phase you get.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-12-07T06:21:01.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand your thought process.

Annoying ish in lane, but offers nothing out of it, and can't roam at all or make tp plays because she can't do anything (as much) with no tentacles set up, as it is a lot of her damage. If you want to play someone for her \"playstyle\" as you said, why aren't you playing Tahm, or Renekton or something?

If you play aggressive on her then it is very easy to bully her. She doesn't have the best mana pool, so simply baiting out her Q a few times and you can easily win trades. In team fights, she isn't going to be doing anything insane unless the stars align for her, because if all of her boxes for her great circumstance aren't checked, she loses a lot of her power and becomes at best, an annoying sack of hit points to ignore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-12-07T05:21:33.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well the idea that there's a champion who single-handedly ensures teamfights assuming she can get five people into a relatively large AOE circle and then proceed to just beat their faces in with raw damage is pretty cool to me, atleast","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-12-07T05:23:10.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah assuming you get into 5 people without dying","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-12-07T05:26:26.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Penns,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wQWsELE0,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-07T05:23:10.772+0000)\n>\n> Yeah assuming you get into 5 people without dying\n\nWell, there IS righteous Glory","replies":[{"poster":"Beldair","date":"2015-12-07T06:14:24.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is Kalista too XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-12-07T07:04:26.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jbels,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wQWsELE0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-07T05:21:33.556+0000)\n>\n> Well the idea that there's a champion who single-handedly ensures teamfights assuming she can get five people into a relatively large AOE circle and then proceed to just beat their faces in with raw damage is pretty cool to me, atleast\n\nShe is actually not that great in team fights. If she doesn't get a perfect ult, then she has nothing else, unless you are for some reason fighting where she set up all her tentacles. If she has none, then that actually negates a lot of her assumed damage that takes up her power budget.
