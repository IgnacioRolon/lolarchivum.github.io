When they are good, you have at least one guy who is semi-reliably not getting to play the interesting parts of the game. And you have a second guy stuck on defending him.\n\nAssassins are elusive. They are hard to gank and hard to pin down due to their overbearing mobility. This pushes gameplay early on away from mid lane (i can't gank this) and into the side lanes. Because of dragon, into bottom lane. This does two things:\n1. it prevents the top lane from participating in the game. Jungler has less incentive to be in top half of map, top lane roaming mid to gank is less viable: Thus top lane becomes Island and this restricts play styles considerabely. \n2. it puts bottom lane to be mostly a recipient of ganks, rather than a donor of ganks. Being a donor of ganks is generally fun and being a recipient is generally not fun. If mid lane is \"ungankable\" and also \"good at killing bottom lane\" that restricts roaming options from bottom lane, taking away 'fun' from bottom lane. \n\nAssassins are generally NON PLAYMAKERS. put simply: we need more options for tanks and front line champions in the mid lane.

Most emphasis is usually in the bot lane, and this is not an assassin's fault, but mostly how the meta is solo queue is developed. \n3. Assassins are generally proactive by either roaming or just using their mobility to engage a fight. The only non playmaking aspect of them is when they wait for you to make a mistake, but there are multiple champions like those and all champions use that to an extent.

There is a multitude of reasons each contributing some portion. The argument that mid lane pick has no influence on how much each lane gets ganked is equally erroneous. \n\n>  Whether you have mage mid, an adc mid or an assassin mid the junger has little reason to go top in most games. The mid lane pick doesnt influence that at all.\n\nGankable mid lane picks results in roaming from top to mid and roaming from bot to mid, in order to gank. High escapes on mid pick results in a much more limited roaming situation. Roamind top->mid and bot->mid is very desirable especially the top->mid roam possibility, because these add a lot to the enjoyment of the game from bot and top players...\n\nbot lane benefits because being able to gank mid serves as a respite from the \"gangbanged at bot\" pattern of play. It allows bot to be agressive and proactive, which is fun, rather than playing a wait for jungler wait for the big 4-man gank style. \n\ntop lane benefits more heavily because roaming mid is a big way into the game as a whole. If top lane receives no ganks and has no objectives and donates no ganks than top lane is an island and only has limited play style. Being able to gank the mid lane opens up the gamaplay options for top lane in a big way. \n\n> If we have tanks and front line champions mid\n\nI think you've already seen the connecting thread in my post: each and every one of my suggestions harms mid lane in some way.\n\nThe reality is most people do not want to play tanks.

Including with Meddler. So insult me all you want because I have a hard time understanding sentence structures(especially over the internet where everything is text). It doesn't change my overall point.\n\nThe boards don't represent the community, they represent those with cause to complain. A shit ton of people enjoy playing squishy champions, and there are already 3 roles where tanky champions play. Forcing them into mid for no reason would have the same problematic repercussions as forcing Mordekaiser into bottom lane. There is no reason to. Mid is viable for the broad variety of mages, assassins, a few skirmishers and a couple ADCs no level of forced variety is needed. The boards want to force that because they are full of exceptions, a bunch of people who are on the fringe of what is normal. Mains of champions only mildly popular or quite unpopular(such as my main). So the point that 'people like to be able to pick champions that don't pop when you sneeze on them.' has little relevancy. Just because a small portion of the community wants to force their class into every role in the game, doesn't mean it is good for game health or would appease the broader global audience of players.\n\nSo regardless of how much 'credibility' I lost with somebody that has posted negatively on my threads *anyway* for months. It still is a bad idea.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2017-05-03T02:22:46.558+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mages went midlane because they also are often inmobile, so the shorter lane means shorter distance to the lane tower, which is another problem of assassins, their mobility overlaps with a shorter lane making them even more ungankeable.\n\nPlus, mages vs bruisers/tanks in midlane is much less aggravating that mages vs assassins because of the shorter lane and bruiser/tanks lack the mobility and sheer burst that assassins have.\n\nPlus, there are a hella lot of mages that can deal really easily with tank/bruisers, either by shredding them or by pushing them like crazy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-05-03T11:51:50.078+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't the mid lane meta...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-05-03T00:48:00.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"At least Syndra can miss her spells as they are all telegraphed, delayed and aimed except for ult which even then requires set-up.
