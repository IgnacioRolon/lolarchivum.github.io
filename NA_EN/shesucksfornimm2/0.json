They give the idea of player freedom with talent builds and can lead to interesting play styles. The problem is that the current talent trees are to cookie cutter. Everyone picks the same thing for the same champion and have to use whatever the dominant key stone is for that champion or not be able to play the champion to its full potential and get trolled by team mates. \n\nThe talent trees themselves need to be reworked all over again, honestly the old talent trees offered more diversity than the current ones and you could get away with different builds easier back then, they weren't that different and cookie cutters were dominant back then too. This is the issue with tying so many modifiers into the trees. All they did when they changed the old trees into the current was cut down the number of options and added the key stones. Less options doesn't exactly lead to diversity, when the majority of the talents are still dmg/def modifiers.\n\nI like the idea of key stones because they encourage developing different play styles depending on how you want to build the champion but again the current trees and even the current Key Stones, which are just bigger dmg/def modifiers than the rest of the talents, don't encourage this idea at all. This is also the same for most item builds. Diversity just loses to the strongest cookie cutter. Making talents more unique and less numbery would be a step in the right direction I think, and can lead to better key stones. But this is my opinion, figured I put it out there. The new Warlords definetly is a step in the right direction though.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-03-10T22:35:09.495+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"you've never seen a garen with CotC dominate before, when i asked him about he said \"i ike the picture\"","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2017-03-11T03:08:25.506+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i saw a garen that had cotc carry a game in like. mid/high diamond from a stream i was watching. the man had an infinity edge on top of his normal garen build.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2017-03-10T21:24:09.103+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I too like the keystones.\n\nThe problem is, IMO, that keystones as a whole presented a whole lot of extra power that wasn't in the old mastery system, especially offensively.
