But considering how easily it is to engage as Darius, one laning with him wouldn&#039;t be stupid enough to get juked and pulled...right? Well in some cases this just doesn&#039;t matter - his E range is considerably misleading (to user and opponent). Maining Darius toplane (an incredible feat, I know) last season I found that I would land more hooks more often than not and think &#039;I really shouldn&#039;t have landed that&#039;. My point being, Darius&#039; E, Apprehend, is represented poorly, to both the user and the opponent. I would like to debate on _**either shortening the actual pull gradient to the targeted area it actually represents, or lengthening the target area to represent the actual pull range**_.
