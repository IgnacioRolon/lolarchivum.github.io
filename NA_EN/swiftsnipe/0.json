Maybe they didn't want to spend the resources; maybe they thought it'd be confusing for cross-map players; maybe they just realized they still hadn't come up with a place to display map-specific changes after four years.\n\nAnyway, they did say broader systemic changes were possible (e.g. gold, xp). However, there haven't been any of these changes either since the xp nerfs to Support meta. Moreover, Treeline hasn't been included in any Missions. The ranked season start Missions even explicitly excluded ranked TT.\n\n3v3 love would be great, but it seems increasingly unlikely.","replies":[{"poster":"swiftsnipe","date":"2018-01-29T21:05:42.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it just seems odd that they put so much effort into creating a game type with a cool boss monster, lore, and a unique play style and then not maintain it.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2018-01-29T22:05:41.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a former Dominion player.
