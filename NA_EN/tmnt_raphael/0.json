I don't think it is lag as other champs and minions still move normally. But my champion does not respond to anything for about 10 seconds. My champion will still proceed with whatever action it was doing before the no response time but not do anything i tell it for about 10seconds. For example, if i told it to attack a champ it will continue doing so, but no abilities or summoner spells will go off, even if i spam all spells, flash and heal after about 10 seconds when my champion starts responding again nothing will have gone off. Normally if you lag and press spells or flash your champ will still flash as soon as your lag stops. It happens very randomly, sometimes every 5min. \r\n\r\nPlease, someone help.","replies":[{"poster":"Asudurga","date":"2017-02-18T20:36:46.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/wmWGtT2W-riot-the-hell-is-with-these-sudden-lag-spikes I'm pretty much getting the same issues.
