But when I activate League voice it comes out of my second monitor. I messed with the sound settings making sure all sounds go thru my headset but it still wont work. I did reset the sound back to default and tried again but no luck. Any recommendations?","replies":[{"poster":"chupaacabra","date":"2018-04-07T01:31:37.496+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude - can you double-check in your system settings for your computer what your \"communications device\" is set to? It may be your second monitor. We are going to change how we use playback device vs communications device in several patches, but for now make sure that communications and playback devices are set to what you'd like to hear your teammates' voices come from.","replies":[{"poster":"BottomFragChad","date":"2018-04-07T20:16:54.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the help I can't believe I was that dumb to not realize this.
