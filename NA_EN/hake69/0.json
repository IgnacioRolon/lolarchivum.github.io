But one big concern is making me wonder how bad the new jungle can be.\r\nWith the small camps appering each 100 seconds (doubled from 50) and just giving a 20% extra gold, with no conservation passive from Spirit Stone (either the Gold Income passive from Wriggle's) and no longer Gold rewards from dragon, and also the new jungle items (with their respectible costs). Don't you think junglers will be lacking gold?\r\nThat's a HUGE impact to the game, and i felt it the last time i've seen Nightblue3 playing preseason changes. It's like junglers now have like 30% less gold than they should, and that makes your ganks and your overall pressure decay easily.\r\n\r\nThe question is, is that intentional? I would love to know Riot's stance on this, cause it's the only thing I think that could impact the game so bad since Preseason changes are quite focused to jungle.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about it guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-11-20T06:49:46.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I do see some ways they made up for it such as that new jungle item that changes smite into a mark to do true damage against the enemy but I so see the point you are making. Though Maybe its to make up for the added damage and faster pace? I am not fully sure myself but we will just have to see how all of this pans out.","replies":[{"poster":"hakE69","date":"2014-11-20T07:13:27.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but, as pointed before, small camps now respawn after 100 seconds instead of 50, and only gives 20% extra gold, so they become even more relevant but also give ~80% less gold\n\nWhich also makes Wraiths and Wolves a resource to be taken only by junglers (when some midlaners farmed them before). So I think they should do something. Maybe adding an effect for smite like \"it gives you N% more gold when you kill a monster\", or something like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lafouboy","date":"2014-11-20T06:45:38.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Don't farm camps.
