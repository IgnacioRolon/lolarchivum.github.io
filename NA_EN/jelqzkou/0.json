Constant 60 to 00-13 at times","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI've been experiencing FPS drops since I've put Windows 10 on my laptop. I had Windows 8.1 and didn't have any problems with it. When I play games, I have 60 FPS constant but at times it drops to 03-05 FPS and it's like a screen freeze for about 5 seconds. After I installed Windows 10, I've upgraded all of my drivers, I have a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M with 4GB RAM, 8GB DDR3 L Memory, Intel Core i7, so I don't think it's my laptop doing issues. I've read literally dozens of topics, tried everything and I still have those drops, which is really annoying. Can anyone help me please?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T23:36:57.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the FPS and freezing issues on Windows 10 are caused by the Windows Game Bar and its *Game DVR* feature. I strongly recommend disabling the Game Bar entirely using [this guide](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nLet me know if this resolved the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mterdon","date":"2016-10-17T13:16:34.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if you have the same problem as me but I get microstutter/fps drops when people die sometimes. Is your cpu, gpu, disk usage really high and what settings are you using such as vsync? I personally am using vsync because without it I get bad screen tearing. I have also fiddled around the nvidia control panel but nothing helps.","replies":[]}]}
