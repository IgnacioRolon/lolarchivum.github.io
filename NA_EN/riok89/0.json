That boosts his waveclear substantially and provides Mana sustain in accordance with his current W into E waveclear pattern, all without making him do too much damage as a support in the laning phase. Waveclear and Mana sustain around CSing is the only way to bolster his midlane presence into being functional without being overpowered as a support, his kit is otherwise enjoyable and great to play besides his E being lackluster in it's range and functionality\n\nP.S: His base AD is a little lower than most mages and makes CSing with autos extremely frustrating, a few small points of base AD early could go a long way","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-09-19T07:21:18.946+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the changes looking good so far, i.e. is that probably the way you'll go (after maybe some tuning), or will you try out other paths?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG Doublerift","date":"2017-09-19T18:37:31.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you experiment with changing his E to *always* spread his burn passive (regardless of whether the target is burning or not) and then give it a different effect if the target is already burning? \n\nI realize that'd be a straight buff to his power level, but it'd make his waveclear much more satisfactory and comparable to other AoE mages in the midlane. It'd allow you to E + W a wave (instead of W + E) to get the bonus damage from W, which would also work with you adding mana refunds to his W on minion kill. \n\nPersonally, I think his current E (low-damage, single-target, point & click ability) is really bland if the target isn't already burning - it only serves to enable his Q stun or stack his passive. If it spread his burn passive to all enemies near your target as a baseline, it'd be much more interesting and cohesive with his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bahmpocalypse","date":"2017-09-19T12:52:54.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler, Have you guys considered moving this restore mana to his E instead of his W?
