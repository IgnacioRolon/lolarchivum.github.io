I'm saying that getting a 2-1-6 score with 4 turrets destroyed an inhib and 2 dragons to your name is the same stats (and same mastery score I would bet) whether you do it in bronze or in diamond. However, the player who does it in diamond has to be more skilled to get those same stats bc people react to plays better at higher ranks and value objectives more. For instance it is more likely that you can sneak a dragon (or 3) solo in low elo than that you will be able to do that in higher elo. Especially since if you sneak it the first time against stronger players they will add 6 to the time when they see the flash on your teammates saying you got it, and will ward around that time so you can't sneak it a second time.\n\nThat's what I meant by \"it's a stat thing\" rather than a skill thing. It is based off stats, rather than intangible influence (for instance I doubt it counts if you roam to another lane and push their lane out so your team can take tower, you are the reason the tower goes down but someone else may have had the last hit on it), or based on skill (the above example shows how the same stats can require different skill levels).","replies":[{"poster":"Helius the Sun","date":"2015-11-26T11:44:37.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then how come in the same game when yasuo{{champion:157}}  had 16/1/9 with 4 turrets and 2 dragons and me as sona{{champion:37}}  had 6/2/14 with 2 turrets and 0 dragon, yasuo got s- and i got s+?","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainGlorious","date":"2015-12-30T22:32:15.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Helius the Sun,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zxv8Bd1I,comment-id=000500000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-26T11:44:37.357+0000)\n>\n> then how come in the same game when yasuo{{champion:157}}  had 16/1/9 with 4 turrets and 2 dragons and me as sona{{champion:37}}  had 6/2/14 with 2 turrets and 0 dragon, yasuo got s- and i got s+?\n\nTwo totally different roles with different criteria.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainGlorious","date":"2015-12-30T22:31:31.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Krigjer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zxv8Bd1I,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-05-11T04:18:50.322+0000)\n>\n> I don't mind the points accumulation but getting a B score when you feel you deserve higher is frustrating. \n> \n> I would rather they remove the grading system entirely, as opposed to giving your score clarity, honestly.\n\nBooo, score clarity would give us a tangible way to improve.
