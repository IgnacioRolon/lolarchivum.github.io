Although it was fairly easy for most parts of it ( there wasn't a lot of details like my Jhin cosplay was earlier this year). I really enjoyed this cosplay and want to remake the wings with a more stable harness base. \n\nAnd no, I didn't have the cookies, I had the tray, but the convention center wouldn't let me bring it in. Ironically though, I do bake a lot like Morgana.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ΤwistedTreeline","date":"2017-09-30T21:35:07.351+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wings Look sick, GG :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-10-02T18:57:28.439+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you should give yourself more credit because this looks fantastic! You've never drafted a pattern but your top still came out so clean and the lace detailing on your skirt is a really nice touch! :) I hope you'll share more of your cosplay with us in the future!","replies":[{"poster":"BL00D M00N JHIN ","date":"2017-10-03T01:32:27.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thank you. I actually have posted my Jhin cosplay I made earlier this year a few months ago which I feel is a lot better due to having more time to work on it. It didn't get noticed that much here like this one. I am really flattered by the amount of positive comments this has gotten motivating me to work harder on the next one. Thank you for having faith in me and motivating me to keep working.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pinkaj","date":"2017-09-30T19:03:51.886+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wowwwww!

The wings where a last minute thing I made since the supplies I needed to make the tattered ones where not available when I made this. So I had to make due with what I had and went a route I was comfortable with rather then trying something new that could have been a failure and cost me more time then it should have. If I had more time to work on this cosplay ( like two days a week for a month) I probably would have done better on the wings.  I did say in the main post I wanted to remake the wings. And for the reason you said-They don't match her design.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2017-09-30T17:40:27.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow very cool!\n\n(btw i am normally no big cosplay fan ^^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DonatellaVersace","date":"2017-09-30T17:23:34.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gorgeous!! <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-09-30T15:25:15.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worth, thats bitching!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-02T22:37:56.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beautiful!
