In doing so, you removed pretty much the two most mechanically unique and interesting parts of his kit.  Mastering Karthus means aiming your Lay Wastes on isolated priority targets consistently.  If you remove it, he becomes more of a face-roll character than he already is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talll","date":"2015-04-25T00:59:16.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karth is completely fine bro, granted he along with other champions will be changed as new ones come out so they won't be to weak/powerfull against them.\n\n~ **_Crumbs_**","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackcat1300","date":"2015-04-24T22:41:21.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a nerff and in no way dose it help his late game and his Q dose 60% on sing targets not 30%.\n\nI would have his Q do triple damage to single target Champions, pets and jungle mobs double damage to aoe jungle mobs, champs, pets and single target minions and the normal damage to aoe minions. This way his q actualy hurts late game when i his you as a single target and early game. \n\nE: currently dose   TOGGLE OFF: When Karthus kills a unit, he restores mana.\nMANA RESTORED: 20 / 27 / 34 / 41 / 48\n\nTOGGLE ON: Karthus surrounds himself with the souls of his victims, draining his mana to deal magic damage to enemies in range each second.\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 (+ 20% AP) \n\nThe wall needs to do damage and the ult needs to cause a 3 second % of max life damage while the ult is channeled with when ever a champion would other wise live or would not have their health drop below 1 it dose and they die. They then revive at the nexis with their passive up. {{champion:266}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:23}} {{item:3026}} \n\nThis way no one is safe when their health is low and the ult has such a long cool down that it just punishes bad players that let their health get low and helps give his own special nitch. Zack died but his passive is still up for later in the game but he still died with his low health. The birning effect is for lazzy spell shields. No you have to time it right not just say oh he is ulting I use it now.","replies":[]}]}
