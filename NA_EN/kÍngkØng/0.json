You'd think 9 years later they'd be able to have a decent amount of artists where things aren't backed up for 6+ months.","replies":[{"poster":"Samuel Murphy","date":"2019-09-08T00:31:10.943+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will always be a \"shortage\" Because a game this big has a lot of moving parts.

They have meetings and meetings to decide where they should allocate artist resources. \n\nYeah more people means more man hours are spent on the game but the effectiveness of each person is much lower in a company of 500 employees vs a company of 15 employees.
