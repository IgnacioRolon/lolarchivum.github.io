A lot of ADCs will try to dictate which support to choose, which summoners to take, everything. But what really gets to me is when someone calls you shit, or tells you that you suck all game, or you accidentally take *one single freaking cs* its \"GG report my supp.\" Also some adcs go all in when you're simply poking the enemy then they die and they blame you like wtf. I really really hate bot lane. I think I'll just mute the adc at the beginning of the game because this is freaking ridiculous. I'm positive that this has happened to everyone that has ever supported because I even see it a lot even when I'm not playing support.\r\n The last game I tilted pretty hard because it's the 5th game in a row that the adc is talking trash except this time it was to me.  What happened was vayne overstayed at 15% hp, died, then rage quit. that caused me to die because I followed the idiot, and then he came back and raged at me the rest of the game. Holy shit man.\r\nI just needed to vent, and you ADCs learn some god damn respect for your teammates.","replies":[]}
