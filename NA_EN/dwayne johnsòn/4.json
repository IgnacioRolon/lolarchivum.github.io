I then played a game which i loss and my score was good 21/6/12. I had around 300 cs in both games, but the difference between the games was that i got a S on the 15/5/5 one and got a S- on the other. I am trying to get m7 tokens and i noticed in my past m7 token grindings that no matter how good your score is you will never get a S if you lose the game.

S+ in a losing game seems unthinkable unless it's a really long game and you're a diamond/master/challenger (MAYBE plat)  player who makes virtually no mistakes across the board in everything. \n\nIt also depends on what champion you're playing and how many other people have gotten S grades with that champion before.  I suspect that the game has a bit of machine learning when it comes to tracking individual champion performance.  S grades this year seemed far easier to get in the preseason and at the start of season 7 than they have been the past couple months.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-10-29T03:06:22.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've personally received an S in a losing game before, so it's possible, although improbable.\n\nI'm pretty sure win/loss is a factor towards grade directly so with equal stats the win will be otherwise better, but besides that when you lose you tend to have lower statistics all around.","replies":[]}]}
