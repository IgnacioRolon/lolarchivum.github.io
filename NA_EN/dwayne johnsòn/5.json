There are many challenges between trolls, smurfs and toxic team mates but the worst of them are the people who disconnect during a game.  I just lost a game were a veigar disconnected just as the game started. Everyone became depressed and gave up, what made it worst was that the other team's adc admitted that she was a Plat 1 smurf.  Quickly the game ended in a defeat and I couldn't help but notice that I lost LP which really bothers me because I wasted a good 20 minutes on a game that i knew wouldn't get me anywhere and in the end it actually pulled me away from getting to my promotion matches.  Now I have to make up for the lost LP and now win 2 matches straight before getting to my promotion matches.  I feel like the Ranked system is not suppose to be like this punishing an entire team for one person who ditched them. Was I suppose to lose LP or was it a bug ? If it wasn't a bug than I don't understand why it was made this way and hope Riot can fix it in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T22:52:05.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that Veigar disconnected at the beginning of a ranked match, you should have had the option to remake.
