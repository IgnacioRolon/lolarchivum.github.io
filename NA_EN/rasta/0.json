Like Darkwill's daugther? Or the daugther of any member of the Trifarix?\n\nAnd the Du Coteau family is a noble family, not a royal one:\n> Born to one of the most respected noble families of Noxus...\n\nI mean, while a general is said to command warbands:\n> Her first mark came straight from her father, camped with his warbands...\n\n> On the bloodsoaked fields of Dalamor Plain, he even beheaded a **Noxian general** after the coward ordered a retreat. Roaring in defiance and hefting his bloodied axe overhead, **Darius rallied the scattered warbands** and won a great and unexpected victory against a far more numerous foe. \n\nDarius was at the lead of warhosts even before he beacme a member of the Trifarix:\n>...so Darkwill ordered **him and his warhosts** far north into the Freljord, to finally bring the barbarian tribes to heel.\n\nSo wouldnt this put Darius family above the Du Coteau family by your logic?\n\nAnd it looks like being a noble in Noxus and being part of the army are not necessarily connected things. Swain was born in a noble family and never interacted with armies until he killed his parents, and this description of noble houses:\n> Despite this meritocratic ideal, the old noble families still wield considerable power at the heart of the empire, and some fear that the greatest threat to Noxus comes not from its enemies, but from within.\n\nSuggest that their power comes from political deals in the capital, like Elise's poliitical marriage or the Black Rose nobles helping in Darkwill rise to power. Even Kat's mother was a politician to some extent:\n> While her younger sister Cassiopeia took after their politically brilliant mother...\n\nThough, the politics could still have something to do with the army as seen in those quotes:\n> The Black Rose exists now to further the clandestine interests of those who can wield such magic—**with its rank-and-file composed of mundane nobles**, drawn to rumors of miracles, kept in thrall and ruthlessly exploited. **Even the most powerful military commander could only ever serve the cult’s true masters**\n\n> Once, she had been a powerful figure in Noxus: assassins killed at her slightest whim, soldiers spilled their darkest secrets, and generals willingly followed her counsel in the hopes of patronage.\n\nBut still. Even if Noxus is a military nation, I dont think that you can consider \"leader families\" part of nobility or royalty just because a member of the family is part of the army.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-10-20T16:31:58.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying they are literally princesses so much as their social standing in Noxus' society is equivalent to that of a lesser medieval princess.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-10-18T22:46:06.188+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is another fact for you:\n\n\"Facts\" means more than one","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-10-19T18:53:23.299+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"and the term \"Riot Games\" implies that they've released more than one game","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-10-19T19:06:03.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZackTheWaffleMan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ZAn8AiTB,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-10-19T18:53:23.299+0000)\n>\n> and the term &quot;Riot Games&quot; implies that they&#x27;ve released more than one game\n\nCHEW, Mech VS Minions, Astro Teemo and other more games.","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-10-19T19:09:38.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they were called riot games when they had only release LoL","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-10-22T12:40:28.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally every company with \"Games\" in their name only had one release at some point.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-10-19T17:26:18.034+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's a less well known one - \n\n{{champion:104}} \n**Malcolm Graves was in prison when his mother died.**  \n\nIt's very sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-10-19T17:34:16.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does he care?
