We were playing threes (rip old treeline) and decided to add one another. It turns out that we played well together; our synergy was amazing. League had never been so easy! We played, and we played, and we played. Months flew by and we grew closer, becoming pretty good friends. We ended up becoming facebook friends, and the months continued to progress. We exchanged numbers and eventually started Skyping... And Skyping... And Skyping. Our friendship got to the point where we were texting every day, and Skyping every night. We wouldn't always play league, though. Sometimes we'd play Xbox, or just sit there and chat. We quickly became best friends and didn't stop there. \r\n\r\nOur friendship had one flaw, though - the distance. We live over 2,800 miles apart. I'm from New Jersey, she's from Washington. Despite the unlikelihood of every meeting, we continued to grow closer and play lots and lots of 3v3 together. To this day, her and I have over 25 days of gameplay together on just League. That's a lot of time, guys. That's almost an entire month over the span of 3 years devoted to quality time with one person. And it's all thanks to this game.\r\n\r\nBut, there's more! Why is today so special? Well, today will mark our first anniversary together, as a couple. On 6/4/14, we had a talk and came to the conclusion that we should be together. It sounded crazy, and there are a lot of risks (mostly a two year friendship) at stake.. But we did it anyway. And I'll be first to admit that making that decision was the greatest thing we could have done. She's the smartest, coolest, funniest, most genuine woman I've ever met. \r\n\r\nWe're close in age, both 20 years old now, and things are getting more serious. In November I visited her for her birthday. She's in college, so I just grabbed a hotel for the weekend. And that's it.. That weekend is the only physical time we've spent together. But you know what? That's alright. In 3 weeks, she will be here, with me. She's gonna stay for two and a half weeks. I absolutely cannot wait. \r\n\r\n**TL;DR It's crazy to say it, but I have met the perfect woman here on league.
