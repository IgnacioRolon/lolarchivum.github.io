I admit it, i inted but please let me make a case before you judge me.\r\n\r\nI had a great day of league, played over 10 games winning 80% of them, I played jungle vayne and my score with the champion was 6-1, pretty great. Now this is normals and not ranked so keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nI get into a new game where i have FIRST PICK, very important also. As soon as my team sees that I want to play Vayne jungle they ban it. So far who is toxic? Not me. After i see the ban I lock veigar and I tell my team to dodge because if they don't dodge i will run down mid and feed. I think so far I'm pretty reasonable, I shouldn't have to spend 5.5 minutes waiting to queue again because my team banned my champion. if anyone should do it it's the player who banned it. I also swapped my sums to barrier and exhaust to indicate that I meant what I said.\r\n\r\nMy team decides not to dodge at which point I get basically a confirmation that they simply don't care. To make matters worse they start talking trash, asking me to feed because they don't care. The game starts and I do what I warned them about, I run down mid and die. I do that 3-4 times, then I walk bot, die, then top die, then i go to the jungle level 2 and start fighting the camps.\r\n\r\nMy team is mad even though I told them I was going to do it, I mean did they expect veigar jungle with no smite? Anyways the match ends with surrender at 15 and I hop into the next match and during champ select I get kicked out and when I log back in I have a 14 day ban. With the following message: \r\n\r\n\"Your account has been suspended until May 15, 2019 for disruptive behaviour in the game like trolling, griefing, intentionally feeding or deliberately trying to lose the match. Your honor level dropped and you lost access to free rewards. The way out of the penalty box is to play to win without ruining the game consistently. After serving your penalty and showing focus on staying cool, you'll get a notification unlocking your rewards again. \r\n\r\nAn overwhelming majority of players say that any form of disruptive behaviour ruins games. Your deliberate choice to ruin League for others reflects a gross breach of community-defined standards\". And then it lists the 1 and only 1 game where I did this.\r\n\r\nNow let's break it down please if you're so kind:\r\n1. \"deliberately trying to lose the match\", Yes i did try to ruin the match but so did the person who banned my champion even though I had 1st pick and the other 3 who took his side and didn't say anything in my favor.\r\n\r\n2. \"The way out of the penalty box is to play to win without ruining the game consistently\". Given that most of my games I get at least 1 honor by my team, the devs know this of course, this is the first time I've done this and of course my 80% winrate today proves this fact. I am not ruining people's games consistently in fact I'm more often than not carrying my team to the win. I rarely vote yes on surrender votes and even when we're getting beaten badly I always try to get objectives as a jungler and win.\r\n\r\n3. \"An overwhelming majority of players say that any form of disruptive behaviour ruins games\". I agree, however the disruption started when my own team banned the champion I had selected. Not only did they not apologize or at least try to say it was a mistake, even if it wasn't but they tried to antagonize me by doing the exact opposite thing. They could have said that they were not paying attention, they could have said they were afk and they didn't see the champion I had selected, but no they went with mockery and threats.\r\n\r\n4. \"Your deliberate choice to ruin League for others reflects a gross breach of community-defined standards\". The only deliberate act of trolling was from my team. I wonder what the community thinks of people who ban their teammate's champions when they have first pick. If I was not first pick and they banned my champion because they were afraid that this champion would be picked by the enemy team, I'd understand, but I literally had 1st pick and there is nothing the enemy team could do. I also want to point out that I said multiple times in chat before the game started that if they don't dodge I'll feed. \r\n\r\nNow you will call me immature among other things but I want you to follow my thinking for a minute. Let's say I decided to be the better person and I said screw it, I'll pick a different champion and I'll go for the win anyways. So we win the game and the people who banned their teammate's champion and mocked them would get a win, This would reinforce their delusion that their choice to ban my champion was a good one, since they were convinced that I would underperform and lose the game on that champion, but their ban worked and they win. This would most likely encourage them to pull the same stunt on other players with whom they disagreed with their picks. Doing nothing and trying to play for the win would literally make things worse for other innocent players in the future who would have their champions banned by the same immature and disrespectful individuals.\r\n\r\nNow let's see what happens with my choice to intentionally feed. They know that if they had let me picked what I chose we could have a chance to win, but now we lose 100%. The will reconsider their decision to act so indecently and disrespectfully to their own teammate and they will be more careful about pulling the same stunt to other innocent players in the future. For 15 minutes of wasted time they get a very valuable lesson which is to respect their teammate's choices and allow them to play what they want. This lesson is far more valuable than me bowing to their twisted egotistical decision to ban my champion because they didn't want me to play it. \r\n\r\nIn closing, let me say that I didn't ruin anyone's LP tonight. This was not a ranked game in which case I would have most likely behaved differently, I just wanted these people to get a lesson from this. I don't condone that everyone feeds whenever they don't like something their team does but this is a very specific case of douchebaggery from their part and one that if it went unpunished they would get the satisfaction of getting away with their toxic and disrespectful decision. I don't care so much about the ban, I've played the game long enough to have other accounts, perhaps I'll just level another account in these two weeks. I just want some justice to be paid for all those people who can't try what they want in normals because of bullies who ban their champs because they don't respect their decisions. And Riot, I hope you listen to this and if you were smart enough you should be thanking me.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-05-01T07:56:15.380+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"All I'm getting out of this is you saying \"I should be allowed to break the rules and ruin the experience for my allies if someone else can.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Oddysseas","date":"2019-05-01T08:01:04.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=52AZEgYO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-01T07:56:15.380+0000)\n>\n> All I'm getting out of this is you saying \"I should be allowed to break the rules and ruin the experience for my allies if someone else can.\"\n\nThey ruined their own experience by disrespecting and trolling their own teammate.

You made your team lose on purpose, and you were proud of it. You're lucky Riot's giving you a second chance.\n\nFrom now on, the slightest offense - whether inting, hate speech, or simply calling a teammate a moderately rude name - will result in a permaban. Your behavior in game will need to be perfect if you want maintain access to this account.

You didn't get your way in champ select so you inted.

This can be accomplished without having the ego of a brick. It just requires some maturity and self-control. Instead, you threatened them. When they refused to give into your threats, you carried out those threats. You \"literally\" had several other choices, including dodging or playing out the match normally. It is only your inability to take responsibility for your own actions that makes you feel forced into misbehaving. I think you knew that this would be the penalty for what you did, and yet you did it anyway thinking that you were in the right and that you could wriggle out of any punishment. Now you realize (I hope) that a six-minute dodge timer is a lot shorter than a 14-day suspension.\n\nRemember what I said: one more tiny slip-up - ever - and your account is gone forever.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-05-01T08:18:47.796+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"First, let's get one thing out of the way: banning a teammate's intended pick is not against the rules.

If you intentionally feed or otherwise troll, or if you use chat in an abusive manner and you're reported, it will treat you individually and not even consider the actions of other players.
