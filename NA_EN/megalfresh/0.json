Those protective locks are only placed when the shift is locations seem impossible, for example, logging in from Kentucky and then 5 min later logging in from Russia. That's pretty unlikely for someone to travel that fast (not counting superheroes xP) so it's a good bet that the account could be in the process of getting stolen. \n\nTLDR; You shouldn't worry about this if you're on vacation, and even if it happened, just hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for verification.","replies":[{"poster":"MegalFresh","date":"2017-12-29T03:34:05.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohh that makes sense.

Could it raise any possible flags? Maybe. If it does, you can explain your situation and get it resolved.

It would be silly if you could only play your account from a single location. But if they do put a hold on your account, it's usually their way of looking out for you, to make sure it's really you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
