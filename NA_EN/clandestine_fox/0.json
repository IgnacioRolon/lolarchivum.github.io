Recently my account was banned for Abusive &amp; Toxic comms, and I felt &quot;harsh&quot; was an understatement to describe this penalty in the context of the reports. I&#039;ve had a lovely conversation with a Player-Support Agent who helped clarify how my actions added up to a ban, but it&#039;s not within an Agent&#039;s power to actually judge if the situation was truly just: only if there was truly content that would trigger the bot. \r\nSo before getting into my situation that got me here, I&#039;d like to reiterate the subjects of this post / discussion.\r\n\r\n1. Was banning my account really the fair penalty?\r\n2. Could the current system be improved to better target toxicity and incite reform?\r\n(And yes, I understand this board has no guarantee that it will effect either my penalty or the system)\r\nThat said, anyone who&#039;s not interested in my personal situation is free to skip passed the first section to read about my thoughts on the system in the second section. Feedback and discussion on either subject is appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n1. My reform card chat logs - brief context - related penalties - thoughts on the matter\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSo this journey begins actually a year ago. I don&#039;t have an exact date since there wasn&#039;t any pre or post game chat, but my Agent mentioned it happened last year so I&#039;m estimating between october and november of 2017. \r\n\r\nPre-Game Chat\r\nNo Post-Game Chat\r\nIn-Game Chat\r\n[4:25] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): i got em dude\r\n[10:37] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): lol, that&#039;s not what salty means, scrub\r\n[10:41] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): low tier troll\r\n[10:42] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): good tru\r\n[15:25] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): lol you kids are trash\r\n[15:59] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): calling you trash and laughing at you isnt mad bruh\r\n[16:03] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): low tier trash troll\r\n[16:05] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): good try\r\n[24:33] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): throw it in the trash\r\n[27:42] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): that&#039;s cause you&#039;re autistic\r\n[27:44] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): the items are done\r\n[28:16] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): it&#039;s a normal, im doing whatever the f%%% I please\r\n[28:23] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): and look, its working\r\n[28:31] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): I&#039;m not\r\n[28:39] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): you kids are literally all chatting to me\r\n[28:43] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): trying to get a responser\r\n[28:48] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): and then calling me salty\r\n[28:50] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): for responding\r\n[28:51] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): like\r\n[29:00] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): shut the f%%% up you stupid pug andrew credit face head idiot\r\n[29:07] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): go ride your f%%%ng sleds all day fa%%%%\r\n[29:15] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): literally kill yourself irl\r\n[29:22] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): ill 1v1 you and all your f%%%ing buddies at the same time\r\n[29:24] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 1v12\r\n[29:31] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 12 being me, because you dont have friends\r\n[29:40] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): eat sh%% you pug fa%%%% c%%% piece of sh%%\r\n[29:43] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): kha is above you\r\n[29:49] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): hes beyond your capacity\r\nPost-Game Chat\r\nNo Post-Game Chat\r\n\r\nSo right off the bat I&#039;ll say, I&#039;m not refuting the legitimacy of this instance and penalty. \r\n\r\nThe context of this game is that the entire enemy team (4 or 5 of their players) were incessantly spamming the all chat and harassing me and my team for literally no reason; your typical baiter-troll squad. Now, the smart thing to do would be to disable all chat at the 10.5 minute mark when I&#039;d initially determined they were being trolls. But I did not, I&#039;m _Stubborn to a Fault_, like {{champion:78}} . Puns aside, I withstood their verbal onslaught quite well for another 5 or so minutes before finally calling them out on their behavior. It didn&#039;t stop though, and became worse over time. By the 27 minute mark they had started harassing me about my build, and by this point I&#039;d had enough of their shenanigans and snapped out at them, since respect wasn&#039;t anything they valued. But at the 29 minute mark I decided to change my tune from &quot;Reasoning with the unreasonable,&quot; to &quot;Parodying the unreasonable,&quot; where I fought troll fire with troll fire. The first couple of lines were quotes from an old youtube video from &#039;06 called &quot;The Life of a Youtube hater,&quot; which is a satire or the vile things people used to regularly post on youtube comments, followed by some classic middle-school style Call-of-Duty smack talk. That is to say: no rhyme or reason, all made up smack talk. \r\n\r\nNow, that was the first time my account of 8 years received a penalty for anything, and it happened in the latter half of year 7. It deleted my honor level from 5 to 0, and gave me a 1 week chat restriction (or whatever the short chat restriction is). This penalty was completely just, and the amount of grinding required to revive that honor level combined with the chat restriction was plenty of time to reflect on that behavior and incentive to better censor myself before letting my thoughts go out to other players. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving along in our journey, several months later on 3/19/18, and very shortly after finally breaching that honor level two state of normal honor rewards;\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-Game Chat\r\nNo Post-Game Chat\r\nIn-Game Chat\r\n[6:36] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): swain oom and just sitting there for years\r\n[6:39] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): now his flash down\r\n[8:15] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): ty\r\n[9:58] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): gw\r\n[17:08] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): f%%%\r\n[17:09] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): she would\r\n[24:11] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): stop being afk in the f%%%ing base when theres 4 top\r\n[24:38] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): im not flaming you are\r\n[24:45] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): you&#039;re afk when im making pressure\r\n[24:50] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): idc if theres 4 on mee\r\n[24:53] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): thats not the point\r\n[25:02] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): since there was 4 top and you werent doingt anything\r\n[25:03] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): thats when\r\n[25:04] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): stfu\r\n[27:30] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): gw\r\n[28:41] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): he used pred\r\n[29:30] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): ty\r\n[31:01] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): gw\r\n[32:57] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): lkmao\r\n[35:15] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 1 by 1? you must not look at your own damn screen XD\r\n[35:23] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): just cause you died before me doesnt make it 1 by 1\r\n[35:45] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): you said\r\n[35:46] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 1 by 1\r\n[35:47] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): when\r\n[35:50] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): me and you went in at once\r\n[35:52] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): thast makes it 2\r\n[35:57] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): so you&#039;re wrong by default\r\n[36:16] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): wrong again\r\n[36:58] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): mute all you kids if you&#039;re just gonna make shit up and waste my time XD\r\n[37:32] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): literally how dumb are you\r\n[37:37] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): no one other than riven had to die\r\n[37:41] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): but yall wanted to afk in the bush\r\n[37:42] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): lmao\r\n[39:03] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): mmkay you tards group as 4, ima bring 3 or 4 of them top so you can do something useful\r\n[39:14] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): gw veig\r\n[39:17] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): off to good stat\r\n[40:16] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): gg\r\nPost-Game Chat\r\n[2018-03-19 00:20:06 PDT] Clandestine Fox: learn to group as f%%%ing 3 before trying to manage a 5 man group\r\n[2018-03-19 00:20:10 PDT] Clandestine Fox: you guys are silly AF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow at a glance this one looks very aggressive, but comparatively it&#039;s much more tame than the first instance. It&#039;s also important to note that the toxicity started at the 24 minute mark (the 17 minute was me frustrated about an enemy gank), when I first defended myself at all from my angry jungler. Up until that point, he&#039;d been everywhere on the map _except_ top, and had some incendiary comment about me everytime I got 3-4 man ganked and dove. Eventually I&#039;d had enough, and gave him some legitimate criticism. Angry, but legitimate. After that, I continued to try my best to play the game and assist the team and give positive reinforcement, and then 10 minutes later the bot lane joins the conversation to assist the jungler by fabricating some story of a failed gank that happened bot lane that was also my fault. At that point I gave up on reasoning with those players, but still tried to play the game and strategize with them. Angrily, but I was still trying.\r\n\r\nLike the first one, this penalty was another great learning experience about how sensitive the system is. Literally any sign of anger in your word choice groups you, the abusee, into the same toxic penalty crowd as the abuser. While cherry picking only my text out of a chatlog can easily paint me toxic, it does nothing to actually address _where the toxicity was coming from_. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis one comes from the night after, and I find to be very questionable given the situation. \r\nA Brief pretext for this one is that I was duo queue with my higher rank friend who was playing adc at the time, while I was top. \r\n\r\nPre-Game Chat\r\n[2018-03-20 10:31:07 PDT] Clandestine Fox: sick amarite?\r\n[2018-03-20 10:31:29 PDT] Clandestine Fox: the lee got so memed XD\r\n[2018-03-20 10:32:33 PDT] Clandestine

scrub\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, this game was another lee sin incessantly harassing me and my duo because my duo was doing very poorly, and for an entire 20 minutes I quietly ignored him and let him go unchecked. But it was around that time that he changed from complaining about my duo&#039;s K/D/A, to telling everyone in all chat to report me for boosting. He started trying to convince my team of it, and at that point I couldn&#039;t ignore it any more. He spent the entire game griefing the chat, and then I go punished simply for defending myself in a heated situation. While this response may not be &quot;productive&quot; toward the toxic jungler&#039;s behavior, I don&#039;t really feel like directing an angry stranger towards a calm state of being is in any way my responsibility. It&#039;s not like my behavior in this situation caused Lee to attack me, he had been doing so aggressively the entire time. Why punish me for responding in kind? At what point is self defense considered Abusive &amp; Toxic? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months later in September, is the one real black sheep of all these logs. This instance is very short, and I make no excuses for it. It&#039;s the instance that earned me a 2 week suspension, while the previous ones were only chat restrictions.\r\n\r\nPre-Game Chat\r\nNo Post-Game Chat\r\nIn-Game Chat\r\n[9:38] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): fa%%%%\r\n[10:28] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): i got camped\r\n[11:16] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): fa%%%%\r\n[31:56] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): gg\r\nPost-Game Chat\r\n[2018-09-25 15:02:44 PDT] Clandestine Fox: ez\r\n[2018-09-25 15:03:06 PDT] Clandestine Fox: i do enjoy playing perma poppy\r\n[2018-09-25 15:03:07 PDT] Clandestine Fox: lol\r\n[2018-09-25 15:03:07 PDT] Clandestine Fox: what\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this one was very upsetting to me at the time, since the enemy team was basically ban-baiting me by doing those cheeky irritating things like /All chatting &quot;?&quot; repeatedly or spamming emotes, laugh, etc. etc. at the end of the day my reaction was very over the top and I feel like a temporary account suspension after extremely incendiary reactions like this are a very reasonable punishment as it sends a clear message that that behavior is not tolerated. In instances like this one, where I just happened to be rather angry to begin with that day prior to playing the match, a suspension of play altogether provides plenty of time to cool-down and reflect. Although this particular report isn&#039;t in the same league as the rest, it&#039;s still an important example of how the system works for discussion later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally, this last one comes from quite recently, on Christmas Eve of all times. The pretext of this instance is that I was playing my Twisted Fate adc in the bot lane, and my entire team flamed and griefed me the entire game for my pick and less than stellar performance. On top of all that, compared to every other report instance here, this chat log is incredibly tame. Summoners, here is the last straw that set the system over the top:\r\n\r\nPre-Game Chat\r\nNo Post-Game Chat\r\nIn-Game Chat\r\n[1:06] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): a yo yo man\r\n[4:35] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): lol\r\n[4:36] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): gw\r\n[4:43] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): you got spotted\r\n[7:23] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): TY\r\n[8:17] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): why&#039;re you so toxic\r\n[8:30] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): im not trolling\r\n[8:33] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): im being camped\r\n[8:36] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): and you watch until im dead\r\n[8:50] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): and you&#039;re muted\r\n[8:52] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): and reported\r\n[8:54] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): whats your point?\r\n[9:45] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): i cant move without xerath blasting me from anywhere\r\n[9:56] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): and you act like my champ is the reason he&#039;s shooting me\r\n[9:58] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): you&#039;re dumb XD\r\n[10:07] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): if I was Jhin, he&#039;d still be doing that\r\n[10:33] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): quit doing thta\r\n[11:10] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): christ this troll sup just wants to blow any chance of recovery\r\n[11:14] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): shove my lane when im gone\r\n[11:16] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): no money or exp\r\n[11:19] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): then they dive me\r\n[11:21] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): wonder why?\r\n[11:26] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): useless sup\r\n[11:56] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): report this velkoz, inting the lane and shoving the wave and just watching as i get dove\r\n[12:25] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): fucking hacker\r\n[12:34] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): literal wallhacks.\r\n[12:48] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): reporting xerath\r\n[13:20] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): lul in caps all you want hes been blind shotting me at max range over 3 layers of wall\r\n[13:23] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): nothing but hacks\r\n[14:07] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): easier said than done, ziggs. both teams plot against me every game. idk why\r\n[15:11] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): velkoz literally cleared my wave so many times\r\n[15:13] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): he has more cs\r\n[15:14] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): so helpful\r\n[15:25] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): then he goes mid\r\n[15:29] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): its adorable\r\n[18:52] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): no idea\r\n[18:54] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): nothing hit me\r\n[18:55] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): at all\r\n[18:58] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): and my hp dropped to 0\r\n[20:14] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): kayn is such a cool champ\r\n[20:19] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): does nothing and your hp goes down\r\n[21:16] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): hes the one doing it\r\n[21:18] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): you chill\r\n[35:06] [All] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): sick hacks\r\n[35:39] Clandestine Fox (Twisted Fate): reported\r\nPost-Game Chat\r\n[2018-12-24 14:24:39 PST] Clandestine Fox: reported\r\n[2018-12-24 14:24:42 PST] Clandestine Fox: l2p\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this one is a bit special, since I still have the entire playback of that game. This is the actual in game context to all of this chatlog. \r\nhttps://plays.tv/video/5c2683eb8be68dd247/got-banned-for-toxic-abusive-comms-against-my-team-lets-take-look-\r\nWhile I can understand where the system flagged my behavior as &quot;Toxic,&quot; is permanently banning my account for such mild toxicity really the best course of action? Under the current system, you get a mere 4 instances of bad behavior of any grade, and then you get the boot. If, after an earlier offense you behave _really really good_ like I did for quite some time, the system will take this into account to some extent and grant you a little leniency. That&#039;s why my reform card here has 5 instances, rather than 4. But remember, this is 5 instances over the course of a year and a half. Not 5 instances over a 3 month span. \r\n\r\nThis of course brings us on to the second section:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nHow could the system be improved to better incentive reform within players being penalized?\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system as it currently stands utilizes a lot of the right ideas and concepts, but in some rather wonky ways. The system understands that there are various degrees of toxicity, and some get penalized much more heavily than others. It also recognizes &quot;the small stuff&quot; like name calling and generally arguing with your teammates, but doesn&#039;t penalize you on them until it has built up over time. This means in some way, the system is able to keep track of that too. But the strange part of the system I find, is the way penalties work. While I understand the premise behind the current one is that 50% or more players typically reform after each tier until the 4th where you&#039;re simply banned, and according to riots statistics the % of accounts banned is extremely small (0.006%), I don&#039;t really understand why that alone is enough of a reason to suspend my account of access to the game and everything I&#039;ve purchased over 8 years of dedicated service. If such a large % of toxic players reform after each penalty, why does the system stop at 4? That&#039;s such a tight ultimatum reform window to expect from someone. \r\n\r\nBut the solution to this is actually incredibly simple. Why not disband the blackmark system altogether? The punishment system would better protect long term average-joe players like myself from inevitably being banned over the course of years just because one day, in one game, you had a heated argument with someone over the internet. Rather than using a system that considers any and all instances of toxicity as the same, we should use a system that doles out punishments (the same ones we use now, in fact) but the punishments severity actually correlates to the instance at hand, rather than checking only for a number of black marks. \r\n\r\nFor example, in hind sight looking back at my reform card now via these chat logs, the very first chat log (The All-chat one against the premade team) I would say realistically should have been punished for the same severity as the 4th one (The very short one where I called the enemy laner a couple angry words) with a two-week suspension. While I wasn&#039;t literally as angry in Log 1 as I was in Log 4, the content of what I said was on the same level of zero tolerance. In spite of this, Log 1 only warranted a short chat restriction (because it was only my first offence). In a system that looks at the severity of an offense and not at black marks, I would have received a suspension for that first offense regardless of it being my first. The system would basically run on a tier system, putting &quot;the small stuff&quot; like arguing and name calling for example, on tier 1 (the lowest), and when a valid tier 1 toxicity report goes through the player will receive a tier 1 penalty. For light toxicity like name calling or negative sarcasm, there&#039;s really no need to go further than a chat restriction. Repeat offenders of tier 1 offences would still be able to stack penalty and therefore gain lengthier restriction periods for toxicity shortly after coming off of a restriction. But on the flip side, players who aren&#039;t toxic and show honorable behavior in games over time will lose penalty levels by maintaining that good behavior. It&#039;s to my understanding that the current system does indeed consider your honor when punishing you, though how it actually does that is still vague to me. But with an actual visual meter of some sort for each penalty tier, it would be very easy for players to keep track of how other players are perceiving your behavior in game, especially if the system is keeping track of &quot;small stuff&quot; that you&#039;re being reported for, but not actually informing you until it has already built up enough to penalize you.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit to such a system is that by not banning players who may very well have just been put into unfortunate situations like I was, the system isn&#039;t outright closing the doors to reformation. If the Player-Reform system is truly built to reform players, why is being banned even _considered_ a reasonable penalty? Being banned by a black mark system for such minor offenses simply doesn&#039;t feel just. If the absolute source of my toxicity is that I&#039;m abusive on the comms, wouldn&#039;t the reasonable response be to ban my comms? Under a system that penalizes by severity rather than consecutive marks, Banning accounts would fall under a tier 3 or 4 offense (depending on how many are added). Bannable offenses would be things related to the account itself like buying/selling accounts, sharing accounts (if that&#039;s against the rules, I forget the policy on it). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, repeated short-term Tier 2 offenses (account suspension penalties) if not reduced through honorable behavior can stack up and give you a tier 3 penalty. In essence; receiving multiple tier 2 offenses (racial or homophobic slurs, telling people to do self harm, and other zero-tolerance things) within a short period of time showing little to no effort to reform, would be a tier 3 offense and be potentially bannable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that&#039;s my story and my thoughts and feelings on the current Reform system.\r\nWhat do you guys think,  \r\n    1. Was perma-banning me really a just punishment? \r\n    2. Do you think the system could be improved by my ideas, or have any ideas of your own for the devs?","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-12-29T23:23:12.635+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [29:07] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): go ride your f%%%ng sleds all day fa%%%%\n> [29:15] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): literally kill yourself irl\n> [29:22] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): ill 1v1 you and all your f%%%ing buddies at the same time\n> [29:24] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 1v12\n> [29:31] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 12 being me, because you dont have friends\n> [29:40] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): eat sh%% you pug fa%%%% c%%% piece of sh%%\n\nNot going to lie, I stopped reading when I hit this.

That's why it's 10-game -> 25-game -> 2 week suspension -> permaban, with a fair number of offenses escalated to 14-day.

I see it all the time and if a human reviews game footage it's VERY easy to tell who the true asshole is.

At this point, based on plentiful collected data, Riot has zero confidence that you can reform since you've ignored so many previous warnings against this sort of behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-29T23:15:22.797+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"# Skip to the end for a TL;DR.\n_______________\n# Game 1:\n\n>[27:42] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): that's cause you're autistic\n[28:16] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): it's a normal, im doing whatever the f%%% I please\n[29:00] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): shut the f%%% up you stupid pug andrew credit face head idiot\n[29:07] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): go ride your f%%%ng sleds all day fa%%%%\n[29:15] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): literally kill yourself irl\n[29:40] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): eat sh%% you pug fa%%%% c%%% piece of sh%%\n\n\"It deleted my honor level from 5 to 0, and gave me a 1 week chat restriction (or whatever the short chat restriction is).\"\n** \nWithout even reading the rest of it, right here your account *should* have been put on a 14-day ban. **\n\nNo doubt about it, your chat log was insanely toxic, but the main issue is inciting self harm.

You'll get absolutely no sympathy from me or 99% of the community. \n\n>Another benefit to such a system is that by not banning players who may very well have just been put into unfortunate situations like I was,\n\n Context does not matter here. \n\n _You_ chose to be toxic.\n_You_ chose to retaliate.\n_You_ chose to tell others to take their own lives.\n_You_ had every opportunity under the sun to reform and restrain yourself from getting more punishments.\n_You_ didn't take them, and you deserved the punishments you got.\n\n____________________\n\n>#TL;DR\n\n\n\"1.

Do you think the system could be improved by my ideas, or have any ideas of your own for the devs?\"\n \n# No. And if it was able to be improved, this is not a scenario in which it failed.\n\nYou don't get to stoop to someone's level and put yourself on a pedestal at the same time. The system was totally justified in penalizing you multiple times and you got lucky with the amount of chances you got.\n\n In the future, be more mindful of the people around you. If you have a problem with being flamed, you're perpetuating the cycle by doing it back to them.\n **Don't fight fire with fire.**\n\n IMO, you should take a long break from League before trying to come back with a new account. You need to restrain yourself and I say that from a place of objectivity, I'm not trying to insult you. The attitude here is honestly just gross on every level.\n\n Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Clandestine Fox","date":"2018-12-30T02:10:25.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">Without even reading the rest of it, right here your account should have been put on a 14-day ban.\n\n>No doubt about it, your chat log was insanely toxic, but the main issue is inciting self harm.

The current system as you can see, only focuses specifically on my chat log, and by removing literally any and all context all you're left with is the impression that I am nothing but toxic. I'd like to remind you that the purpose of this post and discussion isn't to unban my account, but rather to reflect upon the process. My section two reference is as follows:\n>For example, in hind sight looking back at my reform card now via these chat logs, the very first chat log (The All-chat one against the premade team) I would say realistically should have been punished for the same severity as the 4th one (The very short one where I called the enemy laner a couple angry words) with a two-week suspension. While I wasn't literally as angry in Log 1 as I was in Log 4, the content of what I said was on the same level of zero tolerance. In spite of this, Log 1 only warranted a short chat restriction (because it was only my first offence). In a system that looks at the severity of an offense and not at black marks, I would have received a suspension for that first offense regardless of it being my first. \n\nWhen I say improve the system, I'm indeed talking about things like that. The system by all means should have 2 week penalized me for that first instance, but it didn't. With that in mind, I repeat the question: Do you think the system could be improved?\n\n>Game 3:\n>[21:31] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): the f%%% are you talking about kid\n>[21:33] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): im like silver 2\n>[22:33] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): you're r%%%%%eed\n\n>Hate speech, rank shaming, general negativity. Unacceptable and unjustifiable.\n\nFirst of all, you literally deleted context out of an already-cherry-picked chat log, which is a huge no-no and akin to fabricating evidence. Let me fix that situation for you. The situation was as follows.\n\n>[19:28] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): no ones boosting\n>[21:31] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): the f%%% are you talking about kid\n>[21:33] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): im like silver 2\n>[21:39] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): thats not really high in the leasty\n>[21:46] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): and you havent even pretended to gank top\n\nOnce more to reiterate since I know for a fact you only grazed over everything I put so much thought into. \nHate speech, rank shaming, and general negativity is exactly what that jungler was harassing the entire team about that entire game, not me. Who was I rank shaming? That was my rank I was talking about, and he was trying to get the team to report me for boosting. Or for purchasing a boosted account. It's hard to remember exactly what a toxic jungler I was forced to endure playing a single game with 9 months ago, and thanks to context-stripped chat logs like this I guess we'll never know. Insulting him wasn't the proper response, no doubt, but I didn't rank shame anyone. I'll requote my own quote that you have quoted. \"I'm like silver 2.\" This was in response to Lee Sin's, \"This Tristana is totally boosted! Report this Poppy for boosting.\" \n\n\nThanks for taking the time to join the discussion, your feedback is much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-30T02:50:12.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">The current system as you can see, only focuses specifically on my chat log, and by removing literally any and all context all you're left with is the impression that I am nothing but toxic.\n\n...you are, though. Again, trying to speak objectively here.\n\nYou _are toxic._ You're **very** toxic, I would say some of the most toxic that League has to offer. Just because it's inconsistent is ultimately irrelevant. \n\nEven if I _could_ see what the others are saying, it doesn't detract from the fact that you told someone **to take their own life** because you got mad in a video game.

I've reformed. Why can't you? Nothing was stopping you, and I made it clear that you got _more_ chances than the average player would have gotten. \n\n>so I'll tell you outright that it wasn't a fluke that I had 5 reports on my reform card. You get a short chat restriction, an extended chat restriction, a two week suspension, and then a ban.\n\n No, it was most definitely a fluke. That's just a fact, in the first game when you said:\n\"[29:15] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): literally kill yourself irl\"\n \n That's an insta 14-day or permanent ban right there. I know how the punishment ladder works, and with zero-tolerance phrases like that, you skip tiers and immediately jump to a two week gameplay ban. [I repeatedly said \"you got lucky\" because you _should_ have gotten a 14 day ban, there is no debating that. It also states it clearly in Riot's Punishment FAQ:\n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)\n\n>##WHY DID I SKIP RESTRICTIONS?\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy for extreme negative behavior as well as extremely offensive language and remarks made in game towards other players. Since it is a severe disregard for the Summoner’s Code this sort of behavior can result in skipping to a Two week or Permanent suspension. Suspensions of this degree based on negative behavior will not likely be reduced or removed.\n\n\n______________\n\n>If nothing else the system could benefit a lot more from transparency as to what exactly is causing the bans. You think I objectively toxic, and very toxic at that, but you're drawing your conclusion on little to no information.\n\n** You have multiple chat logs telling other players to kill themselves, calling people mentally challenged, and using homophobic slurs. With the information _you've given me_, you are objectively and factually as toxic as you can get. ** \n\n Even if you didn't have that in your logs, your first 10 game chat restriction would have been an indicator as to what's punishable. You negatively spoke to your teammates, called them useless, and asked for reports [all of which is clearly outlined in the Punishment FAQ.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) There is absolutely no miscommunication on Riot's end. \n\n>you have no respect for me, my situation, and absolutely no intention to actually discus the system and how to improve it, but rather you're here to dismiss my entire thread with a simple, \"Yeah this ban follows the current system's rules. NEXT PLEASE!\"\n\n#Yeah, because I didn't spend nearly 30 minutes going over your entire post and making clear, concise statements with fair disagreements and valid points.\n\n I read your entire post, quoted important chat logs while explained _exactly_ how you got your punishment, and gave my personal opinion in addition to Riot's factual opinion on most cases. Remember that the title of your post is \"Was banning my account fair & Could the system be improved?\" both of which I answered to completion. \n\nIf anything, I had **the most** fleshed out response to your post. \n\n> How is that sort of behavior productive? If I wanted someone to pretend to read my case and dismiss it altogether by confirming that instances of toxicity did indeed exist within the chat logs,\n\n# The title of your post is \"Was banning my account fair & Could the system be improved?\" I answered both of those questions to the fullest possible extent, sorted through each one of your chat logs, and even gave my personal advice at the end to try and help you realize your mistakes. \n\n But because it wasn't the answer you wanted, I was clearly ignorant and disregarded your post entirely and my entire summation of your post must just be \"chat bad next\".\n\n> I'd appreciate it if you took this discussion more as an open discussion to improve the Reform System,\n\n I did, and I also gave my answer to your question of \"Could the system be improved?\" But let me reiterate, just because you seemed to have missed it entirely.\n\n I think the system is lenient enough. It takes time to trigger a 10 game chat restriction, and although your account is placed on thin ice afterwards, the punishment is stern and fair enough to deter most people from becoming repeat offenders. A 25 game chat restriction is again, totally fair and isn't that unreasonable given that these people are repeat offenders. Next up you're threatened with a 3rd and penultimate punishment, a 2 week gameplay ban that puts your account at risk for _anything_ negative that you say. If you don't reform by this point, it's over.\n\n>rather than a personal attack on me for things that I've already been penalized for and served my time.\n\n I apologized (in this response) for coming across as rude, but that doesn't change a single thing I've said.\n\n>I can only take responsibility for things I've actually done, and considering I've only crossed the line on any degree 5 times in the past 2 years, I'd say that AT LEAST warrants a little consideration into the motive of the toxicity and whether or not any other punishment would be viable.\n\n You _actually_ were grossly toxic in those games. You didn't just \"cross\" the line, you went above and beyond. I would understand and I would be sympathetic if you simply flamed other toxic people with your average \"fuck\", \"shit\", or \"you suck/you're useless\" type of flame. \n\n **But you didn't do that. That's not even close to what you did.**\n\n The motive of toxicity? Restrain yourself. Self control goes a long way. I said it before and I'll say it again, you don't get to stoop to someone's level and skirt by without punishment. You acted the same way or worse than them and fully deserved your punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Clandestine Fox","date":"2018-12-30T16:18:13.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you really think I'm acutely toxic as a player and was completely at fault for going off the rails and being the worst human being in the world, at least humor me with a favor: actually watch that TF video I linked. \n\nYou keep mentioning that I said \"Literally kys\" and that it was something that shouldn't have ever been said.

Political stuff is a no-no here. Almost got in trouble with that.\n\n>I do feel I should have been punished, but the current punishment system is too quick to dismiss players altogether via a ban, and does nothing to actually target toxicity and incite reform.\n\nThe thing about punishment is that, yes. You will react sooner or later. You can't stay perfectly emotionless forever. That's why the punishment is based on consistent behavioral pattern and severity of your actions. If you're consistently negative or toxic, you get a chat ban, then a longer chat ban, then a 14-day ban, then a permaban. There ARE stuff that'll skip the chat restrictions. Stuff like gameplay-related offenses (troll, grief, 3rd-party programs) and chat-related ZTP (Zero Tolerance Phrases) such as that shit you pulled.\n\nAnd now, my favorite part:\n\n>I don't feel I should have been banned because I was not disrupting the games or my team\n\n**[CITATIONS ABSOLUTELY VERY NEEDED]**\n\nBut even if you did, your team ain't the only team in any match. Did you know that in games like this, you're pitted against **ANOTHER TEAM** and that **ALL-CHAT LETS YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THEM**? You disrupted the game of a few people. Had you not been banned, you would've continued with your behavior.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-12-30T02:09:37.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 29:07] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): go ride your f%%%ng sleds all day fa%%%%\n[29:15] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): literally kill yourself irl\n[29:22] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): ill 1v1 you and all your f%%%ing buddies at the same time\n[29:24] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 1v12\n[29:31] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): 12 being me, because you dont have friends\n[29:40] [All] Clandestine Fox (Poppy): eat sh%% you pug fa%%%% c%%% piece of sh%%\n\nThis alone was enough to know for a simple fact that it was a fair penalty. There's no excuse for any of that and nothing you can do or say will justify it.

Of course, whether or not you wish to read further is your choice, but my personal reform card and my explanation of situational context is all for reference of how the current system works in relation to my history of penalties. \n\nThanks for taking a moment of your time to read my topic though, your feedback is much appreciated!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-29T23:29:11.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0. Yes.\n0. No.\n\nThe punishment system used to have these smaller, more gradual penalties, but it turned out that it simply didn't work. Continued poor behavior (zero-tolerance phrases, harassment, etc.) after a couple chat restrictions and a two-week suspension is a good indicator that further punishments for such a player would be useless, so the player is permabanned at that point. Helping people avoid such players is a higher priority for Riot than allowing such players to keep using their accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-12-29T23:44:30.309+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Helping people avoid such players is a higher priority for Riot than allowing such players to keep using their accounts.\n\nThat's a very concise and accurate way of explaining Riot's perspective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-12-30T01:58:49.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say yes on both counts.

I didn't mean, \"Should we implement my suggestion of a new system that performs in this exact manor? yes or no?\" But rather, \"How could the system to be improved in a more meaningful way than simply adding or removing \"chances\" to reform prior to a perma ban?\"\n\nI feel like the big issue here that everyone's having trouble grasping is that I'm not implying the system should be more lenient on toxic behavior, or that players should be getting away with theoretical murder. Instead I'm suggesting that perhaps \"Perma ban\" really shouldn't even be an end game for certain levels of toxicity, and that more acute instances of toxicity should be addressed more acutely. In the current system, my first offense which many of you (and my self included) agree received _waaay_ to lenient of a punishment. \n\nSo when I outlined my thoughts on ways to improve the system, it was by no means a finished product that everyone should vote on, but rather a discussion starter. It would be awfully conceited to say there was an issue with something, suggest we improve it, and then not even start off the conversation with some ideas to get the ball rolling, would it not?\n\n\nWhat ideas do you guys have to improve upon the current system? It can use some of my ideas, none of my ideas, some of the current system, none of the current system, etc. Open discussion!\n\nThanks for taking the time to join the discussion, your feedback is appreciated.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
