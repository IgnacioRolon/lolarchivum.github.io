This also may force (sometimes) to the opponent to \"fix the wave\" and overcommit far from safety (their tower).\n\nSecond scenario, pushes the wave, denies minions to the opponent, they will die eventually, and push back into you, refresing or reseting the Lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Speeedy","date":"2018-12-18T19:08:47.516+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"it depends on the situation, but mainly you just want to help manipulate the wave to give the most amount of available CS to your ADC. If the wave is pushing into the enemy tower so it will bounce back, try and push it safely if you can to make it bounce faster since he is away (helps more enemy minions pool up if the turret clears yours and denies the enemy minions). If the wave is pushing towards you do your best to hold the wave for your ADC and not let it get under tower (drag them, stun them, tank minion dmg, etc). \n\nWhile manipulating the wave you can get all the gold on last hits that there is no way the adc can get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-19T00:52:47.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying to minimize CS per se is cargo culting. The reason a support has low CS is because they're leaving it for the ADC.

Doing anymore than that will just push the lane and could REALLY hurt your ADC and prevent your jungler from helping. It is fine to take the gold that is right there anyway, but if you do anymore than last hit you will mess with any lane control your ADC may have. The only possible exception is when pushing the wave would reset the lane, then it would be OK to push the wave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-12-19T10:47:06.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time you'd kill minions as a Support is -\n\n- If you have to kill a few to prevent a wave from crashing into your turret.  It's better for your ADC to catch half a wave of minions then lose an entire wave to the tower.\n\n- If you and your ADC need to shove so you can base.\n\n- You have enough waveclear to clear a pushing side lane.
