Fucking forbid you are guaranteed to get a role you pick. &#039;Nope. I want something and it is not good enough until I get it.&#039;  It is very simple and reasonable to think the average player can handle two roles.\n\nI see your point if you're referring to people who played Draft & lost that, however the people who played TeamBuilder did get the role that wanted, guaranteed.\n\nAlso, it's not a matter of being able to \"handle two roles;\" I can easily play two roles very well (Mid & Support), & I can be a decent ADC & Top. Knowing how to play two roles is not the point, the whole point of TeamBuilder is that if I wanted to play Mid, & only wanted Mid, I could be guaranteed to get that role.\nIf I only have time for one match in a night & I just wanted to have fun & play the role I enjoy the most, I could be guaranteed to get that role in TeamBuilder, now I'm stuck playing blind pick where I have to risk on the speed of the chat load to get the one role I want, until blind pick too is taken away, & then I'm not sure what I'll be doing, probably a lot of ARAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-01-15T07:51:50.123+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disclaimer: I play fill and really don't give a rat's ass what I play. \n\nTHAT SAID, I think the main issue is that if someone wanted to play X in X lane, they could go into teambuilder and 100% be able to play that champion in X lane. \n\nAs far as I can tell, most of the arguments against this queue are not because of what it does to ranked, but because of how it is impacting normal queues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-01-15T16:33:53.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this is a valid response for people who played draft mode before, it means nothing for team builder players.

I'm a support/fill main and I enjoy knowing what I am up against and picking a champion who can best counter the enemy team composition. Like if its a pick comp I will run Tahm Kench. If its a poke comp I will run Nami or Soraka. Or if its a keep away composition I will run Morgana. I'm competent enough that I am no one trick pony player and can adapt to situations accordingly.","replies":[]}]}]}
