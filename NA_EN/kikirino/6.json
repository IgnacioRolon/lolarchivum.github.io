Think of it this way. A fire alarm goes off on the east side of a building. The fire spreads to the north, west, and South sides of the building, causing the alarms to go off in those wings as well. 1 fire alarm is enough to summon the fire department, so 3 others going off won't make any difference for that one fire. \n\nReports act in the same fashion. You report someone for bad behavior. The automated system runs an analysis of the game and determines if it should log the game data against the reported player. If 9 other people report that person, it won't make a difference because that game is already being analyzed. It takes multiple logged games of the bad behavior to incur a punishment in the system. This is so that one bad doesn't immediately destroy an account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Makior72","date":"2017-03-20T16:16:05.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The number of people reporting does not influence the punishment or swiftness of a punishment, according to riot. It also depends on how often they do said behavior, for example if I have never intentionally fed before and my account is a year + old, and I do it one game because X reason, I highly doubt I would get banned at all, because it is not typical behavior for my account. VS if I do it once a week, then there is a clear behavior problem and riot would likely ban me faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-20T16:38:08.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, but also only one person gets the message.

Typically when someone feeds, they have probably only done it a couple times over a long period of time, Riots system would see that as \"just having a bad game\". \n\nIn my 3 years of League, i have had multiple occasions where our whole team reported an Intentional feeder, BUT, here is the funny thing. The only time i got a pop up message saying that person got punished, was when that person ALSO TYPED things. Riot won't ban for just the action unless extremely frequent, but if they are to say something toxic, or say that he is purposely doing it, that is when they get banned.\n\nThe one time i got that pop up message was when the intentional feeder was going on about having multiple accounts and that he didn't care about this one, and this that and other insults followed with racist profanity. All the other guys never typed, and i never saw a punishment pop up.\n\nSo in this sense, in Riots eyes, Words speak louder than actions, unless combined in which case you will certainly be banned xD.","replies":[]}]}
