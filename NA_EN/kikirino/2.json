For that I apologize. I do however remain by my word. To give light, I would like to compare Ashe's potential usefulness as a support when opposed to a different support's potential usefulness.\n\nAshe:\n\n- A 3.5 second stun and 50% movement speed area of effect slow on an 80 second cool-down (R at rank 3)\n\n- A toggle-able permanent-slow which detracts 35% of a unit's movement speed for 2 seconds (Q at rank 5)\n\n- An area of effect slow which detracts 35% of the first struck unit's movement speed for 2 seconds on a 4 second cool-down (W and Q at rank 5)\n\n- 5 seconds of revealed area with the missile traversal revealing the area for 2 seconds on a 40 second cool-down (E at rank 5)\n\nKarma:\n\n- A 1.5 second area of effect slow which detracts 25% movement speed from the units on a 5 second cool-down (Q at rank 5) or a 50% movement speed area of effect slow on a 36 second cool-down (R at rank 3)\n\n- A 2 second root on a 12 second cool-down (W at rank 5) or the same thing with a heal which replaces 20% of her missing health on a 36 second cool-down (R at rank 3)\n\n- A 4 second shield that also gives the unit a 60% movement speed bonus for 1.5 seconds on a 10 second cool-down (E at rank 5) or a shield that does the same thing to all units in the area of effect on a 36 second cool-down (R at rank 3)\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the usefulness of a shield over vision, or one ability over the other. It is, however, easy to understand that the more one ability will do, the better it will be used. Karma has three abilities that all do multiple things. So do Janna and Nami. Anticipating Ashe's kit and defensive or offensive capabilities while one of them is on cool-down is extremely easy. Either she will slow you, stun you, or reveal you. Additionally, only the slow is in available use. \n\nThis places her at a disadvantage when opposed to other supports who retain their abilities in extended fights. With Karma, she will either slow you, root you, or shield someone, and they are all in easy access. \n\nAshe would be a better support if her ult and vision control were on shorter cool-downs. Unfortunately, this is not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"ThaddeusMike","date":"2014-06-22T06:05:08.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a good and useful breakdown.

Vision is OP when used correctly.  There's a reason S3 supports bought almost all wards.\n\n2.  Ashe's passive and W give her a ridiculous amount of poke at level 1, probably only rivaled by Karma's Q2.\n\n3.  Ashe has a 600 AA range, only 3 champs have more range than her.  Can you say free poke?\n\n4.  Ashe is WAY more mana efficient than any normal support, since Q won't be used much in lane, W is only 60 mana at all ranks and E is free.  That with the previous point make her much better at outlasting her opponents than most supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Manchette","date":"2014-06-23T06:33:25.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that these applications are of great use to Ashe, and my breakdown glossed over them, however I would like to clarify that I compared Ashe to Karma in a way that did not take proper application into account. I made the assumption that each champion would be played with the same skill level and thus their skills would be applied properly, without delving into the in-game mechanics. \n\nI also stated that comparing vision to shields and the like is extremely difficult, thus each should be compared in their respective roles and not compared at all. As each are used in their own separate, overpowered ways.\n\nAshe's own personal poke may be powerful early on, however how do you compare such a thing to a pull, knock-up, or stun? All of them have the potential to catch someone out and have their ADC do all of the damage, which is their job in the first place - not the support's. Establishing lane dominance early is what many supports do; Ashe is simply one of them.\n\nFree poke? Not really. The champions you will be facing usually have that range or more. Not counting their spells. You will be trading, not poking.\n\nAshe's Q will define her lane. It will be how you escape the ganks and it will be how you chase a won trade. You will always be using it, because otherwise you take away 1/4 of her supporting power.\n\nHer ult costs as much as any other, meaning that big plays will still rely on her keeping track of her mana, like all supports. Simply ignoring this fact will set you behind, and possibly get your carry killed. Combined with your Q and W which you will be using constantly to keep your opponents slowed, Ashe is a difficult support to play.\n\nI understand that unique scenrios can be conjured up, and the use of her skills and why they are useful is important, however the use of other champion's skills are also important. Things happen in-game. People outsmart one another and mess up. That is why I presented my points as if the counterpoints were just as valid. Ashe is a good support, but only in her style of supporting. She has a niche, and to say that her specific niche is the best is simply dismissive of all the other styles.","replies":[{"poster":"FFirebrandd","date":"2014-06-23T07:14:27.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where exactly are you getting that the champs you will be facing will have equal or more range?  According to this http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Range there are a grand total of two champs that outrange Ashe and two that match her range without the use of abilities.  Also 600 range makes the whole AA the carry while they are last hitting much easier.  Another fun fact... Volley has a ridiculously long range of 1200.  That is way higher than most supports' poke abilities.\n\nHer Q is important but you really aren't going to have it on for every single AA.  The simple reason for that is you simply don't need a slow on every shot.  Just like ADC Ashe you use it when you need it and turn it off when you don't.  Having it on all the time IS a good way to drain your mana, so you don't do it.  This is especially true since usually your harass pattern goes AA->Volley or Volley->AA, either way you don't need a slow on the AA because Volley will slow them.\n\nI'm guessing your point about her ult mana costs is in response to my point 4?  If so I would like to point out that ults don't make a huge difference for mana efficiency (outside of a few champs) because their cool downs are very long, meaning that won't drain you dry of mana.\n\nEDIT:  I'm not saying Ashe's specific niche is the best.  I'm just saying she offers quite a bit of power when taken support, more than you seem to be giving her credit for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Doominator10","date":"2014-06-22T05:25:42.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As one who played support ashe a bunch in normals,\n\nBuild mana regen and cdr.

Also, he doesn't offer very much pre-6 in terms of kill pressure - almost all meta supports have the ability to lock someone down in lane, and lacking that ability gives your opponents a lot of freedom to push and trade aggressively. Also, ADCs tend to rage when your voidling steals CS.\n\nI think a lot of meta champions- what the pros play, I guess - are so popular not only because they're powerful, but because they're versatile. Thresh can set up picks, engage and disengage teamfights, peel for your carries, and reposition anyone who gets caught. There are a bunch of off meta supports who can set up picks better (Blitz), engage better (Annie), or disengage better (Janna), but most of them can do only that one thing, while Thresh can function in every situation.\n\nIn my opinion, the issue with \"X and X champion can jungle/support, they can do Y really well,\" is that you fail to appreciate the things you're giving up to do that one thing really well. For instance, Jungle Leona is super fun and has brutal ganks, but her clear speed is awful and she straight up can't jungle if she dies at level 1 or something, while a champ like Elise has slightly-less-brutal ganks but also relatively good clear speed and good 1v1 (and consequently, the option of counter jungling).

But that's like playing Garen as an ADC and expecting results.\n\nMalz is a good support in the respect that he, if played right, and with the right ADC champ pick, can force the other laners out easier than most any support I've encountered. His pre-6 peel is obviously lacking, but, if you're taking mana regen runes and rushing a chalice (buying wards to compliment obviously), peeling shouldn't be much of an issue. \n\n\n**Pre-6 guide to Malzahar support:**\n\n* Max his E, and let your ADC decide when they want to push, or when the wave is nearing tower. Cast E on frontline minion, have your ADC push it through the wave for fast clear, zoning enemies away from their CS, and an added point of focus for the enemy laners.\n\n* Assuming you know ADC ranges (which you should if you're doing ANYTHING off-meta in bot lane), place your W where the enemy ADC will have to stand to farm, forcing them to another position or away from CS altogether. They will almost always avoid the pool pre-Bloodthirster, and if they don't they eat free damage.\n\n* Each time you zone with W, try to wiggle into range for an E if you know you won't be using it to push off your turret sometime soon/push their turret. Furthermore, if you know getting into E range is too risky, harass with Q instead. If nothing else, you buy a second or two of time that might force the enemy ADC to miss a CS trying to dodge the delayed skillshot.\n\n* Always go for an E when your passive is up, or if you're able to chain a Q-E-Passive onto the ADC. You force them to waste SOOOO much time trying to avoid or kill that little minion.\n\n* Before 6, you probably won't kill their duo, unless they engage on you while your Q is up (a really stupid idea). The point is not to try to kill them, the point is to try to force them off cs and out of lane as much as possible, which is very often as Malzahar.\n\n* If they DO engage hard on you pre-6, it's either situation A) Where no amount of peel was going to save your 100hp adc who's in a bad position, or situation B) Where as soon as they do, burst the hell out of their adc. If your lanes are going even, you will more than likely scare away the adc, allowing you and your adc to focus down their hard engage support, or get their adc so low while they've got their kill vision on that they're going to have to either recall or B immediately. If it's a hard engage that separates from their ADC to do it, like Leona or thresh for example, you'll have to make the decision whether to Q the support if they are a threat, or Q the adc so they can't close in. Usually, you'll Q the adc unless the support is way out of position.\n\nAfter 6, obviously, it's just free kills all day if you time your ult right. Wait for a hard engage from their support (as only a few ADCs can stop Malz's ult), and ult the support for a free kill. \nOr, if their support has little in the way of stopping your ult or is too far away, ult the ADC when they're in a poor spot.\n\nSome sidenotes:\n\n- Malzahar with the CDR to spam up Voidlings as they die can solo dragon, you require Chalice to do so. If you force out your opponents, and you have (IIRC) 20% CDR and chalice, you and your ADC can solo Dragon without any HP loss.\n\n- Malzahar with most of the usual support items (and yes you do need sightstone whenever you play a support) and a DFG can still burst down or almost burst down a champion. Learn your damage numbers, your picking power is very strong.\n\n- You still even as a support have some of the strongest pushing power in the game, and you don't even have to take CS to do it. When they're out of lane, if you and your adc wanna push, you can chunk their turret each time they have to B.\n\n- NOT ALL ADCS are good with Malzahar, don't pick him first unless you know your adc and don't pick him wihtout it being a good ADC matchup for you. Draven (riskier), Ez, Jinx, Luc, Ashe, Cait, and Corki are good adc's to lane with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2014-06-21T22:06:50.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, a support must have a heal/shield of their own (items do not count.)
