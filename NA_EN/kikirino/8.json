Traditional adc gathered more passive stacks and did far more damage than on hit jungle. Some may say \"but you gain stacks for your passive from jungling so you can just farm stacks for tons of % current health damage!!\" That is not true. Once you hit 6 stacks from **ENEMY** jungle camps (passive does not mark your own jungle and yes this is intended per RiotWrekz on the PBE forums) or scuttle crab you no longer get passive stacks from jungle camps. This means you only get stacks from champion kills. Okay, so I can just gank lanes as jungle and get stacks that way. Again, not so simple. You can only get 1 stack off of a specific champion every four minutes and then you cannot select another target for your passive for 90 seconds. \r\n\r\nThis is why adc worked so much better. Mark and kill one target bot lane, kill marked camp if it is bot side (and safe) then mark the other bot laner and kill them. By the time you do that you will probably be able to mark the first target again. Rinse and repeat and get a good number of stacks. The only way adc is worse is if you lose lane hard and can't get stacks. Jungle Kindred can at least get a few stacks from counter jungling and not be completely useless but again, it is harder to get stacks overall and the best jungle build path does less damage overall.\r\n\r\nOkay, now to address some things I read on the forums. \r\n\r\n\"**Kindred (they) has a low cd dash for their Q and it gets lowered by cdr**\" Nope. If Kindred uses, and stays in, their W then Q dash is reduces to a 2 second cd that is not lowered by cdr. They only have a spamable low cd dash if you stand in their W effectively making it your fault. W only lasts 8(?) seconds so she can only cast it 4 times. \r\n\r\n\"**Another champion with a 3x AA damage.**\"  Yeah... but it is linked to an ability that has a decent cd and is single target. It isn't every single 3 autos like Vayne or Gnar. And it is 5% max health. This is a very reasonable number in my opinion. AND Wolf actually has to chase you down to trigger the 3rd hit damage meaning, **in theory**, you can hourglass or use other means to avoid the damage. \r\n\r\n\"**More % health damage**\"  Yep. 5% max health on a cd and even then can be avoid by not getting hit by 3 autos. Scaling % current health damage from her passive on each auto. Sounds bad but it is only a big deal late game and you can completely deny her the stacks in the first place. Currently you can see which of your camps she can get a stack from. Ward it and kill her if she tries. If she does manage to farm your jungle for stacks she can only get 6 which is only 7.5% **current** health. From then on she only gets stacks from killing/assisting her marked target. So... she only gets strong from getting fed. Like every other champion in the game. AND a**ll of this % health damage is physical**. In fact, her entire kit is physical meaning armor reduces all of the damage she does to you. \r\n\r\nGot any questions about Kindred? I can try to answer them. I am loving this champ and will gladly talk about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-31T10:37:16.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See... the issue with Kindred bot is that unless you're actually getting kills in lane, which the enemy can prevent by playing passively or having their jungler gank, you're not getting stacks since you'll be stuck at bot and hoping and praying Wolf chooses the scuttle or Krugs/Gromp because otherwise, you're sitting there with 0 stacks. \n\nKindred's kit currently revolves around her stacks. Her scalings SUCK. Her base AD, SUCKs. Her base abilities SUCK. She's all about her passive and her W. Her E is just a slow and a quick 5% off the top of their health bar. Thing is, passive requires stacks and her W requires you to not only have AS, but you also need stacks since Wolf does 40% of your stacks' percent, so if you have the standard 6 at 7.5%, he'll do 3% current health per hit he does. \n\nWhile Kindred can work at bot lane just like she works at top or mid, but in the jungle, she simply does better and with preseason coming around, she'll actually be doing even better because the Tracker's Blade helps her sustain very easily while also providing 2 wards in addition to the 2 she gets from her trinket and you get to pick this up on your first B, so invading the enemy jungle is REALLY safe. You can ward it all up and take the camp quickly, smite it, then get the heck out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"25212638_DEL","date":"2015-10-31T08:56:18.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlphaKiloGaming,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=a6tolbni,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-16T22:28:42.385+0000)\n>\n> Got any questions about Kindred?

Especially as Vayne? \n\nPS: Funny thing is, in late i owned her (who wonders) and sometimes it happened that we both stood in her ult, but i condemned her out of it with the secound W and tumbled to get the 3rd and she was dead ^^\n\nGreetz Miche","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-09-16T22:32:18.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since clones came up in regards to Garen lately...
