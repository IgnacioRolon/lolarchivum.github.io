If you do a custom on Dominion and only take the two bot towers (for minions and gold) it works perfectly. I managed to get from windmill (topmost) turret to left side spawn before Naut ult caught me. Fun fact: Naut ult will constantly increase it's intervals and frequency until it catches you, too many times and it will literally just snare you and catch back up. Quite fun, and I'm sure Vi's ult will act the same way, although probably a bit faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-06-30T11:30:55.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi ult gets canceled and I believe doesn't go on cooldown or on a very minor one?
