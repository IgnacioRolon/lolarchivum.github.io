A lot of people hate the new morde because a lot of people hate the new morde.\n\nFor instance, was morde banned in pro play because he is overpowered, or just far too outside the meta for pros to risk and/or adapt to?\nThats a discussion I wish I could find, instead of the endless morde hate circlejerk.","replies":[{"poster":"Kikirino","date":"2015-10-17T02:45:31.673+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's put it this way, in Worlds at least in the matches I saw, if he wasn't banned he was picked and he dominated.
