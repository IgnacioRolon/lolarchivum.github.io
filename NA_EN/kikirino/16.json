You can be really lazy, mechanically, which gives you a lot more room to wage psychological peacefare (i.e. mediating when two teammates argue), focus on strategy and tactics, warding, and so on, WHILE still having a big impact if you know when and where to make your move and land your skillshots. Plus, you can spam your abilities pretty freely, and I'm a spammy kind of guy. Plus, if you don't like dying, Leona's pretty tanky, so you're more likely to make it out alive. Only disadvantages I can think of are that you can't deal damage by yourself (but why would you need to when your passive basically nukes the enemy when used properly anyways?) and you don't give side utility to your ADC, like haste/slow/heals. But I don't care about those when I can get right in the enemy's face, smack 'em with a sword and leave 'em unable to do anything, and have my ADC deal tons of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrathTurtle314","date":"2015-04-24T21:34:29.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first one was thresh, played him once on free week, started saving IP for him, he is my best by far bot lane.

There is so much you can do with this guy, and so many ways you can build him. Top/jungle/mid. Tank/fighter/assassin. I love it.\n{{champion:86}} : My main. A silence which doubles as a speed boost. An E that, coupled with Sunfire Cape, gives you one of the fastest wave clears top lane. And crazy HP regen which, together with his W, makes him almost impossible to kill when ahead and/or fed.\n{{champion:122}} : True damage ult with a temporary reset on a kill, and a full reset with 3 points in it? A hook to reel in fleeing enemies? A ranged poke with Q? His bleed passive, which is often enough to kill people on its own even without ult?

That's why I like Nasus as he can farm under turret with his Q easily, build tank and still do damage from any of the sheen passives, and stave off death in lane (especially tower dives) with his W, R, and passive lifesteal.\n\n{{champion:90}} When I picked up mid lane, getting good at farming was priority #1. With Malzahar's E, I was able to farm safely even if I was losing lane, and I loved the utility/damage that his W+R combo dealt especially if you have a teammate nearby. Let alone that he is a great counter to Yasuo who was popular at the time I picked up Malz.\n\n{{champion:40}} Support was the first role I picked up and is the one i main today.
