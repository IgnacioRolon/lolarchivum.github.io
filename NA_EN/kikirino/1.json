I have played since preseason one and for the first time a player actually made me feel uncomfortable in match. I have had every kind of internet insult thrown my way over the years but this one player is the first to really bother me. \r\n\r\nHe spent all game pestering me asking how old I was, if I was a guy or girl and saying we should date. I simply refused to answer his questions and when he asked if we could date I said no. He just kept fucking asking. &quot;We should date&quot; &quot;wanna facetime?&quot; &quot;heres my discord lets facetime&quot; &quot;saddle up&quot; &quot;I bet you are sexy&quot; &quot;I just wanna date you&quot;. I get that it was probably some dumbass just trying to be funny or something but I have never encountered this before. How seriously does Riot take reports on stuff like this? \r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t really care until I said no and he kept pestering. All fucking match. Another player commented on how the team should report him for harassment and he just said &#039;lul&#039; and kept going.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-05-24T01:46:37.192+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

She's fairly new and still learning the game, but she didn't mind playing against higher levels if I could play with her and teach her either way. In a game I just played, she was doing poorly. A Twisted Fate and a Braum on our team were being toxic, so I mentioned that she was my girlfriend and that I was teaching her. (Yes, I know that in itself was a mistake, but they were starting to get offensive rather than toxic and I felt like I had to explain.) The rest of the game, however, they started making serious jokes about sexual harassment. \"btw teemo I'm gonna rape your girl after this\" \"she's a whore\" I told them from what I know, that level of sexual harassment could possibly be a perma ban, and the Braum responded \"doesn't matter if I get some tight virgin p*ssy\" It was bad enough that she was actually scared and stopped playing. I don't know what the level of punishment can go, but I was personally really offended and just curious.
