There's a reason that Riot is far more hesitant to change very popular champions: They've already shown very high user enjoyment and risking that enjoyment in order to make changes that might make them feel more fair to play against is not in the playerbases best interest, nor Riots. \n\nThe fact that champions like Riven, Zed, Lee Sin, Thresh, Vayne, and Ezreal constantly maintain high playrates no matter their state of balance is a sign of a well designed champion, not a poorly designed one. The fact that Lee Sin and Thresh can have pickrates upwards of 30% without breaking the game is a testament to being the pinnacle of what Riot has managed to create. We should be clamoring for more champions like them, not less.
