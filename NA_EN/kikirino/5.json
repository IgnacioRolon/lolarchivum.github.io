We all have had players lose. In fact, **every single game has a loser**. Stop getting pissed about it. It will not help them play better. It will not make you more likely to win. Also, it is just a game. I am not saying that because it is okay to be bad or anything. I am saying it because you should not get so mad about someone losing. It is a game. You are not playing Worlds. There is not $2 million on the line. Calm your ass.\n\n\nEDIT: I feel as if I could have worded my post better as some people are reading it as no one should take the game serious or I am attempting to devalue your experience. That is not what I meant at all. **My entire point is that it is a game and someone doing badly in a game is never a reason to get pissed and rage at them.** That is my point. I play ranked.

You have to assume that at least one person on the enemy team is likely similar to you, and will not troll or afk. This would reduce the chance back to 50%\n\nIt's silly to just assume that all 5 people on the opposing team are going to be potential trolls. Even if you go with that assumption, a player would need to play thousands of matches for the variance to balance out. Considering that the average player will only play a few hundred games per season, it's not even worth trying to bring this troll percentage up.\n\nIt's the same thing people say about afks, yet I can get 3 afks in a ROW on my own team, and go 30+ games without the opposing team having an afk. How is that balanced in any way? Oh yeah... maybe after my 4000th game it will average out...  Huzzah.\n\nHow am I supposed to climb ranked when I get 3 losses in a row that drop me down a rank due to afks? Then I have to fight the system some more to win my next 3-4 games in a row to get promoted again. People are stuck in elo hell because of afks/trolls/feeders. It's a simple fact.\n\nLets say you have a win ratio of 50% in non-troll/non-afk matches. Which is what Riot expects... correct? Then you have to factor in all the games where you lose due to AFK/Troll/Feeders. So now your win ratio plummets... but does it ever recover? Sure... again... after thousands of games it might balance.\n\nThe typical scenario for me is:\n\n1. Finally win my promos, move up a rank.\n2. Win/lose a few games... maybe earn a handful of LP along the way\n3. Get 3 afks in a row, and then a 4th game with a feeder troll.\n4. Drop back down a rank.\n5.

You can't just assume that someone will be like you and never troll on the enemy team.  They could be like you, or they could be a troll.  This is a mathematical absolute.  The odds are even more in your favor if you duo queue with someone you know isn't going to troll.  \n\nThe reason you're not climbing is 99.99% of the time not because of trolls/afks/feeders whatever.  It's just REALLY hard for people to take responsibility in this game and accept the fact that they just aren't good enough to carry in their current elo.  It's so much easier to blame the other 4 people on your team or if you want to count smurfs, the other 9 people in your game.  \n\nYes, there are games that are uncarryable.

What I hate is when someone on my team decides to give up because \"there is no hope\" or \"they are so bad\".  In  Silver I  where I am, there is always hope, games can swing very easily.  If you truly want to win, you will understand that one person playing badly does not lose the game.  Raging at them does lose the game.\n> \n> I remember one game where I played incredibly badly as support Morgana and fed the enemy teams Vayne (this was probably the worst laning phase I have ever had).  Our top lane Garen did very well, but he did not rage.  The only thing he said was \"We can still win guys\".  Later in the game the enemy team was trying to siege our nexus turrets (1 inhib down I believe) and I managed to get a dark binding on their Vayne.  Garen engaged on that and killed vayne before the binding even wore off.  Our team cleaned up on them and maybe 1 of them got away.  We ended up winning the game shortly after.\n> \n> The moral is that the right attitude will actually make you more likely to win.  When you rage you are robbing yourself of your chance to win.\n\nYea, agreed. Like I said, I may not take the game as serious as others (my heads about to explode cause we are losing, and I have to win or else everyone will pay! RAWR!) but that doesn't mean I want to lose. I really dislike when people want to give up or surrender. Never say die! I want to win! But I won't be upset if we don't, at least not to the point where I have to find a reason to be an asshole. Its great when the right attitude and belief can pull you through to the win, and even if you don't win, there isn't such negativity at the post screen. You've learned a lesson, you've been taught some strategies and maybe you'll do better next time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TenSlashTen","date":"2014-10-30T20:43:48.524+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"you dont get it because you obviously have a shitload of time to waste.\nBut for those of us with a real life.\n\nYes its a game.\nBut we log on to have fun.\nAnd some idiot ruining that fun/wasting our time.\nIs tilting.\nSimple to understand, if you';re a working joe like any average human being with an actual life.\nThen you hate wasting time.\nIt's probably the worst thing anyone can do to you..

That does not give me the right to rage at people for having a bad game. It is just a game. If a person having a bad game is enough to completely ruin the fun then you are taking it way to seriously.

Do you have the right to always expect your teammates to perform at their best?  Does it give you the right to rage at them for a mistake?  Even if you think it does give you the right to rage at them, how on earth is it helpful?  For you or your ally?  \n\nIt is the people who intentionally lose games who are wasting peoples time.  And as a refresher the topic was about people raging at their teammates for performing poorly and going afk.  So you should probably reevaluate whose time is being wasted and who is really responsible for that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
