I love Lore. Lore is amazing. It makes a game more than a game... but the lore in league stands no purpose. Whether champions are friends or enemies in their lore means nothing in matches. Nothing like seeing Thresh supporting Lucian or Garen killing Lux or Warwick ganking for Soraka. Stuff like this drives me insane.\r\n\r\nMaybe Riot could create a game mode in which each team votes for a faction and can only pick champions from that faction. They could even give it a cool twist so that each faction gets a special passive. Champions from Noxus get % extra damage, Demacia gets % extra armor and mr, Bilgewater (not sure if a 'faction' but whatever) gets 1+ gold per kill/per 5, Piltover gets extra experience and so on. \r\n\r\nI would just like to see lore actually have an impact on the game in some way. They already removed the big lore stories from the Journal. Give lore a place in the game. Pretty please.","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-07T21:58:58.597+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea.

I think we're at around 1000 matches fought so far. We've organized it into [chapters/storylines/arcs](http://leaguefactions.net/previous-storylines/), and rotate through which factions are featured in each installment. We're currently on our fifth arc, [Hextech Revolution](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution/), which features Piltover, Bandle City, Zaun, and Demacia.\n\nFactions operates on a somewhat decentralized model. Anyone can start or join a match anytime. Results are submitted to us online for [scoring](http://leaguefactions.net/balance-of-power/). We also hold shoutcasted Featured Matches every Saturday and Sunday, which are worth bonus points and have advance registration to help ensure evenly matched teams.\n\nIt really has succeeded far beyond my expectations, thanks to [an awesome staff](http://leaguefactions.net/factions-staff/) and a very energetic community. One of our biggest challenges is getting the word out; even though Factions has been running for over a year, when I conduct \"ever heard of Factions?\" polls I generally find that more than 75% of respondents have not, and I frequently see comments on the sign-up sheet to the effect of \"I had absolutely no idea this existed; you guys need to advertise more!\" That made me feel better about constantly making Factions promotion posts like this one.","replies":[{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-05-08T18:26:46.233+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"For what it's worth, I've forwarded links to [Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net) to some other Rioters in the past.

(We then give members of the winning faction from last arc a private vote to add another faction, and sometimes staff will add another after that.)\n\nIt needs some updating, but you might also want to take a look at [the World of Factions](http://leaguefactions.net/the-world-of-factions/) for a list of possible factions with tentative Champion lists.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowNinetails","date":"2014-05-08T08:02:07.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.

I know a couple of communities that have weekly matches like the NexusDown podcast that have taken a week or two to do themed, Faction vs. Faction, Risk-style tournaments. Always a good time especially when people argue over whether a champion was given to the right faction (Why is {{champion:40}} fighting for Piltover when she's clearly Zaunite? Yeah there was the race from the JoJ, but that doesn't change anything!).","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-05-08T08:18:23.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the links: this is a known oddity of Community Beta. If you open links in new tabs, it redirects. You have to click \"straight through\". I've brought it up, and a Rioter confirmed that it's \"supposed\" to work like that, at least at the moment.\n\nA lot of Champions have flexible loyalties. (Bear in mind that, most of the time, a Champion fights for anyone who summons them.) So for example, Janna is from Zaun, but is not exactly happy with the way Zaun is being run, and also has ties to Piltover. I think she could be plausibly placed on either roster; it would depend on, e.g., the story arc.\n\nWe look at three factors when deciding Champion allegiances in Factions:\n\n1. **Story.** The Champion's written lore is sometimes dispositive. For example, Darius is obviously Noxian.\n2. **Theme.** How does the Champion come across in game? What's their aesthetic? Which factions do they \"match\" with? For example, Leona has a strong thematic fit with Demacia, because she's a heroic plate-armor-wearing knight-type character.\n3. **Gameplay.** The centerpiece of Factions is faction vs. faction matches, so we obviously want to take this into account. The goal here isn't so much to give each faction a full \"meta\" roster as to reinforce each faction's core gameplay characteristics. So, for instance, Leona works great on Demacia's roster, because Demacia is already a hard-engage all-in teamfight faction. Likewise, Janna brings a lot of disengage, which synergizes with Piltover's poke-heavy lineup.\n\nWe also try to tie in match outcomes and player decisions. So, for instance, we had a recent interactive lore event as part of which each faction got to select a new Champion. Both Piltover and Zaun had access to Janna in this vote. Piltover voted Janna, while Zaun ended up going for Zac. If they had both selected Janna, we would have held a tournament to determine who got her.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowNinetails","date":"2014-05-08T18:56:55.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is actually an awesome way to decide things.

(Yar har har)\n\nHowever, so far we haven't adopted a general \"mercenary\" system, for a few reasons.\n\n1. Which Champions would be mercenaries? It actually seems kind of difficult to come up with a list of \"mercenary\" Champions. Are they just unaffiliated?\n2. This sounds like a balancing/gameplay problem: you'd have to consider balance for all factions with all mercenary champs factored in as wildcards. What if it turns out that a given faction is completely OP with the addition of a mercenary champ? It seems like then the optimal play for the other side would be to snatch up that merc first. Blue Side vs. Purple Side would become a huge factor.\n3. It would add another rule to Champ select, which would increase confusion.\n4. A big part of Factions is the unique gameplay we get from having factions with distinctive strengths and weaknesses due to their rosters. Even if you only have, say, 5 mercenary Champions available, that could be enough to fill in all the gaps and make the various factions more \"generic\".\n5. You wouldn't believe how many times Factions staff has to deal with \"wait why is ____ on _____\" questions each day. Imagine if we were streaming a Featured Match in which Demacia had (say) Shaco.
