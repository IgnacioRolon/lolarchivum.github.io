Accidental or Intentional, doesn't matter. It's best to learn/master 3 champions for your preferred role, this way you have something to play in the event your main gets banned. Assuming this isn't ranked, you could also dodge as well. Ofcourse if you actually climbed up to Diamond ELO on your own, You'd know all of this.\n- Flaming Teammate: After your teammate banned Nidalee, you constantly flammed them &amp; the team. You were even doing this in Champion Select as well as In-Game. Now considering this was a **permaban**, you were most likely punished for this kind of behavior in the past. There was recently a new feature added where you can disable your Ally Chat, which removes your ability to Read &amp; Respond to Ally Chat. Might I suggest using that next time you play.\n- \"This isn't even my account\": Assuming you were serious, this is considered Account Sharing &amp; is against Terms of Service. This can also be met with a Permanent Ban from the game as well.\n\nIn the end, you're actions (Toxic Chat, Account Sharing) warranted a Permanent Ban from the game on this account. Your only options at this point are to take a break &amp; come back later on a new account. Or you can find other games to play (League isnt for everyone).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Febos","date":"2019-08-10T19:49:30.121+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Stating facts\".

Spending a lot of money on your account has nothing to do with your behavior.  Do you think you should get more leeway to break the summoners code because you spent money?
