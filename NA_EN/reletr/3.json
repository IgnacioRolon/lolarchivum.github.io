I don't want to re-see a toxic player's messages whenever one of my teammates pings and pulls up the chat box again","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T01:39:47.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the time being, our chat system doesn't have a way to backtrack and erase any and all messages from a single person once they're muted in-game. With that being said, I'm not personally sure just how difficult that idea would be to implement. You should hit up the [**Client Discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) board to spread this idea and see how many other players like it!","replies":[]}]}
