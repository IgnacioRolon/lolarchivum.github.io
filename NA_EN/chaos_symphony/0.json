I'll be in a game with 32 ms and suddenly the game will just stop working. Champion stops moving and ping goes to 500. This is odd because my internet is still connected and certain web pages stay open and updated. Any suggestions on how to stop this? The game is no longer fun when i'm disconnected every 2 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T23:45:55.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh this sounds like the dreaded packet loss. Basically what's happening is your network is trying to send data to our servers but along the way some of that data gets corrupted. When it comes back to you, your network is missing important pieces of that data so the game can't respond properly. Let's test for packet loss really quick using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).
