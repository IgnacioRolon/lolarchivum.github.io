During his recall he used to touch the sun and it would emit a purple cloud of stars. But ever since patch 7.9 they fixed other things about his skin and forgot to add the particles back. I would love to have it back and it would make this skin fantastic again! {{champion:497}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-18T16:37:40.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chrisgopher! \n\nThanks for the report! I really appreciate the gif! ^-^ You're absolutely correct, the purple particles should be part of the recall, and must have fallen off! I've gone ahead and logged a bug ticket for it, and I'll be catching up with the VFX artist this morning so we can hopefully get a fix in for next patch! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chrisgopher","date":"2017-05-19T02:43:45.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank so much, I appreciate this being done.
