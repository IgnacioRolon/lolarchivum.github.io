It doesn't auto-complete for you, though.  You need to type the whole word.  I don't know if all the subclasses work, but the main ones definitely do.\n\nWe will also have this feature on the client update, we're using the role icons for \"marksman\", \"support\", etc. as buttons for fast sorting at the top of the champion grid, and there will also be filtering in the search field.  We'll try to auto-complete for you, tho  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-05-27T00:40:46.949+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you allow us to create our own sorting categories too? That would be helpful if I want to sort it by positions (Top, Mid, Support,etc). Maybe some could sort it by faction (Demacia, Shurmia, Ionia). Or we could just make a \"Favorite* category for the champs we like the most regardless of role or position.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot OwleyCat","date":"2016-06-03T21:49:07.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of more keywords when you search, and I think it's a goal of ours to make it easier to type some familiar keywords into the search bar and get cool results.  Things like factions are a smart one, I know I often want to play a yordles-only game. :D\n\nKeep sending in feedback like this, and through the tool in the client!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LetsGoRidePandas","date":"2016-04-29T22:54:29.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, my friends and I have been asking for this for over a year now","replies":[]}]}
