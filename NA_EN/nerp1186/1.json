We removed them from the store shortly after their release when we found the bug and have been working on a solution since. We think we&#039;ve found the cause of the bug, but it will take time to implement and so the skins won&#039;t be available to purchase in the store until Patch 7.24 at the earliest. \r\n\r\nIf you purchased the skin before they were removed you&#039;re unaffected. The bug is with the store and is nothing game related. \r\n\r\nSorry about the inconvenience!","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-11-23T06:12:22.545+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"And gone is the hope that the walk animation gets changed. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-11-24T07:52:45.454+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SatomiKun,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=UJ0J2hs2,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-23T06:12:22.545+0000)\n>\n> And gone is the hope that the walk animation gets changed. ^^\n\nYeah, not gonna lie.
