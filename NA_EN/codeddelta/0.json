I am running very low on options and I think I should post this issue. So does anyone know how I can possibly fix this?\n\nUpdate: So I did nothing and league opened, idk how this problem got fixed, if there was a problem to begin with, I find it weird it would take an hour to open up league but I honestly don't know. I am seeing other recent posts at the time of the update with the same issue, but seeing as idk how to fix it. What I do know is that I apparently have -1 min ETA so I might have more issues I didn't know about. If I do have more issues that are radically different from this original issue I will likely make a post of it if I cannot solve the issue within an hour.

Should be easy enough to fix up by adjusting your permissions by following the steps in our [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions). Give that a go and try launching it again to fix that weird -1 min thing too!","replies":[{"poster":"CodedDelta","date":"2017-10-18T19:17:13.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help, it works out now so now I can chill in the rift again.
