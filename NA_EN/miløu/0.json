It auto disapears and doesnt happen for a little but reapears from time to time. When i try to create a lobby it says \"something unexpected happened while trying to create your lobby\". When i do create a lobby and works i start the queue and it starts lagging. By that i mean that it wont show the accept botton but i get a 15min queue leave penality for not accepting it even if it doesnt apear. If i do get in champ select its because the queue time was lower than 30 sec and then it starts lagging in champ select. If someone on my team picks any champion  it will do the countdown to 0 and it wont show me that he locked in. So when it gets to me i cant lock in becaue it doesnt pop up and i cant switch champions, summoners and runes masteries. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but didnt work. It kinda of works like a freeze screen. If you know whats happening please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-29T18:25:42.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like you might have a pretty unstable connection that's cutting off when trying to reach a game or even matchmaking.
