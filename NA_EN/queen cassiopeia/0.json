You need to have at least 1 Manapool Item -&gt; Pick One -&gt; ( {{item:3027}}  / {{item:3040}} )\n2. Because of the nerfed AP Ratios and her % AP buffing Passiv you need to get {{item:3089}}  (which&acute;s interactions-math with 500Stacks got also nerfed )\n3. Like almost every Mage and exspecially a &quot;Late Game&quot; Champ like reworked Cass needs {{item:3135}} \n4. {{item:3116}} because of the CD nerfs to W after the rework to be able to kite effectivly\n5. {{item:3020}} Everyone needs Boots and it helps you in the earlygame with flat pen and MS for kiting,chasing and dodging.\n6. This is the only &quot;Free&quot; Item-Slot but you have to use it based on the Enemy-Team sadly.\nAgainst High HP Tanks -&gt; {{item:3151}} \nAgainst Heavy AP Dmg -&gt; {{item:3001}} \nAgainst Heavy AD Dmg -&gt; {{item:3157}} \n\nWhen before the Rework you had a large amount of possible Items which all worked in different ways.\n\nFun Fact -&gt; Statistics show that a Cassiopeia gains roughly 12k Gold in a Game which is a really low amount because that means she is only able to finish 3 Full items and her Boots, which means most of the time she cant even get to her &quot;Powerspike&quot; which raises her Winration btw after 40+ Minutes to a flipping 50,25% - 50,50% which shows that her &quot;OP Lategame&quot; has almost no influence at all.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nSo, what do we have today?\n\n1. A boring Kit ( playing as and playing against ) which focuses only on one On-Hit Spam Spell.\n2. Two timers which work together and are gates based on how soon you hit 500 Stacks and have your full Items, which is even harder because of the\nlatest changes that end games around 10-15 minutes earlier.\n3. An extremely fragile Early&amp;Mid for the exchange of a &quot;good&quot; late when your Team peels you enough and carrys you trough the first 25 minutes.\n4. Being called a &quot;noob spam no skill&quot; Champ... when before the update she was one of the most skillfull champs in the whole game.\n5. 46% Winrate which is continuously falling after all the nerfs although having the biggest amount of Scripters out of all Champs which distorts the number positively, making the true number even far worse.\n6. Her Passiv is hands down useless for her because of the nerfs which makes it sound good, but is worse and a lackluster and I will explain why.\n\n25% CDR has almost no use for her.\nThey increased both her Q and W CD so there is no point in it, which makes it a lackluster and there are no items atm which gets her to 40% CDR without capping which steals her a lot of Items.\nThe only good thing is that you have your Ult more often which you already had after buying {{item:3174}} which you cant buy anymore.\nHer incredible 0.06 AP Ratio Heal ONLY on E with 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 16 Flat heal... which are incredible bad numbers ( 76HP with 1k AP ).\nAnd her Manasustain is by far the biggest joke atm.\n1,5% Mana refund when killing an Enemy with E.\nYou need to kill 4+ Minions with E to REFUND the mana you had to use to poison them with lvl 1 Q.\nAnd 7+ when you used W to poison them.\nLet alone that you most likely cant kill 4+ Minions with only 1 Q and you waste mana when using W because a normal Minionwave is only 6 minions and even with a canonwave you dont refund 100% and wont be able to farm the whole wave until Midgame.\nAnd then... her INCREDIBLE % BONUS AP!!!!!1!1!1!\nYeah, would have been incredible if they didn&acute;t slaughter her Ap Ratios so she HAS to stack AP or she deals no dmg and her Dmg is worse then the old one UNTIL you reached Fullbuild, with 500 Stacks, then your E deals around 180 more Paper-Dmg with your E.\nAnd this numbers gets even lower because in the Lategame, the Enemy&acute;s will have at least 1+ MR Items which lowers the Dmg even further to be irrelevant.\n7. A Kit which completely revolves around her &quot;Late Game Powerspike&quot; which like already said, puts her on a 50,25% Winrate after the 40min+ mark, which clearly shows that it has a way to little impact for an unforgiving 40mins.\n\n\nThe Devs says that Cassiopeia was only a half-reworked because they had no idea how to complete it.\nHer 1 Side is her unfitting Passiv and the other one are her classic Spells.\n\nThe Rework got Cassiopeia almost no new Players, lost her a gigantic mass of her Mains she used to have, has a Kit which is anoying to play and anoying to play against AND while having an annoying Gameplay for both sides, no Playerbase she even has a dreadfull low Winratio.\n\nIf you want to test it yourself, search for the 50-100 Last Threads about Cassiopeia.\nThey are only about Rework ideas because she&acute;s just a bad champ right now.\n\nIt would be the best for her that her reworks gets reverted until they have a more thought trough Rework which, she really doesnt need anyways.\nAnd maybe, they use someone who doesn&acute;t ignore all the feedback and then wents missing for 6 **MONTHS** .\nWhich was extremely disrespectfull.\n\nThey basicly did a reverted Poppy Rework.\n\nPoppy got reworkd because her Early and Mid was trash but her Late was incredibly strong.\n\nCassiopeia got exacly the opposite.... trashy early/Mid with a (not so) powerful lategame.\n\nAnd its only normal that the community hates it.","replies":[{"poster":"Aezanthya","date":"2016-01-03T02:20:04.470+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"sorry but they just don't care.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-01-03T03:22:34.506+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"I want to deny it but it's unfortunately true.

Its a good direction but they failed \n\n-Passive is disgusting. It takes to long to be fully stacked and forces her to build 120 Ap items and have 131231230 ap despite meh ratios \n-I dont even mind E dealing more dmg then q or w.
