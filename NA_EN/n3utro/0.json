To avoid having too much people doing it and so making it harder to find a match? I prefer waiting longer to have a balanced matchup rather than having a 1 sided game, one way or another.\r\n\r\nCan someone enlight me please?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-03T10:35:18.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it would be abusable.
