The notification linked the list of &quot;games&quot; in which I was allegedly intentionally feeding. There was only one game, the last game that I played in fact. Here is the link to that particular match:\n\n http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2016447304/201849748?tab=overview. \n\nWith a closer inspection of this particular match, you may notice that I was the only person that got any objectives at all (all of which were in my lane). I managed to push all of the way to their nexus turrets. The first fight that I attempted bot lane ended in a miserable loss. They killed me and my lane partner while we didn&#039;t kill anyone. This season snowballing is very extreme with most games ending before the 25 minute mark. As me and my partner were both melee champs against a ranged support and marksman we quickly were decimated whenever we attempted to touch a creep. We decided that this strategy wasn&#039;t going to work. We would just simply get no minion kills and lose all of our turrets in lane, so we decided to win by irregular means. If you manage to look past your automated ban system (which is heavily flawed if I do say so myself), you will see that I wasn&#039;t intentionally feeding or mindlessly running into the enemy team on purpose like players I so often have the privilege of playing with (who never get banned) , but I was trying to win the game by gaining objectives. \n\nI tried to change the meta and see if something else besides the norm would be a greater way to win the game, and I was unsuccessful. With this failure I was rewarded with a 14-day account suspension. I tried to use my innovation and see if there was another way to win the game and I received a cold slap in the face. I also want to highlight the fact that the list of &quot;games&quot; only had one game. Just one. I would understand if there were several games in which I was flagged for feeding. But just a single one. Everyone has bad games. And I had a terrible game in which I tried to turn into a win. \n\nIntentionally feeding is when one runs around a turret, afks, and lets the enemy kill them. If you review this match, you will see that I never once did that. I may have died whilst killing a turret or two, but I was trying to win the game. As I am always constantly reminded in ranked games, &quot;Turrets win games, not kills&quot;. I didn&#039;t &quot;troll in pre-lobby&quot;, I didn&#039;t cry because I didn&#039;t get the lane I wanted. I planned to play Yi bot and go &quot;double rageblade daddy push mode&quot; with my friend. I would also like to state that this was a normal match, so I figured I could try to go outside of the boring meta a little bit, knowing that a failure would result in literally no loss as I would still get IP and no one would lose MMR for ranked queues. I am not an intentional feeder, and I was hurt by this statement accusing me of the sort: &quot;Your deliberate choice to ruin League for others reflects a gross breach of community-defined standards&quot;. \n\nI never in my wildest dreams would want to &quot;ruin League for others&quot; as I know what it feels like as it happens to me frequently in RANKED. I know what it feels like to plead with someone to just play the game and not intentionally feed, I would never ruin everyone else&#039;s experience by doing that. It is my hope and plea that you will review this case and find that I wasn&#039;t &quot;intentionally feeding&quot;. An automated suspension system can only go off of pre-entered algorithms and programs. I want a real human being to look this case over. Thank you for the help.\"\n\n*****Please note that my 14-day ban was solely based off of this 1 match and I was banned no less than 3 minutes after the conclusion of it, thus leading me to think that it was an automated ban*****\n\n**UPDATE**: The 0-12 Xin that laned with me did NOT have his account suspended, so if you are having a bad game just make sure you don't make it to 0-13, 0-12 is safe, but 0-13 will get you banned by the automated system that detects intentional feeding.\n\n\n***Please note that the AP RUNES i forgot to change from my prior match, which was zac bot lane with my same duo, we went duo bruiser bot just like we did this game, and I failed to change them, I WAS NOT

seen a lot of others who have some bad games on their Match History, but even getting 5-10 matches in a row where you do bad doesn't really qualify as intentional feeding.\n\nThe problem is some players have bad games, other players get matched and forced into roles with players who have no idea what they are doing such as myself I was unlucky enough to get matched in many games where players wanted me to bot, everyone pretty much auto locking, so I played the role, said I was going to play defensive, and instead all players do is go offensive in the games, and the toxicity I just had to mute everyone and try playing.\n\nThe problem however I did bad in the games resulting in quite a few games in a couple of days where I gave too many kills, honestly my match history is worse than yours, and you got a 14 day ban, I got an immediate perm ban with no warning still waiting on ticket to be reviewed simply for having the worst couple days of match-making and very bad game-play.\n\n**I agree that the new system for Intentional feeding, and banning players has flaws, and honestly looking at your match history as a player you did better than me and you still get a 14 day ban.**\n\nLike I have played League for 3-4 years, I have been somewhat toxic in the past, not extremely hateful like some of what people see I do my best to reform myself, but there is absolutely no way I would just run down lanes, afk, and intentionally give kills to the enemy we have our bad days, I would personally not risk a 3-4 year old account myself just to feed some games, and get banned after spending lots of Real Life time put into a game which I enjoy playing minus the toxicity.\n\nSo yes I agree there is something wrong with the current system for Intentional Feeding, and honestly even when a player I am playing with besides myself feeds or does bad, I hear players screaming at me to report them at the end even though they just did bad and no way is it intentional.\n\n. In General since everyone was supposed to get a clean slate with the new 2.5 patch, I have not even got a chat restriction, or reform card either.\n\n. Also in the past before 2.5 I have done just as bad given some games just as bad as my current history, and always improved, never got suspended for Intentionally feeding before and 3-4 years of playing league like come on, if I wanted to Intentionally feed I would just go make a dozen more accounts right now and Intentionally feed.","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2015-11-22T16:15:21.159+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I got an immediate perm ban with no warning\n\nI doubt that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2015-11-22T17:33:52.227+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lets look at the facts here\n1: 0-26 duo bot lane\n2: off Meta picks \n3: Both Plat players and one of them is a Diamond player who's recently dropped off\n4: 0 wards placed(even for Bronze players this bad, for Diamond/Plat this is absurd bot lane ESPECIALLY when split pushing)\n5: 1.7K DMG as full AD - AP bot lane duo, 20 min game\n\n\n\n- - - -\n\n\n\nEverything they did this game was intentional and should by every mean and right be considered intentional feeding.

Two hyper Dmg when built with Guinsoo, it's pretty obvious to anyone of any rank that in 20mins doing such little Dmg means you aren't even attacking the opponent. Not to escape, not for any reason. \n\nI am incredibly pleased that Riot banned these two, and I find it hilariously ironic that if most of you people had a duo bot who just afk splitpush and refused to attack you would of reported these players too, ESPECIALLY in high elo where it's very clear what they are doing is not going to win the game. \n\nHowever such is League of Hypocrites, all social justice warriors until it happens to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Straw Hat Loki","date":"2015-11-22T19:11:07.510+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"This. \nIf I was investigating his claim, I would go back and see if he was boosted into Plat as well. \nThere is no way to justify 12 deaths in lane.

That is troll meta. \n\nPlacing zero wards and doing that little damage to champions is another huge indicator of what him and his duo were up to.\n0-26 is absolutely unjustifiable. \n\nI am also glad they were banned and I hope it increases to a month or more or even perma if they continue on like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Liyutsue","date":"2015-11-23T00:58:01.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not going to say anything else that you said is wrong, I agree with you, but one thing, there is no such thing as a troll meta.

One thing I want to state is that this is a normal game, ruining a normal game is much much better than ruining a ranked game, although 0 and 26 is a bit too insane even for my charts. master yi adc and xin zhao bot lane is completely normal, even for season 6. If master yi somehow (just somehow, don't ask how) gets fed, he can still dominate. When you say no one forced them to pick melee champs against an ADC, first, that is blind pick, and also, a really great youtuber, Solwolf played master yi adc not long ago.

Obviously it was pretty terrible, I don't really have to explain that. \n2: No wards placed. I know it's hard to place wards when you're so far behind, but just dropping them in bushes behind you to prevent flanks shouldn't be that tough.\n3: Those tower kills can be summed up to \"splitpushing\" while your team was getting destroyed on the other side of the map, giving the enemies a free tower. So basically you're trading a possible chance to get something for your base. \n4: You played off-meta. Playing something like Support Yi (I know it was some sort of split between you and Xin, but the machine would probably see all Runic users as Morde or supports). \n5: AP Runes. \n6: When losing, instead of going full tank, you went for more damage and a requirement of spending more time in the middle of a team. \n7: If your AP was meant to help your healing, you had less overall healing throughout the game than anyone not in the mid lane.

That cannot be decided by looking at KDA.","replies":[{"poster":"Keitron","date":"2015-11-22T22:14:20.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is normals pal just because someone calls you a noob does not mean you go cry to mommy (riot) or in this case just because you skipped class once does not mean you get suspended (banned)","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-11-22T23:58:39.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, if it's a proven case of intentional feeding, just one game should be enough to warrant a ban.

I say it because the feeder detection system was over 14 months in development. It looks at far more than KDA or wards placed. It also looks at **how** you play. It knows how and when you use abilities. It knows how often you clicked and it knows how this contrasts with your normal style of play.\n\nMy best guess is that you and your friend were screwing around. You started with an off-meta comp and decided to say \"screw it\" when it didn't work out the way you hoped. I dunno, 0-28 between the two of you sounds like you were trolling from the get-go, but I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nI'm doing my best to get a Red in here to take a look.

One, you were playing Yi bot, which is highly unusual. Two, despite being at the Platinum level, you did not learn from your mistakes and continued to seek interaction with Ezreal in bot lane. Three, you were only able to deal a paltry amount of damage far below what the average Bronze Yi does. \n\nSo you have someone who dies an obscene amount of times in high level play, with a very unusual champion/lane combination, with far below average damage to players. Add to that a complete disregard for warding and it looks like you had no intention of playing towards a win.\n\n\"Hold up! It was Normals, why should I tryhard in Normals?\"\nBecause \"it's Normals\" is not an excuse to ruin the game for your team mates.\n\nWhether you were intentionally feeding is hard to tell, but all signs point toward more than just \"a bad game\".
