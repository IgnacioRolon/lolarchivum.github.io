I am looking to get either zed or katarina or talon because I love playing assassin, I am decently skilled at all 3, I&#039;ve tried em all out. Should I get zed because I will dedicate time to master him and is he good at silver level ranked games. Or should I get katarina but does she get banned in bronze - gold games alot? Or talon","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-04T09:25:14.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"kat gets banned in all levels, she's one of the stronger champions ingame, you're better off getting zed.\n\n\nIf mastered though, Kat is by far the most rewarding of the 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2017-02-04T18:00:16.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra because the best CC is death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemainaNyx","date":"2017-02-04T11:09:05.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat is really strong right now, but requires some skill to actually combo properly now.\n\nZed still seems strong to me, but he's dipped in must ban/play.\n\nTalon is eh.  He can be really strong but he pretty much just kills 1 target IMO.  Zed and Kat do a lot of AOE where as Talon can pretty much only kill one from what I've seen.  Maybe I'm wrong, I don't play him often, but I feel like the other two are better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"463","date":"2017-02-04T10:03:52.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't want Zed yet, since he's too mechanically demanding.
