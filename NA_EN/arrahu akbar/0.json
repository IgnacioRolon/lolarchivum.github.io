You won't be able to see anything but you can click and drag it around so that you can. Go to the \"video\" tab and change from \"fullscreen\" to \"windowed.\" Accept it. THEN CHANGE IT BACK. I'm on a MacBook pro and have been having the same problems, and this will fix it for the game and allow you to play in fullscreen mode. It's annoying, it's tedious, but it works.\n\nAlso I love all these Mac haters. They're probably writing from their phones because their laptop bluescreened.\n\nEDIT: Alt+Enter will also accomplish the same thing without having to open up the menu.","replies":[{"poster":"Scorpio Goddess","date":"2017-05-04T03:55:02.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"THIS WORKS.
