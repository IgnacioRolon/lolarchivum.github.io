She often found herself filled with envy of those around her who could and would freely engage in intimacies and public displays of affection, as if they were doing it just to mock her. She wished she could have somebody to love, even if only for a moment. She had heard a lot of great things about the mighty Fizz the Trickster, and, as nervous as she was, she knew that this could possibly be her last chance to satisfy her hunger for romance. Surely Fizz would have been just as lonely as her, if not more so, being separated from his own people for so very long.\r\n\r\nThough, these selfless empathetic thoughts for the great Tidal Trickster would soon be overwhelmed by new thoughts caused by her new found emotion: Lust. She found herself unable to refrain from looking over his fine, slender, smooth, shamelessly unclad body. How exciting it was to her that there was still much left to the imagination, even though the handsome figure that stood before her was literally completely nude. \"Surely, he must realize the implications of his lack of attire, to show off his beautiful aquatic body in such a way. And...how brave he must be to fight like that, without even even the lightest of armor to protect himself in the midst of combat, and yet he has not even a scar upon his perfect body... Everything about him is magical. He really is the full package. Oh, Fizz, I think I've held out long enough. You're the one I want...You're the one I need,\" Nami thought to herself... She was biting at her bottom lip as she indulged her eyes upon the male, not even attempting to mask her desire for him. If she had any less self restraint, she would have practically been drooling at him. After visually exploring the male, she would then bring her eyes to rest upon his in a lustful gaze, and say, with a nervous sort of innocent stammer, \"H-hey there, handsome.~ I've heard a lot about you. Would you care to come to my place and...\" She takes a moment, taking a deep breath, as she tries to muster the gall to voice her true desire. \"...and show me what wonders you can do with that...*pole* of yours?~\"\r\n\r\nFizz blushes a bit and coughs a few times awkwardly. It turns out he was just as socially inept and inexperienced as the Tidecaller on discussing matters of such erotic nature. He blinks a few times, just to buy some time... \"Well...\" He lets his mouth curl into an awkward half-smile, lets out an awkward shy giggle and replies, \"Sorry Nami, but I'm gay,\" and turns and walks out the door before things could get any more awkward.\r\n\r\n>Original thread here: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=42998608#post42998608","replies":[]}
