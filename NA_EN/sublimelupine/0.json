And I also don't know if this will catch the attention of anyone that matters but hey it's worth a shot! And if it does catch your attention you do matter. &lt;3\r\n\r\nAnyways. I am an NA player who is currently stationed in Japan. I have had this neat little trick to where I could log onto my Japanese account with the English client. All I had to do was shuffle around server information in the lol.application file and it would load up in English but on the Japanese server. I don't see that being an option anymore with this new client. So again I am asking if any devs see this. Can I please get an English text pack or just get it unlocked to where I can play on my Japanese server with English everything. I don't care that the other players are all names box box box. And for the most part they can speak enough English to utilize teamwork. Granted I have seen plenty of unsavory \"americans\" on the JP server and I have reported them. (American with a lower case \"A\" Cause they don't deserve it.) \r\n\r\nI don't want to play the military card but can I PLEASE get some help. I can't deal with the high ping to the NA servers and if someone else can they are far better than me. It doesn't make sense to me to even have the option to change the language if there is only one option. You may as well strip that whole drop down out except for places that actually utilize multiple languages. Which I don't think I have seen but I have only ever played on the NA and JP servers. \r\n\r\nI find it wholly insane that on the old server I can easily and fairly quickly trick the client into logging me into the JP server with the english client. But Actually Devs can't do it themselves. Is there a law that states they are not allowed. Am I just being ignorant? \r\n\r\nLooking for answers in all the wrong places. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nLet the downvotes commence... #rip","replies":[{"poster":"Vinse","date":"2016-11-22T06:26:40.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same situation as you, bruh.

Hah hah. I guess my lack of knowledge made me jump to conclusions. All you have to do is go to the system.yaml file in the most recent lol client release and add into region locale or available locales below the Region: jp_JP Put \"-en_US\" and it will come up as an option to log into the Japanese server with all english text.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T04:18:22.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this isn't something that's possible on the Beta Client at the moment.

I saw that before but it wasn't really that relevant considering I can go to outside sources to find out all that information. If something is down on the client notifications I can go to the website to see what all is down. Player's names being blocks is fine. I just wanted essential things to be in english. But with Reddit's help they showed me a way to be able to play in Japan with all english. I dislike having to make my own way around things but if that's the only way to enjoy the game then I guess I have to make due.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SublimeLupine","date":"2016-11-20T13:30:19.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The struggle continues...","replies":[]}]}
