Black Market Brawlers, Graves/TF portion in ACT III,  I&#039;ve won 2 of them today, one via destroying the Nexus, one via enemy team surrendering.  My &quot;progress&quot; still showed as only 1 win.  this is a bug, and needs to be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2015-07-31T01:09:57.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DragoonRuin~\n\nChecking your match history, it seems you didn't play with a Bilgewater Item in the second game.\n\nFor the objective, you have to win a game where you have bought a Bilgewater Item. The first game, you bought the Mirage Blade. But on the second game, you built only standard Summoner's Rift items.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragoonRuin","date":"2015-07-31T18:31:09.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply.  And come to think of it your correct.  I was in process of building the AD/Crit/LS sword when they surrendered but I hadn't finished it.  Thank you for clarifying that.  \n\nGuess now we're pigeon holed into building the BW items FIRST in the event the enemy surrenders quick.  :-/","replies":[]}]}
