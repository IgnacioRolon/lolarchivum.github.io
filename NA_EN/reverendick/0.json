You yourself admitted you were recently off a 2 week ban and continued to exhibit the same behavior that got you banned, hence perma ban. Riot even warns you the next offense is a perma ban.

Pls read below and know you were wrong. \n\n\nGreetings ReverenDick,\n\nI looked over the 3 games mentioned on the permanent suspension and I wanted to talk about what I noticed in these games.\n\nIt looks like during the game you are fine and you are even helpful to players at the beginning of the game, it seems like when something goes wrong in the game then you turn on players in your games including insulting them for their gameplay and this makes the rest of the game turn into quite a negative experience for all involved.\n\nThe games mentioned on this banning are negative enough to warrant a permanent suspension especially since you have recently gone through a 2 week suspension and about 2 weeks later this banning occurred. I wanted to give your account one final chance, and I will be applying a final 2 week suspension on your account.\n\nI also wanted to discuss the game where there was quite a bit of hatespeech going on, in this game there were players that were being incredibly toxic to each other and you responded back to them with a response claiming to defend yourself about the use of hatespeech. While I understand the want to explain this to others in the game with a measured response. This is not the place for you to be speaking about this in League. If this happens in the future just mute these players and report them after the game, there is no need to spread the negativity.\n\nPlease note that the next negative action on your account will result in a permanent suspension of your account and if it is placed we will not be removing or altering the suspension for any reason whatsoever.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\n(edited out riot employee)\nRiot Games Player Support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blutseuche","date":"2017-10-05T12:02:53.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youre not \"defending\" your race.\n\nYou just used this as an excuse to lash out and insult other people and stooped down the level of the one insulting you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-10-05T10:17:55.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't the format that usually accompanies chat logs, as they normally have the user's name and or time stamps.\n\nThat being said, you should take into account your punishment history.
