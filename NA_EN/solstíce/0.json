[NEW CLIENT]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So recently I've been having a lot of issues with the new client, and honestly it's not on my side. League works perfectly with the legacy client, but for some reason it just doesn't on the new. In the client itself there are a lot of \"Trying to reconnect...\" notices popping up, but those fix themselves within a minute. The real issue is in champ select. For some reason, when I DC in champ select I don't automatically reconnect. When this is going on though, the chat service is still live. I can still talk with my team in real time. I can't ban, can't pick, but can talk to teammates. Wonderful. Eventually I see the notification in chat of everyone leaving the lobby, while I'm still stuck on the 0-second timer screen. Upon reaching this point in the process, I need to restart League, and suffer my queue penalty for dodging. Could someone please help me understand what's going on? And please if a Riot person responds don't link me to your connection troubleshooting page. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"xZiinxx","date":"2017-05-10T17:50:06.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the EXACT same problem. I've noticed that it only happens on certain internet connexion. I've found a solution knowing this (can't really call it a solution): I queue up on my iPhone \"personal hotspot\" (using the lte of my cellphone) which doesn't give me any disconnection issues. Then, during the loading screen, I quit LoL, switch to my real Wi-Fi and reconnect. I always get into the game around 30 sec but at least I can play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-22T21:44:58.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated and legacy clients are separate applications, so your network settings can be configured fine on one but not the other.

I never DC in-game, only in the client. It's incredibly annoying. Also, if it's a configuration issue why would it only happen in the client? Shouldn't it affect me in-game as well? (it doesn't)","replies":[]}]}]}
