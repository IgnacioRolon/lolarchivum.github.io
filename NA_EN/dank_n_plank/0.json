To add some information, this seems related to wherever the NA patcher is pointing to. If I switch my client to EU W and restart the client, the client downloads the update just fine. But if I go back to NA, it stays stuck at 33%.

Also when I re-install the game it loads up only to 98% then shows the error again. This is the first time I experience anything like that, the error first appeared when patch 6.20 came out. I know for sure it's not caused by my connection as I tried patching with firewall turned off, and I have no anti-viruses besides that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"flyingpandas123","date":"2016-10-09T00:19:14.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people said it's the AVG virus software that are causing the trouble, I have AVG and it's denying my match to start.
