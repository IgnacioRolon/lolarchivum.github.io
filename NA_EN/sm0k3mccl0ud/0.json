Others do.\r\n\r\nWhy this savage imbalance? It isn&#039;t as though the resourceless champs suffer from reduced damage output in order to make up for their ability to infinitely cast spells.\r\n\r\nSo why then should any champ have a resource pool of any kind?\r\n\r\nTake yasuo and ziggs for example.\r\n\r\nYasuo is clearly casting spells in regards to his wind based bullshit kit, and yasuo players, you know your kit is bullshit. Ziggs on the other hand is simply throwing bombs, not casting spells of any kind what-so-ever.\r\n\r\nSo, if one champ, who suffers nothing from having a resourceless kit but is clearly casting spells, is allowed all the damage and mobility of an H-Bomb strapped to a jet engine... isn&#039;t it savagely imbalanced against champs who do suffer from resource intensive kits but clearly aren&#039;t casting spells...\r\n\r\nWhy not just remove all resource pools and make every champ cooldown based? It would certainly be more action packed and contribute to the E-Sports scene. No more should resource based champs be forced back while the yasuos and garens and katarinas of the world spam spells endlessly.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-07T00:15:49.880+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why slashing/stabbing with a sword is magical while throwing bombs isn't?\nLogics and physics are not used to justify game balance, and that is for good reason.\nIt's the same reason a rat with a blowpipe can kill a massive, galaxy-creating star dragon/god/entity.","replies":[{"poster":"Sm0k3McCl0ud","date":"2016-10-07T00:49:38.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nep2une,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HyGos3OA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-07T00:15:49.880+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t see why slashing/stabbing with a sword is magical while throwing bombs isn&#x27;t?\n> Logics and physics are not used to justify game balance, and that is for good reason.\n> It&#x27;s the same reason a rat with a blowpipe can kill a massive, galaxy-creating star dragon/god/entity.\n\nThrowing wind walls and wind teleports is swinging a sword and not spells?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-07T00:51:05.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's slashing hard enough to create a massive gust of wind.\n\nAnd it's a blink first of all, but that's only gameplay wise.
