Do they even have any intel or knowledge on the Void and the creatures that are starting to spread around Shurima? You would think that The Master Tactician Swain would have more information on them.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-09-01T10:44:40.941+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some regions have probably heard the tales of the \"twisted beings\" or \"great devourers\" and there may be some stories but nothing more... Most of those you mentioned are probably oblivious to the void, which also makes sense as even the nations are much younger and than the void events that occurred so the only way for them to know about the void is through written materials or stories( keep in mind most written evidence was destroyed through all the wars and conflicts be it internal or external)..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2019-08-30T03:53:36.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, technically...

I feel as though with the Icathia update and the Void update last year the Void is now a much more obscure thing. Not a massive world ending threat that the world fought off before and remembers. Only the Ascended, Icathians, Celestials and Lissandra likely know about them as well as champs like Rengar that directly confronted a Void champ. Rengar couldn't even put what Kha Zix was into words saying it was \"wrong\". \n\nI'm not saying they are too secret but just that random townspeople wouldn't understand what they are. To a lesser degree for sure than it was before the Void updates. \n\nPeople don't even remember Morde for Chris sakes and he came waaaay later and was relevant in Valoran which the Void really weren't","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2019-09-01T07:31:40.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you were unlucky enough to have run into one or are one of the regions you listed, most people don't know about the Void and even if some of their myths and stories are about voidborn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IIIllIIllIIllIII","date":"2019-08-30T11:21:02.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malazahar is coming for ya'all 3:) {{champion:90}} {{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2019-08-30T07:50:09.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd assume Ixtal and any Kumungu-residence are aware because the Void's \"main Location\" on Icathia is pretty close to their territory, hell, Rengar is having a dicksize measuring with Kha'Zix in that damn jungle and it's safe to say, considering how long Kha'Zix has been there, that other Kumungu-residents like Zyra and Nidalee know of him, and by extention, of the void.","replies":[]}]}
