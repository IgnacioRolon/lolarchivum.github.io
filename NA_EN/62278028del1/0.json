Check the server status here. If it looks good, \nfollow the guide here.\" I followed the guide, but it didn't help, and the server status was fine too! I tried League on the other computer and it worked fine, so I have no idea what's going on. I tried the \"Run as administrator\" button, but that didn't work either... This started happening around the new client \nupdate, so I tried using the Legacy Client. But whenever I tried using the Legacy Client OR the new client, it would start patching and would get to 99% and then an error would occur and it repeated itself over and over again. So I tried reinstalling the game but I still kept getting the \"Unable to connect to login queue\" message over and over again, but it at least let me patch. So I tried the Initiate Full Repair button but that didn't help either! HELP ME I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME\nEDIT: The YouTube sign in button also broke around the same time League did. It always says \"There was an issue signing you into YouTube. Troubleshoot here.\" I'm hoping if I can fix the YouTube issue the League issue will also fix. Any ideas?

All that stuff looks really scary and I don't want to blow something up, so I'm going to try the Hextech Repair Tool first.
