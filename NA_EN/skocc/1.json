Also, beyond LoL, everything else works perfectly.\r\n\r\nSo if anyone has any idea if maybe i could fix this somehow, maybe some lol files are corrupted (but i think that causes fps problems, not lag) or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T16:15:51.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Corrupted files definitely won't impact your connection, but the fact that this happens across multiple connections and locales intrigues me. I suspect there may be network settings local to your PC that could be causing this. To ensure that's not the cause, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if those steps changed anything.","replies":[]}]}
