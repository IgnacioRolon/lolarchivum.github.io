There are still some features that aren't available in LCU, but can still be accessed and changed in the legacy client. If you aren't sure how to pop back over to the legacy client, all you need to do is \n\n- Open the client\n- Click the 'Launch Legacy Client button (yellow text) in the lower right hand side of the login screen\n- Log in as usual","replies":[]}]}]}
