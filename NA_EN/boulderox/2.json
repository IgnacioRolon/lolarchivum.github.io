Like you said GP already struggles in 1v1's, reducing his ult range to a TF or Pantheon like range would make him a lot more healthy, especially in higher elos where people find him more oppressive. Higher elo players are able to use globals well, and a map wide global like gp is able to swing any lane at any time after 6 and causes a lot of hate for GP.\n\nMaybe a 4th silver serpent upgrade to make it global again would be fun. /shrug. I think his ult being global is pretty powerful right now, and I would be sad if the rest of his kit had to give up power for the ability to swing fights on the other side of the map.
