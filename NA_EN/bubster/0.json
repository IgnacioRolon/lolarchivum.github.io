I have already been in my promos for gold 1, therefore I was rewarded 1 free win. I then queue'd up for my Vi game, which I won. But the client and OP.gg show that I have not played my 2nd game in my promo. I will just play my promos out. Just thought I'd throw a heads up out to Riot. This was right before patch 6.14 last night.\n\nEDIT 1: Won my next game so I promo'd anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T15:21:33.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems everything functioned normally. It's possible the system had a hiccup and simply didn't apply the Promo Helper immediately. Congrats on your promotion to Gold 1! :)\n\nIf you have any more concerns about Promo Helper or what happened here, I recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with our specialists.","replies":[]}]}
