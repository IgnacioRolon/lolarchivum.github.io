The popular solution is to set your date forward or backwards (I haven't tested it but many people say it is a temporary fix.) My solution is to uninstall league and wipe all local files left over. reinstall and attempt to patch. If it doesn't patch or the loop start again  go to Riot games> League of Legends>RADS and delete the projects folder. try to patch again and continue to delete the projects folder until  the problem is solved.  This is what I did to fix my problem.","replies":[]}]}
