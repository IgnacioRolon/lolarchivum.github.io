Unless playing meta in top, you literally cannot do anything to Morg. She also makes bot a snorefest because she hard counters interaction, i mean cc. Really fun, huh?  Morgana was initially designed for mid lane where ap champs could, more or less, break the shield with one ability. Even then, she was ungankable because she was range. I'm just trying to give divers some leeway to interact with her. And its not like this is a huge nerf. She can still reliably block most cc.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-14T01:33:53.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsuhume,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5AK9kNgX,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-02-14T01:29:44.528+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m sorry you cannot afk top lane.

The only way she is outclasses is in damage. And why not? She is god tier in terms of cc and utility. If she had broken damage, she would be banned every game.","replies":[]}]}]}
