I have very little time to play this game.  When Riot came out with the ability to choose between two roles, I was over the moon, because I could finally focus my limited time on 1-2 roles and specialize in them, rather than having to have a stable of champions for every role.\r\n\r\nThen came autofill.  Playing an off-role is now much worse than before, because when I do get stuck with adc/support, I&#039;m rusty as hell because I rarely ever play those positions.  The game is frustrating even if we do, by some miracle, manage to win despite me derping around with my thumbs up my ass.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been autofilled support 3 times tonight.  One somebody dodged, once I dodged, and the time I played was as awful as it always is.  Riot, instead of needlessly reworking the jungle for the 524th time, maybe try making supports actually fun to play, so people don&#039;t have to be forced to.  Every time I&#039;ve had to play adc/bot has been so painful, I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m just going to dodge if nobody will switch with me.  If a lot of people are doing that, how&#039;s that going to affect queue times?  That would certainly explain why I see so many dodged games.  I hate to be part of the problem, but I don&#039;t want to waste 20-60 minutes of my precious time playing a role I no longer know.  And to all the folks who say, &quot;You should know all the roles,&quot; isn&#039;t it nice for you that you have time to play the hours and hours that let you cultivate every role.  I don&#039;t have time for that, especially since role-selection IS A THING THAT EXISTS.\r\n\r\nOh, and bring back goddamn item sets.  I played Lux support and there was no recommended support page for her (even though she can often go support) and I can&#039;t set up my own.  I love item sets, they&#039;re great, and I&#039;m stuck with the ones I made months ago for champs I don&#039;t even play anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Dracocrash","date":"2017-01-15T02:33:15.657+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you get autofilled just take janna. easy to play and freelo.","replies":[{"poster":"AkaliTheOP","date":"2017-01-15T02:37:45.857+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":9,"body":"As a support main, please don't.
