We had a bug for the first few hours of pre sale where everyone was limited to 2 tix. I am working with TicketMaster to help you out, and to do so I need you to send me your info to tickets@riotgames.com. I need your email and any transaction info.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Like 2 Cuddle","date":"2017-06-26T16:30:41.812+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here. The original post noted that \"There is a max limit of 6 tickets or bundles per transaction. Floor seats are extremely limited and will be limited to 2 seats per transaction.\" So this should have only applied to floor seats","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raravin","date":"2017-06-27T16:18:48.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must be nice to even get tickets, trying to do the bundle and getting a broken search every time tried quantity of 1 (incognitio browser) and qty 2 both just broken.

We had to purchase only 2 and are crossing our fingers to be able to pick up a third ticket nearby for our friend tomorrow in the general sale. \n\nMakes me think something on the Ticketmaster system may have messed up and didn't conform to what was expected.","replies":[{"poster":"theuSeR91","date":"2017-06-26T16:33:46.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your code does work for the other two sales, so you can still get 4 tickets buying each day individually and buying the bundle. they just become two separate groups, and you can attempt trades or try again tomorrow and sell the ones you got today.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhazik","date":"2017-06-26T16:36:43.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, tried that...unfortunately the single day tickets don't let you search by section - it's only \"best available\", which doesn't help.
