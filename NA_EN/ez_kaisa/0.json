If you go in 90% sure you'll lose, it'll probably be a self-fulfilling prophecy simply because you'll focus on what you'll do *wrong* instead of what you should be doing *right*. \n\nThree easy ways to boost your confidence:  \n\n* Practice, you probably saw this one coming, but seriously, having confidence in your skill with the champ and role you get in a game can really help out.  \n\n* Downplay the stakes. I remember my Gold V promos. It was a big deal for me getting out of Silver and I'm not going to say \"it's just a game\" or \"it's just Gold\" because of that. What I will say though is to not sweat over a lost promo series. Yes it means more games, and when it's your 5th or so series (My Gold II promos....ugh) it can get frustrating, but the fact remains you got there once you can gt there again. Don't worry about the ranking, worry about the game you're in. Whether you've got a Gold, Diamond or Bronze icon doesn't matter at all in a game, you making the right decisions and plays is what matters.  \n\n* View every game as a lesson not as a test. You are your own teacher in League, no matter how many times you are coached or how many guides you read. As such, don't look at a death or a lost game like a waste of time. You can *always* take something away from a loss to improve your game, so it's never an innately bad thing, it's just a small inconvenience.\n\nAll that being said I also wish you the best of luck, a little can go a long way! =D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-07-18T22:45:28.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are all really valid points! \n\n**Practice** - For which ever role you play, be confident that you can be successful with several champions. Know who counters these champions, and be familiar with their kits. I improved my rank play by a ton when I started playing ARAM, and learning how more champions worked.\n\n**Downplay the stakes ** - Sure, losing sucks, and everyone wants to win. Sure, it's going to be more work to get back into promos if you *do* lose, but so what?! You've done it before, so you're totally capable to do it again! I second the point of rank not mattering in a game ~ it's definitely all about how you and your team plays together. \n\n**View every game as a less, not as a test** - YES. YES. YES. Okay, so you lost. What can you take away from that? Did you not have vision, and were too pushed too far out? Was it a bad Baron call? Did you try to 1v1 someone and realized just a little too late they were fed? What could you have done differently? What did their team do well? I know it can be hard to look into a loss and critique yourself, but it'll help you prevent the same mistakes from happening again, and will ultimately improve your play! \n\n**How I avoid getting nervous** - For me, shaking off the nervousness was as easy (hah) as learning multiple lanes. I would have a panic attack when I first started queuing in ranked because I only knew how to mid. OH GOSH, WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE CALLS MID, THEN WHAT?! SHOULD I JUST INSTALOCK?! Once I learned several lanes, it was a lot less stressful in champion select, *and* it makes it easier for people to fill, creating a happy team, not three people who can only mid, and now it's totally an ARAM! \n\nWhat also helped me was just learned how each champion worked, what their skills were, what they were strong against, what they're weak against. The more you know, the more confident you become, the more confident you may feel to lead your team in (or out!) of a team fight! \n\nIf you're still nervous, try practicing in a draft pick, but treat it like ranked. Play how you normally would ~ take it seriously. It's a great way to improve your play without worrying about losing your rank! \n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"EZ Kaisa","date":"2014-07-19T16:45:29.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying to my post, i ended up winning my series as well, Gold V first try :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-07-19T17:30:16.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime! \n\nCongrats! :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
