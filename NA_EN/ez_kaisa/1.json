I was wondering your opinion on zhonya's hourglass.\nI personally think the item needs a nerf due to how hard it counters not only assassins like talon and zed, but also countering even tanks, as you can just wait for cooldowns on champions like fizz. Instead of offering counter-play to their damage, it instead completely destroys ALL of the damage, without any actual downfall.\n\nI think the effect of Stasis it provides should be lowered to 1.75 seconds (currently 2.5) for this purpose of offering counter-play,  2.5 seconds is just too long.\n\nOpinions? Do you think zhonyas is OP?  Do you think it is balanced? How should it be changed if in any way at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-07-14T10:37:52.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it´s fairly balanced, you really have to time it right or it´ll be just useless...so the better the mindgames/timing the more effective it gets - it´s pretty much what all balancing should aspire.

Taken to a slight extreme, imagine ZH with a statis of .5 seconds. You could still use it to escape from the largest burst damage spells and then immediately escape or continue fighting with minimal disruption to your personal damage pattern or movement. \n\nInversely let's say the duration was increased to 5 seconds from 2.5. Using this puts the caster is a tricky situation, you use the stasis to escape an immediate threat but losing control of your actions for the next 5 seconds gives a ton of control and opportunity to your opponents. In teamfights it reduces your ability to contribute (as 5 seconds is an eternity in a teamfight) meaning you've turned that teamfight into a 4v5 and giving the entire enemy team time to huddle around your soon to be dead body. \n\nNot to say Zhonya's couldn't use a light nerf but personally I don't think it needs anywhere near the level of a full rework or gutting. I would certainly like to hit the stat efficiency of the item a bit when we do a pass and increase the stasis duration slightly but that has the really heavy cost of people learning, memorizing, and feeling the invuln timing on both ends.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-07-15T22:40:52.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"you know zhonyas active has come to my mind often as of late as it is one of my key items on my main. That being said It would be interesting to see what being able to cancel the stasis after about 1-1.5 seconds by hitting the item again might do. it would definitely increase the stasis power of the item but it would also provide a bit further control with regard to the tides of the teamfight. Quite often when I use zhonyas at least one person on the enemy team will sort of fall back if they are able to and wait for the stasis to end and cc lock you further if able. If you could choose to end the stasis sooner you could catch them off guard and either engage on them or retreat a bit safer.\n\nthe one thing I don't think zhonyas needs is to have the stasis time increased. 2.5 seconds is honestly just right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-07-15T20:08:56.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whoa there tiger!

(Fizz, Syndra). \n\nAlso are there going to be plans for AP melee itemization?

For those of you who were not around, Zhonya's Ring had the %AP amp from Deathcap, and the Stasis active of Hourglass, plus 120 AP.  It was, bar none, the most powerful item in the game, because it was the best in-class offense item (120 AP, % AP amp) and the best in-class defense item (go-go-gadget-stasis!), in a single item slot.  As a result, Riot split the item into Deathcap and Hourglass.\n\nThe issue now is that Hourglass is -- *still* -- top tier in-class offense, and -- *still* -- best in-class defense.  If I had my way, ZGlass would look more like this (numbers properly balanced, of course) :\n\n**Zhonya's Hourglass**{{item:3157}} \nRecipe:  {{item:3191}} Seeker's Armguard (1160 gold) + {{item:3113}} Aether Wisp (950 gold) + <number> combine = <number> total\n+70 AP\n+60 Armor\nUnique: + 5% movespeed\nUnique:  Stasis\n\nThis positions Hourglass as more of a defensive item rather than an offensive one, all the way through.  Relevant AP, but not a huge amount.  Significant Armor, now that it is a defensive item.  The movespeed might seem a little odd, however, you could easily swap the {{item:3113}} Aether Wisp for a {{item:3108}} Fiendish Codex to replace with CDR instead.  Both fit with the idea of an enchanted hourglass (although the CDR might fit better).\n\nThe only real cost to this is figuring out what new item to make for {{item:1058}}  NLR to build into.","replies":[]},{"poster":"canible","date":"2014-07-16T14:37:30.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The issue is in team fights I believe.  1v1 it can be annoying but not necessarily op.  In a team fight, being forced to switch targets after blowing cooldowns on an initial target is very hard to do properly.  Especially when it is someone like Fizz or Kat.  Lowering the stasis time would be a nerf no matter how you look at it to the overall usability.  1v1 for a skilled user it might see a buff, but in a team fight it would allow your team to actually finish of the target. Not to mention that Zhonya's is 110% gold efficient without even taking into account the active.  WOOGLETS on the otherhand, is just plain stupid.  Playing 3s or dominion a lot means that EVERY AP gets that item. On dominion, there can be 2 or even 3 ap's on a team comp at times, so you may have to deal with three of the actives in any given fight...besides being 103% gold efficient without either the passive and active factors, its just plain not fun to play against.  It needs to be changed.
