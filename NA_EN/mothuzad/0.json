Our latency spikes to 1200-3200 ms depending on the type of game. I have done some research and everything points to opening certain ports for league of legends on my router  but a lot of links have been deleted so they take me to an error page instead. Anyone able to help me with the knowledge of what ports I need to open to be able to have multiple league of legends accounts running games at the same time?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T23:32:31.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have just the tool to help!
