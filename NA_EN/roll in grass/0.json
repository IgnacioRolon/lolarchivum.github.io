The relationship between ADCs and Supports right now is pretty much a domestic violence relationship, and I&#039;m tired of watching it happen. Numerous times in all-chat per day do I see abusive statements from the enemy adc to their support, and all I can say is: &quot;Fuck you abusive adcs.&quot;\nWithout your support, you are absolutely nothing. If you&#039;re 12-1-4 and your support is 0-7-14 then you take all the credit or call your support a feeder, you are scum. Your support is the one that got you fed, not you. If your support didn&#039;t peel for you, provide you with utility, cc the enemy, or tank all of their damage, you would be the one feeding and/or you wouldn&#039;t be fed whatsoever. Oh, you have 104 cs at 10 minutes (yes, this is possible, though I know it&#039;s an over-exaggerative sentence)? Tell me more about how your support is useless. Your support is the one that allowed you to get that cs. Without them being there to pressure the enemy off of you or give you the utility to survive the lane so you could farm, you wouldn&#039;t even have nearly as much cs as you have.\nDon&#039;t think I&#039;m right? Go ahead, ask your support to leave lane and to go support mid. Tell me how much cs you have at 10 minutes. Tell me how many kills and deaths you have at 10 minutes. My guess: Less than 70, 0 and 2. Don&#039;t think I&#039;m right? Go ahead, you engage the fight, not your support. I want you to walk up to the enemy and autoattack them with your support sitting behind you (unless you have a Soraka support &gt;~&gt;). Tell me who ends up winning the fight.\nSo, stop being an asshole and give your support the credit. I challenge you ADC mains out there to give your supports as many compliments as you can think of today. &quot;Thanks for warding, Lulu :)&quot;, &quot;Oh my gosh Thresh, your peeling was incredible that fight!&quot;, &quot;Without you, I couldn&#039;t have gotten fed, Braum :3&quot;. I challenge you ADC mains out there to be kind and respectful to your supports when you want something done today. &quot;Hey Lulu, could you go ward over there for us **please**? :)&quot;, &quot;Alright Thresh, I&#039;d love to see some awesome peeling for you!&quot;, &quot;I know you&#039;re going to do a good job carrying me Braum :3&quot;. I challenge you ADC mains out there to not make a single toxic comment today. No calling gg because you lost lane, fed first blood, or someone else on the team is feeding; no flaming your support or anyone on the team for making a mistake (we&#039;re human, we&#039;re not perfect); no calling someone bad because they&#039;re having a bad game (you&#039;ve had bad games too). I challenge you ADC mains out there to thank your support for carrying you at the end of the game, or if they played poorly forgive them and encourage them that they&#039;ll do better next game. At the end of the day, report back to me your winrate and how much better your supports played. \n\nSupports:\nI love you, and I&#039;m sorry for the poor treatment a lot of ADC players out there give you. This toxic community has made you guys feel underappreciated, and a lot of support mains died off because of it. However, keep in mind that not all ADCs are the same, and there are a few of us out there that understand the work you&#039;ve done for us and appreciate every single bit of effort you&#039;ve put in. It&#039;s a hard life for you supports: You wake up everyday and get onto your laptop or computer to play some League of Legends, and instead of being happy that you&#039;re about to play such an amazing game and gain some elo, you&#039;re letting out a deep sigh and frowning whilst dejectedly queueing up for a League match wondering why you even play support anymore, knowing that you&#039;re just going to get harassed and/or verbally abused by your ADCs and lose more elo. That&#039;s why I&#039;m making this post--to try to make a difference. \nUnfortunately, not every ADC will see this, and chances are the ones that do you won&#039;t see in game later, so if you&#039;re a Gold 3+ elo support with either Skype, Curse Voice, Teamspeak, and/or Discord and at least a 52% winrate, go ahead and add me in-game and I&#039;ll make sure you don&#039;t have to deal with those toxic ADCs. I&#039;ll give you a relaxing day of fun and elo gains, and give you all the compliments you deserve. If you don&#039;t meet my requirements, go ahead and add me in-game anyway! We can be friends and play some normal games together sometime! I&#039;m always looking for League of Legends friends, and maybe we can even form a club together; a club where positive ADCs and Supports can meet and queue together to have a fun, healthy environment :). \nAnd don&#039;t forget, there are those of us out there who understand your hard work and appreciate it. Don&#039;t lose hope and quit playing support, we need you! &lt;3\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0yuye5f.jpg\nIGN: Roll in Grass\nGold 2 elo Twitch main\n\nEDIT: Holy shit this post is blowing up. So hard to keep up with and reply to all of the comments!\nEDIT2: I'm going to take a nap, so unfortunately I won't be able to continue keeping up with all of the comments and talk to my fellow summoners.

Any tips for when they have a heavy dive team? (Vi, Zed, Amumu, etc). Does Merc. Scim. synergize with him well or is it worth more to get a GA and hang in the back until the ults are blown?","replies":[{"poster":"Roll in Grass","date":"2016-03-23T18:12:37.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off you probably never want to get GA on Twitch. I'll cover defensive items further down.\nAgainst a dive team like you just listed, especially versus Vi, just stand super far back, perhaps even out of vision of the enemy team, until the teamfight starts; do not attack minions, do not help push, just stay super far back. Once the teamfight starts (the split second you see two champions of opposing teams make close contact with each other) press Q and hover around the backline for a bit until you see that their positions are static (i.e. Amumu throws his Q onto someone on your team, they'll move around for a bit trying to position for that ulti; once they stop moving it's your time to shine), then press R at max range and damage whoever you can. Don't try to kill the backline, just hit whoever you can in a safe position.\n> \"The AD Carry's job is not to kill the enemy carries, it's to deal as much damage as possible without dying.\"\n\n{{item:3139}} is the most optimal item for the comp you listed. Any team comp that has three or more champions with easy-to-land hard-cc or extremely obnoxious debuffs (i.e. {{champion:32}}, {{champion:103}}, {{champion:412}}, {{champion:90}}, {{champion:238}}), this is the item you want to build.\n{{item:3053}} is the defensive item you're going to want to build against assassins (i.e. {{champion:238}}, {{champion:84}}, {{champion:105}}). However, some assassins, like {{champion:105}} and {{champion:238}}, two or more defensive items fit into the category of countering them. There is nothing wrong with building two defensive items, but make sure you're actually able to do so, and never build three. For example, if they have a {{champion:106}} and a {{champion:31}} on the enemy team, it's not worth sacrificing your {{item:3036}} for a second defensive item.\n{{item:3156}} is probably the best of all of the defensive items, but unfortunately can only be built in certain situations. If they have a burst mage that doesn't have much cc, their cc doesn't last long, or their burst has a long cooldown after their cc is down (i.e. {{champion:115}}, {{champion:7}}, {{champion:34}}), this is the item you're going to want to get. Honestly, you should try to build this as your core defensive item as much as possible, but unfortunately you're going to HAVE to build {{item:3139}} more often than {{item:3156}}.\n{{item:3026}} is the second worst defensive item there is and is only built in very rare situations. If the enemy doesn't have an assassin, doesn't have a burst-oriented mage, or doesn't have much cc--like an ADC comp--this is the item you'll get. Otherwise, don't build it--ever.\n{{item:3102}} is the worst defensive item there is and is also only built in a very rare situation. The only champion you'll ever build this against is {{champion:30}}. Otherwise, never build it.\n\nEDIT: The most optimal standard Twitch build is {{item:3142}}>{{item:3085}}>{{item:1300}}>{{item:3031}}>{{item:3036}}>{{item:3139}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-03-23T19:53:55.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the info dude\n\nWhat's your stance on {{item:3153}} for Twitch?","replies":[{"poster":"Roll in Grass","date":"2016-03-24T01:46:04.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3153}} is horribly gold inefficient, but it's still a really good item for Twitch.

This janna was a good player, and ended the game like 0/0/12. But youre supposed to shield me when I go in for a trade, not as I'm just standing there csing. I basically won that lane by myself, with janna just being there so I didnt get zoned by the morg and getting cheesed. Luckily, the janna was good and played well after the lane phase and saved my butt a couple of times, but they're not these tragic heroes that need to be thanked for all their hard work. \n\nSo stop it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxicor","date":"2016-03-24T05:57:44.761+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny how many people are missing the point of this thread. Be nice to your team, it will pay off. :) Supports are a smaller group of people so sometimes it's okay to give them a pat on the back. If your support or heck anyone is raging there's probably a reason. We all make mistakes.

I, a support main, get flamed nearly every game for their not being enough wards, not sacrificing myself for my teammates, roaming mid everyone once in a while, etc... This patch is by far the worst time in league history to be a support player, if not the lowest point in league history in general. Ward limit and the removal of green wards made supports progressively worse until we arrive at the sorry state its in know. Combined with blanket nerfs for support masteries/champs/etc and the current bullshit meta/balance, this game is nigh unplayable for a support main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-03-24T05:27:15.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you'd have started with:\n> [{quoted}](name=Roll in Grass,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BGVBtFWJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-23T12:15:38.177+0000)\n>\n> Riot:\n­­Please stop being assholes to your supports.

So you only ever see it going against the support.\n\nThat doesn't mean it doesn't go both ways, nor does it mean you can't get fed and carry with a completely useless support.\n\nI've had games where I can't get a kill in lane, my support dies a couple times, and while I say nothing i know my support is REALLY bad. Then while the support is dead (0/2/0, I'm 0/0/0) I get tower dove and get a double kill. Don't tell me my support died on purpose to bait the tower dive or some BS like that. My support was awful, I outplayed the tower dive (dodging all of the cc, baiting heal, getting the support who's tanking slowed/snared so they take the extra hit to die while I focus the ADC) and once I got those 2 kills roamed mid and snowballed myself without help from my support.\n\nDoes that happen every game? God no. Is the support the reason I get fed most of the times I get fed as ADC? MAYBE. NOT YES, only MAYBE. \n\nI mean, pause, and think about it for a second:\nIf I get fed in 85% of my games as Jinx, is it because of my support or because of me? It's obviously because of me, because odds are I'm not getting a god-like support while my opponent gets a garbage support in 85% of my games. \n\nThe bot lane is a 2 player game. More often than not, the winning side is the one with not only better players, but better chemistry between the two, which means that both players succeed together and both fail together (so in the above example, it's actually not my mechanical/strategic ability that lets me get fed 85%, but my ability to develop chemistry with my support).\n\nWhich leads to the core problem:\nI think most of the time that an ADC is raging at his support ISN'T because the support is garbage, but is because this particular ADC and Support don't work well together and the ADC is more vocal about it. They're losing because they're not a good pair, not because either is individually a bad player (most of the time). \n\nI don't rage at supports, but I can tell you the worst ones are those who refuse to let me play my game. In season 5 I hated laning against Graves. I ALWAYS died to him in engages (as Jinx). I told my support at the start of every Graves game that I wanted a farm lane. Every time I got it (i.e. my support didn't try to engage all laning phase) I won lane. No, I didn't get kills, but I got the turret early and had 40+ more farm. Every time I didn't (my support thought they saw a chance and engaged) I died in lane and mostly fell behind and lost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2016-03-23T18:29:29.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main who can play many supports (and even non meta supports) with success I thank you\n\nI've had adc that rage at me for being a shaco support but then...
