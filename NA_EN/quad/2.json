You play a free game and expect everything to be free that comes along with it right? Wrong! Just because it is a free game does not mean riot should make everything obtainable from just playing the game. They have to make money too some way. Making ward skins and champion  skins cost IP would completely ruin riot. They make all there money off of RP and that's how it always will be. If you are in such dire need of money get a job then. If you are not old enough to get a job then stop complaining! Just because you do not have a certain skin or a ward does not mean you will play any better or worse. It is just ways for people to show off there support for riot in general and the game itself. From buying RP you keep the game alive as well as the community.\n\nSomething that I was going to add but a guys comment was spot on about it:\n\nDivinityArcane (NA)  - 22 minutes ago\nPeople complain about the weirdest things.. Let's go over some simple facts here.\n\nRiot Games is a company operating with around 1,000 employees. People who need to put food on the table for their families. Any adult would realize what this means.\nLoL has been free from day one. RP is their main income, but it's not required to play the game.\nThings that cost IP exclusively are like that to reward players who put more time into the game.\nThings that cost RP exclusively are like that to offer customization to players for their favorite champs, or to allow newer players to buy some things quicker.\nYou may think that $20 of RP you just bought was a lot of money, but divide that by 1,000 after taking overhead fees out of it. That's barely income, if any at all. So if you feel like you have to use that $5 in your pocket to get that shiny ward skin, you both a) don't have to do anything; and b) shouldn't resent Riot for the small thanks you just gave them for providing you with one of the better F2P games on the market.\n\nAnyway, that's just my opinion. If people honestly don't like having to pay money for skins, they really have no idea how much work goes into making just one of those skins these days.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-10-20T00:51:37.162+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"I still want ward skins to cost less than $5.","replies":[{"poster":"Quad","date":"2014-10-20T01:09:42.851+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":12,"body":"$5 is nothing man.

Over the past year I've won 360 some games, about 1/3 - 2/5 of every game I've played in 5v5 (I'm not the best player in the world so meh), Let's assume the prior, so 360 time 3 is 1080 games in the past year. multiply this by 40 and you get 43200 minutes, divide by 60 you get 720 hours. I've spent around 720 hours playing normal 5v5's in the past year. That's just norms, not including ranked, bot's 3v3's and the special game modes that are included within that time period. I'm also not the most active LoL player in the world (my parent's don't like me gaming). So, let's round that number up to 750 for me, because that's closer to the amount of time I've actually spent. I've probably spent about $75-80 on cosmetics in that past year. While yes $10 may seem enormous for a single skin, look at the money spent on the game to relative time played. From what I hear of most people, there aren't too many games that people buy at \"full retail price\" that they will play for more than even 200 hours, the most recent one I know of is the new Borderlands game, which is open world and has some nice replay-ability.\n\nYes a \"full retail game\" may seem cheaper at the price compared to a single skin, but that single skin is something that puts money into supporting a free game that you've spent x hours playing. Me? I've spent upwards 800 hours total, and around $80 total supporting it. I'm not ashamed to put $10 and hour in cosmetics towards a game that I play for that amount of time I play it, I'm more upset that I put $30 into buying Civ 5 and haven't broken 50 hours of playtime in the past year I've owned it.\n\nPoint being is that skins aren't meant to be a \"full product\", they are a bi-product of a full product used to keep that full product running, like an MMO subscription. The reason people pay that is due to the cost being worth the time played. So a skin to a person who play's 100 hours a year would be them putting $10 into riot for 100 hours of gameplay, whereas a person who plays 800 hours and bought one skin would be getting 800 hours for that same ten dollars. It's all relative to how much you play and what the worth of the game is to you. If your willing to spend $50-$60 on a \"standard full retail game\" then I hope you get your 500-600 hours of gameplay out of that, because I've willingly put in $80 to league as a thank you for the 800 hours of fun I've enjoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"Quad","date":"2014-10-20T20:45:02.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MorikTheMad","date":"2014-10-20T17:00:33.969+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is by design.

They always have one skin that is essentially a re-color that can be bought with in-game currency. Many champions (or at least the older ones) have these things and to have a few of them obtainable via IP while the rest that took significantly more time and effort and resources cost real money doesn't seem like a bad idea to me.\n\nGranted that opens up the floodgates of possibility and precedent. We've already learned from the fiasco that is their decision to make Championship Thresh available how such things could go. (Riot, if you're reading this: DO NOT RE-RELEASE CHAMPIONSHIP RIVEN! Sorry, but it wasn't that good of a model to begin with and people are just whining! DO NOT GIVE IN! In a month and a half 90% of them will go back to never playing Riven anyway.)\n\nIf simple, older skins could be purchased for IP, perhaps that might solve the problem and keep everyone happy. Not every champion has those skins, but people need to understand that those ones are from a different time when Riot had a different way of doing things.\n\nI suppose there's also the possibility of making them so prohibitively expensive that you're really gonna have to save up that IP for a skin. Six figure IP price? Seven figures? Certainly would get people playing I suppose. Might cut down on the afk after first blood crowd too since they'll wanna stick it out for the additional IP.\n\nEither way, there's probably a compromise that could be put out to make everyone at least content.","replies":[{"poster":"Quad","date":"2014-10-20T01:08:43.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I think riot makes enough money that they will never even have to think about making IP skins.

Riot has (despite the complaints) proven to be a pretty player-friendly company. They do listen to their players when it's clear that what the players are asking for is something they REALLY want. Multiple champions have been made/affected by this (Lee Sin and Elise being the two examples I can think of at the moment), and even the East Coast Servers thing is being worked on.\n\nIf people want the better skins, they will always pay for them. Always. Putting out the cheaper/recolor skins as IP-priced wouldn't be a nightmare. If anything it may throw the 'It's FREE so I REFUSE TO PAY ANYTHING ON PRINCIPLE!' crowd some love.\n\nThe problem is not IP skins. The problem, I think, is balancing pricing with expenses. There should be just as much want from Riot to have the customer spend $5 or $10 on their game, as those of us who spend hundreds. Having the money be spent purely on cosmetic items is a good way to deal with the issue, but the pricing slider just needs to be adjusted a little.\n\nOn the flipside, people complaining about prices need to remember that Riot is paying their employees with this money. They're keeping themselves running. This is by and large their ONLY REVENUE. Their E-Sports division doesn't have a ton of sponsors, Teams have sponsors, but Riot E-Sports has few thus far. They're also not airing commercials between matches so there's that. Even if Riot is a big bad greedy corporation like some people think, there's people that work IN that corporation that ARE NOT evil. They're just trying to make a living, doing something they enjoy, and put food on the table for themselves and their families.\n\nPaying the 'chinese overlords' or whatever is one thing, but paying the guy who spent two weeks working himself to the bone to make Spirit Guard Udyr or Arcade Sona or Dunkmaster Darius is completely another. We don't even know if the former exists. The latter we KNOW exists and deserves our support for their efforts when we enjoy them.\n\nBah, rambling, but you get the point: IP skins wouldn't be a problem if done right. We'd still spend fat stacks on this game for the stuff we REALLY want.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vellich0r","date":"2014-10-20T13:53:46.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they do have free skins though, garen, alistar, tristana.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-10-20T15:38:20.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"WOW 3 free recolor skins to SMITE's 99% of god pool?","replies":[{"poster":"Vellich0r","date":"2014-10-20T16:49:05.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are better than just recolor except tristana. but thats beside the point, you also get enough free RP to buy a skin when you reach a certain level, can get free skins by referring friends, ETC. my point wasnt that LoL had more free skins than smite, i was just mentioning that you can get free skins. so your sarcasm is neither needed nor is it even a constructive part of this discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-10-20T16:54:43.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"At level 3 you only get enough to buy a 390 RP skin, only 3 of them exist, White Veigar, Yellow Alistar or Blue Yi, all just recolors.

I'm not saying half off or anything, but like 25-30% ip would be nice on those sale champs.","replies":[{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2014-10-20T17:26:01.665+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i love this idea personally, cause i never understood why the sales were only rp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-10-20T17:49:34.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You guys tickle me.

Riot is making money hand over fist with this game, and if they reduced skins to a reasonable price point they wouldn't likely make much less (as people would buy more skins if they were cheaper).","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhereTheNamesAt","date":"2014-10-22T00:55:57.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand posting the other stuff but I don't know why you listed servers.
