They do not care about anyone that is not played in the LCS and so on. They are happy with the over powered lanners and junglers. Lets look at what they just did. Yasuo was a very much played champion because he was so op. Then riot gave him a little nerf and every team stopped using him. Because of that that had to buff him again so that he is played so much more. They literally have there few select champions that they will never nerf. A Sivir will never beat a Lucian in a lane because they know Lucian is a big guy in the esports community and Sivir is not so why should we care about her. Now lets look at the jungle and I am pretty sure you all know who I am going to talk about. Not Warwick (because he is not used in the LCS) but Lee Sin the mascot of Riot. Everyone has been asking for a Lee Sin nerf forever now because he needs one. He is way to mobile for the amount of damage he has and his ult is up every single fight that he does dealing insane amounts of damage. Because he is so well-known and so popular they do not want to nerf him so that less people will use him. Another champion that gets no respect at all is Galio. I'm pretty sure people under level 30 probably have never even see one in game. He has a good concept but is never used because he is not the best compared to other top lanners and mid lanners. Riot sees the money in esports and that seems like is all they care about. I wish they would go back to the days where they listened to the community and gave us what we wanted to make things enjoyable. I wish we could have a 100 champion pool instead of a 10 champion one to used in ranked. There will forever be the upperclassmen champions and the lower ones but nothing in the middle. It's either they're used by pros or they're not, no getting around it. So please Riot for once just do what the people want instead of looking at all the money signs, because really where would you be without us by now?","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Jester","date":"2014-12-14T04:39:06.006+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed that they only do their biggest changes after their tournaments. as much as I hate to admit, they have a kind of \"we know best\" attitude that really gets on my nerves at times.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2014-12-15T01:34:00.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"maybe because they do know better.\nIf I was a Rioter i'd only respond to people who are master and above, because they actually understand the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Jester","date":"2014-12-15T16:07:46.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"your right! as an avid gamer, I clearly have no clue what I want from my games.

They're the ones you pick for objective clearing due to their DPS. \n\nGalio is meant to fight AP, but unless a team is completely full of it, then he won't see a lot of play because against an AD team, you either have a lackluster passive or you can't defend yourself against their damage. \n\nHe's also more of a utility mage due to his AOE slow, speed-up, and shield, as well as his ult being an initiate. This makes him a bit outclassed against other utility mages that arguably will help their team a bit more, like Orianna, Lissandra, or Morg. \n\nThis is coming from someone who loves Galio.
