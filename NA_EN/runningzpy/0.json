I love the idea for it, I just think it's a bit flawed.\n\nMy biggest complaint for the snowday one seems to be fixed, that was that I got what seemed like completely random champions. One in particular was a skin for Ashe, whom I never play, nor do I play any champions even remotely close to her. But that's all fixed this time around, I got all champions that I actively play.\n\nAnother big complaint I've seen around is that more often than not, we already have a skin for the champion that we've received a sale for, and it's often a 'downgrade' to the skin we've got. For example, this time around I got Veigar Greybeard as one of my sales, I already own two skins for Veigar, and one of those skins is a legendary. Why would I buy a third skin for a champion when I've already got a legendary for them? I think you guys should change it so you can't get a sale for a skin that's cheaper than a skin you already have for that champion. That way you're never getting a sale for a 'downgraded' skin.\n\nAaaaaaaand that's about it from me. Hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"DontHassleDaHoff","date":"2016-01-29T05:37:37.694+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely appreciate the feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"MAGA MAN X 2020","date":"2016-01-29T10:49:36.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sort of in the same boat. You guys have done a great job at targeting me with skins I'd actually buy (I bought 2 skins on both sales).

I brought this up to Ghostcrawler on twitter once, and maybe you can toss it out to the team, but I really wish skin select UI had a 'Random' option.

For some champions, I own quite a few skins. I'd love a way to just get one randomly and go \"Hey cool, I love this skin\" instead of being forced to choose between multiple great skins (Thresh with Blood Moon or Championship, Shvyana where I own Darkflame, Championship, and Ice Drake that all have unique animations/dragon forms, etc).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cronovey","date":"2016-02-01T21:35:01.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with that is that, for example in this sale, I got Warlord Shen as a sale choice. I already own Blood Moon Shen and TPA Shen, but I was actually very happy to see another skin that I really like come up, especially as a 70% discounted skin. Most people would probably stick to TPA Shen (it has great sound effects, and got even better after the update) because of the slightly higher rarity of the skin (for example, I have Redeemed Riven but I'd never use it over Championship Riven) but some skins are cheaper or \"lower quality\" but have other things that are more fun.\n\nI also own Spirit Guard Udyr, which is his ultimate skin, but got Definitely Not Udyr as one of my skin sales as well. I'm not upset over this; I think it's a great skin with some really funny stances and animations, and I'll probably end up buying it to be honest!\n\nJust take it with a grain of salt; it's one thing to compare something like Greybeard Veigar with Final Boss Veigar; there's a clear difference in quality and Greybeard doesn't really bring anything unique; it's like getting Shamrock Malphite as your skin sale when you already own Glacial or Obsidian, which are both better looking in general and also have different spell effects. Sometimes overlapping skins is cool, like in the case or Udyr or Shen who have very different looks to them and unique effects, and sometimes it's pointless because of silly old recolors from the days of old.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cronovey","date":"2016-02-01T21:29:15.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely glad to see the answer when I did a quick search on Google, because I was planning on buying Battle Regalia Poppy when I saw her in my sale, only to check back after payday and find the Scarlet Hammer Poppy instead.
