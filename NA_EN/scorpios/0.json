I mean I want try some different champions so I'm going to play ARAM. Usually get these guys: {{champion:78}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:19}} Also sometimes the team is not very good. For example in your team you don't have any adc but the other team have 3 adc that is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T02:55:56.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM stands for All **Random** All Mid.

Because everyone would hit \"random\" and then everyone would go mid.\n\nWhether or not ARAM should have all champs enabled is a separate discussion, and the name of the mode has little relevance to that discussion. Hell, Summoner's Rift is still called Summoner's Rift despite summoners being removed from the lore years ago.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
