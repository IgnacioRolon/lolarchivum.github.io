I saw others playing him as a tank, but never did I try that out. \n\nI simply played him, making a build worthy of any ADC, and have continued doing so, four seasons later. \nThis patch, has absolutely crushed me, due to the NERF, (not buff) of his ult, and damage ratios. \nPlease check Match History, of the user lohith0205, (my username) to see the differences yourself. \nThe waves are the same slow speed, and the damage doesnt really do anything late game. Building AP in a match where there are usually Mag. Res. Champs is suicide. Hence it is currently unplayable. \n\nI hope the staff checks this out, because I would love to play my favorite Champion, and ride the wins to atleast Gold, in season five. \n\nThank you,\nlohith0205","replies":[]},{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2014-10-14T18:35:36.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Global laugh pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"oh you wanna die","date":"2014-10-14T04:41:46.339+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":15,"body":"because riots the only game company known to man that fucks up more on a patch by patch basis then they actually fix?","replies":[{"poster":"GROMMI","date":"2014-10-14T19:22:12.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the point of this?\n\nIf you can't contribute anything, don't respond.
