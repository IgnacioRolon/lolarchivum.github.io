Mordekaiser was shields and more importantly ghosts. His new kit is all fine... BUT WHY REMOVE THE GHOST FROM THE R? Like, his EXACT same reworked kit  would be fine but have him return from the Shadow Realm with the enemy's ghost and his stats. You know, that's the way it works now. \nInstead of completely changing Morde, it would have been pretty similar but now he'd be able to duel an enemy without getting kited to death and no one would complain","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-05-30T16:32:01.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no hes metal ghosts isnt any champions thing its the shaddow isle's thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2019-05-30T01:06:52.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every new champion added to the game was a new ghost that would be needed worked on.  As much as I loved the ghosts too I fully support letting them go to free up labor.  Besides, it looks like he no longer has health costs so that makes me hype to see just how strong his early game is now that his power isnt tied up in his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-05-30T00:56:31.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The ghosts were honestly a gimmick in his kit, and little more. They made up for the fact that his kit was pretty bad on it's own. I'm glad they removed the ghosts and made him more independently sufficient.","replies":[]}]}
