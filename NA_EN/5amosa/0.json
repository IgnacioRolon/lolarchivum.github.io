We wait 20 minutes and then get into champ select and then the client just decided to close randomly. According to my friends it just said i had disconnected from chat so i tried reopening but it just took me to homepage. My friend has to wait another 20 minutes for no reason and I got a dodge because the OLD client crashed. If it was the beta client i would understand but this is the old one and it's just dumb that it crashes this way.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T17:24:08.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like either your connection could be unstable so it's disconnecting from champion select, or you have a third party like play.tv running.  I recommend removing any third parties that interact with league just in case as they've been known to crash.  \n\nOtherwise, run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help fix this up.  Test it out in a custom game as well to prevent any further penalties.  It does suck that ya'll got back to back waiting periods, and while we can't remove them I hope those steps can help prevent future occurrences.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
