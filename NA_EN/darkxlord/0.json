It's a stale lane right? Not necessarily. The reason I bring this example up is that I have a very conservative play style in mid if it looks risky (i.e. against a jungler with good ganks, heavy kill pressure mid, roaming top, etc.) and so very few kills and deaths happen in my lane if I'm left to my own devices. On the other hand, even if I don't get super big or anything, neither does their laner. If they push in to try to take tower or set up a roam, I'll clear wave quicker than they can say it's worth it to leave. Placing the threat of pressure on their turret to discourage roaming makes it so they won't be getting kills either. \n\nI'll end games having done my job of keeping their major kill threat weakened very well with not many kills but few deaths and a good number of assists, but I'll be received with comments on my \"sub-par\" play in the ending screen just because I didn't get a ton of kills.\n\nThe mentality in League is that the more kills a player has, the less their number of deaths matters so long as it is less than their kills and that the team with the most kills did the most in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2016-04-11T21:24:30.565+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're telling me league isn't the 1v9 singleplayer experience I've thought it was?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rieshkhan","date":"2016-04-11T21:10:30.114+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with you on this, and the way Riot has it setup with the mastery system helps enforce this.

Lower level means just 30-50 less base damage/shield/heal on some skill, or slightly higher cooldown. But as a support I love having short death timers.\nThe real problem is gold difference. While carries finish their last item, you barely have 2.5+boots. THAT is the real problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkxLord","date":"2016-04-11T18:31:10.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said this before, but it may have gotten lost in the walls of text. here is the TLDR of this thread.\n\n\"That's the point of this thread, me being consistent every game matters more if I'm not playing the support role.\"","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-04-11T19:05:04.062+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shame most people are ignorant & impatient; I agree though playing support just sucks, behind in levels & items when the meta is high mobility & burst.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dataless","date":"2016-04-11T19:35:32.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"People who complain about being under leveled as support typically don't know how to actually accumulate exp and possibly die too much.

Idk how many times i've made the enemy lane quit or the other team rage at the bot lane for dying so often.  I would say out of all the supports you listed Braum is the only one i see as relevant to climbing but its obviously all personal opinion.  Sona dies instantly from 1 cc, leona is easily countered by a morgana, and naut just doesn't fit bot lane anymore, i've yet to run into any problems with a naut support. Im confused on your argument with being underleveled?  Very rarely should you be 4 levels down unless you are roaming a ton, i rarely have run into this issue.  Just my opinion lol","replies":[]}]}
