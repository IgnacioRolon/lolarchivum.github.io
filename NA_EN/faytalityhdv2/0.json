So it's toxic because people find enjoyment that the system is working in trying to take down toxic players in a game and getting a notification in doing so!\n\nDon't get me wrong the system isn't perfect, but I don't see what is wrong with this! I would rather play with a community that tries to be a better community than one that is childish into think that it's appropriate to call people racial/homophobic slurs, calling them retards and acting as if this game is something more than that. The sad truth is league isn't going to pay your bills (for the most of us) we are all still human beings and deserves to be respected as such.\n\nYes, there are toxic people in our games, people who troll and intentionally lose. But what's the point in calling hem out? They know what they are doing, and are just trying to get a rise out of you by using the system against you. There is a saying \"don't take the bait\" and it couldn't be more truer than with this game. \nMost trolls in this game knows exactly how the system works and will try to cheat the system, it is your responsibility to not take it. I know it's hard to some, but all you need to do is ignore it. Report these people, but most don't because they think it doesn't solve anything. Which makes no sense. If you don't use your power to report people they will get away with it. Riot isn't some magician that's know when people troll/toxic/cheat. They need our help to catch these people!","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-09-14T09:37:19.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at his thread history.
