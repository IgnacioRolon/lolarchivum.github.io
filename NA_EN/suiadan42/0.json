After a series of (very irritating) uninstalls, reinstalls, and testing of a dozen different games in my steam library, I finally ran across another game which exhibited similar problems. Hit up that support as well (cuz why not, right?) and they had a useful insight:\n\nThis is a bug with recent versions of the AMD video driver.\n\nUntil AMD fix this problem, please revert to the January 2017 driver which is the last of their 16.xx series, from here:\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064\n\nUnfortunately, the drivers there all seem to transparently, without asking, auto-download the latest version, without prompting and without letting me choose 'No, install this ****ing version!!'. This prompted another hour of fiddling, and finally managed to completely uninstall the existing drivers, then make windows figure it out by itself while isolated from the internet, and install some old (15.x vs the current 17.x) drivers instead. After some testing all problems seem to be resolved. This is quite irritating, and hopefully should be fixed... I dislike having to backdate stuff...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-09T04:04:35.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really weird, especially considering that your other games seem to work ok. Double check to make sure all your drivers and Window's settings are updated; after running some of these screen shots by Tech they said the current update for AMD was at 17.62, so that might be different from what you're at. You should also run through LoL's troubleshooting for DirectX related issues [**over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq3).\n\nOnce you've finished with both of those steps, or if you've already tried them, if you're still encountering that trouble you should hit up Tech Support [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and show them this too. They can give this a more in depth look one on one with you, and if either of us have overlooked anything, we're certain they'll find it and get you back in game. ^^","replies":[]}]}
