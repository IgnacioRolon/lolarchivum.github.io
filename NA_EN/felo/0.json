I've been playing a lot of mid lately i love it, just being able to have the chance for the 1v1 kills and playing Zed and destroying someone in lane feels great. But i also thought about Jungle and Support, I like roaming and providing vision for my team. One reason i don't really want to play support is because I want to have that chance to make crazy plays (Kill wise, Yes i know supports can make crazy plays too). I thought about jungle too, I love jungle, being able to roam/gank the whole game and deny/provide vision is great. Top lane just is not my thing I don't like being a huge tank i want to be able to make crazy plays. So it really comes down to Mid or Jungle.\r\n\r\nAnything to help me decide?\r\n\r\nJungle Champs I Enjoy:\r\n{{champion:421}} \r\n{{champion:2}} \r\n{{champion:64}} \r\n{{champion:254}} \r\n{{champion:54}} \r\n\r\nMid Laners I Enjoy:\r\n{{champion:103}} \r\n{{champion:112}} \r\n{{champion:101}} \r\n{{champion:7}} \r\n{{champion:238}} \r\n{{champion:6}}  (Tried After Keane Played It)\r\n{{champion:127}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2015-03-25T03:19:27.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get kills as support.

The best players, even though they have one role they try to master, are able to proficiently play every role in the game.  Your main role should be the role you prefer playing, and would love to play if you could only play one role from now until the end of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TranslationZ","date":"2015-03-23T21:43:42.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to be able to help your teammates win lanes, get objectives, and usually be the front-line of a teamfight you should pick jungle. If you're good at winning lane, snowballing, carrying LATEGAME you should try top. If you are good at winning lane, roaming other lanes, snowballing pick mid. If you like giving your team a huge buff at securing objectives/kills pick support. If you like getting most of the kills, being the back-line damage dealer, you're good at position, pick ADC. \n\nHonestly, in my opinion I think mid/jungle has the most influence on games with support coming in as 3rd. Mid can snowball his lane  while helping other lanes win theirs, jungle can win all 3 lanes if hes good, get most objectives, and snowball. I like support also because a good support will always be aware of dragon, ganks, letting his team push lanes safely, and getting his WHOLE team fed vs a bad support who lets their teammates die, don't have any kill constribution, and don't have important objectives warded.","replies":[]}]}
