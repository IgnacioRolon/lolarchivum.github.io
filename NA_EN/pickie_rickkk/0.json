To me, this is on the line of racial slurs. Why? Because \"monkey\" has been used as a racial slur against black people. Some people try to say it's because they're unevolved as a person and are primitive, but that's also the same root cause as to why racists called black people monkeys. The racists believed blacks were unevolved and primitive compared to them. Even though on the face it's marginally different as an insult, the root of the insult is actually the same. \n\n\"Stay 1-4\" I would say this is less likely to be trash talk due to the addition of \"ape\" afterwards. If it was something like \"Stay 1-4, at least if you get assists on my kills, I'll have the gold to be a hypercarry.\"  That's marginally better, but I still don't think it's a good thing to say because it's mean spirited particularly towards your own teammates. Why would you want to be mean to your teammates? Why not encourage them to contribute to team fights rather than be a pixel on the screen? \n\nTrash talking your own teammates just feels really self defeating to me. All you're doing is sabotaging teamwork in a game that thrives on teamwork.\n\n>this fucking team is so fucking incredibly bad holy fuck\n\nThis isn't trash talking, it's just an insult to the team. It's an expression of frustration and an outburst from the person that can't handle adversity well. Shit happens, you should learn to adapt to overcome the obstacle, not sit there and insult people. \n\nAgain, this is just sabotaging teamwork in a game that thrives on teamwork and is ultimately self defeating.\n\n>listen to fucking pings you stupdi as fuck inbred retards\n\nTo me, this isn't trash talking either. The person is upset that people aren't listening to pings and insulting them by calling them \"stupdi as fuck inbred retards.\" If the person said something like \"pings aren't just eye and ear candy, I'm trying to tell you something quickly.\" Although there is sarcasm in \"pings aren't just eye and ear candy\" it's addressing the fact that the teammates are ignoring pings or are misunderstanding pings ie focused on the skill in the game and awareness in the game. Although this could be further taken an insult to someone's awareness or intelligence because of how they act in the game, but because it's about their skill in the game, I would consider that trash talking because the main focus is on the game and the skill involved in the game while the quote above focused on insulting someone. You don't have to take any steps in the quote to go from what is said to being an insult. It's just outright an insult.\n\nAgain, like the previous examples, it's self sabotage and self defeating because this game is about people working together to beat an opposing team of people working together.\n\nThe strategy of \"divide and conquer\" isn't an old one. If you can cause a rift in your enemy's forces, then you can conquer them easier. If you trash talk your own team, you are dividing your own team and letting your enemy conquer you easier. Many psychologists say long term negative reinforcement does not work and that positive reinforcement is the better long term solution. They say negative reinforcement is good at stopping bad behavior but positive reinforcement is good for continuing good behavior. \n\nSo rather than trash talk my teammates for doing something bad and never saying anything good to them, like how this chat log reads, why not just say \"I tried to warn you with my pings and you died because you ignored them\" as your negative reinforcement and then when they do listen say something like \"great call on not engaging there.\" This way you have a minor uncomfortable interaction because you are addressing something bad a person did publicly and it's public shaming (since it wasn't through a PM that they and only they saw and the rest of the team did), but then you are offering positive rewards through encouragement and compliments afterwards on behavior you like seeing in your teammates.\n\nNow, granted I don't know if the team ever did anything that would warrant encouragement and compliments so I don't know if the chat log is skewed in the all negative direction because of the person typing or because of what happened in the game (or more specifically things that could get complimented didn't happen in the game so there is nothing to compliment), but that's just my take on trash talking and its effects on your teammates when you trash talk your ally rather than trash talk your enemy.\n\nThis is just my personal interpretation of what trash talking is. You are free to disagree with how I view trash talking and also my opinion on its effects on your own teammates when one trash talks one's own teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"P3rspective","date":"2018-03-27T16:44:32.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YerroFever,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jXHEJgwj,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-27T16:41:24.819+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t know about what kind of competitive environment you are used to but I played team sports and trash talk usually involves witty or clever remarks that are insults to an opponent&#x27;s level of skill or an over the top boast about their own skill. \n> \n> It&#x27;s not calling someone a racial slur, it&#x27;s not calling someone a homophobic slur, it&#x27;s not telling someone to kill themselves, it&#x27;s not calling them a retard, etc...
