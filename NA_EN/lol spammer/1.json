The ult timers is a pie style timer, and people have requested a time style or (Minute.Seconds) style. On top of this, the pie timers are so small and unreadable just like most things in the new HUD\n\n2. The players wanted summoner CD's to be next to or adjacent to the ult timers for maximum efficiency. Riot stated that they moved death timers to the passive screen (Screen when playing) to negate having to press tab, but players will be just as often pressing tab because of the summoners cooldowns in that section. On top of this, the CD's are barely readable and literally the size of 10 pixels(for most monitors).\n\n3. This addition was great, nothing to complain about here honestly it is perfect.
