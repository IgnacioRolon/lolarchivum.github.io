Norms is supposed to cater for more fun and relaxed games, ranked is for people trying to win. That's literally the only difference in attitude / gameplay between the two.\n\nEvery person I know who doesn't play ranked chooses not to because they aren't interested in playing competitively. The idea that someone doesn't like ranked, presumably because it's too competitive for them, and so chooses to play norms, but then expects everyone else to be competitive is nonsensical.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-10-21T18:50:01.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they want to take it seriously but not *too* seriously.

It's not that hard to be polite, even when openly disagreeing with someone for their choices. They are free to do so, but it would be demanded that they do it in a proper manner.\n\nAlso, I would get upset if the off-meta playing around turns to be basically a throw, and a defeat as a result.
