I wanted to start playing again and i checked all my champs to see if everything was fine but the skin was gone. I checked the RP purchase history and it was empty, which makes makes no sense because i also bought other skins with RP and they are still active. I just wanna know why i no longer have my skin and why it didn't even refund my RP points?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T22:26:56.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like someone refunded that skin awhile back and the RP was returned to your account. If you know you weren't the one who did that refund, I'd really urge you to change your password, possibly your email password as well, and hit up our account recovery agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaNori","date":"2017-10-25T23:56:04.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at my gifting history and saw that it indicated that i gifted a champion and skin to a player called dreamdxc on 8/4/17.  However, I did not do this, so it appears this player hacked into my account. Please correct this and return my RP points to my account. I have already changed my password and I will submit a ticket to the account recovery agents with this information. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-26T00:06:54.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I mentioned in the first reply, you'll need to get that done in your ticket where they can verify you as the account creator. We can't do this on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaNori","date":"2017-10-26T00:20:59.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your help, I truly do appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
