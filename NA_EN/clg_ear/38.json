It requires critical thinking, attention, and patience. \r\n\r\nWith GPS Navigation so prevalent, all people want to do is let their GPS Navigation device do the thinking for them and tell them when and where to do. \r\n\r\nNo thought, no attention; just listen to the computer that will tell you where to go. Your navigation told you to turn right even though turning right puts you into a 60 foot freefall into a canyon? That thing knows better than I do let me turn right :) \r\n\r\nAs an employee working the Front Desk of a Resort, I often have to give guests directions to our property. I have taken every single route to our property so many times that I could write a guide down to the kilometer which directions to take; but no one cares. Everyone just wants me to give them the address so they can put it into their GPS navigation so it can do the thinking for them. The worst part is after 10 pm, where the gate that the GPS will send people, is closed. When I work overnights, I also constantly get calls from people whose GPS brought them to the normal gate that is no longer open because they didn't plan correctly and got here after 10 pm. When I try to explain as simple and down to the letter as I can how to get to the 24 Hour gate, people just want me to give them a physical address for the 24 hour entrance so they can put it in their GPS; so a computer can tell them where to go and how to think.\r\n\r\nI don't like it. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EwcL3SW.png[]","replies":[]}
