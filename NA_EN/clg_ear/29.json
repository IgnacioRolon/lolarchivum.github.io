Before these changes, General Discussion was more like General Discussion where any topic was okay to post and discuss. Now, we are severely limited in what we can post. It boils down to league of legends, anime, and maybe tv shows or movies. I feel a lot of the fun has been taken away since this board is no longer &quot;the wild west&quot; as Riot originally named it. And I expect the forums will further decline in quality when we&#039;re all lumped together under this &quot;all chat&quot; thing. \r\n\r\nDo you still enjoy posting on the forums?","replies":[]}
