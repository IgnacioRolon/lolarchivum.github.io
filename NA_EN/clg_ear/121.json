This time he made an ironic post about the enemy team not acknowledging that his ashe was just as cancerous as the singed, soraka, and yasuo that played worse. I didn&#039;t get the irony and thought he was complaining that they didn&#039;t recognize he had pwned them, so I thought he was being a dick. \r\n\r\nthen he blacklisted me \r\n\r\nOur relationship has been a tumultuous one. Either I do something, I say something, or he says something that we don&#039;t agree with; and he ends up blacklisting me even though I want to still be friends. I guess it was never meant to be, even though I like the guy. \r\n\r\nHe has since deleted the thread in question, but the wounds my soul has suffered still remain.","replies":[]}
