Her ultimate is useless late game, which is the direction Riot Games is intending most games to lead to. Her E only scales with AP, and the enemy has to stand in it for the full duration for it to be effective, and she has no real escape mechanism. She only has increased movement speed with Strut, and if she's attacked, Strut goes away. \r\n\r\nCan we buff this champion, or rework her? \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/9W6yAFi","replies":[]}
