Her side boobs got nerfed but who cares? \r\n\r\n{{champion:34}} 0/10 - is an ice bird thing \r\n\r\n{{champion:1}}  0/10 - is a little girl\r\n\r\n{{champion:22}} 6/10 - bland personality. Voice is annoying as well \r\n\r\n{{champion:51}} 8/10 - hot accent, attractive, but bad dancer\r\n\r\n{{champion:69}} 1/10 - is a snake monster. Upper half is okay, apart from the eyes and the forked tongue and that weird helmet thing. Maybe its not ok.\r\n\r\n{{champion:131}} 5/10 - has some weird moon glowing tat on her forehead and no pupils. &lt;_&lt;\r\n\r\n{{champion:60}} 5/10 - is a spider monster, but still attractive somewhat \r\n\r\n{{champion:28}} 6/10 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQlZweKNBjo\r\n\r\n{{champion:114}} 9/10 - would&#039;ve given her a 10/10 but since riot changed her face to make her look older and uglier than her old splash art, had to deduct a point. Athletic, strong hips, hot accent, nice hair. Still hot. \r\n\r\n{{champion:39}} 8/10 - has a nice body and personality, but is undead\r\n\r\n{{champion:40}} 6/10 - has probably blown every guy in league of legends and dresses like a stripper. Some wouldn&#039;t have much issue with the latter, but I find it off-putting \r\n\r\n{{champion:222}} 6/10 - is insane and pale, but still kinda attractive \r\n\r\n{{champion:429}} 0/10 - is a ghost monster with multiple personality disorder\r\n\r\n{{champion:43}} 5/10 - idk\r\n\r\n{{champion:55}} 7/10 - is a murderous assassin and has an unsightly scar across her face, but is still attractive and would probably be amazing in bed. \r\n\r\n{{champion:10}} 4/10 religious zealot\r\n\r\n{{champion:203}} 0/10 - i don&#039;t know wtf this thing even is\r\n\r\n{{champion:7}} 10/10 - stunning, beautiful, and can split into two for a threesome if you&#039;re in the mood. \r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} 10/10 - probably the only league of legends girl that would be suitable for marriage in real life. Strong, but not femnazi strong, will defend you if you get in a bar fight or something, redhead, and not a slut. \r\n\r\n{{champion:127}} 1/10 - is a blind ice witch thing \r\n\r\n{{champion:117}} 0/10 - is some baby alien thing \r\n\r\n{{champion:99}} 7/10 - reminds me of a glee club president, and her laugh would probably get irritating. Is still attractive. \r\n\r\n{{champion:21}} 8/10 - has nice body, but is probably a slut like Janna. \r\n\r\n{{champion:25}} 6/10 - has elf ears, giant wings, and no pupils. Keeps ranting about revenge or something. obviously won&#039;t let you forget about something you&#039;ve done wrong. \r\n\r\n{{champion:267}} 1/10 - is a fish mutant mermaid thing with some weird helmet. \r\n\r\n{{champion:76}}  1/10 - tree hugger furry\r\n\r\n{{champion:61}} 1/10 - is a robot. Rick Deckard from Blader Runner had sex with one, so she gets a point for the possibility. \r\n\r\n{{champion:78}} 0/10 - is some angry alien midget with a hammer \r\n\r\n{{champion:133}} 6/10 - more focused on her work than anything, but has a nice body\r\n\r\n{{champion:92}}  5/10 - probably a major downer at parties/get-togethers, but is still attractive somewhat. Also screams and grunts a lot. \r\n\r\n{{champion:113}} 6/10 - dominatrix \r\n\r\n{{champion:102}} 0/10 - is a dragon monster thing \r\n\r\n{{champion:15}} 6/10 - grunts too much and will probably throw things at you if you make her mad\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} 10/10 - great body, hair, eyes, complexion, can play music during parties or when you&#039;re both alone to set the mood, no grating/annoying voice.\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} 0/10 - is a goat thing with too many tat&#039;s\r\n\r\n{{champion:134}} 6/10 - obsessed with power and has weird helmet with glowing purple eyes, but has nice thighs\r\n\r\n{{champion:18}} 0/10 - is a midget alien thing \r\n\r\n{{champion:67}} 5/10 - more focused on her job \r\n\r\n{{champion:254}} 9/10 - strong, loyal, and has a nice body, but her haircut is stupid and she tattoo&#039;d her name on her face so might not have a lot of intelligence\r\n\r\n{{champion:143}} 0/10 - is a plant monster.","replies":[]}
