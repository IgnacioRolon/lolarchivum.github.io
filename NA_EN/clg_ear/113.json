I watched an interview with him and he was pissed about the team&#039;s overall play and the fact that Huni refuses to play meta champions and picks retarded shit; then in the semis Huni picks retarded shit yet again costing them the finals. Yeah Huni has done well on Riven top before, but they weren&#039;t going against some random bottom tier team, this was Cloud 9 and Huni was going up against Impact, a top tier top laner and world champ. I don&#039;t think that was the time to bust out the kennen top just to get killed over and over, or the Riven with her Lucian top flank just to get killed in 1 second. Now they have to run the gauntlet to have a chance at worlds, but I don&#039;t even want them to go to Worlds if they&#039;re going to continue to play like that.","replies":[]}
