I tried restarting my router and when that didn't work I tried to restart the client. When I logged into the client there wasn't an option to rejoin the game and when I look at op.gg the game clock is still ticking. Does anyone know if this is a bug or how I can solve this issue, should it happen again? Does this count as me leaving this game? It was the last of my provisionals, so I'm pretty tilted.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T03:17:00.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh looks like you encountered one of those random game crashes. It doesn't happen too often, and it happens server side so there's not much that can be done on your end. No worries, you won't be hit with any penalties, since it's as if the game never took place!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eithusela","date":"2017-08-27T18:54:53.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here.","replies":[]}]}
