Have you reset your computer recently? Have you tried unplugging/disconnecting both the keyboard and mouse and then reconnecting them? Are they running low on batteries? You might also want to try repairing your client; I had keyboard issues for quite a long time and I fixed it by repairing my client.","replies":[{"poster":"ROBOTKUBO","date":"2016-12-24T03:08:35.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean repair my client?","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-12-24T06:02:14.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you initially open your client, there should be a gear icon in the corner of your client. Click on it, and there should be a tab titled: \"Initiate full repair.\" Click on it, and your client will be \"repaired\", and any possible corrupted files will be overwritten with fresh new files. However, this is almost like installing the game from scratch, so it might take a while to complete. However, if you believe this is going to solve this issue, you should try it out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
