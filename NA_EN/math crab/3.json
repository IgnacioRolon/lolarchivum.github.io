Whenever you see no CC or very little CC on an enemy team that's the time to go Yi, Kat, Vayne etc....\n\nThey aren't OP just they are being played into an obvious weakness.  Before you say \"Well CC stops everyone so its not a counter.\"  Some champs thrive in a low CC environment. \n\nNasus or Veigar are examples are champs where your team does need to work together to stop.  They are weak early and powerful late.... you can either delay them or win quickly... choosing to do neither is not the champ being OP its your team not realizing that certain champs cannot be left alone too long.","replies":[{"poster":"FrickendaChicken","date":"2016-02-01T05:08:42.258+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"This man needs more upvotes.
