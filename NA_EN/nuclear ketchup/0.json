(keep in mind they will still be able to play normals)\nIf a user plays some agreed number  of games (maybe 10-20 ranked games w/o leaving) then their punishment should go back down to that of a first offender.\n\nA fix to the report system is needed too.

But it very quickly becomes much more complicated.  Is it worth trading kills?  Or letting the enemy team take a dragon if you get one of their towers?  Should a support sacrifice themselves to save a teammate?  Should you give up CS to harass the enemy and maybe set up a kill?  How do you weigh objectives versus kills versus CS?\n\nEven if you have answers for some of those, the problem is that once you start rating people not just on whether they win or lose but *how* they win or lose, you **will** change how people play.  Now, if you had a super-accurate rating system that could tease out individual contributions while being very hard to game, would it be a good thing?  Maybe.  But you'd need a much more detailed proposal than just \"Riot should decide who did good and promote them\".\n\nAs much as people whine about the vagaries of the current Ranked solo queue implementation, it is in some sense \"optimal\" with large enough sample sizes.
