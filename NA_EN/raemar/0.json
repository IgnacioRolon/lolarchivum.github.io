I can tell the game's still running because friends tell me I continue to load, and once the game starts I can hear the audio like usual, but I'm completely stuck on a black screen. It won't even let me tab out to close the client and restart, the only thing I seem to be able to do to get out of it when I realize this is happening is to just completely restart my computer, which typically results in a remake.\n\nAll of this happens fairly rarely - like in one out of every ten to twenty games. I have no idea what's causing it though and no way to really check anything when it happens since as I said it pretty much completely locks up my display, won't let me tab out or anything. The rest of the time I can play just fine.\n\nCan anyone help me with this? A quick search only seems to turn up cases of people just not loading altogether, but the game's obviously still going for me, just with a black screen for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T18:18:39.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you were able to establish a connection to the game server, but there's some kind of hardware or driver failure failing to render the game itself.
