Ive fully reformed myself from my toxic ways, so I'm not worried about being reported for that anymore, but I occasionally encountered an attempting to reconnect issue, where my game would freeze, yet I could watch everything go on around me, sometimes it fixes itself, but other times I have to disconnect and reconnect and this could take within a few seconds to a minute. Is there a fix for this, because I do not want to be banned for this issue, I want to get my account back to clean status, so I'm kind of scared of getting punished for this attempting to reconnect issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T22:35:25.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system won't impact your standing with the Instant Feedback System.  You're more likely to get a lower priority queue than a suspension for it.  I recommend sticking to custom games for now, and go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot whatever is causing your network to loss comms with the game server.

I shouldn't have that many disconnects from now on but if I do that's good to know that it wont get my account permabanned, if I have any more questions ill probably send a ticket! Seems to be random whenever the issue appears but if it becomes more frequent ill send a ticket, thanks for the information!","replies":[]}]}]}
