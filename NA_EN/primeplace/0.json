Drivers up to date.\r\n\r\nAfter install the program opens with the league of legends icon in the middle of the screen with the load bar beneath it, makes it about 3/4 of the bar then closes.

By far the most common is that League is not configured to run with proper system permissions. Since League accessing a number of files and software packages outside the League install, it needs certain administrative privileges in order to run properly. As a first step, I recommend ensuring League has these privileges by working through our [permissions guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\nLet me know if this issue persists.","replies":[{"poster":"PrimePlace","date":"2016-09-12T23:23:58.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still no luck.

If you have a firewall or antivirus, it could be preventing League from properly reaching the server, which prevents it from coming up.
