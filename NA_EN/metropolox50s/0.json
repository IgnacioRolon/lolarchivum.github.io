First off when flaming someone it helps relieve your stress and helps know that the person (feeding, getting gank so easily, or not knowing their champion) that they suck plain and simple. Now the cons for this is you look like an asshole, you trigger someone, and you start a flame war. So, what you need to do if you are being flame at is mute flamer (which no one does or they do but says to the flamer &quot;I&#039;m muting you.&quot; which defeats the purpose of don&#039;t respond to the flamer rule). Also, have a adaptive/flexible mind, play smart, and play safe when you are losing lane to at least prevent getting flame on. Also to the person getting flame at try to understand their reason on why they are flaming at you like maybe you need practice more on that champ in Normal match (this confuse me a lot especially to those that play a new champ they aren&#039;t experience at and decides luck will help win their rank game), might want to play safe especially when you are getting camp and getting killed by it, you may also want to farm up if you are behind on kills or have more deaths, and use your pings because if you are losing lane especially in mid lane the enemy champs will roam on to other lanes. At the end of the day this game really doesn&#039;t reward much and if it does it just make things worse to flame especially this Promos system where it doesn&#039;t makes sense you get group up with players that aren&#039;t in promos. Why can&#039;t you group up with other promo players who you know will invest and play smart/safe because everyone is in the same boat? They either need to fix that or remove that system.\r\n\r\nLast note, if the person is flaming let them flame/ mute them if you want might as well let them let out their stress and do yourself a favor and play well enough, or learn your mistakes and fix them.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-07-25T19:32:18.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking this thread as per necroing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2017-10-03T05:49:21.855+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol so now the victim is at fault?\nThat's some twisted logic ....","replies":[{"poster":"Metropolox50s","date":"2017-10-03T05:53:45.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"I'm saying if the person is getting flame at they could at least think why they are being flame at. \nAlso you could just mute the flamer like I said.

For example, when you keep getting gank/camp play safe, if you are behind on kda then farm, or when you keep venturing off solo and getting gank so easily then group up when call by someone. You are saying flaming in general shouldn't be allow and does nothing. No I don't believe flaming does nothing but gets through them if they don't listen from the previous advice that were given. If you keep doing the same mistakes over and over you are going to make it hard to play or even fun at that point because of the mistakes you made. \n\nListen all of you are so focus on one side of how bad flaming or toxic if you want to call it that, but you don't want to believe or don't care that there are bad players who keep doing the same mistake over and over without being told to fix it. Flaming is good when necessary. If your coach keeps having to remind you to fix your stance or playstyle that results most of the time losing a game don't you think it gets pretty annoying at that point. Yea you can shrug off tiny mistakes here and there, but if they don't learn from that mistake then what you want me to do don't say anything and keep them doing the same thing for the next matches that will ruin the other teams too. \n\nThis community is toxic of course by many types like flamers, feeders, and intentional bad plays. But is overshadows the other types like i mention bad players who don't learn, doesn't care to listen to the advice given to them (not flaming but just saying like \"Our situation is bad we should play safe right now.\"), or the ones that keep making the same mistakes over and over. \n\nWe need to have a balance of sportmanship and tough criticism (when necessary), because what I'm seeing with all the anti-toxic/flamers going on isn't helping the community become less toxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Metropolox50s","date":"2017-10-04T04:12:36.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I may need to be more specific on difference between good and bad flame.
