Between his poke range on his Q and the pull of his E he can be really scary to duel. To make matters worse, even if you try to burst him down, he can use his W to tank your burst until he kills you. However, the biggest thing I think that makes him the most difficult to deal with his passive Darkness Rise; the sustained damage gets very scary after Mordekaiser builds some AP and does craptons of damage overtime, also the circle size is huge so avoiding it is very difficult.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**I like how Mordekaiser is currently, but in the pursuit of making him easier to fight without heavily nerfing him numerically, I have a few ideas to make him more manageable to fight:**\r\n\r\n*** Change his passive - _Darkness Rise_ so the damage circle starts in a smaller radius around Mordkaiser but expands over time**, like over 2 seconds, until it reaches its current full size. Similar to how Anivia's ultimate works. This shrink his area of denial for melee champions but would still be dangerous in longer fights. \r\n*** Have his W's shield scaling to changed to have a base value increased by level that scales off bonus hp only**, this would force Mordkaiser players to either build partially tanky if they want the W to block a ton.  The base value would be much lower than it is currently but with a stronger bonus hp ratio that rewards tanky builds.\r\n***Reduce the base damage (not the ratios though) of his Q but increase the damage multiplier if he hits a single target**, weaker poke unless he builds damage or aims well.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-23T13:24:50.208+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"those are straight nerfs what are you talking about","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-06-23T14:04:40.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xQ6XG9vW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-23T13:24:50.208+0000)\n>\n> those are straight nerfs what are you talking about\n\nIf people want his passive nerfed, then fine. Buff his HP scaling, Healing from shield late game, and make the ultimate stats increase per rank of R. That and maybe give him some health ratios on Q and E if we cant add any AD ratios.","replies":[{"poster":"MalignMetal","date":"2019-06-23T16:42:02.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. These cry babies need to learn to adapt.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-06-23T19:10:38.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MalignMetal,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xQ6XG9vW,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-06-23T16:42:02.913+0000)\n>\n> No. These cry babies need to learn to adapt.\n\nSure, but I do feel like he's lacking the strength a typical juggernaut has for late game.
