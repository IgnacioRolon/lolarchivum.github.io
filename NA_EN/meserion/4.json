Unfortunately, balancing anything AD in this game is akin to balancing cards on top of each other to make a house; you fix one thing only to have the rest fall apart. This to me, says that AD is flawed itself, but I&#039;m not going to air my grievances about it here; I&#039;m going to focus on making Lethality as good stat that is built for Assassins, but not abused by everyone else.\r\n\r\nAt its core Lethality is a good idea, an Assassin-centric stat that focus on the strong point of the game for Assassins: early game, but in execution is too strong for any AD-based champion. This coupled with the fact that AD Assassins have the issue of_ always_ doing massive damage, means that Lethality has become a cancerous mess of a stat that has warped the entire meta of the game around it.\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is both simple but fairly involved: Lethality would now grant a 1% per point bonus damage as true damage, based on off abilities and basic attacks, whenever you strike a target made _VULNERABLE_ by certain champion mechanics you triggered by your champion. With 60 Lethality and 200 AD you&#039;d see a champion deal an additional 120 true damage if the target is _VULNERABLE_. \r\n\r\nTo make a target _VULNERABLE_ require you to hit an enemy with certain abilities, and only Assassins could make a target _VULNERABLE_, making it useless for non-Assassins. For example:\r\n\r\n{{champion:84}} applies her Q to her target, making them _VULNERABLE_ for 3 seconds, the target takes greatly increased damage during that 3 second window, but afterward they revert to normal. \r\n\r\n_With {{champion:84}} mentioned, I would like to say that with the proposed changes, their would be an introduction of AP-centric Lethality items added to allow for AP Assassins to leverage the mechanic as well. Because of AP scaling, they would have lower max Lethality levels, but the damage would definitely still be there.\r\n_\r\n\r\n\r\nIts important that the _VULNERABLE_ window remains fairly short, with 3 seconds being about as long as it should get. Some champions might also have multiple ways to make a target _VULNERABLE_. For example:\r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} can make a target vulnerable for 1 second if he hit them with an attack from his Living Shadow OR he can apply it from his Ultimate, Death Mark for 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n**Another example of this:**\r\n\r\n{{champion:107}} can make his target _VULNERABLE_ whenever he applies his E successfully to the target for 1.75 seconds, from attacking a target with his Ultimate active for 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts important to note that ONLY Assassins would have this ability and the _VULNERABLE_ would be unique for each Assassin. With this in mind, the baseline damage of Assassins (mostly the AD Assassins) would take a slight nerf to the point where they should do damage as though they&#039;re a fighter like {{champion:19}} or {{champion:114}}; the damage is there but you won&#039;t get wrecked by it in 2 seconds flat. Only when the _VULNERABLE_ damage window is active would these champions have their damage catapulted to deletion levels of damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?

The burst window is about striking at the right time and captilizing on that time to deal massive damage, not just jump out of the bushes and kill someone in less than 1 second. Again, thats the ADCs job...","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-19T05:39:01.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not landing an ability would mean an item you have automatically becomes less efficient , that is a double whammy coz you already fcked up by missing that spell but now even your items are telling you to go fck yourself because you missed said ability","replies":[{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2017-02-19T05:43:49.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MaeDoSan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HUnELA4L,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-19T05:39:01.591+0000)\n>\n> Not landing an ability would mean an item you have automatically becomes less efficient , that is a double whammy coz you already fcked up by missing that spell but now even your items are telling you to go fck yourself because you missed said ability\n\nWelcome to the world of playing a mage, {{champion:45}} and {{champion:103}} and {{champion:115}} and {{champion:134}} ALL SAY HI!

I'm proposing a burst window for high damage and then period where they do 'normal' damage of that of a fighter. Their resting damage will be lower because they should not be hitting as hard as an ADC 24/7. Instead their high damage is tied to making a target _VULNERABLE_ from a well timed ability.","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-19T06:08:46.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will that ability be a skill shot ?

This results in Assassins being a very toxic classification of champions which is also why the tank meta is resurgent. \n\nI see Lethality as an answer to a persistent problem every-time they make changes to benefit Assassins or say Juggernauts, making their damage reliant on a specific stat that only they can harness we prevent the issue of tanky Assassins but also make them less toxic to fight, more skill-reliant and simultaneously more rewarding when you succeed. The whole point of the post is to propose that very idea, so read before you blindly respond after only reading the \"cliff notes\".","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-19T06:57:43.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you get that what that what you are trying to do Riot can easily do with their kits instead of relying on items.
