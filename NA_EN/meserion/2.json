It was the fact that it was a focus on _conditional_ power, which previously had nothing to do with Skarners kit (objective control?  Really?  If I was going for objective control I would pick Nunu, the king of objective control, why in the bloody hell would I ever pick _Skarner_ for objective control?  Note that I am referring to this from a stance of pre-rework Skarner players, as pre-rework Skarner really had nothing to do with objective control, at least not anything more than any other average run-of-the-mill jungler did).\n\nSo what happens?  Riot **misinterprets** the feedback and thinks that players are saying that Skarner is too weak (which wasn't really the case) and _massively _ buffs Skarner across the board (while missing the entire picture), with fairly incredible number buffs to just about everything in his kit, _all while keeping the conditional power at exactly the same ratio_.  So Skarner initially on the PBE was relatively slightly underpar _outside_ of his conditional zones, and while _inside_ his conditional zones he was very strong, borderline overbearing.  After the buffs he was _very_ strong _outside_ of his conditional zones, and _completely broken_ while _inside_ of them.  This is because Riot didn't make his conditional zones weaker while making him stronger outside of them, no, what they did was both make him stronger outside of his zones and massively stronger inside of them.\n\nRiot then _rushed_ the patch to live without really giving anybody a significant chance to test out the new changes and formulate an opinion of them.  And naturally he was broken as all hell.\n\nFast forward to now, and we see that the original complaint still stands, with pretty much all of Skarners power tied up in a conditional passive.  He is incredibly strong (borderline overpowered) inside of his zones, and very lacking when he is outside of them.","replies":[{"poster":"hobomann2","date":"2015-11-13T07:18:16.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"WOOOOOOOOOOOO! thanks for giving me something to copy-paste for other twat-blasters that toot the same horn","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-11-12T05:40:18.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think a lot of people underestimate the power of {{item:3812}} .
