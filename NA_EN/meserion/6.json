Ironically {{champion:17}}  is not on that list. Its because of these champions, I will never play rank, and whenever I play normal draft, I have a dilemma where I have to try to ban the more troubling champions on my list. I&#039;ve made posts about my hatred towards certain champions so I&#039;m not going to explain why here; That would make this post be like 3 pages long. \n\nTo me these champions suck out the fun to be had in the game, and replaces it with a hollow sensation, and the feeling of intense futility; kind of like filing state tax returns... Ok, the list; here we go:\n\n{{champion:245}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:91}} \n\nI know, not a list, but easier than typing it all out.\n\nEDIT: ok, some elaboration:\n\nGenerally either you cannot actively stop their initiation, or they do too much damage than cannot be countered effectively. hence that feeling of futility.","replies":[]}
