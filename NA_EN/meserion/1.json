The problem is her passive, even if she has 99% slow (yeah talon does this) she can just dash away even though she is slowed. With enough attack speed (a natural choice for a AD carry like Kalista) it becomes nearly impossible for melee to keep up with her. \"But she has a high skill level!\", that hardly matters because as soon as someone figures her out she quickly becomes unstoppable.\r\n\r\nI'm already upset with Kalista in general, what with her FORCED oath and her ultimate that is either awesome or terrible. as well as the fact she can do %-based damage at level one that scales with max hp making it very difficult to counter (yeah I don't like vayne for this reason either). \r\n\r\nBut to address the most troubling aspect of Kalista, her passive Martial poise, all that is required is disable her passive whenever she is effected by some form of crowd control (kind of like how Miss Fortune's passive works); this would enable melee to have a chance at catching up with her but only if they gap close to apply a form of CC. A crafty Kalista can still evade CC if they dodge well enough, this allows for a fluid situation where the victory goes either way instead of having Kalista run away with a 99% slow like a demented jackrabbit.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2014-12-21T19:58:49.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My idea was the speed of the dash is lowered if she is slowed, similar to Yasuo, meaning if she dashes through a wall of Thresh's box, it'll take 5 seconds or so for her dash to go the full distance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kanacho","date":"2014-12-21T20:00:43.642+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why don't you just fight Kalista NOT 1v1 as a Melee champ who only has slows.

Picking a champ who is extremely horrible against another particular champ, doesn't make the one with the advantage automatically OP. Kalista can be countered, and quite easily at that. She can be snared/stunned/suppressed for a free kill. Remember that she is an ADC and that means she is really squishy. If you can CC her, she can't do anything.\n\nAlso her mobility can't compete against Assassins who are designed to chase highly-mobile ADC's like her down. Lucian and Kalista and all the Mobile ADC's cannot compete with an Assassin when it comes to a chase. Solid assassins have some of the best, if not the best gap closers in the game coupled with extremely high burst damage so that champs like Kalista or Lucian don't even get a chance to respond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilRabbitt","date":"2014-12-21T21:32:53.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista is much squishier (as far I as I can see) then people think.
