Surprisingly the wiki does not say he has any carry roles like {{champion:51}} or {{champion:18}}, rather he is a Fighter/Assassin. Neither role mentioned on the wiki says that Fighter/Assassins have a sustainable resource system, kind of what {{champion:157}}  has at the present. Often one of the big weaknesses for Assassins is a very mana hungry champion and fighters tend to build tanky so they don&#039;t have a lot of mana to play with. The simple solution to {{champion:157}} would be to give him a mana bar. A mana bar is a finite resource that one has to itemize for which can slow down damage, however focusing on pure damage makes it more likely that the champion will be caught with no mana.  Yasuo would still be able to itemize for it with {{item:3004}} and {{item:3508}}, but buying either item slows his damage down a bit or gives him potentially wasted stats (like too much crit). The mana costs would be as follows:\n\n**Flow:** this would be a graphic that would orbit {{champion:157}}  on the ground similar to targets affected by {{champion:67}} &#039;s silver bolts, it would exist as 3 &quot;tiers&quot; with each tier representing how much flow he has, with full tiers he would have a full bar effectively.\n\n**[Q] Steel Tempest:** Mana cost would be 60/70/80/90/100 and each rank would now reduce the cooldown of it by 0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5/0.6 for every 1% of attack speed instead of a flat 0.6% for every 1% attack speed.\n\n**[W] Windwall:** Mana cost would be 100 at all ranks but would refund 50 mana if it absorbs an enemy spell.\n\n**[E] Sweepng Blade:** Mana cost would be 50 at all ranks but each successive use of sweeping blade would double the mana cost up to a max of 400 mana per cast.\n\n**[ult] Last Breath: **Mana cost would be 100/150/200 mana and would refund the total mana cost if {{champion:157}} manages to kill an enemy champion with the initial damage.\n\nSo the scaling was changed on his Q so there would be a reason to max it first to consider, however if the player wants a more bursty mode they can max later and maybe max his E 1st for extra damage. Sweeping blade is essentially a non ultimate version of {{champion:38}}  ultimate with a lower cooldown and being tied to minions; this change parallels with how {{champion:38}}  functions who is ALSO an Assassin. The mana refund on his W highlights the point of using his W to block actual spells and not just deny last hits. \n\nMake no mistake Yasuo can out-scale this but it makes his &quot;complete&quot; build require more than 2 items to function. {{item:3508}} is a great fit for him because of his crit passive so rushing it early would give him sustained mana, but he would not have the extra damage from {{item:3031}} . So more decision would be required but his output would be mostly unchanged.\n\nAs an example his mana bar could be the same as Master Yi's (251 â€“ 965)","replies":[{"poster":"Frost the Reaper","date":"2015-12-07T22:41:53.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On his ult i hope you mean 200 and not 2000 as I doubt he'd have 2000 mana to use.","replies":[{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2015-12-07T23:10:17.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FrostedReapers,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YXtL0ybK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-07T22:41:53.234+0000)\n>\n> On his ult i hope you mean 200 and not 2000 as I doubt he'd have 2000 mana to use.\n\nthx for that, too many zeros :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-12-07T23:07:12.761+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's so much wrong with this.... Yo, straight up, Yasuo was made to spam abilities at-will. That's why the base damages on his Q and E are fairly low when compares to other melee-range abilities. Mana works as a gating mechanism to prevent some champions from spamming their more impactful abilities.\n\nYou can't have Yasuo be yasuo with a resource. It would either change the way he plays entirely or have costs low enough to be inconsequential. Whether a champion has a resource to manage or not is based on their individual needs; don't just add or remove a resource haphazardly.","replies":[{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2015-12-07T23:18:35.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you understand how {{item:3508}} works with him every melee and Q would restore 3% of his max mana pool every-time they hit with 100% crit. with the proposed mana pool shown: it would restore 7.53-28.95 on every melee, this coupled with his semi-permanent crit means he gets mana back almost constantly. He would have to pool his mana just like any Assassin has to.\n\nAlso on the base damage of his Q his can can crit so that acts like free AD of 100 at max rank, so yeah that is a lot and it can hit multiple targets. the lowered attack speed scaling is to avoid the situation where you get 1 point in his Q and max last with no downsides. \n\nIf you read about Assassins and Fighters in the wiki, it does not say a champion is spammy, rather they have to be planful as an Assassin, or do very little burst but it adds up over time as a Fighter.

The use of magic cost something in this game, health, life, long cooldowns, mana, SOMETHING. {{champion:157}} has none of these he has a bar of \"flow\" that only serves to give him a shield and be a excuse to not have a mana bar.\n\nFace it, he uses potent magic that no enchant or armor could give, thus he needs a mana bar to permit that level of power.\n\n\nYou did not read the wiki, so your argument falls flat. I'm using the wiki as a reference, so if you choose to ignore printed evidence, your very argument is in jeopardy of falling through. As for your remark of {{champion:115}} not having a mana bar, Yasuo is basically him without a global ultimate.\n\n**Also final note:** normally knockups are not a huge deal, but they're basically suppression effects with motion involved. Because his ultimate extends the knockup up time, It also suppresses the affected targets meaning you cannot cleanse his ult, Flash out of it, or do anything while this is going on. This makes his ult very toxic because it takes a semi-annoying idea like knockarounds, and makes it much worse.\n\n\nI know my opinion is not popular but In my experiences, it is the truth.

Yasuo is is a master of the wind and it bends to his will as a matter of course rather than him having to exert his will over it. \n\nNow, as for the wiki, I never said I didn't read it.

Or a E with a 0.5-0.1 cooldown on it, yeah that isn't a cooldown either; both abilities don't much of any cost, and their cooldowns are so insignificant. \n\nHow does Yasuo bend the wind to his will?

Even if Yasuo was a wizard, that wouldn't be a good argument for him using mana\n\nThing is, one could say they get their magic from Enchantments on a weapon or Armor. But true magic is very strong, thus it should cost something significant. One could argue for example {{champion:86}}'s ultimate comes from his sword, but it has to recharge, hence the long cooldown. {{champion:45}}'s Ultimate costs a lot of mana and has quite a cooldown, that is a twofold cost partially because for mages, mana becomes somewhat irrelvant late game, thus the cooldown keeps it relevant.\n\nI'd be prepared to let {{champion:157}}'s ult be free, but the fact it can fully refund its mana from kill provides so much followup potential that I chose to give it a mana cost. His Windwall, however, is like an ultimate but costs literally nothing, and the only reason it has a long cooldown, is {{champion:157}}  would be broken if it was short.\n\nIn fantasy worlds mana is indeed a thematic element, it is the proverbial \"life-blood\" of magic residing in every living creature. Sometimes it exists naturally in pools and sometimes it refers to a mental reserve of power that is drained as one uses magic. Hell-yes its thematic. It highlights the simple idea that Magic has costs that must be paid in order to use it. The benefits can be very substantial, if you're willing to pay. Even {{champion:8}}  pays. He uses blood magic which draws power, or perhaps the 'mana' itself from his blood which fuels the powers he uses.\n\nMana is not just a LoL theme'ing it has a place in literally every fantasy game and universe out there.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2015-12-08T00:07:10.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
