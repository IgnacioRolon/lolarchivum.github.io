I believe there are too many knockup effects in the game coming from champions to the point that its nearly impossible to avoid getting caught by CC as no one has like 6 spell shields. The idea is to make an item the can be used to escape knockups and avoid getting caught but also not making it abuse-able; somewhat like the invulnerability mechanic with {{item:3157}} or {{item:2420}}. Lets see:\r\n\r\n**Hextech Jump Jets**\r\n\r\n_UNIQUE: Active- Secret Hyper Jets- Propel your champion 800 units in an indicated direction, while being unstoppable. This effect can only be used when affected by a knockup effect (240 second cooldown).\r\n_\r\n\r\nBasic item: 600 gold.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere would be 3 upgrade options a player could buy that would be made for 3 archtypes: AD, AP, and Tank:\r\n\r\n**Damascus-Forged Hextech Jump Jets\r\n**\r\n_+50 Attack Damage\r\n+30% Bonus Attack Speed\r\n+10% Cooldown Reduction_\r\n_UNIQUE: Active- Secret Hyper Jets- Propel your champion 800 units in an indicated direction, while being unstoppable. This effect can only be used when affected by a knockup effect (180 second cooldown).\r\n_\r\n\r\nBuilt from: {{item:1038}} (1300 gold) + {{item:3101}} (1100 gold) + Hextech Jump Jets (600 gold) +300 gold buyout = 3300 gold total cost\r\n\r\n**Arcanium-Infused Hextech Jump Jets**\r\n\r\n_+120 Ability Power\r\n+10% Cooldown Reduction_\r\n_UNIQUE: Active- Secret Hyper Jets- Propel your champion 800 units in an indicated direction, while being unstoppable. This effect can only be used when affected by a knockup effect (180 second cooldown).\r\n_\r\n\r\nBuilt from: {{item:1058}} (1250 gold) + {{item:3108}} (900 gold) + Hextech Jump Jets (600 gold) +250 gold buyout = 3000 gold total cost\r\n\r\n**Chromium-plated Hextech Jump Jets**\r\n\r\n_+30 Armor\r\n+30 Magic Resist\r\n+400 Health_\r\n_UNIQUE: Active- Secret Hyper Jets- Propel your champion 800 units in an indicated direction, while being unstoppable. This effect can only be used when affected by a knockup effect (180 second cooldown).\r\n_\r\n\r\nBuilt from: {{item:1011}} (1000 gold) + {{item:3105}} (1100 gold) + Hextech Jump Jets (600 gold) +300 gold buyout = 3000 gold total cost\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe whole idea here is to make an item that you buy when the enemy is employing a number of knockup champions like {{champion:12}} or {{champion:14}} and being able to avoid getting caught is crucial. The cooldown means it can save some of the time, but not all the time. The upgrades are meant to compliment different playstyles while still preserving the core idea of the item.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-02-10T06:13:04.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can see it avoiding a yasuo ult here and there.","replies":[{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2019-02-10T08:10:13.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it wouldn't stop the damage, but it would take you well out of followup range.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-02-10T08:13:16.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally i dont see a problem with it because i get tired of yasuos or some eternal knockup attacks cc i want league to be interactive again. but.... then again theres yi or someone else (mainly melee carries) who can pretty much ram at your team unstoppable style.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-10T07:18:36.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC → Tenacity → Knockup → pls no more","replies":[]}]}
