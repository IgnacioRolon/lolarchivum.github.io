I realize I haven't really played much since my go-to Ahri build got deleted from the game with no real alternatives, but this actually impacts my enjoyment of drunken bot matches :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T04:54:41.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried disabling G-Sync? I know some players have encountered issues using G-Sync in the past, depending on their exact setup. I'd recommend trying a custom match after disabling G-Sync and ensuring you aren't globally enforcing any settings in the Nvidia Control Panel for League.\n\nLet me know what you find after making those changes!","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Jelly","date":"2016-12-28T05:54:15.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: Real firstly: Thanks for the response. Sorry I forgot to say that!\n\nFirstly, can't seem to reproduce the blue-exclusive lag I was having. I did seem to have a higher framerate range (around 48-55) so I wouldn't be surprised if the booze hid the remaining few frames shy of 60 (where I stop really noticing it due to that being my old laptop's monitor's refresh rate).\n\nSecondly, toggling GSync via control panel, it's GSync causing the issue, you are correct.\n\nSadly, while League is kind enough to be toaster-compatible, for games where my laptop starts showing that it's a laptop not a desktop, I really like having GSync enabled, as it makes the degrade a lot less terrible. Best workaround I can think of is dealing with the slight UI cutoff at the bottom of Windowed mode and disable GSync on non-fullscreen.\n\nIf you have any better ideas, I'm all ears.\n\nAlso kinda curious as to why GSync makes this game dive, but doesn't murder, say, Warframe, which is a lot more graphically complex, or EDF 4.1, which isn't exactly more complex as it is noisy.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T21:34:51.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear that disabling G-Sync caused a noticeable change for you. As to why it's conflicting with League, I'm not sure. I've seen multiple posts online for various games having issues with G-Sync, though, so it's definitely not just a League thing.\n\nJust to confirm where we're at now, where does disabling G-Sync and running in either fullscreen or windowed get you? Are you running the game consistently at your native refresh rate?","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Jelly","date":"2016-12-30T14:31:20.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"200-400 fps uncapped no v-sync, 74-76 v-sync. Uncapped blue has a slightly worse framerate than purple (by like 10-20 average), but even a CRT wouldn't be able to tell. So yes, disabling g-sync completely fixed the problem.\n\nA shame you're not sure the cause.... Something to look into when you guys have some \"free\" time. Ha. To help on that, this previously was not an issue I had, so either it was a change on NVidia's driver's end, or a change in League at some point during 6.x (as previous games in the 6.x family haven't had this issue). Wish I could be more helpful in narrowing it down, but alas, Dominion died and my go-to build was deleted (RIP WotA and mana regen on mages), so I've been very eh about this game lately.\n\nThe Windowed trick is so I don't have to actually disable g-sync, just set it to ignore Windowed mode- which means I don't have to remember to toggle g-sync. This works because NVidia's g-sync settings has a \"fullscreen only\" option.\n\n\nThanks for the help, and hope you have a happy newyear!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
