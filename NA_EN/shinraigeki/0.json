Proceed to nerf Lulu.\r\n-Soraka was popular top-lane as an alternative AS WELL AS as a support AND mid. She was harassive but she did not flat out dominate any lane (especially top, where she was about as effective as Renekton!)\r\n-Both of the above are cases of Riot promoting the Toplane as a must-bruiser meta.\r\n--Not entirely sure, but could the ADC changes be an attempt to tone them out of the top-lane meta too?\r\n\r\n-Riven saw quite a bit of use in mid lane, proceed to nerf her HP Regen.\r\n\r\n-Annie saw use in bottom lane over mid, proceed to nerf and readjust her skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems like whenever a champ finds a use outside what's expected, the answer is \"nerf it\". In fact you noted the next champ's meant to be a top laner - should we expect it nerfed when/if it goes jungle, mid, or sup!?","replies":[{"poster":"MrSc0tty","date":"2014-07-17T11:41:20.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a case of somewhat irritating double standards. If, say, Renekton and melee bruisers with strong kill potential early force out oh, let's say every tank in the game from toplane-then that's the natural Metagame. But if a \"support\" goes and competes ANYWHERE (lulu mid, Soraka top, Alistar jungle, Janna ADC ) then it immediately gets targeted nerfs to \"bring it in line \". \n\nThen, because every support is too undertuned to work anywhere else, any time something goes botlane that beats them, it gets the bat (Fidds Zyra Annie)\n\nThe other class with \"the protection of Riot\" is the precious AD carry. Anything that creates a game where there is a successful comp without an AD carry, or anything that counters ad carries well enough to reliably kill them gets a heavy nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Danksley","date":"2014-07-17T21:17:49.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"M-muh Malphite","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinRaigeki","date":"2014-07-17T19:21:40.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly my point. It feels like Riot has some sort of damned crazy double standard.  I don't think they themselves are even seeing that they're controlling the meta and trying to restrain it. If a champion can go multiple positions great, but why punish a champion for it? It means that lane needs to change it's own meta to match. Yet god forbid, Always Nerf Irelia, don't nerf Renekton though!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-07-18T18:31:59.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they are failing to realize that one of the best things about this game is it's malleability.  The fact that so many champs are not forced into one specific role is a great thing, and doing things like this only gradually makes the game have less and less options.  It's hard to say what they are thinking with stuff like this, as they do tend to go against what they say somewhat often.  The Design Values blog said \"Instead of offering a best path forward, we want to offer different paths forward that have real tradeoffs. Players should see changes that reflect this philosophy when we introduce strategic tradeoffs for emergent strategies, not because they're new and unique, but usually because they're dominating the scene.\".  So, if this is true, why keep shoehorning champs into one role?  The blog also says: \"Whether a player wants an assassin that waits for the perfect engage or a tank that fights when he pleases, we want to present a wide selection of champions that can deliver on a variety of distinct roles.\"  Did they just mean a variety of roles, but only one per champion?    I feel like that blog is making less and less sense over time, because if these were really the things they see as the most important, they wouldn't go against them so often.\n\nAnother great example is the design value \"A fight loses its excitement if the first punch wins â€“ it's what you can do after that adds depth and complexity.\". If that were true, then Blitz/Thresh grabs shouldn't end fights the vast majority of the time they land, and I think someone like Fizz blows that sentence away as soon as he gets ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinRaigeki","date":"2014-07-18T20:06:32.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your last paragraph confuses me too. Blitz, Thresh, Morgana, Amumu, Orianna, all of these are not exactly high skill (see: Gragas ult) but can completely change a teamfight into an instant win.  \n\nMorgana's Q just lasts forever, effectively a kill, and it sets up her ult for a single target assassinate. Not to mention her shield. No offense but **WHY IS OLAF'S ULT PUT ON A BEEFY AS CRAP SHIELD THAT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK WITHOUT A 3-4 AP CHAMP TEAM!?** (Olaf's ult is more acknowledged as a giant CC negator than anything if you were to ask me from my talks with friends).","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-07-18T20:10:53.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah there are quite a few things that go against that design value.

I actually really like where she is for the most part, just because she can go AD, AP, or hybrid, and be more or less viable.

Riven *was* heading mid. That might have been \"too powerful\", but that is the time she actually saw the bat. Maybe it was a coincidence, maybe not.\n\nSoraka was also NOT making choices top lane unviable, but rather was able to compete. She was sort of a reverse nasus, as she scaled her heals just as hard as his damage when given gold. She was a lane counter to some champs, sure, but also had VERY solid weaknesses (AP damagers like cho/rumble, people with CC and Sustain, and ANYONE with grevious wounds built in tbh.) Basically, she had strengths and weaknesses, and fit rather well in top lane, but because she was a healer she really wasn't allowed to head top or mid, and was nerfed till seen NOWHERE.\n\nLulu I actually agree with, but only because pix had no travel time. If they gave him a travel time to his destination, then lulu would telegraph her glitterlance pokes, and she would have had enough counterplay (more than nid actually).\n\nAnnie, IMO, was simply so weak as a mage pick that she had only one lane she could compete in, the land of the nerfed. Hence the changes to her to allow her to compete elsewhere.","replies":[]}]}]}
