Her visual design is all Piltover, so the only way you'll know she's from Zaun is if you went out of your way to look.\n\nI personally ran into at least three separate interpretation of Jinx's character - a vindictive and homicidal psychopath a la Penguin and Harley Quinn, a madwoman with a purpose a la Joker and a punchclock villain who drops her crazy act when she's \"off-duty\". That people interpret her in so many ways shows how much of blank slate she is.\n\nThat's pretty much the issue with recent champions.

Are they implying everyone is wearing hotpants and bikinis in Zaun despite it being portrayed as an industrial wasteland? Is \"hotpants and bikini\" even a fashion style, given that it's a pretty normal thing to wear in hot weather?\n\nNote that this also plays into how Zaun developed even less of an identity under the so-called Foundations team. Back in the day, its art direction was simply \"mad science\" and most of its characters didn't look human. Now that they're trying to expand into more normal-looking clothing, the coherence is simply not there.

I completely agree with you though.  Even though there was never much cohesion between the Zaunite champions, they all had at least some part of their style/design in common.  \n\nViktor, Singed, Twitch, and Mundo for example have a similar overall theme of 'weird science' with elements of 'dystopian steampunk' (contrasting Piltover's more positive version of steampunk).  They don't have much in common beyond that, but at least it's something.  Jinx has very little in common with any of them.  She's also not completely Piltovian, but in my opinion she's got more in common with those champions than the Zaunite ones.  From the way I've always viewed Zaun, it's a very dog-eat-dog city.  You either get ahead of competition, or you wind up on the streets (or worse).  Everything citizens do is done for a specific reason and that includes what they choose to wear.  I vaguely remember one of the JoJ articles saying that in order to be outside for very long you needed to wear a gas mask, and that the sky was constantly a greenish-grey color from the ever-present pollution and contamination.  Additionally, all of the clothing/gear of the champions mentioned previously serves a purpose, with the exception of Mundo (though that could be because all the experiments he's done on himself have warped his body so much that he has a much stronger tolerance for external contaminants).  In that kind of environment, Jinx's \"hotpants and a bikini\" make absolutely no sense as you said, and I can't see any Zaunite (no matter how 'crazy') risking their own life just to make a fashion statement or look cool.  \n\nOn a slightly related note, I'm not the only one that forgets about that section of Champion info-pages from time to time.  According to Kalista's 'Location/Place of Origin' thing, she's from \"faction_\"  It's been that way since her release.
