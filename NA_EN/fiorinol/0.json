NA ping for everyone except the west coast seems to be getting worse, not better. As a company, Riot has consistently said it is working with ISPs to get a better flow for their traffic but the actuality is that the opposite seems to be occurring for many of us. I am still baffled about why Riot refuses to even entertain the idea of East Coast servers or to give an actually legitimate answer on why they are not going to add east coast servers. The only possible thing for us to think is that a majority of the concern at Riot is around the main server location and focusing on LCS and Challenger teams. (If someone at Riot can point me to a legitimate coherent reason aside from \"we'd like the region to be united\" or some other generic vaguery, please do so). The difference in ping is noticeable. Many of us play with 70-90 ping constantly, and when you watch the pros when they get that high they says its massive. **Not only is the increasing ping effecting average players, but it is preventing new young teams to enter the challenger scene and seriously compete because in order to be serious you must leave everything behind wherever you are and gamble on moving to the west coast and hopefully making it. This is supremely unfair and puts a huge burden on those who don't have access to the funds to be able to make that move to pursue their dreams.** Riot, it's time to face the facts that whatever you are attempting with the ISPs is failing and that the best solution for the players, both average and potentially competitive, is to create an East Coast region for NA. The player experience should be first and foremost, so make it better and add the servers you know you will eventually have to add anyway. I am prepared for more vagery, but let's be honest, you have no plans to address it and will stand by and continue to talk about player experience while the ping for a majority of players continues to go up and up until it becomes unplayable. Maybe that's what DOTA 2, HotS, and Strife need to see an influx of players; Riot's ineptitude for basic server support. (PS all of these have East Coast servers, Dawngate has/had east coast, most PC games have east coast, so you are entirely out of touch and out of step with the general consensus of the gaming industry without a legitimate reason to do so. Being innovative is one thing, but outright refusal to use established norms that help increase the happiness of players and therefore revenue makes no sense in any possible interpretation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2014-12-31T04:41:08.798+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You heard it here first folks runescape 10/10 +1","replies":[{"poster":"1337n00bh4x0r","date":"2014-12-31T18:04:00.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lol'd pretty hard, though.

Obviously the goal of this is to just place servers on the East coast, which honestly shouldn't be a problem for a game garnering this much success, but you speak much truth. I suppose every giant has their weaknesses and this is riots and they really cannot deny it.

Well, they misjudged the amount of traffic they get on a regular basis due to the lack of research and study and BAM, server goes down. Everybody is locked out, or people are constantly sitting in queue waiting to just get logged in, let alone play a game.

This is one factor of thousands that people need to focus on and work out before they just throw some shit on the East Coast. Just imagine sitting in the same queue we all do after a big update every single day you wanted to play. Having that East coast server would be irrelevant and people would move back to the West coast server just so they could play.

They're estimated to have made over 1 billion in 2014 alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Ternt","date":"2015-01-01T07:54:57.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hazare,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=12ipkEJc,comment-id=00310000,timestamp=2015-01-01T07:10:11.557+0000)\n>\n> But you see, the cost/return value is not a factor to be taken into account : Most of their playerbase is in East Coast already, and they make far more than enough money a year to build roughly 2-3 entirely new servers from scratch if they wanted to.

You don't just build a house because you want one, there's a lot of thought that needs to go into every inch of it. Aside from that, there's also a lot of regulations they need to bypass to even get the permits to do something that they do. The company hosting their servers now was probably an established company they have a contract with. Maybe they can't just create their own because it would breach their contract now? All huge server operations run cooling systems, cooling systems require a water source. Well you can't just starting pumping water in from the Mississippi or Ohio river and expect everything to be fine. It would completely disrupt the habitat of thousands of animals by changing temperatures in the water, oxygen levels, etc. That's a lot of paper work to get approved and a lot of planning than just throwing something down. If there are as many people East coast as you say, it would require something far more complex than just that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
