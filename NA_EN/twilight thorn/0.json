Getting a S- is hard enough, now you want players to play flawlessly??? I finally managed a S- last month and find out RIOT moved the finish line for tokens!!!!\n\nThis is ridiculous!  \n\nThe bench mark for success for a Champion should be realistic for majority of players, not some arbitrary decision to move the finish line.  The players know why you moved it, to increase play time, rob devoted players of their skill development.  This is madness!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2017-11-14T18:17:58.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your match history and don't see any above A+.
