That's the most simplified definition of what a tank is. Yes tanks are usually the walls of their team, but they are also the wrecking ball. \n\nVanguards showcase this by being teamfight starters with their AoE and quick engage kits. They literally crash into the enemy team to cause chaos so that the enemy team is ill prepared for his team following up. \n\nWardens are tanks that focus on keeping allies safe. The biggest Warden I'd Braum not just because his kit is the most literal form of the job (that freaking shield) but also how his passive stuns people at four stacks that can be applied to anyone on his team!  He's giving the carry a peeling tool. \n\nWe also have Tahm who literally eats his carry to run away. Taric who can stun from his carry. Alistar and his freaking headbutt. \n\nAll of these tanks are feared for their CC and utility making teamfights literal hell for the enemy.
