Elemental dragon&#039;s color pallets were a step in the right direction but even summoner&#039;s rift is blue. Look at old champions like Brand, Zyra, Cho&#039;gath, Pantheon they all had unique ability particles and different colors. You can distinguish easily. But even Yorick who&#039;s ghouls were all different colors uses these blue particles. Every champion looks the same and even the new client overuses blue.
