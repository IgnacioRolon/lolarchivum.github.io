Maybe half a year ago I learned about the PBE and how I could get early access to new champs and skins to see how they work out and I applied instantly. Sadly, 6 months later, I haven't been accepted to create an account even though I still desperately want to be. Is there anything else I can do to receive an account other than click the \"I apply\" button? Or am i just name out of thousands with nothing to do to stand out and a hopeless dream of getting an account on the PBE?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T21:12:30.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy one year of League!  I appreciate your passion and wanting to help on the PBE, but we can't expedite applications.  As long as your account is in good standing, your best bet is to apply on the[ sign up page](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe).  More details are also provided in our [PBE FAQ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq),  Best of luck with admissions!","replies":[{"poster":"CaRNo","date":"2016-08-24T21:47:52.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":( alright thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
