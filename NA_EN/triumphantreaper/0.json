Able to force AP Carry and AD Carry into horrible positioning because of his ultimate. The fact he's considered to be a strong pick against ZED should tell you that he's not as trash as the community makes him out to be. \n\nBlitzcrank needed that change to W, his lane dominance has just been way too ridiculous. Miss a Q? Just run up and punch whoever you missed.\n\nAs far Kassadin, he's a balance nightmare with the design of his kit, hyper mobility combined with damage is hell to balance properly, see Kalista and Yasuo. Can't really fault them for struggling with that one. \n\nAnything else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TriumphantReaper","date":"2015-04-12T00:17:51.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The point is blindly nerfing everything isn't good balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-04-12T00:24:21.304+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They aren't blindly nerfing anything.

But OP is wrong thinking that urgot is being played cause everything is nerfed. Hes being played actually for the complete opposite reason. Urgot is an anti carry that excel versus sustained dmg opponent and tanks. \n\nguess what,  the meta is heavily in favor of these two types of opponents **_because_** of humongous buffs on tanks and deserved buff to urgot at the same time. you are wrong on the context and reasoning of why hes being played (and besides hes not played that much)","replies":[]}]}
