Unlike what most people seem to say, Riot does keep a careful eye on the playerbase&#039;s demands and fulfills them whenever possible and reasonable.\r\n\r\nThat said I just want to make a minor note that Bloodlord Vlad laughs with the vanilla Vlad VO when casting E. It&#039;s really no big deal but just pointing it out.\r\n\r\nExample in this video of a TF being silly around me:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ri_oEJHSxQ\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T20:58:18.638+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey VaynexVlad OTP - \n\nThanks for the report!
