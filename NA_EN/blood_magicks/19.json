Hopefully by the end of it Riot will resolve the soloq/dynq issues and come up with a good blend of the two, so they can focus on a different, but very important issue:\r\n\r\nLeague can benefit from an influx of fresh blood. As it is, old players are becoming burned out on league, starting to quit it and even hate on it. And that&#039;s perfectly okay. Few games, if any, can boast keeping a player&#039;s interest for so long, and renewing it with every major update. \r\n\r\nKeeping old players is a good pursuit, but sometimes there just isn&#039;t anything a company can do. The 2k games diamond 4 player who uninstalled sometimes just wants to play something else for a while, or maybe forever. Doesn&#039;t matter. There just needs to be an eager newbie taking his place in order for the game to stay fresh and alive.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, League is very unwelcoming to new players. I don&#039;t even think smurfs are as problematic as the sheer amount of stuff to learn and the little to no assistance provided by Riot to new players. It&#039;s all an outdated, confusing mess.

The games we play are basically _literally games_, bloodsports conducted with summoners ( yes, they still exist, they're just not part of Runeterra anymore ) that call forth what are basically phantoms of the \"legends\" or otherwise notable people of Valoran and beyond. Certain things may hint at lore events, but just like they are OOCly, they're basically set dressing to make the world of the \"game\" seem more alive.\n\nIt's exactly the same deal as with, say, DOTA or Overwatch, just without the actual \"justification.\" Yes, with DOTA, there is this whole \"battle of the Ancients\" going on in the lore, but it's comically always sometime in the future, a conflict put on the heroes' schedules ( literally, in the case of Rylai ) but not one to ever come. That's because the actual gameplay does not suit the lore _at all_, and trying to do so would raise way more questions than it would answer or just flat-out break the game. Overwatch may  have locations and missions that'll end up being important to the characters, and they may interact in ways that would be true to how they'd interact in the situation they're in, but they're still absolutely _no_ reason for Tracer to help Widowmaker push an EMP device onto a camp of Omnics in her hometown, much less _Bastion_ or _Zenyatta_ who would also be killed in the blast - and Zenyatta is flat-out a monk of peace that promotes human-Omnic equality! Hell, Blizzard has flat-out stated that the gameplay of Overwatch is completely out of the story, because there's just really no making sense of it.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-07-17T07:39:59.865+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"But OW still has Overwatch (the organization) to tie all of the characters together.

Them not having any ties means nothing because there isn't any story for DotA, in actuality. They're just a bunch of new units tossed into a custom game, essentially. DotA 2 is just a prettier version of it. \n\nAlso, all of the heroes are on the same level, power-wise. They're all beings, not gods. Even Zues, a literal god, reduced himself to being mortal due to an argument with his wife. \n___________________\n\nLeague, like Overwatch, had an organization that tied everything together, gave champions a purpose for being there. Not anymore.\n\nBut Riot's still trying to flesh out the world like anything makes sense anymore?\n\nThen you have different champions in League, many of which are irrefutably much, much stronger or larger than others in lore, but they're all magically on the same playing field/unit of measurement? **Why do we have a giant star dragon, that literally forges massive celestial stars, that's barely bigger than Gragas? ** There's no fixing that. Riot fucked up. Aurelion Sol is a massive failure simply because of that small fact. He will never deliver as a character because he **is not** the character in lore. That's just a similarly themed character, not the character that lore describes.  \n\nI'm sorry but if you take a game like League without completely re-doing all the lore all at once, you're left with nothing. It doesn't matter how much they flesh out certain regions. The lore of the game is forever broken because so much of it just doesn't keep up with the rest. \n\nIt also doesn't help that Riot made a bad habit of including power in lore, rather than primarily characterization.

Are there characters in Overwatch, in-universe? Well, yeah. But what about Widowmaker and Reaper, who work _for Overwatch's enemies_?

Roadhog? Zarya? Lucio? Symmetra? Zenyatta? Maybe you can claim they're all people that the members of Overwatch could've picked up as teammates as part of the scenario of the mission, or that some of them would flat-out join the organization ... but there's another thing: Overwatch, in-universe, is basically dismantled. Agents of Overwatch were \"recalled,\" but overall most of the stuff for Overwatch agents are likely unusable, because _Overwatch activity is illegal_.\n\nThere's ... actually really nothing Overwatch provides the actual in-game stuff, besides the background of quite a few characters and explanations of why they interact with each other the way that they do, and also I guess it provided a reason why one stage looks like it does.\n\nAlso, the heroes of DOTA definitely aren't the same power level. Sure, there's nothing to the level of, say, Teemo vs. Aurelion Sol ... because it's even worse. You've got Techies, three goblin-esque things that are based around explosives _and nothing else_, facing off against the _fundamental forces of the universe_, including _gravity_, _electromagnetic force_, and _weak_ and _strong nuclear force_. No, not someone that channels the forces for their powers, not some god that has power over those forces, _the embodiment of those forces themselves_.\n\nAnd, yes, the Techies can lay down some land mines and blow them to smitheroons, no problem. Hell, they can blow themselves up and commit suicide _and then proceed to come back to life sooner than a fundamental force of the universe_.\n\nAnd that's not all. Funny that you mentioned Aurelion Sol, because in DOTA a really, _really_ angry troll with a lot of tomahawks is actually one of the best heroes to kill and destroy another hero that is _literally a star_. A random kobold-goblin thing that is flat-out posed as an underdog and really only has cloning to his name - a skill that many other heroes have, anyway - can curbstomp _the heat death of the universe itself_ with a shovel. And last but not least, a yellow guy riding a bat ... can douse _the creator of the world itself_ in napalm and burn him to death.\n\nSo ... yeah, DOTA definitely has the same problems as League, if not worse, in terms of heroes being of the same power level and said power level be represented in-game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-07-17T09:05:05.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That last sentence makes no sense, Aurelion Sol is a very well written character with a clear personality and set of goals.

It's all about abusing what's powerful and copy pasting whatever the pros are doing. No one thinks for themselves anymore, no one plays to have fun.

On the other hand, i find the experienced players create more problems in the game - mainly through smurfing. Sure, smurfs quickly end up getting matched only against each other, which of course is nice - but this also breeds more toxicity, which in turn results in more smurfs for various reasons. The community has been on a steady decline ever since Season 5 begun, and then it jumped off a cliff with Season 6. \n\nWe can only hope Riot learns from their massive mistake this season, instead of taking it to another next level in half a year's time.\n\nOn the bright side, at this rate we might soon be back to the good old days with a small, concentrated playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2016-07-17T16:02:19.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfs have always been a huge problem. Thinking back to when I first started, nearly every game I was in had one person just dumpstering everyone on the enemy team. I don't think that's an exclusively veteran player problem though. On the contrary, I definitely know more new players with multiple accounts than I do old players. I don't know if this is the case for all veterans, but I see no reason to make a new account when this one has everything unlocked. \n\nAlso, the problem with smurfing is that it's not against the rules. Back in the day, it was against the rules to abuse the refer a friend thing, but the account itself wasn't breaking a rule, just referring yourself was. Another thing that's sort of amplifying the problem is how popular smurfing has become. It's gotten to the point where people watch streams of master tier people absolutely demolishing silver players in an effort to show that elo hell doesn't exist is very popular, as well as 'racing' to see how fast you can get your smurf where your main is. \n\nAs for getting back to the small playerbase of the good ol' days, I fear that's no longer an option. Even if the game dies out to that point, as long as there are pros to copy, that's what people will do. The birth of LoL as an eSport has killed originality.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xXMrPeanutXx","date":"2016-07-16T19:17:01.180+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Season 6 is already about introducing new players.
