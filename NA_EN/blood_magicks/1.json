Something about not glimmering enough.     --I decided using &quot;twilight&quot; to mock someone was to esoteric.\n\nSo I hope this isn’t too salty, but two thoughts immediately hit me:\n\n1. Given the sort of rich space Vlad occupies as our bloodmage, and his not really being a run-of-the-mill vampire (a vampire but not vampire, if you would) I am surprised something else wasn’t on the list. \n\nPlease don’t take this as a shot, as I really love the writing you did for both Jhin and Kled - between the lines themselves and Quinton Flynn’s delivery, Jhin is a masterpiece. Even “HOW LOVELY” is a superb line, despite being all of two words. So I guess it just kinda bums me out that he wasn’t going to get a line that gives some small amount of life to him.\n\n2. I understand there can be any number of reasons why it got cut, but I think it’s fair to ask why it wasn’t given a little more weight? There are definitely champions he isn’t going to encounter much that he has lines for, but Vlad is both a popular champion in top and mid lane at many levels of play, and he’s a woefully underdeveloped character and has been for many years now. I respect that a lot of his lines make sense - having one for someone like Anivia, a mid laner he may not get close to much, but because she’s a thing he hates (gods), he’s there. But over Vlad? And for Mundo? I get thst he’s a top laner, but Vlad is probably of similar pick rate and even if not related in existing lore, he’s still more related to Aatrox if only by blood (rimshot, I know).\n\nAnyway, thanks for letting us know. I’d love to ask some questions about Aatrox’s lines if you ever take questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-06-12T23:44:40.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of all the Vladimir source material you can take and expand on to create a highly relevant and intelligent bit of lore you go for this one?\n\nShaking my head family.\n\n(Besides Twilight was 10 years ago and is quite forgotten)\n\nThat said thank you for sharing, I had a chuckle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Old Man Riven","date":"2018-06-12T21:29:50.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
