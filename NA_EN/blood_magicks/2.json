I finally got to examine my emotions and realise how wrong I was in my assumptions.\n\nBasically, @WAARGHbobo, the lore community holds you in incredibly high regard. You might have noticed that by the amount of people who write about your characters and emulate your style. I have nothing but obscene amounts of adoration for your work. I swoon over your champions as much as I swoon over the research you display that you&#039;ve put into them. \n\nOn a higher level the value of League is that it can serve profundity and cleverness to a mass audience. Like all those classic books we read twice in a lifetime at its best the writing in this game can keep us coming back to it. It is fair to say your writing consistently displays this multifaceted depth.\n\nNow here&#039;s the problem with me, I copy your attitude to champions a bit too much. I&#039;ve been researching all things Vladimir in the last few months (and always, really). I&#039;ve gone full scholar on this, bouncing between the biographies of Romantic poets, European folklores and classics, medical nonfiction, articles on taboos and the occult, and various pop culture phenomena. It&#039;s a broad and fascinating topic.\n\nHalf the time I&#039;m having great fun and the other half I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m wasting my time and boring the hell out of people.\n\nWhen someone I hold in as high regard as you dismissed what I have focused the labor of my love around so nonchalantly I heavily swung towards the latter, and it hurt. My lashing out was a knee jerk reaction.\n\nNeedless to say your actions don&#039;t mean any of these things and the perceived insult is all in my head. I apologise for burdening you with it, especially since there was nothing you could do after Aatrox was released. I only ever wished to convince you Vlad was worth writing about.\n\nApologies again for being rude and awful at it.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-06-18T18:03:59.662+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"No worries,  we all love things and when they feel neglected we get upset.   Vlad has some interesting stuff relating to how noxian society works— unfortunately because that stuff is still R&D I couldn’t be sure where/if it will be used— thus couldnt really use that info for a lore type interaction with Aatrox.  This left me looking for jokes with him— i wrote a couple and they were “okay”. But knowing he was mainly a midlaner who “could” flex top-  i decided the best joke wasn’t good enough to warrant inclusion over other material.    \n\nYou, myself, everyone makes mistakes \n\nThanks for your kind words\n\nI hope vlad stuff gets your way soon","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-06-20T16:50:16.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The complaints were because the Darkin have serious canon lore reasons to interact with mortal blood mages, ones many players have been inquiring about. That said I don't blame you for not knowing much about a character Riot hasn't discussed much yet.\n\n> Vlad has some interesting stuff relating to how noxian society works— unfortunately because that stuff is still R&D I couldn’t be sure where/if it will be used\n\nI know - I might get to work or at least try to help with that myself fairly soon. See you at Riot next month (I hope!). Once more has been set in motion it would be an absolute honor to hear your opinions.\n\nPS Thank you so much for replying to this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lol you wild wyd","date":"2018-06-18T18:08:37.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I may ask why the drastic change in Aatrox's personality?
