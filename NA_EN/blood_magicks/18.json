It was insanely popular in the 90s, and most often was told about a white guy in Asia or some other place who ended up saving the world or country, hence the name \"white savior.\" It wasn't a very deep concept back in the 90s, and it certainly wasn't built upon to make Kayn.

He has no attach except Ionia and he is a 'stranger' in it, he see weapons as tools, see no value in the design of armor. He thrive in the shadows, which despite the edgy side of it, show also someone who find comfort in the notion of void. It is someone who is edgy because he has a damn unstable life man.\n\nHe want to be recognized (be it by others or by Zed in particular), suceeding with this darkin weapon is a way for him to prove his own existence. Narcissism/overconfidence is more like a cons that come with the way his life was shape, when you feel to have any attach toward you (because he sure seem to like Ionia), the only anchor you get is yourself.\n\nAnd in the game, his quote with Shen actually show respect, you can see how much he talk about potential, about how he is as 'great' as he should be. It show a lot about what his past and life left into his mind, oh yeah, edgy assassin narcissic doing shadow sh*t, sure, it doesn't look innovating but by god is he well built in his coherence. I am glad they tried to stick to a trope (kinda like how I love Urgot for being truly something horrifying/disgusting).\n\nHell, I even think he truly see Zed (and maybe Shen) as a father figure/someone he want to be recognised by because Zed, by saving him/seeing something worth in him, actually gave a meaning to his life.\nDamn, he sound so tortured/sad when he attack/kill Zed, his weapon show so much enjoyment because they KNOW it is a final step for tghe corruption of Kayn.\n\nThis kid is not cheap and I would love for people to clean their eyes to see that a character doesn't have to be \"Original the lord\" or \"Fake deep shit story\" to actually be human or interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Faceless","date":"2017-07-04T07:32:25.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you're not wrong, nothing of his bio or color story reflect this.\nIn this case you don't enjoy the character, but the potential he has.\nI understand you - I have a lot of champions who I love for their potential, even if they never were fleshed out.

Everybody has their flaws, and the hero of one story can be the villain of the other.  It depends on perspective.  The best example I can give you is Jayce and Viktor.  Jayce paints Viktor as a batshit crazy basketcase who went so far as to enslave humanity by stuffing their brains into robots.  Viktor, paints Jayce as an arrogant douche with a respectable level of intelligence who is so far up his own ass that he killed the people Vik tried to save by destroying the robots which supported their existence.\n\nHe may not be the typical good guy, but, at the very least, before he picked up that Scythe, most in the Order of the Shadow saw him as the one who'll help them protect and maintain what they saw as the \"right\" way to enforce law.  Zed is about \"The Greater Good.\"  You don't have to be a radiant light to protect or do something good.
