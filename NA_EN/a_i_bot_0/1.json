The results would be he gets less gold and you take less damage, thus you have an easier time outscaling him. You should quickly get to the point where locking him in R is a kill if you can land your skillshots.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-30T12:19:12.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Mord is a counter to Kennen then so is Darius by the same logic.

Those are all big differences.\n\nThough I agree that Morde probably doesn't counter Kennen","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-30T12:53:53.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mord's Q is also a much easier skillshot to dodge as is his pull.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
