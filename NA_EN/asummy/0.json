I live a couple hours away from the servers, so my ping shouldn't be that high. I recently had to start using a program that I don't want to advertise, but anyways all it does is chooses a optimal path for my network connection, and now I'm at a stable 23 ping again. The problem is this program costs money, and has some inconvenient problems.\r\nI called my ISP and the person at the desk doesn't have the technical knowledge to understand hops and all that good stuff, so I was wondering who at riot can I contact (and how) to get them in communication with my ISP so that my network route can become optimal again? I really feel like this could help other users who could be experiencing similar issues.\r\nTLDR: Who at riot can I contact to put them in communication with my ISP to get my connection optimized","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T03:02:15.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't speak to your ISP on your behalf, but we can certainly help you gather the right data and provide the right context to a tech at your ISP so your issue should be resolved.

When packets hit the chicago host shown below all my backs were being dropped, at about 4 minutes in 1 packet finally got through. What should my next step be?\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                               10.20.0.1 -    0 |  391 |  391 |    7 |    9 |   25 |   13 |\n|                              72.240.7.1 -    0 |  391 |  391 |    9 |   13 |   44 |   13 |\n|                           72.240.111.33 -    1 |  387 |  386 |    0 |   13 |   38 |   12 |\n|                           72.240.111.49 -    0 |  391 |  391 |    7 |   11 |   30 |   12 |\n|      xe-10-3-2.bar2.Detroit1.Level3.net -    1 |  387 |  386 |    0 |   18 |   37 |   17 |\n|      ae-2-3615.ear2.Chicago2.Level3.net -   99 |   79 |    1 |    0 |  296 |  296 |  296 |\n|                              4.15.84.42 -    0 |  391 |  391 |   54 |   57 |   74 |   56 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  387 |  386 |    0 |   56 |   76 |   55 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T21:59:43.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, it looks like your route is fine up until the **ae-2-3615.ear2.Chicago2.Level3.net** node, where 99% of your packets drop off before reaching our servers.

He said they've been getting a large amount of complaints due to the Level 3 node, but he said he doubts anything is going to be done, simple because the two level 3 providers they partnered with have recently been bought out and he has seen a large difference in performance (he called them trash xD) but yeah I don't really know what to do, didn't sound too assuring.
