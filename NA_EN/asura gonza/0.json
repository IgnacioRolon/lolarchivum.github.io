This lead to her being very difficult to buff in damage.... but this doesnt mean that she cannot be buffed in utility. thats why i propose to buff her passives; Rock Surf and worked Ground.\r\n\r\n&gt; _**Rock Surf:**_ IMO it needs to offer more. I feel that thematically, this passive is great but in practice is weird. I dont know why she needs to be hugged to walls for it to activate. On top of it it doesnt help her in active battles but just to roam. Ill suggest some ideas to consider (not all at the same time obvs).\r\n\r\n1- Let her rock surf on worked ground. This would help her to create paths to move while in lane, and surprise enemies. Also it would be cool to let her surf a little more farther from walls. My idea was to add a passive to R, that will let her keep surfing after getting out of walls more time depending on the level of R. For example, 1 extra sec  at lvl 1, and 2 and 3 secs at max level.\r\n\r\n2- Let her actively use rock surf while in combat, This one is more tricky, but it would be cool for her to be able to keep surfing for 2 or 3 secs after enering combat (dependding on the level of taliyah for example)\r\n\r\n&gt; ~~_**Worked Ground**_~~\r\nI will borrow this idea from someone i saw here on forums.\r\nI think WG should affect her abilities and give her new attributes, at least some of them.\r\n\r\nQ- Volley. Rework the skill to make her shoot 3 volleys on non-WG...and let her charge volleys while staying for some time on WG, to be able to get the 5 pellets stored. This would balance the damage of WG right now which is way too much or simply nothing. \r\nSummary...shooting nonchargeed vooley: 3 pellets.... shooting charged volley after some seconds in worked ground : 5 pellets.\r\n\r\nE: Minefield. Let her snare enemies who eplode the mines on a minefield casted on WG...and make the slow way stronger when the E was casted on WG.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Asura Gonza","date":"2017-01-04T17:22:43.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO its annoying and lazily thought to be honest.

The passive is just a situational Boots of Mobility with a rock board cosmetic. I honestly think removing the requirement to be near a wall wouldn't make the passive that much stronger. At the moment, it's just a tad inconvenient to move over a few steps to trigger the passive. It is technically a (minor) quality-of-life issue. I don't know how Taliyah players put up with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asura Gonza","date":"2017-01-03T14:04:42.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would you implement more tankiness on her?.

A 70% slow on the minefield would be enought to keep at bay any aggresor..and in case they decided to go in, the snare will kick in.\n\nBut theres a problem with this. . SOme suggested that when the mines were popped by an enemydash it would snare, but when Popped by a W throw it would not. I read somewhere that a rioter said they didnt wanted to give the mine popping 2 different scenearios because it was going to not be intuitive for enemies. So this is my new suggestion:\n\n> _**E Rework:**_\n\n**-If and enemy is hit by the INITIAL cast of  E, said enemy will get snared on the Spot for 0.75 sec.\n-If the enemy walks thru the minefield...he will get a 70% slow until he leaves the field.\n\n-If the enemy pops the mines with a dash or by a W pull/push.. He/she will get a counter on his head for 5 seconds (similar to Braum´s and Kench´s). Auto attacks and skills will consume this counter points and when they reach zero, the affected enemy will get snared for 2 secs and _damaged again_. **\n\nDepending on how many mines where popped, the amount of attacks required to activate the snare will vary. Ex: _If the enemy exploded the 4 mines, Taliyah/teammates will need just one autoattack/skill to activate the snare.... If the enemy popped one mine with the dash, Taly and friends will need 4 autos/skills to trigger the snare. And so on_ This way, Taliyah will be able to keep at bay assasins and dashers who venture into her without care.\n\nIMPORTANT: If the enemy was pulled/pushed to the minefield by Taliyah´s W, the counter will always be at max (5 hits) before applying the snare. This is to prevent Taliyah to pull, damage and instantly snare and damage again the enemy with an autoattack and being super oppresive. Also this will compensate Taliyah for using and E without using W...because you will be able to snare, slow the enemy... or in case of a dash..applying the counters depending on how many mines were popped. This will create a sense of respect to that skill. Enemies will have to think twice or thrice before rushing thru it, as they can get instasnared at the end of the dash by a simple autoattack or super slowed in case of walking/running thru it anyways, turning the skill into a real controlling danger zone for taliyah´s advantage.\n\n\nBtw, i liked that suggestion of rocksurf getting more speed.  What about on top of my suggestion of rock surf getting more surfing time out of walls, include ur suggestion of more speed but with a twist: The longer you keep your rock surf active, gradually the surfing speed gets up until reaching a cap.\n\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-30T21:10:37.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"seems a little much, her cc is fine where its at, 1 hard cc (w/ optional displacement) and an aoe slow, add that to her insane amount of damage with only 3 spells makes her pretty powerful in the right hands.  her problem is that the hard cc is too difficult to pull off and any tier of boots can easily escape it even in the slow field.  if her knock up radius was a little bigger, not too much though (and damage or cd would probably need to be adjusted accordingly), then that would fix alot of player issues.  im thinking about the size of chogaths knock up, maby a touch smaller.\n\nas for her passive, its not a bad passive but buffing it would kinda break her.  if she didnt have to stick to the walls, she would pretty much have mobility boots from the get-go.  she doesnt really need escapability on the passive, because as soon as you get rylais her q will slow any chasers and speed her up.\n\nall her potential isnt geared towards winning in her lane, its supposed to be geared towards winning in another teamates lane.  thats where she gets her steam to roll.  not alot of people realize that and just try to win their own lane, hence the lower winrate.  a quality of life buff to her would be including this in her tips page.  she not weak but she could use some touch up work.","replies":[{"poster":"Asura Gonza","date":"2016-12-31T02:07:48.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E8RhEdhF,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-12-30T21:10:37.822+0000)\n>\n\n> all her potential isnt geared towards winning in her lane, its supposed to be geared towards winning in another teamates lane.  thats where she gets her steam to roll.  not alot of people realize that and just try to win their own lane, hence the lower winrate.  a quality of life buff to her would be including this in her tips page.  she not weak but she could use some touch up work.\n\ni dont think her lower winrate is because people dont know how to play her. She was OP once and all her strong points were gutted because of it. Thats why i think she needs a semi rework on some of her skills because theres no way to buff her more..because according to riot her Q is too strong which IMO is debatable...and his W-E cannot be buffed anymore. SO she really needs at least some changes\n\nThanks for your opinion","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-31T04:08:50.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well now that i think about it, if che could get a bit of survivability in lane, it would give her the opportunities to roam instead of having to stay safe by the tower.  so if any buff she needs is some tankyness","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IA9hRfpP5q","date":"2016-12-30T16:19:49.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Taliyah is is fine.

Once u are engaged by a dasher blinker...even when getting them away with a W... you are still inminent danger. Thats why i suggested the reworked E.\n\nBut definitely she needs less cooldown time on her rock surf.
