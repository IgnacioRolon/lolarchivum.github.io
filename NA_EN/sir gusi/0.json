The principal could have gone to Kas, Braum, Voli,\r\nAnd for the students: Ori, Quin, Kalista, Karma, Diana, Vi, and many others but you chose champs that have resently gotten skins > PJ line and both have Ultimate skins and give them the legendary and prestige skins this really upsets me because it's clear you don't care about the minority players and just want money by releasing new skins for popular champs I'm considering getting that app that lets me play with skins for free instead of supporting you.","replies":[]}
