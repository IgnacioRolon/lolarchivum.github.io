If i delete my game setup source and quickly make it when i enter game, it is fine, but if i try to switch over, for instance using a hotkey or manually, the game crashes. Help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-14T16:39:51.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this on the updated client or both versions?  There's currently an issue per our[ known issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/231536768-Updated-Client-Known-Issues#h2q2) guide that's preventing the updated client from being streamed sometimes, so I'm curious if this crashing might be a result.  I suggest reporting this to our [client discussion boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) to let testers and the client devs knows.  You may want to reach out to OBS support as well in case an issue with your OBS itself could be causing the crash.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
