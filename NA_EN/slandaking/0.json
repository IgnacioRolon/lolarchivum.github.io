I see you are no longer allowed to receive loot do to previous restriction (roughly). Is this a bug or permanent? Many forums I have seen are blaming it as a bug in the game, but I would like some reassurance, or perhaps a correction.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T22:09:41.842+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a bug or something permanent.  You are not eligible to earn Hextech rewards until you show progress towards being positive in games, not when the punishment itself ends.  Since progress is not a linear line and can be different for every single player, there is no set amount of time we can share when you will be eligible again.  We do have an [article that explains this much more in-depth here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463).\n\nHope this helps alleviate some confusion!","replies":[{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2016-05-17T22:23:10.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"There is no specific timeframe for eligibility, and the length of the reform period may vary on a case by case basis. It all depends on the severity of your punishment, and on your behavior moving forward.\"\n\nI'm actually a little intrigued by this in regards to how riot monitors accounts. I'm not ready to believe that there are not set expirations based on restrictions given, but rather the ambiguity is to prevent players from measuring out their penalties based on the offense. Otherwise that would be ALOT of monitoring required to turn the on and off switch for rewards. \n\nCurious how you guys do it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlandaKing","date":"2016-05-25T21:53:25.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot, this does clear up a lot of the confusion regarding the topic!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-05-18T06:45:37.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also curious about \"how does it work\".

You should really work on that otherwise you're just going to keep on getting reported and possibly get perm banned one day. I don't really feel bad for toxic players. I feel whatever punishment they get they deserve. Next time if someone is being annoying to you, you can just report them or mute them. There's really no need to rage.","replies":[]}]}
