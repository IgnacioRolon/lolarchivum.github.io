PLEASE!!! &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-06-25T04:21:37.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahck! Sorry to hear about your enter key; hope it can get fixed soon!\n\nBut I think that's a pretty good suggestion actually; something that might have been overlooked since normally folks just press enter all the time. The best place to make a suggestion like that is over in the [**client discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) channel. You may not get a response from a dev, but they do check the Boards constantly looking at feedback and for inspiration, and there might be others who feel the same about a send button and can start a discussion to get more attention to the idea. :)","replies":[]}]}
