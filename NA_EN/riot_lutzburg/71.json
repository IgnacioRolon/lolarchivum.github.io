{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T05:07:00.327+0000","title":"Fritz, the Hextech Medic","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: Support\n\n**Inspiration**: Original inspiration was to create a scifi “medic” trope with a skillshot heal.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Fritz is a utility-centric Support Champion with powerful healing, buffs and movement tools to assist his allies. This suite of utility comes at the expense of his individual power, however, as most of his abilities require nearby allies to be most effective. Designing Fritz’s kit solely around a two man lane and restricting his ability to perform when alone allows his kit to have beefed up power in the specific and isolated use cases it was designed for.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Medium. Great care has gone into the concept of making a “healthy” healer in League of Legends, by avoiding many of the pain points associated with champions like Soraka and Sona before their recent reworks. Fritz’s theme is fun, and while not overly original, it takes advantages of classic and proven tropes in the sci-fi medic landscape.\n\n**Appearance**: Fritz is a science fiction-inspired, heavily outfitted, humanoid combat medic, with an array of gadgets, metallic armaments and glowing lights and liquids adorning his otherwise slender frame. All this extra equipment makes him appear much bulkier than he really is. He wields a wide-barreled, multi-faceted medic gun in combat, which has a variety of uses.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/la_ca_0415_guardians_of_the_galaxy_007_zps857cb861.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/300px-Medicbot_blu_zpsea3c4522.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Heavy_Flammer_zpsef0ce1b3.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/11487191873_9236f4fbb1_zpsbef9132a.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Dr. Arthur Fitzgerald, or “Fritz” as his colleagues call him, is a showboating, sarcastic, and overly arrogant combat medic and mercenary. Fritz once served in the Demacian military, but was dishonorably discharged for disobeying orders in the heat of a mission. His superiors claim that he was compromising the operation, but Fritz is all too eager to tell you a different side to that story.\n\nAfter a few years spent wandering Valoran without a sense of purpose, Fritz crossed paths with a scientist who had an explosive personality that rivaled his own- Ziggs. For a brief time, Fritz offered his assistance to Ziggs, before managing to con the errant hexplosive expert out of his latest invention for what Ziggs thought was “exploratory research and development performed purely for the advancement of medical science.” After his somewhat dubious ‘partnership’ with Ziggs ended, Fritz started taking jobs from the highest bidders to ensure the safety of soldiers and other combatants, regardless of the nature or integrity of the mission. Despite hundreds of jobs, Fritz never left a single man behind; thanks in large part to his shiny (and stolen!) hextech med-suit.\n\nOver time, Fritz gained a reputation as the hero of every mission he went on, and he was all too eager to indulge in the praise. It wasn’t long until his accolades drew the attention of the League’s High Council of Equity. They instantly saw the value of a combat-trained medic fighting alongside the pantheon of the League’s other summonable Champions. Of course, it didn’t take much to convince the self-indulgent Fritz that his heroic deeds would be best served (and most widely viewed) on the legendary Fields of Justice...\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful healing, unique and varied utility, ability to heal through Grievous Wounds, ability to provide a gap closer to allies\n\n**Weaknesses**: Diminished power when not near allies, heal ability requires proper aiming and timing, long cooldowns, low personal damage output\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:43}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:92}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Fritz fires a glob of plasma from his medic gun at 600 range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11551_btn_zps282d99a0.jpg\n**Passive- Taste of Your Own Medicine**: Every 30 seconds, the allied target of Fritz’s next ability also grants them a spell shield which lasts for 2.5 seconds, causing the next enemy ability used against them to have no effect. In addition, the enemy who uses that ability suffers magic damage equal to 8% (+1%/100 AP) of their maximum health. Successfully casting spells on allies decreases the cooldown of this ability by 1 second.\nDesign Philosophy: This is a thematically fun ability based on the common wordplay of the spell’s name. Fritz has very low personal damage output, but is set firmly in the role of utility support. As a result, this ability merges the two, allowing Fritz to indirectly contribute to his team’s damage output when performing his duties skillfully.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5594_pas_zpsf8dd9c6b.jpg\n**Q- Electroshock (9 sec)**: Fritz launches a hextech defibrillator which clings to a target champion, tethering to them for up to three seconds or until the target breaks a 900 unit range. Fritz receives 20/22.5/25/27.5/30% (+2%/100 AP) bonus move speed for the duration. The ability has additional effects, based on the tether target:\n\nOn Ally Cast: Ally's movement speed is also increased by the same amount as Fritz. If they remain tethered for the duration, their AD increases by 10/12.5/15/17.5/20% for an additional three seconds.\n\nOn Enemy Cast: Enemy suffers 10/15/20/25/30 (+30% AP) magic damage every .25 seconds. If they remain tethered for the duration, they are stunned for 1 second and take an additional 30/45/60/75/90 (+15% AP) magic damage.\n\nThis ability cannot be used without a tether target.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability requires another champion to be used, which prevents Fritz players from power-farming their Passive. It also greatly diminishes Fritz’s power in solo lanes, which is a desired trait for a strictly support-oriented Champion.  I chose to make this a targeted ability so that other player characters can't inadvertently body block the defibrillator, leading to the incorrect usage of the ability at presumably very inopportune times.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16405_btn_zps506e6465.jpg\n**W- Gloopoline (18 sec)**: Fritz spawns a large, rubbery splotch of gloop at a target location. Allied champions can click on the gloop, causing them to walk towards it and bounce off of it in the direction they are currently facing (issuing a new move command cancels the effect). This causes them to bounce 600 units forward, and can be used to pass through walls or other terrain. The gloopoline bursts after 3 seconds or after the first champion uses it. The gloopoline can also be burst if walked over by enemy champions, though this does not trigger the bounce effect and instead causes enemies to be knocked back slightly. Fritz’s passive can be activated when an allied champion successfully bounces off the gloopoline.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is inspired by Thresh’s Dark Passage, and provides huge playmaking opportunities and a small window of isolated but powerful utility. It allows for emergent gameplay synergy for junglers who lack powerful initiations or gap closers and also allows for safe counter-jungling tactics.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5775_pas_zpsb5f66ba6.jpg\n**E- Heal-O-Matic (12 sec)**: Fritz fires a healing beam of energy from his medic gun in a line (850 range), healing the first allied champion it intersects with for 60/90/120/150/180 (+30% AP). This beam ignores other allied and enemy units. If the allied champion has recently taken damage equal to or greater than 8% of their max health within the last 2 seconds, the heal amount is increased by 50%. Successfully healing an allied target also heals Fritz for 50% of the amount his target was healed for.\n**Design Philosophy**: The bonus heal amount based on taking recent damage encourages active trading and battle in lane, while also diminishing the unwanted \"top off\" effect commonly seen in passive lanes. The skillshot component has multiple benefits, including adding a layer of skill to landing clutch heals and preventing Frtiz from being able to sustain himself in a solo lane.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14037_pas_zps22ca08dd.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14048_pas_zps16161216.jpg\n**R- Hypocritical Oath (80 sec)**: Fritz sarcastically recites a line from his Hippocratic Oath while powering up his hextech suit, increasing his ability power by 20/25/30 for each nearby allied champion (including himself). This effect lasts for 12/16/20 seconds. During this time of power, Fritz can reactivate the ability to cast a targeted 250/400/600 (+40% AP) heal on a single allied champion. This heal is so powerful that it ignores the effects of Grievous Wounds. Once the heal has been cast, the bonus ability power is instantly lost.\n**Design Philosophy**: Once again, Fritz’s power stems from his ability to coordinate and empower his allies. The second activation of his Ultimate is similar to that of Riven’s, and allows for interesting decision-making as a Fritz player- does he continue to enjoy the bonus power of his basic abilities, or cash it in for a powerful heal? Should I risk letting my marksman die while assisting the rest of the team with augmented abilities, or do I need to cast the heal immediately to make a game-changing save? The scaling ability power starts high at rank 1 because it will most likely only be used with 2-3 allies in the area.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T00:30:25.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping up Fritz in honor of Chris Pratt's new Jurassic World scene!
