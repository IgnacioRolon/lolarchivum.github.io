{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T06:19:59.420+0000","title":"Havel, the War Hero","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: AP Support\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to embody what a good support/leader does by creating abilities that foster teamwork and leadership.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Havel has one purpose- aid his team even at the expense of himself, and his entire kit reflects that goal.  Havel is completely nonviable in any role other than Support, as a majority of his kit deals little to no damage.  His utility and teamfight effects are second to none, however, and Havel really shines as a true, fully fledged Support Champion.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Havel is a particularly niche Champion falling under the role of total team reliance.  He is ideal for coordinated 5v5 teams with great communication skills, but will likely perform poorly in solo queue, especially at lower skill caps.  Havel does not really play like any Champion in the roster today, which makes his simplistic kit both novel but also untested.  Havel is a very simplistic Support champion, making him ideal for new players, or those who find themselves as the last pick in a ranked game.\n\n**Appearance**: A grizzled war veteran with accolades and awards pinned up and down his military uniform, complete with shoulder tassels. Carries a gold-studded commemorative pistol as his weapon, which he was awarded from the Demacian military on the night of his retirement.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/portrait_of_the_hero_by_inobras-d3fp614_zpse686e7c1.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/treister_zps094bdf2a.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Havel is a true Demacian war hero who, after decades of faithful service, was forced into retirement due to an incurable medical condition which left him unqualified for frontline combat. With the thrill of battle still coursing through his veins, he joined the League to continue serving his city-state and the honor of his people. \n\n**Strengths**: Multiple team-wide buffs and sustain, mild crowd control, a boon in team fights\n\n**Weaknesses**: low damage, team dependent, weak laning abilities, does not scale well with items\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:201}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Havel fires a round from his commemorative military pistol, dealing physical damage from 500 range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6921_btn_zps3080c7ed.jpg\n**Passive- Battle Scars**: Havel lives for the thrill of battle, empowering himself whenever dealt a blow. Whenever Havel loses health from an attack, he gains between 1-20/35/50/75 bonus armor and MR for the next 3 seconds, based on the damage incurred.  Taking 20% or more of his max health grants the maximum effects of this ability.  If Havel is dealt a blow that would lower his current resistance bonus, the duration of original bonus is refreshed instead.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a thematically fun ability which rewards Havel players for ‘taking one for the team,’ a common practice among good support players.  This increase in armor allows Havel the possibility of escaping after performing his honorable duty.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6787_pas_zpsbcabff73.jpg\n**Q- Warning Shot (6 sec)**: Havel fires his commemorative pistol toward the ground at a  target location. Enemies struck by the shot suffer magic damage. Enemies near the edges of the target location are feared away from the impact zone for .5 seconds, but are not damaged. (This ability functions similar to Hecarim's Ultimate.)\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is great for both poking in lane as well as deterring enemy engagements.  It is especially effective if a Havel player is able to both damage one enemy while simultaneously fearing the second away from their ally.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6119_btn_zps4ea14ad7.jpg\n**W- Attack Orders (8 sec)**: Havel marks an enemy champion, gaining vision of them with a target over their heads and causing them to take 5/6/7/8/9/10% bonus damage from all sources for the next 4 seconds. This ability also slows the target by 25/28.5/32/36/40% for the first 1.5 seconds and deals minor magic damage in its own right.\nRank-ups increase slow amount and damage modification.\n**Design Philosophy**: The key to this ability’s effectiveness is its damage amplification.  However, since Havel’s personal damage is so low, he must rely on the offensive capabilities of his allies to capitalize on its effects.  The slowing component should make this relatively easy to achieve.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_596_btn_zps1e0f00df.jpg\n**E- Rally Point (26 sec)**: Havel creates a beacon from long range (2,000 units) that appears on the minimap and makes a noise similar to a ping. Allies within a range of 5,000 units who move toward the beacon gain 10/15/20/25/30% bonus movement speed and are healed for 8/10/12/14/16% (+1%/100 AP) of their max health when arriving at the beacon. This beacon lasts 10 seconds.  Visually, Havel fires a flare from his pistol that slowly descends onto the target area, similarly to Anivia’s ‘soul’ when in egg form.  The beacon ends when the flare touches the ground.\nRank-ups increase healing done and bonus movement speed, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is yet another utility ability useful for creating rally points (as its name suggests) for allies to meet around.  This could include enemy or allied towers, dragon or baron, or an impromptu location within the jungle.  This ability is incredibly effective when pressured at a tower that needs to be defended, while Havel’s allies are enroute but still a ways’ off.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_9913_btn_zps26a2a86a.jpg\n**R- Last Stand (70 sec)**: Havel inspires his nearby allies to fight until the very end, granting them bonus health/resource regeneration, movement speed, attack damage and ability power based on their missing health. The lower their health when Last Stand is used, the stronger the spell becomes. These bonuses last 8/10/12 seconds.\nRank-ups increase bonuses and their duration, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: Havel, as the pinnacle of team leadership and bravery, has an Ultimate designed to inspire allies to never give up.  This ability is a fantastic re-engagement tool to be used after the first round of a team fight, especially if it didn’t go so well for Havel’s team.  It incentivizes players to continue to fight and be aggressive and active, rather than limping home and resetting the battle.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"Raz98","date":"2015-04-06T23:38:32.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would throw money at my screen in heaps for this character.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-07T00:41:50.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raz98,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GA7hJgVT,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-04-06T23:38:32.535+0000)\n>\n> I would throw money at my screen in heaps for this character.\n\nHaha wow, thank you!

Yes, the fear is probably about that range.\n\nI agree with you about his design.  He's solid and semi-interesting and doesn't do anything crazy or broken.  I think he's probably a little too \"safe\" and I think that's what has you a little unsure about him.  Especially compared to the rest of my designs, which tend to be batshit crazy most of the time.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"IForgot2buyBoots","date":"2015-04-30T01:55:44.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the design.
