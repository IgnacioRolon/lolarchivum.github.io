{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T10:23:06.592+0000","title":"Lydia, the Ethereal Seamstress","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"**Role**: AP Support, AP Mage\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion who used some sort of tethering skillshot system as the foundation for her entire kit.  The other motivating factor for Lydia was in my desire to create a champion who personified the phrase, “elegance in simplicity.”  As a result, Lydia’s abilities will likely be seen as quite simple when under a magnifying glass of scrutiny.  This was an exercise in experimenting with kit flow and user enjoyment; not to create a mechanically complex powerhouse champion.  Having said this, I ask that you be open-minded about Lydia.\n\n**General Design Philosoph**y: Lydia is a support with a level 1 ultimate that functions similarly to Corki’s recharging missiles, with roughly the same skillshot style.  She fires coils of ribbons that tether onto enemies and allies, affecting them in various ways based on the rest of her kit.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: High.  Having an entirely skillshot-dependent champion may prove unviable, especially during the laning phase.  In addition, the skill required to effectively tether the intended target for each spell may prove too high or even unrealistic to achieve.\n\n**Appearance**: Lydia is a seamstress with all manner of fabrics, yarns, and pins adorning her. She has a very soft, kind, nurturing attitude, but also seems a little naive about the world around her, and its dangers. Her various ribbons take on all manner of artistic styles and materials based on their effects, and will include things such as checkerboard, polka dots, silk, satin and more.  Lydia’s ribbons spawn from all four sides of her, allowing multiple ribbons to tether to the same target without visually overlapping.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/h_e_l_l_o-1459970_zpsddf38d58.jpg\n*Admittedly I am experimenting with a little click bait by making this the thumbnail image of this thread... Let's see if it works!*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/beauty_of_china_girl-986267_zpse2b28d1a.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/touhouwhiteribbonsgreenhairkagiyamahinaanimegirls1250x873wallpaper_wallpaperswacom_32_zps9d37f8df.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/gpjm6embcvnxprop19y4_zpsqkddozqt.gif\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/yomiko2_zpse2553180.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Indian_female_ribbon_dancer_by_LeoTao_zps37ce8094.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Lydia is a seamstress and ribbon dancer from Ionia.\n\n**Strengths**: Suite of stacking and overlapping crowd control effects, powerful sustain on both herself and an ally, low cooldowns\n\n**Weaknesses**: Must manage an ammo style resource system, is entirely skillshot dependent, low base stats, requires a teammate to use abilities defensively\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:43}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:42}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Lydia fires an energized sewing needle from range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16895_pas_zpsbf73ff75.jpg\n**R- Ethereal Ribbon (.5 seconds)**: This ability is automatically learned at level 1 and has four ranks, similar to Elise and Jayce’s Ultimates.  Lydia launches a coiled ribbon from her gown, latching onto the first enemy unit that it connects with (max range of 1,000).  This is a skillshot similar in width and cast speed to Corki's ultimate. Lydia creates and stores these ribbons, up to a cap of 5/6/7/8. A new ribbon is created every 6/5.5/5/4 seconds (this is unaffected by cooldown reduction). This ability can only be activated after Q, W, or E has been cast, which effectively “preps” the Ethereal Ribbon with a particular type of ammo. Each ribbon lasts 2-5 seconds (based on the spell used) or until the tether is broken (1200 distance). The ribbons' appearance is based on the spell the ribbon is channeling from Lydia.  Note that these ribbons can also be targeted at allies directly (not as a skillshot), which grant each one a unique and beneficial effect for Lydia and her target.\nRank-ups increase ribbon cap and decrease charge time.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Lydia’s core ability and what the rest of her kit is designed around.  Her abilities use an ammo system, which acts as a vital resource that must be managed in order to effectively use her to her optimal performance.  Lydia can hold onto several of these ribbons for a sustained trade, kite or chase, or she can choose to use them more judiciously over the course of her laning phase, only using them to farm and poke as needed.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15246_pas_zpse053696c.jpg\n**Passive- Triage**: Lydia gains 5/10/15/20 bonus AP for every Ribbon she currently has active. Design Philosophy: The stacking AP promotes active and aggressive play.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5774_pas_zps498af651.jpg\n**Q (7 seconds)- **\n\n**Impair (enemy target)**: Lydia's next Ethereal Ribbon immediately deals 60/95/130/190/250 (+70% AP) magic damage to the enemy target, plus deals 70% of that damage to all surrounding targets. The primary target is then slowed by 30% for the next 3 seconds.\n\n**Infuse (allied target)**: Lydia's next Ethereal Ribbon shields herself and an allied target for 60/90/120/160/200 (+30% AP), and increases both of their movement speeds by 30% for the next 2.5 seconds. The shield lasts 5 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: Offensively this ability functions similarly to Twisted Fate’s Red Card.  Tying the ally speed boost or enemy slow to one spell is important, as it prevents Lydia from ‘doubling down’ on her ability to both chase and kite simultaneously.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5775_pas_zps9d8b1c9a.jpg\n**W (8 seconds)- **\n\n**Siphon (enemy target)**: Lydia's next Ethereal Ribbon deals magic damage every .5 seconds for the next 5 seconds. Damage per second: 10/17/25/34/50 (+8% AP).  Full duration damage: 100/170/250/340/500 (+80% AP).\n\n**Renewal (allied target)**: Lydia's next Ethereal Ribbon heals herself and an ally every .5 seconds for the next 5 seconds. Heal per second: 14/22/30/38/48 (+30% AP).  Full duration heal: 70/110/150/190/240 (+30% AP).\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is inspired by Karma’s old W.  Lydia is designed to be a sticking mage and deal magic damage over time, and this ability allows her to do that effectively.  This is her primary damaging ability, which is why it’s also tied to her heal, to yet again prevent the doubling down of both high damage and healing on-the-go.  This should create interesting and opportunistic decisions for players to make, especially during duels.  The cooldown of this ability is relatively low compared to its potential up-time, knowing that it's very unlikely that a Lydia player will be able to fully channel the ability when cast on a fleeing enemy target.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8926_pas_zps1864ceb8.jpg\n**E (9 seconds)-**\n\n**Root (enemy target)**: Lydia's next Ethereal Ribbon will snare an enemy target after remaining tethered for 2 seconds. This effect also deals 40/70/110/150/200 (+40% AP) magic damage; half on initial cast and half upon successfully stunning the target.\n\n**Embolden (allied target)**:  Lydia's next Ethereal Ribbon grants herself and an allied target a large defensive stat boost that increases over a 4 second duration of being tethered together. Armor/MR bonus after 4 seconds: 30/50/70/90/120.  This defensive buff lasts for an additional 2 seconds following the end of the tether.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a delayed snare that requires a bit of sticking power to initiate.  To compensate, the stun is actually quite long.  If Lydia is out of range to stun an enemy, she can instead use E to drastically reduce the damage her allies will receive as they lead the charge.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-07T10:37:05.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anime waifu needs some love.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revvy","date":"2015-01-05T01:08:25.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lydia, the Anime Waifu","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T18:34:34.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still have mixed feelings about Lydia, but people seem to think she's alright as a concept.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-03-24T13:51:26.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dancing girl is from the anime Blade and Soul if I recall correctly.

How have I not seen this before? It's been a while since I've looked at your page, but since you've come back, I thought I'd give it a look over. How did I miss this one? It's so cool! I'm really excited to review this one!\n\nR (Ethereal Ribbon): I'm very glad you gave a range/width for to gauge this ability (though I would say the range is more similar to Ahri's Q. Perhaps you meant speed when comparing it to Corki's missles?) I would make it so she takes a little longer to refresh her ribbons since only waiting 5 seconds at level 1 is nothing (not to mention her short cooldowns on her normal spells). Maybe having it at 10/8/6/4, or increasing the cooldowns on her basic spells. \n\nEdit: Perhaps a good way for people to envision this ability is with Leblanc's chain. It has almost the same range and speed)\n\nPassive (Triage): Very nice\n\nQ (Impair/Infuse): Also very nice, and if she hits this ability on an enemy, it's much easier to land her other spells on the enemy. Since she's purely skillshot reliant, I approve. I also like how you make these abilities have lots of utility.power since she's lacking an ultimate. I'd probably increase the cooldown a little bit, as I'm sure she'll build quite a bit of CDR as both mage and support. Already having it at a 6 second cooldown and having the effect last for 3 seconds is a little overbearing.\n\nW (Siphon/Renewal): I'm confused with the math on siphon. 5sec/.5ticks =10 ticks of damage per second. 20X10=200 max damage at level 1, but you have 100. Not to mention the scaling (which should probably be 8% per tick, up to 80% AP max). As for siphon, maybe a cool element to have would be instead of it dealing so much damage, it would drain a small portion of the units armor/mr and bolster hers by the same amount. However, if she has another ribbon tied to an ally, it bolsters them instead. That's what I get out of an ability that has \"Siphon\" for its name at any rate. Again, 7 second cooldown for 5 seconds worth of an ability is quite a lot. At max CDR, you can always have it up.\n\nE (Root/Embolden): Very nice. Like how it has a longer cooldown. I feel like the others should have a cooldown roughly equal to that, but that may just be me. \n\nEdit: If you run with the idea armor/mr drain for Siphon, have the armor/mr boost bolstered by the stolen resistances go to the ally tagged with Embolden. If an ally is not chained with Embolden, the stats go to Lydia.\n\nOverall: Wow! Such an awesome champ that I would love to play on the rift!

Looks like you missed this concept and I missed your review of it!  That's kind of funny.  Thanks for the review, as always!\n\nR- Yep, \"range\" was supposed to refer to cast speed.\n\nAgreed on the cooldowns being too short.  This has been adjusted.\n\nW- Yep, the math is way wrong.  Adjusting it now.  On a more frontline style mage/support, an MR/armor buff would make sense, but as it stands, I feel like she is meant to be a fragile utility mage and I don't think she'd get much use out of these stats when played properly.  They would only take up valuable power allocation into empty stats that won't matter much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spirangle","date":"2015-01-13T17:24:40.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This champion has a straightforward concept for her kit, but she has a lot of moving parts and I worry about the reliability of her ribbons.
