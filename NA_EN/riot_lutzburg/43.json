{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T01:06:11.076+0000","title":"Locke, Death's Command","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":40,"down_votes":6,"body":"**Role**: AD Bruiser, Jungler\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create an undead Noxian general who still commands his loyal skeleton soldiers in combat despite having all died in battle ages ago.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Locke is an extended, sustainable fighter similar to Yorick and Warwick.  He has powerful healing tools and consistent, sustained damage over long engagements.  In addition, Locke possesses an interesting, mobile squad of soldiers which he summons to aid him in battle.  These soldiers come in three varieties, each with unique capabilities and uses.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Very high.  Locke falls into an odd combination of champions, most notably Yorick.  With Yorick currently undergoing a rework, it’s quite possible that Locke could end up being even more similar to the Gravedigger.  With the release of Azir, Locke also runs the risk of stepping on the talon'd toes of Shurima's Emperor.\n\n**Appearance**: A formal and well decorated Commander from Demacia, well past his prime as he’s, well, dead.  Shredded and tattered cloth, decrepit skin and protruding bones are all par for the course here.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/ec41bbc8e6403f0791dcd7a00801dea9_zpsulm7eyo9.jpg\n\n**Lore**: *Centuries ago, Locke was a respected Commander of Demacia's finest soldiers.  These young warriors were renowned across Valoran for their tactical strength, their comradery, and most famously their undying loyalty to one another.  When King Jarvan II sent them on a scouting mission to the Shadow Isles, they had no idea just how undying their loyalty would turn out to be...*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/paladin_mckell_by_smexyheroes-d4ir6wt_zpsxmpklpzj.jpg\n*Locke and his loyal soldiers, entrenched in a bloody battle to defend their King, Jarvan II*\n\n*As soon as their ship hit the shoreline of the kingdom of death and tortured souls, Locke knew something wasn't right.  Quickly he ordered his fastest men to fan out and patrol the area, while his most enduring defenders were tasked with guarding the perimeter of their camp.  Finally, he had his most heroic and battle-hardened soldiers stand at his side as they begun to explore the horrors of the Shadow Isles, delving deeper towards the center of the island.*\n\n*After some time and without warning, a piercing shriek echoed across the thick foliage of the Twisted Treeline, where the battalion had somehow stumbled towards.  The faintest of scurrying and shuffling could be heard among the trees, startling and shaking the men's resolves.  Locke rallied, however, urging his men to focus and stay together.  His words of encouragement would be his last as a Commander of the living, however, as the nest of Vilemaw's brood which they had unknowingly stumbled into would prove to be their silent, remorseless demise.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/league_print_twisted_treeline_by_yandesign-d7otra0_zpspeo1oiud.jpg\n\n*With a startled gasp, Locke awoke.  He had no idea how long he had been unconscious.  As he pushed himself off the ground and into a wobbled stance, he somehow felt... different.  It didn't take long for him to realize his fate.  An inconsolable sense of grief and devastation filled Locke's very soul; what little of it remained, at least.  That's when he sensed it, though.  His resolve, his will... they were weakened, yes, but still intact.  This gave the sterling commander a sense of hope, despite the immeasurable loss of his mortality.*\n\n*On a whim, he called out to his battalion, hopeful that at least a few of them managed to survive.  There was no response.  Again he called, louder this time.  His decrepit voice echoed across the barren forest of rotting trees.  The Shadow Isles had changed, he thought momentarily.  How long had he been unconscious?  Stirring himself from his own thoughts, he shouted a third time to his brothers in arms, raising his ragged fist into the air as he did.  Just then, an even more vile and ravaged arm burst through the dirt at his feet.  A tattered and dilapidated corpse pulled itself loose from the soft and spongy earth of the forest.*\n\n*Locke stared in disbelief, his eyes wide and his mouth agape as the zombified remains of his lieutenant loosened a spear from the ground and dusted itself off.  With a resolute salute and a crack of its bony heels, am ominous though respectful hiss escaped the skull's mouth- \"Ready to serve, Commander.  What are your orders?\"  It was in this moment that Locke realized his army was now under Death's Command.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Army_zpsdxxzbhga.jpg\n*Locke leading his army of undead soldiers into battle*\n\n**Strengths**: Amazing zone denial and territory control, lane sustain, powerful single target slow, consistent auto attack damage\n\n**Weaknesses**: requires long setup time to be most effective, non existent burst damage, can be easily kited\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:83}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:19}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A melee strike with a rusted but clearly once ornate sword.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11305_pas_zpsodcdggjm.jpg\n**R- Summon Soldier (2 sec)**: This ability is automatically learned at level 1. The player presses R,  then Q/W/E to place a soldier on the battlefield at a target location. This causes a soldier to burst from the ground, requiring a slight summoning time before becoming active. Locke can store up to 2/3/4/5 soldiers at a time. Soldiers regenerate every 18/16/14/12 seconds. Deploying soldiers does not affect the cooldown of Locke's basic abilities.\nRank-ups increase soldier capacity, lower recharge time and increase the damage and health of all soldiers.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a combination of Teemo and Karma’s Ultimate.  It allows Locke to place soldiers at a target location, the variety of which is based on which of his basic abilities he activates at the time of placement.  Each undead soldier behaves differently and has unique properties.  Some follow Locke like Elise spiderlings, others patrol areas and then dive onto enemies similar to Maokai saplings, and others still create immovable and impassible terrain.  Unlike Yorick, who treats his ghouls as disposable minions, Locke and his soldiers share mutual respect for each other, which is represented in the rest of his kit.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11124_pas_zpsbzhh0zgj.jpg\n**Passive- Pledge of the Fallen**: Soldiers that fall in battle near Locke lower the recharge time for summoning a new soldier by 3 seconds. In addition, Locke becomes invigorated by his soldier's loyalty, causing his next basic attack to deal bonus physical damage.\nDesign Philosophy: Locke needs his soldiers to be effective in battle.  If his soldiers are falling, he is losing effectiveness, so this Passive is designed to rubberband him back into a decent place.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17527_pas_zpswsvythi5.jpg\n**Q- Blade of the High Command (6 seconds)**: Locke charges his blade with the spirits of his soldiers, resetting his auto attack timer and causing his next attack to deal bonus physical damage. This ability deals 15% bonus damage for every charge of Summon Soldier Locke currently possesses, up to 45/60/75/90% bonus damage.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8782_pas_zpsemxa6jbk.jpg\n**RQ- Foot Soldier**: Locke summons a combat troop wielding a sword or spear that follows him in battle, prioritizing his target and functioning similarly to a voidling that deals physical damage. This soldier lasts up to 30 seconds or until killed, has moderate attack damage, low health and moderate speed.\nDesign Philosophy: the bonus damage based on soldier charges is intended to provide Locke with a fighting chance when he gets caught unexpectedly and without any soldiers on the map. Not having his army puts him at a severe disadvantage, so having a more reliable form of damage helps compensate for this.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12001_pas_zpslgv4dnfw.jpg\n**W- Undying Loyalty (13 seconds)**: Passive: Nearby soldiers' attack damage is increased by .5% for every 1% of health Locke is missing.\nActive: the lowest health soldier near Locke sacrifices itself for his commander. Locke absorbs this energy, healing for 6/7/8/9/10% of his max health. There must be a soldier nearby to activate this ability.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_4224_pas_zps98jdolue.jpg\n**RW- Shield Soldier**: Locke summons an immobile shield soldier that creates impassible terrain and deals minor AoE magic damage in the form of a demonic green burn when enemies are within melee range of it. This decrepit aura deals more damage the longer it remains active.  This soldier can be used to block skillshots such as Nidalee’s Spear.  This soldier lasts up to 30 seconds or until killed, has low attack damage but massive health.\n**Design Philosophy**: Locke has very low burst damage, and as such needs a way to survive his preferred method of long, drawn out engagements.  The attack damage boost also helps Locke turn the tides of losing battles, a common thematic tactic for an Undead General to employ.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16950_btn_zpstduliygm.jpg\n**E- Beyond the Grave (16 seconds)**: Locke summons a skeletal hand that bursts through the ground at a target location, rooting the nearest enemy in place for 1.5 seconds and dealing magic damage.  If there is no target to root, the hands pull themselves out of the ground and become a spear soldier instead, which follows Locke into combat.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increases damage.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8086_pas_zpsbtyfteju.jpg\n**RE- Scout Soldier**: Using vector targeting, Locke summons a patrolling soldier that grants vision of the area. This ghoul-like skeleton runs at and attaches itself to the first target it sees, dealing physical damage over time and crippling the enemy's movement speed by 70% for 3 seconds before collapsing. The ability continues granting vision on the target for an additional 4 seconds. This soldier lasts up to 15 seconds, has very low health but incredible speed and attack damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: This provides Locke with a much needed way of closing the distance between him and his target.  It also provides an additional way to summon soldiers for his undead army.  The patrolling soldier functions similarly to Maokai’s Saplings, though it patrols a short distance in order to grant continual vision of the surrounding area.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my unique concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread)","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-16T01:18:40.685+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually love this idea, mostly because it's clearly articulated and that it was well thought out, doesn't seem ridiculously overequipped or underequipped and does have clearly outlined downfalls.\n\nWell done, OP.

I don't think he'd be a Noxian general. Sion and Urgot are not really the norm for Noxus. Sion is the foray of Noxus into using dark magic to raise back a champion that had fallen. Instead of the hero they had hoped for, they got an undead juggernaut who feels nothing. While the results are great, i doubt it would be something they could reproduce. Urgot of course is more of a Frankenstein, with the Executioner's ravaged body being 'fixed' with a mix of twisted technology and LOTS of stitches. Honestly this champion seems more like he might come from the Shadow Isles. Perhaps he's the 'Ruined King' that the Blade is named after. Or maybe a general to said king. Just the magic he has, the powers, and the general theme seem far more consistent with Shadow Isles than Noxus.\n\n2. His three soldiers are certainly all great, but his ult, due to starting with a point in it, feels less impactful.

The Demacian General or the Shadow Isles \"Ruined King\" (which is totally awesome, by the way!).  It's a tough call.  Honestly I think the best idea might just be to merge the two together!\n\n2- I see what you mean and I hesitantly agree with you.  I'm a little worried that Locke has a LOT of hidden power relegated to the various bonuses he gets from having his army near him, die near him, not be near him, etc.  I think it might be a little too early to tell whether or not his kit can afford some more power baked into it, even if it results in his Ult feeling a little underwhelming.","replies":[{"poster":"ZylotheWolfbane","date":"2015-03-16T18:36:34.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1- Glad to help, I could see the merging of the two actually working out. From the Bard animated video we got, we know that Noxus will send out armed companies and raiding parties in search of powerful artifacts, and magics. Maybe  ancient Noxus tried to send Locke to lead a company of soldiers to the Shadow Isles to try and bring back traces of Shadow Isles magic, or some artifacts from there, but Locke and his soldiers fell under the sway of the twisted magic of the Shadow Isles. Locke however had such a strong will, he kept some of his mind even in death, and still commanded the loyalty of his soldiers, even if he now served a new nation, the Shadow Isles? Could be pretty awesome, especially if Locke was even older than Sion, could have some awesome interactions with Sion, where Locke is this ancient Noxian general that 'vanished mysteriously' but Sion looked up to in life? Could be cool.\n\n2- I understand that, it makes sense. Unfortunately it's difficult to gauge since there's no gameplay to really check out, but if Riot did something like this, I really think testing an Ult ability would be a good way to give him a bit more impact, especially if he gets caught out without soldiers, being able to just push RR to panic and get a more potent soldier/more soldiers up instead of pressing RQ-RW-RE. If the cooldown was especially long as well, it could help him have a panic button, so that once in a while he doesn't NEED an extended engagement to be effective. Obviously it's not something he can do every fight, but it makes it so that if he's the only one on his team getting fed, he can pick fights when his 'Ult' is up, and use it to press his advantage. The enemy team of course wants to push in on short skirmishes anytime his 'Ult' is down. Just a thought, because of how short fights can be in League, champions that excell at extended engagements need some way to impact short fights as well at least every now and then. Thus things like Azir/Warwick/Yorick ults etc. They really excell in extended fights when they can get their abilities/attacks off a lot, but their ults are all quite impactful, and powerful, and can suddenly change how a fight is going, even if it's not a long fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-18T08:28:04.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZylotheWolfbane,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=A7M07lHQ,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-03-16T18:36:34.036+0000)\n>\n\nI wrote up Locke's lore tonight based heavily on your ideas and I absolutely love it!  Check it out!\n\n **Lore**: *Centuries ago, Locke was a respected Commander of Demacia's finest soldiers.  These young warriors were renowned across Valoran for their tactical strength, their comradery, and most famously their undying loyalty to one another.  When King Jarvan II sent them on a scouting mission to the Shadow Isles, they had no idea just how undying their loyalty would turn out to be...*\n\n*As soon as their ship hit the shoreline of the kingdom of death and tortured souls, Locke knew something wasn't right.  Quickly he ordered his fastest men to fan out and patrol the area, while his most enduring defenders were tasked with guarding the perimeter of their camp.  Finally, he had his most heroic and battle-hardened soldiers stand at his side as they begun to explore the horrors of the Shadow Isles, delving deeper towards the center of the island.*\n\n*After some time and without warning, a piercing shriek echoed across the thick foliage of the Twisted Treeline, where the battalion had somehow stumbled towards.  The faintest of scurrying and shuffling could be heard among the trees, startling and shaking the men's resolves.  Locke rallied, however, urging his men to focus and stay together.  His words of encouragement would be his last as a Commander of the living, however, as the nest of Vilemaw's brood which they had unknowingly stumbled into would prove to be their silent, remorseless demise.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/league_print_twisted_treeline_by_yandesign-d7otra0_zpspeo1oiud.jpg\n\n*With a startled gasp, Locke awoke.  He had no idea how long he had been unconscious.  As he pushed himself off the ground and into a wobbled stance, he somehow felt... different.  It didn't take long for him to realize his fate.  An inconsolable sense of grief and devastation filled Locke's very soul; what little of it remained, at least.  That's when he sensed it, though.  His resolve, his will... they were weakened, yes, but still intact.  This gave the sterling commander a sense of hope, despite the immeasurable loss of his mortality.*\n\n*On a whim, he called out to his battalion, hopeful that at least a few of them managed to survive.  There was no response.  Again he called, louder this time.  His decrepit voice echoed across the barren forest of rotting trees.  The Shadow Isles had changed, he thought momentarily.  How long had he been unconscious?  Stirring himself from his own thoughts, he shouted a third time to his brothers in arms, raising his ragged fist into the air as he did.  Just then, an even more vile and ravaged arm burst through the dirt at his feet.  A tattered and dilapidated corpse pulled itself loose from the soft and spongy earth of the forest.*\n\n*Locke stared in disbelief, his eyes wide and his mouth agape as the zombified remains of his lieutenant loosened a spear from the ground and dusted itself off.  With a resolute salute and a crack of its bony heels, am ominous though respectful hiss escaped the skull's mouth- \"Ready to serve, Commander.  What are your orders?\"  It was in this moment that Locke realized his army was now under Death's Command.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T19:15:12.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZylotheWolfbane,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=A7M07lHQ,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-03-16T18:36:34.036+0000)\n>\n> 1- Glad to help, I could see the merging of the two actually working out. From the Bard animated video we got, we know that Noxus will send out armed companies and raiding parties in search of powerful artifacts, and magics. Maybe  ancient Noxus tried to send Locke to lead a company of soldiers to the Shadow Isles to try and bring back traces of Shadow Isles magic, or some artifacts from there, but Locke and his soldiers fell under the sway of the twisted magic of the Shadow Isles. Locke however had such a strong will, he kept some of his mind even in death, and still commanded the loyalty of his soldiers, even if he now served a new nation, the Shadow Isles? Could be pretty awesome, especially if Locke was even older than Sion, could have some awesome interactions with Sion, where Locke is this ancient Noxian general that 'vanished mysteriously' but Sion looked up to in life? Could be cool.\n> \n> 2- I understand that, it makes sense. Unfortunately it's difficult to gauge since there's no gameplay to really check out, but if Riot did something like this, I really think testing an Ult ability would be a good way to give him a bit more impact, especially if he gets caught out without soldiers, being able to just push RR to panic and get a more potent soldier/more soldiers up instead of pressing RQ-RW-RE. If the cooldown was especially long as well, it could help him have a panic button, so that once in a while he doesn't NEED an extended engagement to be effective. Obviously it's not something he can do every fight, but it makes it so that if he's the only one on his team getting fed, he can pick fights when his 'Ult' is up, and use it to press his advantage. The enemy team of course wants to push in on short skirmishes anytime his 'Ult' is down. Just a thought, because of how short fights can be in League, champions that excell at extended engagements need some way to impact short fights as well at least every now and then. Thus things like Azir/Warwick/Yorick ults etc. They really excell in extended fights when they can get their abilities/attacks off a lot, but their ults are all quite impactful, and powerful, and can suddenly change how a fight is going, even if it's not a long fight.\n\n1- Ah, I just saw this after posting my new lore idea below.  They really sync up rather well so I think this is going to be a great direction to go in.  Thanks so much for your ideas and feedback!\n\n2- Not much to say to this other than that I agree with you.  It would be cool to see a super soldier not unlike Heimer's empowered turret that he places down when he ults.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-07-14T18:33:13.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bringing some of my most-upvoted concepts back to the front page today, to see if a new audience still finds them compelling after so much time has passed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T22:36:35.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locke has secured a place as one of my most upvoted concepts, along with Axel and Pinwheel, Echo and Rabadon.

And also I think that he is really different, and unique from other champions, he is his own character\n\nThanks so much for the detailed notes and feedback, Okido!\n\nHis lore was directly inspired by a few other creators in this thread who very boldly suggested that I move away from a cliche \"Noxian general\" into something that we haven't seen before.  The story itself was inspired a bit by Homer's Odyssey but generally just came out of nowhere.  It only took me about 15-20 minutes to write up the whole thing once I had the idea in my head.\n\nFor the Q, I chose both swords and spears to provide some visual differences, but it's not that important either way.  I don't think damage reductions for multiple soldiers is necessary, but it's a good lever to have in case it does.  Azir usually has one soldier and sometimes two (with three or more being very rare) attacking the same target, so the damage from a single one should be substantial enough to feel impactful.  Locke SHOULD have an army of soldiers and only having 1-2 going at it shouldn't be doing enough damage to warrant nerfs for subsequent ones.\n\nFor W, yes, the shield guy works just like any allied unit, similar to Tibbers.\n\nWith regards to E, since the scout basically transforms itself into a damage over time spell, it doesn't actually need attack speed.  It's basically a DoT version of Maokai's Sapling.  The \"latch on\" is purely a visual one.\n\nI definitely considered an RR \"super soldier\" kind of ability and it took a LOT of effort to demonstrate restraint in his design by not including it.  I think it would be really neat but I am concerned by his already-complex and multi-faceted kit, as well as all the power he gains from passives and other circumstantial buffs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-19T04:54:23.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope Locke's new lore gives him a more *commanding* presence on these forums.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radach","date":"2015-03-18T05:48:06.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the champion how he is a cross between {{champion:43}} /{{champion:83}}, but I feel like all of the soldiers last a really really long time.
