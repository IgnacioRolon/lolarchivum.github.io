{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-09T04:18:00.073+0000","title":"Navia, the Unheeded Prophet","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: AP Support, AP Mage\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a debuff-centric champion who chose when to activate spells for maximum effectiveness.  This quickly took the form of Navia’s E, and the rest of the kit was inspired by a psychic theme.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Navia's entire kit is based around the idea of housing immense power, but needing the support of her team to unlock it fully. Similar to Zyra, she can hold her own as an AP Mage but is best suited as a utility and augmentation-based support character.\n\nNavia can mark enemy targets in very rapid succession, allowing her allies to proc bonus magic damage when attacking those she has marked.  Furthermore she can grant shields to multiple allied champions while also dealing damage in her own right.  Her most iconic ability allows her to invade her enemy’s mind, choosing when precisely she wishes to detonate a powerful, mental bomb inside their heads.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low. Navia occupies a relatively untapped psychic theme, has interesting abilities and is designed to work in multiple roles and team compositions. She is also a relatively simple champion to pick up and play, making her an ideal starter champion for new players in the support role.  Her biggest issue is going to come from balancing the numbers and relegating her kit's power appropriately.\n\n**Appearance**: An adolescent, naive psychic girl.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/anime-art-devushka-flowers_zps102b4773.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/anime-girl-78352_zpsf9c7df29.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/nidy-2d-anime-girl-1600x1200_zps522442a9.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Navia is a girl with psychic powers who spent her childhood foreseeing terrible blight for her village. She only wanted to help her people, but they blamed her for the disasters that plagued them, rather than heeding her warnings. They dismissed her gifts and believed that she was the cause of their misfortunes, intentionally causing the terrible events that befell them as some sort of trick. She was exiled from her village and became a wandering loner, falsely believing that her gifts were in fact under false pretense, and that she really was to blame for everything.\n\nDoubting herself and her powers, she left her village and began wandering around Runeterra with no real purpose. Then one day she had a prophecy about a young man who was in some sort of danger.  Using her powers, she found and saved him.  The man thanked her and told her about the League of Legends.  Navia realized that this was a way to give her gifts a true stage and real purpose, so she journeyed to the Hall of Justice seeking acceptance.\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful burst mage when building AP, gold generation utility, excellent synergy with attack speed carries, long-range stun, team-wide stat buffs\n\n**Weaknesses**: No sustain, full potential requires presence of allies, heavy reliance on auto attacks when solo laning\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:117}} {{champion:44}}\n\n**Auto Attack**: Navia performs a 'force push' with her open palm, dealing damage at range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5875_pas_zps3764146a.jpg\n**Passive- Self-fulfilling Prophecy**: After casting 6 spells, Navia's ability cooldowns are reduced by 3 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: Navia is a spammy champion whose individual spells pack less power when used a single time. This passive rewards active and aggressive players and occasionally allows an instant double cast of Psychic Beacon.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5937_pas_zpsd871c1ab.jpg\n**Q- Psychic Beacon (3.5 seconds)**: Navia targets an enemy with her mind, marking and granting vision of them.  If that enemy suffers damage from Navia or an allied champion, the mark detonates, dealing magic damage based on Navia’s AP.  If marking a minion, any ally who slays that minion receives 1/2/3/4/5 bonus gold.  The mark lasts 2 seconds. No mana cost.\nRank-ups increase damage and gold generation amount.\n**Design Philosophy**: As a support, this ability gives Navia players an active role in their lane somewhat akin to last hitting itself. The only difference is that they're actually second-to-last hitting in order to provide more gold for their carry.  As a Mage, this ability can be spammed and supplemented with auto attacks, providing consistent magic damage.  This ability is somewhat reminiscent of Kallista’s Sentinel passive.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11465_pas_zps45711a41.jpg\n**W- Prophetic Bolt (9 seconds)**: A lined skillshot that deals magic damage and marks the first target it contacts for 5 seconds.  Any allies who attack the marked target receive a small shield, absorbing 20/40/60/80/100 damage +30% AP. Each mark can only be triggered by 4 total attacks before disappearing, but the same ally can stack instances of the shield with multiple attacks, which also refreshes its duration.  Each shield lasts 4 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and shield value.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is another ability that promotes aggressive play in lane. It's also a novel new way of applying shields to allies without shielding them directly. As a result of the added complexity and skill required, the spell itself can carry more power than a normal shield.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13929_btn_zpsa0362a3f.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14104_pas_zpse615fb4b.jpg\n**E- Mind Link (12 seconds)**: Navia links minds with an enemy, invading their thoughts. This acts as a remotely detonated stun that, on first cast marks the target, and on second cast triggers a stun and magic damage on the target.  The stun’s duration and the magic damage dealt increases the longer the mark persists on them (between .25-1.5 seconds).  Mark lasts up to 5 seconds and will proc automatically following its duration.  This ability is constrained by a tether range of 1200 units.  If the target goes outside of this range, the mind link snaps and has no effect.  This ability does not go on cooldown until the mark has been detonated.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage dealt.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Navia's most iconic ability. As an instant, on demand stun, its damage is almost nonexistent and was inspired by the range decay on Taric's targeted stun. In ideal situations, Navia will be able to mark a target in lane before a gank occurs, then trigger it after the gank starts and the target has begun to flee. Conversely, a marked target can see the mark and react accordingly, using cleanse/crucible or fleeing before the stun can be detonated.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16495_btn_zpsa7a1e8cb.jpg\n**R- Premonition (90 seconds)**: Sensing a looming danger,  Navia envelops an allied champion in a shield which absorbs 300/450/600 damage (plus 10% for every nearby enemy champion and 40% AP) and marks all surrounding enemy champions (regardless of vision or stealth) with Psychic Beacon.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a massive, single target shield designed to protect a priority target at all costs. In order to add some depth to the skill (as well as provide an offensive benefit to AP Navia players), Beacon is applied to nearby targets, which allows them to all be \"popped\" by Navia and surrounding teammates.  This deters enemies from continuing their dogpile on the shielded target.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-07T22:28:55.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been seeing quite a few \"mind control\" concepts on the boards lately, so I thought I'd drop my own psychic girl into the mix again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T22:12:49.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one listened when Navia said she was an awesome champion concept!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-18T22:24:59.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a premonition that Navia will get some attention soon...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2015-02-21T00:02:56.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This looks like a really fun support!

Otherwise some pretty good ideas though.\n\nI've added a tether range to Mind Link and reduced the minimum and maximum stun duration.  I've also scaled back the raw values of her ultimate.  If it was a numeric balance issue that you were concerned with, that's understandable but it would be helpful if you would actually elaborate.\n\nLooking at her kit and ignoring numbers, I genuinely don't see the massive outcry of \"OP\" going on here.  Her passive is pretty weak, her Q is weaker than Syndra's with TF's passive attached (but only for allies).  Her W is pretty basic and in practice will rarely achieve optimal effectiveness since the shields will likely go on multiple targets who don't need it (similar to Karma's Mantra'd W), and her Ultimate is in line if not weaker than Lulu's or Shen's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"snoopDOdoubleG6","date":"2015-01-09T07:08:50.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems more of a really, really,\nreally OP soraka mixed with Janna.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-09T09:12:36.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=snoopDOdoubleG6,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=srgHfU1z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-09T07:08:50.286+0000)\n>\n> seems more of a really, really,\n> really OP soraka mixed with Janna.\n\nI legitimately can't find a single ability or theme within this kit that resembles either of those two champions, other than the fact that both Navia and Janna have an ability that grants a shield.
