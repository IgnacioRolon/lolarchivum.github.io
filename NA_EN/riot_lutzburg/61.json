{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T06:57:11.203+0000","title":"Kuro, Guardian of the Shrines","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Role**: AD Fighter, AP Fighter, AP Support\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion who uses a type of statue or shrine as a physical and interactive game object.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Kuro is a hybrid champion who can be built in a number of different ways.  His kit revolves around the construction and use of various shrines, which act as physical objects in the game world.  These shrines each have special auras that affect both Kuro and his allies.  Each shrine also has a unique ability.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: High. Kuro uses all-new mechanics revolving around physical objects with a lot of importance. Players may not realize or enjoy the significance these shrines hold during gameplay.\n\n**Appearance**: \n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Samurai_by_GBrush_zps88t9xox2.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/samurai_by_tomedwardsconcepts-d3r70sp_zpsylqzzry2.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/shrine_to_hofukushu_by_bertuccio-d5x4acv_zpsrupqmbbi.jpg\n*Kuro visiting a Shrine of Protection*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/woods_guardian_by_southam-d2zrdta_zpshyfcxdjn.jpg\n*An artistic interpretation of Kuro's legendary 'Shrine of the Demon', standing watch from the jungles near the top of Summoner's Rift*\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful team auras, mixed damage, can be built AD or AP, sustain in lane, gap closer.\n\n**Weaknesses**: limited escape, weakened by highly mobile fights, can be shut down if Shrines are focused, sustain requires initial investment.\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:11}} {{champion:2}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A melee range katana strike.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5779_btn_zps9d1wtrof.jpg\n**Passive- Blessing of the Goddess**: Kuro receives twice the benefits provided by any nearby Shrines (see Ultimate).\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a simple and effective way to demonstrate the powers of each shrine type to the Kuro player, as a double in power makes their benefits much more visible and obvious.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15737_pas_zps7lz7kpyt.jpg\n**Q- Samurai Strike (7 seconds)**: Kuro meditates in place for a brief moment before lunging at a selected target with his katana, dealing physical damage when he arrives. Once meditation has begun, he will always reach his target regardless of their distance, unless interrupted. The distance traveled during the lunge adds bonus physical damage to the attack; the further he must travel to reach his target, the more damage they receive, up to a cap.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability works similarly to Alpha Strike, and rewards Kuro players who are willing to dive deep to get a kill. This also deencentivizes squishy characters with escape moves from using them, as doing so will greatly increase Kuro's damage output.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13673_pas_zpsarrnelss.jpg\n**W- Offering of Sacrifice (18 seconds)**: Kuro inflicts 50/80/125/200/300 true damage to himself as an offering to his Goddess. After 3 seconds, the Goddess rewards his faith by healing him for twice the sacrifice amount +30% AP, as well as granting him 20% movement and 15/20/25/30/35% attack speed for 3 seconds.\nRank-ups increase sacrifice and heal amount, as well as bonus attack speed.\n**Design Philosophy**: This strongly plays off of the samurai and honor theme of falling on your sword. Mechanically this creates more counterplay than a passive heal or sustain mechanic would, as both sides of the lane have interesting decisions to make in response to the self inflicting damage of W.  Top laners can use this ability from the cover of a brush just before engaging an opponent, catching them off guard and using the rapid attack speed boost to secure a kill.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13776_btn_zpsltrh8jvk.jpg\n**E- Waning Blade (10 seconds)**: Kuro slashes his katana in a wide cone in front of him with incredible speed, instantly dealing magic damage +80% AP to enemies within the cone. After a brief delay, enemies caught in the arc are knocked back.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage dealt.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability creates a cool \"faster than light\" visual effect, mechanically only knocking back enemies who stood too long in the ability.  The knockback component of this ability perfectly synergizes with the damage modification of Kuro's Q. It is also his primary damaging ability when building AP.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_845_btn_zps3v6sziqw.jpg\n**R- Construct Shrine (32 seconds)**: This ability is available automatically at level 1, but still receives rank-ups at levels 6/11/16.  Casting this ability places a shrine with 250/500/1,200/2,500 health at a target location. The next ability used after hitting R will erect a shrine with unique properties based off of the basic ability used to construct it. Once a shrine has been imbued, it cannot be reversed or altered. Shrines last until destroyed, or more than three shrines are placed. If this happens, the oldest shrine is destroyed first. Shrines grant vision comparable to a vision ward. Shrines must be placed at least 1000 units away from each other, but multiples of a Shrine type can exist. Shrine Auras are 800 units in radius, preventing any two shrines from ever overlapping. Shrines possess 100 armor and Magic Resistance.  If a shrine is destroyed by an enemy, this ability’s cooldown is reduced by 10 seconds.\nRank-ups affect each Shrine differently, as well as lower the cooldown for placing Shrines.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_9913_btn_zps31sncksz.jpg\n**RQ- Shrine of War**: This creates a shrine adorned with battle standards, spears and a gong. The shrine grants an attack damage and armor aura to all nearby allies. Auto attacks that Kuro performs near the Shrine will charge it. After 9 charges, the gong will sound, granting Kuro greatly increased attack damage and armor penetration for 3 seconds.\nShrine rank-ups increase attack damage and armor aura, as well as armor penetration and attack damage buff.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Kuro’s primary AD combat shrine and ideal for top lane duels.  This Shrine is best kept up front near the action.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11088_pas_zpshea9lcke.jpg\n**RW- Shrine of Protection**: This creates a shrine with a health regeneration aura for Kuro and all allied champions. The shrine resembles a spiritual incense burning idol. Every 12 seconds, the Shrine will cast a shield on a nearby friendly champion, prioritizing those with the lowest health percentage. This shield absorbs 100/175/250 damage +30% AP and lasts 4 seconds.\nShrine rank-ups increase healing aura regeneration and shield value.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a great support tool, even when Kuro has recalled from the lane or died.  In the jungle this shrine could actually be placed at a specific camp to aid in jungle clears, where they are much less likely be to found and destroyed by the enemy team.  Typically Kuro players will want to keep this shrine in a safe position near an allied tower.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13061_pas_zpstlooafm4.jpg\n**RE- Shrine of the Demon**: This creates a shrine resembling an ancient dog demon, which grants the shrine ability to act as a Vision Ward. Enemies that get too close cause the statue to howl, dealing AoE magic damage +50% AP and slowing targets by 40% for 3 seconds. This effect cannot occur more than once every 8 seconds.\nShrine Rank-ups increase the slow duration and AoE magic damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an amazing tool for a top laner, acting as a dedicated pink ward and gank prevention tool.  These could also be placed at important objectives such as blue buff as a deterrent.  Unlike the other shrines, this one is best used in the middle of combat, directly on top of the action.\n\n**Gameplay Patterns**: the guardian can be built as AD, AP, or a hybrid. His early game is relatively weak, as he relies on his Shrines for stat boosts and sustain.\n\nTypically, you will want a Shrine of War near you in lane, to give you bonus damage and armor, as well as a periodic AD steroid.  As AD, the steroid will account for a large part of your damage, so this shrine will typically be placed in or near team fights.\n\nThe Shrine of Protection is best placed near your own tower at top lane, where you can retreat to between minion waves for health regeneration and the occasional shield.  As either AD or AP, this shrine is best used as a forward base of operations or \"retreat!\" rendezvous point. If positioned near a team fight but out of harm's way, its aura and shields can still be utilized effectively.\n\nThe Shrine of the Demon is best used as a scout for ganks in the river or jungle. Its ward denial and slowing ability provide early protection when in lane.  It’s also incredibly effective when placed on top of an existing fight or where one is about to break out.  As AP, this shrine will account for a large part of your damage.\n\nWhile unconventional, Kuro could be built as an AP aura support champion, using a combination of Shrines and aura items to create an entire team of stat-buffed allies. A free sight ward every 25 seconds is a rather handy thing to have around.\n\nActivate E, then immediately begin meditating with Q. As E deals damage and knocks the enemy back, Q will hone in on the target, traveling a much further distance than normal and receiving a large damage bonus.  If you possess a higher movement speed than the enemy, you can effectively push them back to their side of lane and win trades handily.\n\nDrop a Shrine in the middle of a fight and then use E. the AoE damage and slow will keep enemies locked down for the damage portion of E and provide a major amount of AP burst damage.\n\nUse E to knock enemies closer to already active Shrines whose effects may be just out of reach. For example, if you have 8/9 charges for your Q Shrine and the enemies move too far away, knock them back and get in one last auto attack, activating your buff.\n\nAs AD, hone in on your target with Q and then flash ahead of them, using E to knock them back into your team or a friendly tower.\n\nEscape from a team fight or gank by lunging toward enemy minions or jungle monsters from max range.\n\n**Recommended Build Patterns**:\n\nAs AD, building attack speed synergizes beautifully with your Q shrine's steroid.\n\nAs AD and especially AP, Spirit Visage will make the most out of your sacrificial heals and aura regeneration.\n\nLich Bane is a great item for an AP build, as Kuro is almost always in melee range and has relatively short cooldowns.\n\nCDR is a great stat for the Guardian, as it allows him to place more Shrines during a mobile team fight.\n\nNashor’s Tooth is an incredible item for Kuro, as every statistic offered on that item synergizes with his kit.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my unique concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T22:39:07.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kuro needs an auto-bumping shrine, don't you think?","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2016-02-09T03:06:11.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=wqNtJf4k,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-04-10T22:39:07.508+0000)\n>\n> Kuro needs an auto-bumping shrine, don't you think?\n\nyeah, Im just revisiting this thread because the idea of a Warlord support came up and this popped into my head, check out the amazingly innovative thread here\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/EV2wsdMl-riot-lets-talk-about-your-supports?show=flat&page=2\n\nbasically the writter is asking if Riot has anything more to offer the support role besides mage caster or tank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-08T21:31:37.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If League added more Samurai, what skin line should they get to counter the Ninjas and their Nurse/Doctor line?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-03-31T18:33:20.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another Samurai-based champ would be nice in my book.

That's exactly what I was going for with Kuro... meaningful mini objectives and dynamic map control that involves more strategy and counterplay than simply \"if it exists, make it dead ASAP\".  In fact, I'd say right now the closest analogy in the game is actually pink wards, which I think is one of the more fun and engaging forms of \"mini objectives\" that exists in the game today.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-03-26T01:26:05.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy is really cool, hes is a whole new type of champion that summons new physical objects onto summoner's rift, i think its really cool, and an incredibly unique idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T01:42:08.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=wqNtJf4k,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-26T01:26:05.198+0000)\n>\n> This guy is really cool, hes is a whole new type of champion that summons new physical objects onto summoner's rift, i think its really cool, and an incredibly unique idea.\n\nThanks, Okido!
