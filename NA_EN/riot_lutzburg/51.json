{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T00:27:03.420+0000","title":"Oliver, the Imaginative Youth","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: AP Support, Ranged AD\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion based around using his or her child-like imagination as a basis for their abilities and theme.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Oliver is a very thematically-influenced Champion whose entire kit is based around classic games that children might play during recess. Oliver is an aggressive support similar to Lulu, with the ability to build as a hybrid ranged attack damage/magic damage carry under certain conditions.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low. Thematically, there is a strong sense of whimsy and guilty pleasure emanating from Oliver’s kit. This theme of ‘innocence’ has been proven successful with champions like Annie, Lulu, Amumu, Nunu and Teemo.\n\n**Appearance**: A young blonde boy who uses his imagination to conjure powerful spells. Oliver uses his fingers as pretend guns.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/tumblr_ltdwroaXi61qg3xh2o1_400_zps6988e3a0.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/astroboy21_zpsf4fe1efb.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/1551bg2_zpsbe3af366.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Strong lane pressure and crowd control, augments the damage of his allies, can stand alone as a hybrid AD Carry, provides powerful team-wide positioning tool with his Ultimate\n\n**Weaknesses**: No AoE or wave-clearing potential, melee auto attacks, low base stats, lacks true carry potential\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:117}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:432}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Oliver makes a gun shape with his fingers, firing a very short range bolt (250) of energy at foes. As a child, it doesn't make sense for Oliver to be throwing punches, and he needs his hands free for his Q ability, which limits his ability to carry a weapon or instrument of any sort.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6862_btn_zps3ec61104.jpg\n**Passive- Imaginary Friends**: Every 24 seconds, an imaginary friend will appear near Oliver. These friends can only be seen by him (though enemies will see a colored aura indicating that they're nearby), last up to 6 seconds and come in three varieties/colors. The color that appears is determined by a predictable order of Blue/Green/Red. If Oliver gets near these friends, they provide him with a small bonus based on which friend has appeared. The bonus they provide is based on Oliver's level. Casting a spell lowers this ability's cooldown by 2 seconds. Visually, these imaginary friends might look similar to some of the characters from the show, “Foster’s Home For Imaginary Friends.”\n\nBlue Friend- restores X mana\nGreen Friend- heals for Y health\nRed Friend- increases AP by Z for 4 seconds\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a very strong thematic ability and adds a lot of character to Oliver. Mechanically, the rest of his kit acts as a relative suite of single use abilities, so adding some passive movement options to a Support during their lane phase seemed appropriate. The boosts themselves are relatively generic, in order to best catch all possible play styles or builds used by the Oliver player. The cooldown reduction based on ability use should be balanced, given that two of his abilities require other nearby champions to cast. This promotes active and engaged play patterns, which is a hallmark aspiration for the design of Support champions.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16895_pas_zps0c415a69.jpg\n**Q- Bang, Bang! (7 sec)**: Oliver's hands begin to glow, causing his auto attacks to deal bonus magic damage and lower his target's armor by 10 for the next 5 seconds. This effect can stack up to 7 times. Oliver's auto attack range also increases from 250 to 550 while this ability is active.\nRank-ups increase the damage and lower the ability’s cooldown.\nAudio: “Bang, bang!” upon activation.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Oliver’s primary damage ability and should be ranked up first if being played as a Carry. It scales exceptionally well with attack speed. As a Support, this spell synergizes with the player’s AD Carry, especially against high armor lanes like Graves/Taric.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12577_pas_zpsd79a516b.jpg\n**W- Tag, You’re It! (9 sec)**: Oliver gains 15% bonus movement speed that increases to 40% over a four second duration (similar to Volibear's Rolling Thunder).  If Oliver physically tags an enemy champion in melee range while this ability is active, he will mark them with a debuff that lasts 4 seconds and slows them by 30% for the duration. When the debuff wears off, the affected enemy suffers magic damage, and all enemy champions within 350 range of the target will be feared away from their ally for 1 second.  This debuff can be transferred to other enemy champions if they touch the affected target.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\nAudio: “Tag!” “You’re it!” “Gotchya!”\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability offers an interesting gameplay choice for the player. When supporting in a duo lane, they need to decide who they want to slow, and who they want to fear. Sometimes it’s better to place the slow on a champion with no escapes, forcing their ally back to avoid the fear effect. Other times it’s more advantageous to slow an enemy carry and force their support to peel off of them, or be feared. Conversely, a bulk of the ability’s power can be diminished by smart enemy counterplay, zoning out the fear and then moving back in afterward. This ability works somewhat similarly to Zilean's Time Bomb, though it deals significantly less damage and can't be reapplied or detonated early.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15644_pas_zps007072a8.jpg\n**E- Hide/Seek (10 sec)**: Targeting ally: Oliver covers allied champion in a veil, shielding them from 60/105/150/195/240 (+ 60% AP) damage for 5 seconds. If the shield is broken, the veil disperses, creating a smokescreen effect around the target for 2.5 seconds, inhibiting the vision of enemies around them.\nTargeting enemy: Oliver draws attention to a target enemy, dealing initial magic damage and causing them to take bonus magic damage from each subsequent attack for the next 5 seconds. This damage cannot occur more than once per second.\nRank-ups increase shield amount, initial magic damage and subsequent bonus damage.\nAudio for ally: “Quick, hide!” “Shhhh, they’re coming!” “Nice hiding spot!”\nAudio for enemy: “Ready or not!” “Found ya!” “Caught you!”\n**Design Philosophy**: This is another very strongly themed ability, based on the game Hide and Seek. This ability is most analogous to Lulu’s, and provides similar choices to the Oliver player. As a Carry, this ability synergizes incredibly well with Oliver’s Q.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5864_btn_zpsb54e9703.jpg\n**R- Red Rover (90 sec)**: Oliver creates a circular symbol of sidewalk chalk runes at a target location (about the size and range of Leona's ultimate), creating a link between it and Oliver's current location. This rune lasts for 6 seconds. Allied champions can click on this rune to instantly teleport to Oliver. The rune has 2/3/4 charges and allies can only use it once per activation. There is a brief .5 second cooldown after each charge is consumed by an ally, which prevents entire teams from arriving at a location instantaneously.\nRank-ups increase the number of allies that can use the rune, as well as decrease cooldown\nAudio: “Red Rover, Red Rover...” “Send ‘em on over!”\n**Design Philosophy**: As a Support, I wanted Oliver to have a powerful, ‘game changing’ Ultimate. Red Rover provides a ton of team-wide utility for getting players into the right position, and it can also act as a soft team fight ‘reset’, similar to Janna’s Ultimate. As an Ultimate, this ability functions like Thresh's lantern on steroids.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-03T19:32:14.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are the changes to the W based on your feedback-\n\n> W- Tag, You’re It!

If only Oliver can see them, the opponent will just see him randomly get health, mana, or AP. I honestly think, from a game play perspective, that its fine to have the friends be seen by everyone, or have some kind of indicator telling his opponents of which friend is currently active, that way there is some counterplay to it.\n\nQ: Seems OK for an AD carry, but for a support, it seems a bit odd. I know you were trying to make a flex pick here, but... I don't know, it doesn't really fit for a support.\n\nW: this is quite interesting, especially for a support. The only other champ that I can see come close to doing this is Fiddle, but he needs two abilities burned and certain items in order to do it. I think if you made the fear an AOE fear, but it made it a very short fear (maybe like a second) it would be an awesome disengage tool, or even be used to engage, considering his ultimate.\n\nE: the shield seems VERY powerful. I'm not sure how much Lulu's shield gives, but this almost seems more powerful then hers. Also, the blind seems odd. Why not give the shield grantable invisability to whoever he targets? Of course, it would have to be quite short, and possibly act like Evelynn's invisibility: if your close enough, it simply won't work.\n\nR: A combination of Rek'sai's ult and Thresh's lantern...

This may be an example where gameplay needs to trump theming.\n\nFor his Q, I know it's not ideal but there are many hybrid champions who play support who don't have perfect skills for that lane (Morgana's Soil, Annie's self-shield, Zyra's passive).  Since he's meant to be a hybrid champion I think this is fine.\n\nI like your idea for the W changes, and also added a new component to it.\n\nFor E, the values are almost identical to Lulu's but start weaker at lower ranks.  Same scaling otherwise.  I think adding invisibility to allies is a really neat concept and one that I explore with[ Agatha, the Encroacher](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/mnT77EWL-agatha-the-encroacher), but I think it'd be too powerful on a non-Ultimate ability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T18:34:02.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm looking for a guy- last name Clothesoff, first name Oliver.
