{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T04:55:43.794+0000","title":"Damek, the Earthcaller","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion who could remotely pull enemies to a target location. Further inspiration came from the desire to create an earth elemental mage that didn’t rely on the crutch of ‘human being with magic energy beams that happen to deal rock damage.’  Almost a year after Damek's inception, Riot released Azir.  While I commend Riot for not taking the \"sand mage\" route through any cliched territory, I also think they missed the mark on making Azir actually feel '*sandy*,' so to speak.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Damek brings a unique mash-up of positioning/zoning utility to his team while simultaneously being able to deal damage from long range. His most iconic ability allows him to essentially create a stationary Blitzcrank which he can ‘detonate’ remotely.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate. A remotely detonated grab may prove too powerful no matter what the compromises elsewhere. Damek has a very powerful and novel theme, however, and an interesting mashup of various existing kits and mechanics, which keep him in check.\n\n**Appearance**: A dark and twisted, nomadic shaman, with very simple robes and drapery. He uses an ornate staff as a weapon that doubles as a cane.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Nomad_zps0ecbf921.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Tusken_NEGAS_zps8757e76f.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/95025313440680371_zps752a663a.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Damek is a dark, self-serving mage who controls a powerful subterranean beast like an animal handler or snake charmer. The creature uses its immense power to aid his trainer in battle. The creature was once an ancient enemy of Skarner, his kind and the Crystal Scar. However, after laying dormant for ages, the beast’s powers are not what they once were and it sees a strategic partner in Damek. Damek in turn has a great deal of respect for the beast and treats it like a partner or friend. Damek himself has no inherent magical abilities or dominion over earth magic; all of his powers come directly from the subterranean beast below him. Even still, Damek is a powerful dark mage, though it is unclear just how long either of them will find their partnership one worth keeping...\n\"He stirs below.\"\n\"The sands part to his might.\"\n\"The earth crumbles at my feet.\"\n\"My sediments exactly.\"\n/joke: *tendril unearths itself and wags like a dog tail*\n\"Who's a good subterranean sand monster? You are! Yes you are!\"\n\n**Strengths**: Remotely fired grab, long range on abilities, displacement and zone denial, capable of blinding multiple targets at once\n\n**Weaknesses**: Incredibly dependent on positioning, long cooldowns, no escapes, low base stats\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:53}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:101}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Fires a ranged bolt of energy from his staff.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12749_pas_zpsc1a9f802.jpg\n**Passive- Shifting Sands**: Every 16 seconds, the beast will create a swirling sand pool for Damek that spawns near him and lasts for 3 seconds. If Damek steps on this pool, he is infused with the subterranean beast's power and the pool disappears. For the next 5 seconds, Damek gains bonus health and mana regeneration, and his next damaging spell deals 15% bonus damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is designed to create a thematic connection between Damek and the underground beast. It evokes a sense that the beast wants to help Damek, but also that the beast has its own thoughts and ideas about when and where to place its aid. Mechanically, this adds interesting zone-based gameplay and counterplay. The ability’s internal cooldown should be displayed on the Passive itself, much like Blitzcrank’s Mana Barrier Passive.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11730_btn_zpsf6919a06.jpg\n**Q- Tremor (6 seconds)**: Damek commands the beast to create a fast-traveling fissure in a line via skillshot, dealing magic damage to all enemies hit.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a very simple and thematically relevant ability that functions similarly to Vel’Koz’s fissure ability. This is Damek’s primary source of damage, and is intended to be somewhat spammable, as his W is situational and his E is very much a long-term investment type of ability.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6030_pas_zpsd09265f0.jpg\n**W- Sandstorm (12 seconds)**: Damek commands the beast to create a 300 radius sandstorm around an allied target champion, increasing their armor and ability power for 5 seconds. Enemies within the storm suffer minor magic damage over time that increases in potency the longer they remain within its effect. If a target remains within the sandstorm for 2 consecutive seconds, they are blinded for 1.5 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and bonus AP/armor gained.\n**Design Philosophy**: This provides Damek with a bit of utility and a way to deal damage during a teamfight even when he himself is zoned out of it. Increasing the damage over its duration, as well as the blinding effect, deters fighters or bruisers from conducting sustained trades or all-ins against Damek, who has few methods of escape barring the use of his Ultimate.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13907_btn_zpsa826b214.jpg\n**E- Subterranean Grip (16 seconds)**: Damek summons a tendril from the beast at target location, which takes 1 second to emerge from the ground. For the next 30 seconds, the ability can be recast as a line skillshot grab similar in range and speed to that of Blitzcrank’s. The tendril grants minor vision and is untargetable, and deals magic damage while pulling the first enemy it contacts to itself before disappearing. A swirling sand pool forms after the tendril recedes into the ground. This ability will only go on cooldown after being fired or after laying dormant for 30 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Damek’s most iconic ability. It is a great positioning and zone denial tool and essentially acts as a stationary Blitzcrank waiting wherever it’s placed. To compensate for this immense power, the ability has a long activation time, preventing Damek from making clutch, instantaneous grabs. Granting a sandpool after its use is simply a neat way of incorporating Damek’s Passive, and also grants a small reward to players even if they end up missing their grab or allowing it to fizzle out.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5867_btn_zps57764d92.jpg\n**R- Tectonic Eruption (70 seconds)**: Damek causes a crystalline spire to erupt from the ground at target location, dealing magic damage and displacing enemies. The spire lasts for 4 seconds and acts as impassible terrain. This ability can be cast 3 times within 12 seconds before going on cooldown, with a 1 second cooldown between casts. In addition, swirling sand pools form under each pillar as they recede back into the earth.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an incredibly fun ability meant to evoke the sheer sense of immense power and scale that this underground beast possesses, as well as Damek’s power over it. Mechanically, these spires function almost identically to a trio of Trundle pillars, only they deal magic damage as well as displace enemies. These spires can be placed in a line to block off massive amounts of the map, or be used to leapfrog one another to create constant slows to cripple fleeing enemies.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-07T01:49:49.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Time to cause a stir with Damek, the Earthcaller!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-05T04:28:12.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else looking for a REAL sand mage in League?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T23:19:03.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and I came up with this guy over a year before Azir or Rek'sai, so I haven't really thought about any connections between them.

I feel like every time I give my two cents, I always suggest extra bits to the move that give the champ an overloaded kit.

Perhaps Quake or something I dunno.\n\nW (Sandstorm): I’m so used to Mordekaiser’s W that I almost read “Amor and MR gained” haha. Nice job giving it a blinding effect. 4 seconds seems rather excessive given champions nowadays have tons of mobility. Perhaps lower the 3 seconds? It only applies a soft CC anyway.\n\nE (Subterranean Grip): Wow, this ability is so cool! Great thinking making the move have a long activation time.

HAHAHA that’s hilarious!\n\nR (Tectonic Eruption): Very powerful ability. What’s the range? Very cool how you have them produce sand pools for the passive.  How close does the pillar need to be to do damage? Does it need to spawn directly on them?

And as a fellow Earth Lord, I figured this champ would be right up your alley!\n\nThere would probably be a ~1 second wind up to let the player know that a pool was spawning nearby.  I don't imagine one ever being more than 500 units away from Damek's current position.\n\nGood call on the adjustments to W, those have been updated.\n\nGlad you like the E!  I was really excited when I came up with it.\n\nUlt range would likely be marginally longer than Trundle's E, but the pillars themselves would be about 2/3 the size.  The damaging component would be from an aura like Trundle's, with the displacement only happening on direct hits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-01-02T06:43:25.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Review trade http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Iybn7OHF-adan-the-devoted-defender I'll review yours tomorrow when I'm so tired.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T06:53:14.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tamur,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=8jgeIV8F,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-02T06:43:25.270+0000)\n>\n> Review trade http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Iybn7OHF-adan-the-devoted-defender I'll review yours tomorrow when I'm so tired.\n\nOh, great.
