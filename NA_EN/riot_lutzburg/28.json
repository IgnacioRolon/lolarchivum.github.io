Move over, Hecarim.  Move over very, very fast.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Doubletime fits an extremely niche if not completely new role within the game.  He is a mobility-based jungler with an emphasis on long-range (semi global) support and utility spells.  He is designed to be a counter-ganker with high sticking power and consistent damage by way of auto attacks.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Doubletime is a very unique mash-up of roles and skills wrapped up by a universally understood and intrinsically fun theme- extreme speed.\n\n**Appearance**: A militaristic courier designed for lean, agile travel behind enemy lines.  Specific detail and attention might be given to his boots.  Personality-wise, Doubletime is equally nimble and jovial, while retaining the respect and discipline reflective of his military training.\n\nTake these...\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/7b3aae7c603a771b2c35f8119b41d19b_zps2d58ae3b.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/11af74eebe8565a3bfa32ae62dbe3421_zps18fc7e27.jpg\n\n...and add a dash of this:\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Mailman___Zelda__OoT_by_GoKammy_zps0cc9be50.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Doubletime is a member of the Demacian military, acting as a courier for high-ranking officials such as Garen and Jarvan IV.  He is the unsung hero of many a Demacian victory on the fields of battle.  He uses speed, agility, and a keen sense of environmental awareness to gather intelligence for his city state.  Due to his incredible speeds and military background, officers in the Damacian army respectfully gave him the nickname, “Doubletime.”\n\n**Strengths**: Multiple movement speed modifiers, insanely fast base movement speed, mild crowd control, AoE heal, long range (semi global) team utility\n\n**Weaknesses**: Unreliable stun, susceptible to kiting, no true gap closer, primary form of damage also slows him, forced to build on-hit effect items or Sunfire Cape to deal damage\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:120}} {{champion:41}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A melee strike with a falchion.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10354_pas_zpsfca9c437.jpg\n**Passive- Lay of the Land**: Doubletime gains 1 movement speed and .5% attack speed for every X distance traveled.  (This ability should grant Doubletime an average of 30 bonus movement speed and 15% bonus attack speed after 30 minutes of play as a jungler)\n**Design Philosophy**: Thematically, Doubletime is a courier and would ideally spend most of his time scouting and exploring the world.  In the case of League of Legends, he’s exploring Summoner’s Rift.  This is a fun and novel Passive ability that both thematically and mechanically ties into Doubletime’s character persona.  The attack speed component synergizes with his Ultimate, and allows him to deal consistent damage as a champion with few offensive capabilities.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8476_pas_zpsca524a79.jpg\n**Q- Stricken (6 seconds)**: On first cast, Doubletime charges his falchion with energy and begins sapping movement speed from himself and all enemies around him, continually draining more the longer the ability is active.  On second cast or after 4 seconds, Doubletime spins through the air with his falchion, dealing AoE physical damage around him.  This ability deals bonus damage if the ability is triggered automatically after its full duration.  This ability functions like a combination of Vi's Vaultbreaker and Jax's Counter.\nRank-ups increase damage dealt.\nDialogue: “Where ya goin’?”  “Wait up!”  “Wait for me!”  “Slow down!”\n**Design Philosophy**: Doubletime is designed to have a much higher movement speed than that of his enemies, and is also meant to stick to targets once he reaches them.  This ability allows him to slow nearby enemies so long as he’s near them while also limiting his own power slightly in the process, creating juking and counterplay opportunities.  Players who are exceptionally fast can afford to let the ability run its course, naturally creating opportunities for higher damage by stacking Doubletime’s primary stat- movement speed.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_3104_btn_zps112e87d9.jpg\n**W- Rendezvous Point (23 seconds)**: Doubletime places a long range (2000/2250/2500/2750/3000) aura on the battlefield that lasts 10 seconds, granting vision and healing allies who stand within it over time.  Doubletime gains 40/50/60/70/80 movement speed when traveling towards the Rendezvous Point.  The Rendezvous Point is roughly the size of Gangplank's Ultimate.\nRank-ups increase heal amount, cast distance and movement speed, as well as lower cooldown.\nDialogue: “I’ll be there.”  “In the blink of an eye!”  “Converging on target.”\n**Design Philosophy**: As a jungler, Doubletime is meant to excel at assisting lanes and counter-ganking by way of his extremely high mobility.  This ability allows him to grant some assistance to his team on his way to a priority engagement.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14945_btn_zps35f99659.jpg\n**E- Paint the Target (10 seconds)**: Doubletime targets an enemy from long range (1,500), recording their location for reconnaissance and creating a map-like aura with a bright red ‘X’ directly under their feet roughly the size of Anivia's Ultimate.  If the marked target fails to move outside the marked location within 1.5 second,  the ‘X’ detonates,  dealing magic damage and stunning the target for 2 seconds.  If the target is not stunned, Doubletime instead gains +35% movement speed for 2 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower the cooldown\nDialogue: “ Painting the target...”, “X marks the spot!”\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is intentionally designed to be unreliable and open counterplay from the enemy team.  Again, Doubletime is meant to race through the jungle and counter gank lanes.  Having a long range stun really helps close the distance, but oftentimes requires initial forms of lockdown by his allies to be effective.  The speed boost on failure to stun helps Doubletime personally reach his target, even if the rest of his team couldn’t.  In practice, this ability will pressure an enemy team to reconsider their engage or tower dive in bot lane.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_1447_btn_zps84c84058.jpg\n**R- Behind Enemy Lines (40 seconds)**: Passive: When this ability is available to cast, Doubletime gains 10 bonus movement speed for every nearby enemy champion.\nActive: For the next 8 seconds, Doubletime’s basic attacks deal bonus magic damage based on his current bonus movement speed (30/60/90 +50% bonus movement speed).\nRank-ups increase damage dealt and lower cooldown\nDialogue: “Move it, move it!”  “Gotta go!”\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive component of this ability is yet another way to add movement speed to Doubletime, with the notion that he needs to be at his fastest when in the thick of a team fight, sticking to priority targets.  The active component of this ability helps solidify his role as an auto attack-based fighter, as the rest of his kit provides mostly team utility and movement speed.  If able to stick to a target for the entire duration, Doubletime’s auto attacks can deal incredible single target damage over a sustained period of time.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"Spirangle","date":"2015-01-13T16:55:11.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are great at designing champions with unique mechanics.

I ask because it is not very fun to have an ability that you can never land on your own.\n\nQ- This ability functions like a cross between Vi's Vaultbreaker and Jax's Counter.  For number's sake, let's say that both Doubletime and enemies in an aura around him are slowed by 20-60 MS over the duration.  It's an even playing field, but he will typically be faster than whoever he's chasing.  This allows him to basically become an AoE slowing field that allows his allies to catch up to enemies.\n\nW- It's about the size of Gangplank's Ultimate.  Ideally it can be used for both, as he'd place it on top of the ensuing scuffle.\n\nE- It's meant to have some significant counterplay and is best used as a deterrent.  The enemy targeted can and should be able to get out of range in time if they wanted to (especially if they have a dash).  The idea is that the enemy has a choice- continue doing what they're doing (AKA beating the crap out of your teammates) or be forced to move out of the way to avoid the stun.  It's a great way to turn team fights around.  I agree that missing the stun and it being out of your control isn't that fun, but that's what the massive bonus speed boost is for.  :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Invite him","date":"2015-01-13T07:44:30.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hes cool, but way too much movement speed, that it got all messed up, its a nice idea, thought, so..!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-13T09:08:37.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thattipman,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GpN7gwHl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-13T07:44:30.948+0000)\n>\n> Hes cool, but way too much movement speed, that it got all messed up, its a nice idea, thought, so..!\n\nHaha well, that's kind of the point, right?  His low-cooldown Ult scales with his movement speed, which means that going fast is actually one of the most gold efficient ways to increase his DPS.  If you want to talk actual numbers, we are looking at a passive movement speed of about 380 by end game, assuming no boots or MS items.  He has a very short-lived speed boost of 35% for 2 seconds,  which is okay but very isolated.  He also has a very long cooldown ability which grants him 80 MS contextually, but only when he runs in a certain direction.  His Ultimate does grant 10 MS per nearby champion, but realistically that will equate to about 30 bonus MS.\n\nSo the grand total is 490 MS before items.  Boots will grant another 45, so we're looking at 535 movement speed while near 3/5 of the enemy team and using a 30 second cooldown ability.  That, my friend, is barely faster than Janna's base movement speed with Zephyr or Blitzcrank's speed while his W is active.  I was careful with the numbers  on this and I really don't think his speed is that outlandish.","replies":[{"poster":"Raise Dongrs","date":"2015-01-13T19:14:03.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true.

If anything, I think he would be most helpful as a mid-laner, because then he could roam to top, bot, or the jungle to assist any of his four teammates easily.

While I do think Doubletime could \"double\" as a support, he really would be wasting a lot of his mobility and long-range power, as you said.

I definitely haven't run out of ideas... don't forget I still have over 20 finished concepts waiting to be uploaded!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bayard","date":"2015-01-16T01:08:54.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, this one is new!

He could also build a tankier route with one or two damage items, like a lot of Shen players do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-16T03:29:01.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok yeah, it makes since to nerf someone/s damage if they have 2 semi global attacks.

I do think that he's lacking in the damage department, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, given the fact that he has two semi-global basic abilities and is faster than, well, everyone else.\n\nWhat if, along the same lines as a \"delivery,\" Doubletime moved faster when walking towards turrets or his home base?  Almost like a mini homeguard effect when retreating?","replies":[]}]}]}
