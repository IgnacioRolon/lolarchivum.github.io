{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-15T08:19:06.478+0000","title":"Pastel, the Wandering Artist","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage, AP Support\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create an AP/Support champion who utilizes Udyr's variable ability system.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**:  Pastel can be built and leveled in a massive variety of ways: single target damage mage, AoE mage, single target support, AoE support, self-sustaining mage, team utility mage, or a jack of all trades.  His skills are each represented by a different primary color, and can be combined to create additional, ‘secondary’ color effects.  Each ability also represents a different type of skillshot.\n\nGiven the varied cooldowns, ranks and powers of each ability based on its rank, Pastel uses Energy (themed as paint) as a resource, allowing him to be balanced more universally across all his potential paths.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Incredibly high.  Pastel is a novel, ‘gimmicky’ character with an artistic whimsy that may not mesh well with the League universe.  In addition, his skills rely on a player to have external game knowledge in the form of their understanding of color patterns and color mixing.  Moreover, having abilities based on colors may prove insensitive and/or frustrating for colorblind players. Finally, with so many varied builds and ability point options, he would likely be a nightmare to balance.\n\n**Appearance**: Just like with his abilities, Pastel is a blank canvas in terms of his visual design.  Below are some possible art styles to explore.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/painting_dragon_by_breathing2004-d4nyw5i_zpsdh8wgpbg.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/painting_fish_by_qinni-d4t1tis_zps1tphrm7h.gif\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/gijinka_inkjinka_art_contest_by_domdozz-d4qkzyp_zpsd54yvhpq.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/where_i_begin_by_nilampwns-d5xvoh5_zpszxainz9s.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Adeleine_zpsn0vbrtcu.png\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Uses energy (paint) as a resource, can rank up abilities to suit role and counter opponents, can heal, has high team utility\n\n**Weaknesses**: cannot deal as much damage as true burst mages, dependent on skill order, must lock into role early in a match, no escapes, can only max rank two abilities\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:77}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:43}}  (pre-rework)\n\n**Auto Attack**: A long range attack,  Pastel flicks his paint brush, sending a glob of paint towards foes\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13675_btn_zpsmulwpsmh.jpg\n**Passive- Artistic Vision**: Each of Pastel's abilities can be ranked up 7 times, with the 7th rank-up providing considerably higher bonuses than previous ranks.\n**Design Philosophy**: This gives players a significant power spike when reaching rank 7 of an ability, which is designed to feel rewarding and help reinforce the chosen role or play style selected by the Pastel player.  In addition, this Passive is meant to be simple and provide obvious power for Pastel players, as their skill order and abilities in general are rather complex.  From a development perspective, creating UI for abilities that can rank up 7 times may prove too costly or technically challenging.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_746_btn_zpsqizxn2ky.jpg\n**Q- Burst of Red (5 seconds)**:  Pastel creates a burst of red paint at a target location after a short delay, dealing magic damage to enemies caught in the area and covering them in red paint for 5 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown. It also increases the damage component of ‘Splotch of Purple’.  Additionally its particles and effects change at rank 7.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12725_btn_zpsec80ugv3.jpg\n**Secondary Effect- Splotch of Purple**: Enemies affected by ‘Wave of Blue’ directly  before or after ‘Burst of Red’ suffer bonus magic damage based on the rank of Q and are silenced for 1 second plus .5 seconds for every 100 AP Pastel has, up to 3 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Pastel’s primary damage/harass tool and most consistent skill, as well.  The silence component is tied to W, which is a much shorter range ability, and therefore will most likely only be used during all-ins or when being all-in’d.  For the purposes of Pastel’s Ultimate, Q starts out at a very small radius similar to Cassiopeia's Q.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_747_btn_zpsx9idcehf.jpg\n**W- Wave of Blue (7 seconds)**: Pastel creates a wave of blue paint in a cone with his brush, restoring the mana of allies and lowering the armor and MR of enemies significantly. This also covers those enemies or allies in blue paint for 5 seconds.\nRank-ups restore more mana and lower enemy resistances more. It also increases the healing effects of Dab of Green.  Additionally its particles and effects change at rank 7.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_748_btn_zpsybykx6pm.jpg\n**Secondary Effect- Dab of Green**: Allies affected by ‘Wave of Blue’ directly before or after ‘Splash of Yellow’ are healed for a base amount based on the rank of W +.3AP.\n**Design Philosophy**: Wave of Blue is designed to hit large numbers of either allies, enemies or both, using a skillshot shape similar to Karma’s old Q.  The heal component is designed to be consistent and easy-to-apply, given the combo required to perform it.  For the purposes of Pastel’s Ultimate, W starts out as a very small, narrow cone.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15576_pas_zps79cshtfk.jpg\n**E- Splash of Yellow (9 seconds)**: Pastel fires a lined skillshot that creates a trail of slippery yellow paint on the ground, increasing the movement speed of allies who travel on it. The first enemy hit by the paint suffers magic damage and stops the trail. Both allies and enemies affected by this ability are covered in yellow paint for 5 seconds.\nRank-ups increase the damage dealt, as well as lower cooldown. It also increases the damage component of Orange. Additionally its particles and effects change at rank 7.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_741_btn_zpsb2ywulya.jpg\n**Secondary Effect- Tinge of Orange**: enemies affected by ‘Splash of Yellow’ directly before or after ‘Burst of Red’ suffer heavy magic damage over time based on the rank of E.\n**Design Philosophy**: Splash is intended to be a utility ability which can be augmented for high single target damage, if desired.  Its ally/enemy application is necessary to provide different secondary color effects for synergies with the rest of Pastel’s kit.  Tint applies its damage over time to prevent large amounts of on-demand burst, as that is one of the intended weaknesses of Pastel.  For the purpose’s of Pastel’s Ultimate, E starts out as a very thin line nuke.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_745_btn_zpszgayirlt.jpg\n**R- Tools of the Trade**: Passive: the width and range of Pastel's basic abilities is increased, and his Paint (energy) regenerates at an increased rate.\nRank-ups increase the passive's effects. In addition, his brush and pallet evolve visually at rank 7 of this ability.\n**Design Philosophy**: A huge part of Pastel’s dynamic and variable builds and playstyles stems from his Ultimate.  It is designed to have purely passive effects, to offset the complicated combos, skillshots and spell orders needed to capitalize on the rest of his kit.  By augmenting his existing abilities, Pastel can choose to be a single target or AoE mage, a single target or AoE support, or a jack of all trades.\n\n**Gameplay Patterns**: Single target mages will want to level Q and E to maximize burst damage on single targets, building AP and magic penetration to assassinate enemies.\n\nAoE mages will want to level Q and R to damage as many enemies as possible with infinite sustain, building CDR to capitalize on the quickly regenerating Paint.\n\nSingle target supports will excel in lane by leveling W and E to have powerful single target heals and sustain. Building a good mix of aura items (with health) and AP will let you stay closer to the front lines to support your champion of choice while still dealing competent damage.\n\nAoE supports should max W and R, healing as many people as possible at every opportunity. This role deals the least amount of damage, but buying CDR and aura items makes them a boon in large scale team fights.\n\nA jack of all trades will level their skills evenly and provide a decent mix of damage and utility, also building a mix of AP and support items.\n\nMore rarely, a Pastel player may max Q and W to provide a mix of self-support/heals and damage, or E and R for a mix of AoE utility and damage. The former will typically build as a pure AP Mage, the latter likely wanting to incorporate a tankier build.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)  You can find a similar concept created by Nameless Hero by clicking [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/nm245ouh-su-the-wandering-calligrapher)","replies":[{"poster":"Reformed Dunni","date":"2015-03-31T00:11:04.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems overloaded and complex im all about high skill cap complex champion but I think it would take a pro support player at least 2 whole weeks to figure him out lol mind making it a little more simple?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-30T20:57:01.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You found some great art for your concept!

I will not comment on who stole whose idea but I do think that EvilRabbit was sincere and yeah, do mention him. I will say to you the very thing that I said to him.\n\n\nI like the Giant Paintbrush wielding Mage. We need more artists in LOL lore and this feels like a refreshing new concept. \nBut your colour wheel mechanic is unwieldy and very complex. Therefore I would like to suggest that we combine forces and produce a different champion. \n\n\nSu the Calligrapher\nRole: AP Mage, AP Support\n\nInspiration: Zhang Xu the Mad Calligrapher\n\nGeneral Design Philosophy: Su is a powerful mage able to bring her imagination to life. Her giant paintbrush allows her to create short lived ink creatures that have various uses. Using a mix of snares, skill shots and denial areas, she can trap and damage the enemy before summoning her ink dragon to finish her enemies. \n\nAppearance:\nSu is an asian themed calligrapher with jet black hair gathered in a heavy braid which resembles a paintbrush. She is beautiful but has little concern for appearance and has ink stains everywhere. In game, she spins and leaps elegantly while using both her giant paintbrush and braid to quickly draw her creatures. Using ink drains the colour of her hair.\n\nLore: Ever since she was little, Su was unusually skilled at the art of Ink magic. While her peers usually stuck to Rune writing, Su was able to give life to birds and animals. One day, she was haunted by the dream of a mysterious wind dragon and has since since spent all her life trying to draw a creature that she barely remembers. Ridiculed by her peers for her obsession with drawings of her \"imaginary\" creature and hated for her harsh caricatures of corrupt officials and vain socialites, she escaped Ionia and wanders the land in search of the wind dragon.\n\n\nStrengths: Uses energy (ink) as a resource, has high team utility\n\nWeaknesses: Few escape options and no defensive ability. She relies on team mates to defend her. Needs to plan her abilites. Long casting times. Melee\n\n\n**Auto Attack: **Su whacks her giant paintbrush at an enemy. Melee champion. Autoattacks restore her ink faster\n\n\n**Passive**: Su uses Ink as a resource.\n\n**Q: Forest snake. - Fast projectile Skill Shot**\nSu quickly draws a snake on the ground that quickly travels in line and wraps around the first enemy unit hit snaring them. 450 range.\nIf the snake hits a terrain head on it will die. But if it hits at an angle it will ricochet and continue its way until 600 range total. Casting time same as thresh hook\n\n**W: Flame tiger. - AOE Trap**\n2s casting time. Su draws a tiger on the ground where she stands. The first enemy who walks near is attacked and briefly stunned by tigers. Max 3 tigers\n\n**E: Millenium Crane -  Utility**\n1s casting time. Passive. Increases her ink generation. Active Sudraws a giant bird that circles around her giving vision in an expanding concentric circle.\n\n**R: Water Dragon - Channelling - **\nSu spins and leaps and draws her dragon adding more and more details and charging him up until she releases R. Dragon then rampages in a line in front of her damaging and knocking champions ASIDE the further that he is charged up to 1200 range. Water dragon ricochets and reflects on walls and destroys all player terrain. Visually, it looks a furious river breaking a dam. \n\n**Gameplay**\nFitting for an artist, Su needs time to create her masterpieces and thus cannot easily chain abilities. Her playstyle revolves around accumulating ink and setting up traps for her allies until she has time to charge up her Dragon. Her kit is especially devastating if she manages to catch people in the jungle thanks to her Tigers and ultimate.\n\n**Risk:**\nI don't know what you mean by risk but I do know that foreign looking champions are generally badly received. But she has a unique concept not found in any other MOBA and an neat mechanic with her ricocheting snakes and is a new archetype in the RPG genre.\n\nAlternate skins: Maoi Artist Su where she draws turtles, sharks and fishes, Prehistoric Su where she draws bisons, mammoths and antellopes, Alchemist Su where she draws alchemical circles that launch fire, air and water elementals, Punk Su where she draws giant tattoos of snakes, skulls, butterflies and the grim reaper\n\n\nThat's how I imagine a Legendary artist. I am absolutely crap at drawing and balancing champions and if I was afraid of someone stealing my ideas I would not post this on a public board. So feel free to use it but mention me ok :).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-28T21:19:11.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nameless Hero,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=fTwuEYmo,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-27T10:15:15.716+0000)\n>\n> HI Lutzburg, \n>\n\n\nHi Hero, thanks for writing up such detailed and honest feedback.  I really appreciate the effort and the contributions you've made.  Just as a quick aside, I took your suggestion and have adjusted the thumbnail image for Pastel.  I still like his name, however, and it's impossible to edit thread titles, so that's set in stone for now, I'm afraid.\n\nRegarding other paint-inspired champions, I'll say that Pastel is a concept I've had for close to 3 years now.  A few weeks ago I saw someone holding a \"paint themed tank\" contest on the forums, so I imagine that's why more kits like Pastel's have started to surface lately.\n\nRegarding Pastel's kit, I agree that it's complex and highly experimental in nature.  It does task players with combining two abilities together in a specific spell order.  He's also Udyr-like in nature, so that adds another layer of complexity.  That said, his Passive and uncastable nature of his Ultimate should help compensate for this, and the color-mixing and dynamic spell rank-ups are core to my vision for Pastel's identity.  As a result, while I do think your kit has a lot of merit and good ideas, it's not \"my\" version of Pastel and I think it misses the whimsical and experimental vibe I was going for with the concept.\n\nHowever, I think you should absolutely publish this kit under your own name and gather as much attention and feedback around it as you want to.  You clearly put in a lot of work and that effort should be put on display and recognized.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-03-30T20:21:20.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thnx man.
