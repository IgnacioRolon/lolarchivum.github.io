{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T00:15:48.555+0000","title":"Flint, the Bombardier","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Role**: AD Jungler, AD Caster/Fighter\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create an AD caster counterpart to Xerath’s siege gameplay and Heimerdinger’s sentry construction.  That doesn’t sound OP at all, does it?\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Flint is a siege/artillery AD caster designed around pushing objectives, sieging safely from the enemy’s jungle and planting traps around the map.  If and when he does get caught out of position, he has few options to save himself, as he makes for a terrible duelist.\n\nThe core mechanic of Flint is utilizing his Level 1 Ultimate, Shellshock, to fire long range mortar shells across lanes or over jungle camps.  His Mortar can be put to even greater effect when used in conjunction with his W, which allows him to deploy his Mortar anywhere on the battlefield.  Once deployed, Flint is free to move about the map while firing Shellshock blasts remotely.  The rest of his kit is designed to compliment the core gameplay pattern of setting up a sieging area, creating a defendable bunker around that area, and proceeding to split push or cause cause elsewhere on the map.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  His kit flows nicely and a lot of balance considerations have been made.  However, the role of an AD artillery champion is largely untested and may prove unfun or potentially broken.  The utility of his kit may also need to be toned down.\n\n**Appearance**: Flint is a somewhat heavy set, middle aged man with a beard and mustache.  His manliness is rivaled only by his portliness.  His handsomeness cannot be rivaled, however, as Flint might refer to himself as a “manlier Liam Neeson,” should he ever become aware of the famous action movie star.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/big_boss_liam_neeson_by_kareig-d60m4v0_zpsf617c015.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/treister_zps5e12dcd8.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Prom4_zps8004c365.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/332_zps3e7cb718.png\n\n**Lore**: A Demacian soldier who excels in military tactics and is a master bombardier.  Though he comes from a military background, his duties often call for solidarity over long periods of time while out in the field.  As a result, Flint’s personality often takes the forefront, as he is known to play by his own rules and have a little fun from time to time, even when it’s not entirely appropriate.\n\n*Some might say that Flint has a very unique set of skills.  He knows who you are, he knows where you are, and he will kill you.*\n\n**Strengths**: Excellent sieging and split-pushing powers, great scout and semi-global threat when in the enemy’s own jungle, powerful counter jungler, very unique set of skills\n\n**Weaknesses**: Woefully unequipped if he gets caught “with his pants down,” requires long setup times and excellent aim, must adapt to enemy movements and requires razor sharp map awareness\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:101}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:96}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A beefy melee punch.\n\n*Note- Abilities are listed in the most effective order for educating readers about Flint’s kit*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6413_btn_zps985ae0b7.jpg\n**R- Shellshock (1.5 seconds)**: This is a level 1 Ultimate with four ranks, similar to Jayce or Elise. Flint fires an incredibly long range mortar shell at a target location using his Mortar, which may either be at his location or at an independent area somewhere on the map. The shells have a blast radius marginally larger than Xerath’s Ultimate, and deal 80/120/180/220/280 (+60% AD) physical damage.  This blast deals full damage to the target closest to the its center and 70% damage to all other targets. Shell Shock has a minimum cast range of 300.\nRank-ups increase damage done and ability’s cast range to 1,000/1,500/2,000/2500\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Flint’s primary damage tool and what the rest of his kit revolves around.  To prevent massive amounts of AoE physical damage, only the target closest to the ability’s center receives the full brunt of the damage.  In addition, the minimum distance to fire allows enemy players the opportunity to really close the gap to dismantle Flint’s remotely located mortar or flat out kill him where he stands.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10311_btn_zps23eeede0.jpg\n**Passive- Direct Hit**: Damaging an enemy champion with Shell Shock increases Flint's attack damage by 15% for 5 seconds. This effect can stack up to three times and landing subsequent hits refreshes the buff's duration.\nDesign Philosophy: Shellshock is Flint’s primary damage ability, though it is rather difficult to aim consistently.  Repeated shots against an enemy champion should feel rewarding, so Direct Hit is designed to promote this positive gameplay pattern.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14290_pas_zps4371db1e.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15849_btn_zps99d8fc60.jpg\n**W- Deploy/Pack-up (0-10 sec)**: \n\n**Deploy Passive**: Flint gains 10/15/20/25/30 movement speed when not carrying his mortar.\n\n**Pack-up Passive**: Flint gains 10/15/20/25/30 bonus armor when carrying his mortar.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14290_pas_zps4371db1e.jpg\n**Deploy Active**: Deploys Flint's mortar at target location, taking 2.5 seconds to activate. The mortar has base health that scales with Flint’s level and the ability’s rank,  and also enjoys 50% of Flint's armor and MR.  The mortar grants vision in a 300 unit diameter. If the mortar is destroyed, it is instantly returned to Flint, but Deploy cannot be recast for 10 seconds (unaffected by CDR).\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15849_btn_zps99d8fc60.jpg\n**Pack-up Active**: If cast within melee range of the mortar, Flint picks up the mortar and Deploy can be cast immediately. If outside of melee range, the mortar despawns from its current position and Deploy goes on a cooldown based on the distance Flint is from his mortar, from 2-8 seconds.  Flint cannot pack-up the Mortar from range while it is being attacked by enemy champions (though it can be packed up while being attacked by neutral monsters or enemy minions).\n\nRank-ups increase passive stat gains and the Mortar’s base health.\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive components of this ability are designed to improve Flint’s quality of life around the map.  The active components essentially allow Flint to fire his Ultimate from anywhere on the map.  The cooldown of this ability is tied to a number of factors to promote smart deployment and aggressive enemy counterplay.  A large part of the fun and strategy behind this ability is for Flint players to sneakily hide their Mortar in a place that won't be detected, not dissimilar from players placing cleverly hidden Pink Wards.  It's up to the enemy team to find the Mortar and destroy it, which they can discern from the general direction in which the Mortars are being fired from.\n\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16486_btn_zps5bf3f999.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12416_btn_zps8f05c7b9.jpg\n**Q- Iron Uppercut (14 sec, available when holding the mortar)**: Flint swings his mortar in a massive uppercut on his next auto attack, dealing physical damage (+20% AD) and briefly knocking the target skyward. This ability resets Flint's auto attack animation, and works identically to Blizcrank’s E.\n**Q- Landmine (12 sec, available when NOT holding the mortar)**: Flint places a slightly visible landmine at target location, similar to Caitlyn traps. After arming for 1 second, the first enemy unit to walk over it will detonate it, dealing 65/115/170/220/280 (+70% AD) physical damage in a small radius and knocking those targets back slightly.  Following this, affected enemies are then slowed by 50% for 2 seconds, the potency of which decays over the duration. Max of 3 mines can be placed at a time. Landmines last 4 minutes.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\nDesign Philosophy: Flint is relatively helpless once an enemy has managed to close the distance to him.  The uppercut acts as Flint’s last line of defense before suffering the consequences of getting caught out of position (note its long cooldown, making it truly a last resort).  The landmines are one of Flint’s many tools for map control and zone denial, especially in the enemy team’s jungle.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_3104_btn_zps79582511.jpg\n**E- Recon (32 sec)**: Passive: When Recon is available, Flint enjoys minor bonus health regeneration and regenerates 1.5% of his max mana every second.\nActive: After a brief delay, Flint reveals a portion of the map for 5 seconds with incredible range and places a massive bullseye on the area (1,500 diameter reveal, 1,000 diameter bullseye). Enemies standing on the bullseye receive a debuff that increases the damage they take from Shell Shock by 15/20/25/30/35%.\nRank-ups increase health regen and damage modification, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: As an artilleryman, Flint can oftentimes find himself laying in wait before springing into action.  The mana regeneration ensures that Flint can use Shellshock to his heart’s content after a long time of waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  The active component of Recon acts similarly to Ashe and Quinn’s sight revealing abilities, though this one is much more akin to Clairvoyance.  Relegating such a large zone for damage amplification creates powerful zone denial against the enemy team, and allows Flint to continue bombarding enemies long after they’ve gone outside of his normal vision range.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T00:36:53.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope Flint doesn't get bombed out of existence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlackerboyTC","date":"2015-03-29T18:06:32.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st picture looks like metal gear solid movie","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-29T18:08:40.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rekt522,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=TUkbEvBm,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-03-29T18:06:32.725+0000)\n>\n> 1st picture looks like metal gear solid movie\n\nYeah, I specifically looked up images of Solid Snake as reference material for what I thought Flint could look like.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-29T17:57:22.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bombs away!

His R lets him cast a single mortar shot to a target location (just like Xerath's Ult).  He can cast this spell, which has a fixed range based on where the mortar is.  He can carry the mortar, which means it would fire form him like a regular ability.  But he can also deploy the mortar and then walk away from it, possibly leaving it on the entire other side of the map.  When he casts his R while the mortar is deployed, its cast range is based on the MORTAR and not Flint.  In that respect, think of it like the attack range of one of Heimer's turrets.

He's like an AD Xerath, if anything.  He auto attacks in melee range.  His R uses targeting like Xerath's ult; they're skillshots.  Therefore he can cast them wherever he wants at a target location, but there is a travel time that makes them more difficult to aim.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-05T04:29:01.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to be a semi decent artist, but that was way back in my middle school and high school days.
