{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T04:08:34.045+0000","title":"Oberis, the Decrepit Knight","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AP Tank and Jungler\n\n**Inspiration**: I originally wanted to create a creature that shed damage-dealing pools when struck in combat, losing and regenerating them over time and changing its appearance as it did so. Months after Oberis was designed, Zac was revealed, who incorporated many of Oberis’ once-unique mechanics and theming.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Oberis is designed as a front line tank and initiator, as well as a consistent (but low) damage threat to entire teams. His kit is best suited for the jungle, and his abilities and scaling position him perfectly for the mid-late game. Oberis players should usually dive headfirst into a team fight, and can then make the strategic decision to either dive the enemy carries or peel for their own. The central theme of Oberis' kit is in the management and application of his Slime Globules, which (unfortunately) work similarly to Zac's. Finally, Oberis is gated primarily by his cooldowns and his globules, and therefore does not use mana or any other resource. Instead, the number of globules he currently possesses occupies his resource bar in small segments.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Was once low, is now moderate. Oberis occupied a space that has now likely been filled by Zac (I conceptualized Oberis long before Zac was announced).\n\n**Appearance**: Oberis is a humanoid, blob-like creature, who hides a glowing skeletal suit of armor beneath his oozing, sickening slime. Oberis’ appearance changes slightly based on his current number of globules (detailed below), revealing the entirety of the suit when the globules are nearly depleted. Essentially, the living essence of Oberis is the slime itself. However, he uses his old hollowed out suit of armor as an avatar or vessel in which to move around in freely.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/GelatinousCube_zps877411e8.jpg\n*The slime creature engulfing Oberis.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/knight_yi_by_puscifer91-d59vwsh_zps12541d8f.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/monster-water-revenant-full_zps9ec81bf7.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/240px-Acidic_Swamp_Ooze_-_full_art_zps41fdf911.jpg\n*The slime creature before consuming Oberis.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/248663_zpsdad3043d.jpg\n*Oberis fleeing from the encroaching slime monster, deep in a forgotten dungeon of Valoran.*\n\n**Lore**: Oberis is a knight who was killed and consumed by an ancient slime monster guarding a treacherous dungeon. While he is uncertain as to why, for some reason Oberis' spirit survived the encounter with the creature, and he was able to commandeer its mortal coil and continue his duty and service to the armies of Demacia using the slime as an avatar. He now uses his old suit of armor as a vessel in which to travel, manifesting appendages and extremities out of his new, slimy form. Oberis is a loyal soldier of Demacia and his allegiance is so strong that he has seemingly found a way to escape the clutches of death. Oberis continues to fight on seemingly unphased by his transformation, all in the name of the King.\n\n**Strengths**: Constant damage threat and able to disrupt enemy teams, strong peeling mechanics, innate tankiness, strong single target and AoE crowd control, does not use a resource other than globules\n\n**Weaknesses**: Loses effectiveness in long fights or when focused, must stay in close proximity to enemies to be most effective, low single target damage.\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:154}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:36}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Oberis swings his sword in a moderately long melee range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_4074_pas_zpsc37961cc.jpg\n**Passive- Slime-cast Armor**: Oberis’ body is comprised of up to 10 slime globules, which regenerate over time. Being attacked from any source causes Oberis to lose a globule, which splashes onto the ground and deals 9-77 true damage (5 + 4 per level) to enemy targets that touch it. These splotches last for 2 seconds, though a single enemy may only be damaged by a particular globule once. A single globule can affect multiple enemies, however. Oberis regenerates one globule every 2 seconds when out of combat, and every 4 seconds when in combat. This effect cannot be triggered more than once per second. After death, Oberis revives with 10 globules.\n**Design Philosophy**: Oberis’ kit and visuals are heavily themed around this. This allows Oberis to be a constant damage threat regardless of the enemy team’s defenses when effectively diving them during team fights.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11636_btn_zpsbb113415.jpg\n**Q- Corrosive Blade (8 seconds)**: Oberis swings his sword in a short, wide cone, dealing 80/110/140/170/200 (+80% AD)physical damage. Additionally, a toxic slime is flung from the blade in a much larger arc (similar to Riven’s Ultimate, though likely a shorter range), applying a magic DoT and 30% slow to all enemies hit that lasts 2.5 seconds. This DoT deals 20/30//40/55/70 (+60% AP) damage over its duration. This ability’s cooldown is reduced by .25 seconds for every globule he possesses. Rank-ups increase damage done.\n**Design Philosophy**: The sword itself deals roughly 70% of the ability's damage, with the DoT's primary function being the application of the slow. This allows Oberis to clear jungle camps more effectively while requiring more of a commitment to engage in order to effectively trade damage. Typically, an Oberis player will proc a long range slow with his Q before getting into range to cast Engulf, completing his initiation loop even while starting from a considerable distance.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14783_btn_zpsadb7d42e.jpg\n**W- Slime Shield (12 seconds)**: Passive: Oberis gains 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 armor and magic resistance for every globule he currently possesses.\nActive: Oberis morphs 2 of his globules into a protective knight's shield for himself (which he wields in his empty hand), absorbing 100/150/200/250/300 (+15% bonus health) damage and lasting up to 6 seconds. Additionally, Oberis' auto attacks deal 30/45/60/75/90 (+2% of your maximum health) bonus magic damage while the shield holds. This ability costs 2 globules and cannot be cast without at least 2 globules.\nRank-ups increase bonus damage and shield strength, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive component of this ability allows Oberis to be incredibly durable when he initially dives into an enemy team, and also allows him to better survive through jungle camps. The active borrows from the mechanics of Nautilus’ shield, as Oberis can either draw enemy focus during a team fight, or he himself can deal considerable damage while being ignored. The shield also naturally allows him to better survives his initiations.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_516_btn_zps3b9739d2.jpg\n**E- Engulf (9 seconds)**: Oberis targets an enemy to engulf in slime, rolling like a slinky to their location and snaring them for 1.25 seconds. This effect also deals 70/110/150/190/230 (+50% AP) magic damage and engulfs the target in a tar-like slime, causing the target to deal 10/15/20/25/30% less damage to all enemies for the next 3 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and increases damage debuff's effectiveness.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a powerful initiation or peeling ability similar to Maokai’s Twisted Advance. The damage reduction against the target allows Oberis to feel more secure when diving onto an extremely fed enemy carry. This also allows Oberis to assist his own carries who may be getting dogpiled on by enemy bruisers or assassins.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16112_pas_zps3a1f4054.jpg\n**R- Putrid Regeneration (45 seconds)**: Oberis rapidly regenerates 10 globules over 1.5 seconds. Additionally, Slime-cast Armor deals 50% bonus damage for the next 8 seconds.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase the ability's active duration.\n**Design Philosophy**: Oberis is incredibly weakened without his globules, especially since they are required for his W. Having a way to regenerate mid-battle and continue to serve a purpose is vital to his viability, and the bonus damage effect ensures that his damage presence when running amok in the middle of a team is noticed and dealt with. Finally, the unique duality of this ability's strengths positions it as a sort of second wind for Oberis. Casting it will allow him to deal more damage, but if he casts it immediately upon engaging the enemy team, he will waste the regeneration effect. This creates an interesting decision point for Oberis players to make during each team fight.\n\nSpecial thanks to \"If I Had a HiFi\" for devising many of the damage numbers and ratios for Oberis!\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-09T00:26:09.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I wish my threads could be as sticky as Oberis is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadeMagnus","date":"2015-03-11T14:37:28.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off i fucking love this champ i want to play him right now welllll after bard but this guy would be amazing \n\nSecondly His ult should be made a passive and given another ability","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T17:49:11.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShadeMagnus,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=jcB4uBUc,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-03-11T14:37:28.189+0000)\n>\n> First off i fucking love this champ i want to play him right now welllll after bard but this guy would be amazing \n> \n> Secondly His ult should be made a passive and given another ability\n\nThanks so much!
