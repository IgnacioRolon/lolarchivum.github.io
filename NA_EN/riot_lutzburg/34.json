{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-12-21T03:57:26.860+0000","title":"Wukong Update- Prepped For PBE!","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThe team and I have made good progress on Wukong over the last few weeks, and we're excited to show him to all of you on the PBE!  However, based on the way our deploys work and how files get packaged, the next time the PBE will be updated will likely be the first week of January.  Wukong's files are prepped and ready to go, and will become playable automatically when the next deploy drops.\r\n\r\nso just what are the changes?  Before we get into them, I want to remind everyone of the major goals for this update:\r\n\r\n> 1- Shift Wukong's power towards the early game and away from the late game, while remaining roughly power neutral in the long run\r\n> \r\n> 2- Give Wukong players the tools they need to feel competitively viable in early lane phase/jungle\r\n> \r\n> 3- Create new outplay opportunities that enhance Wukong's identity as a tricky, uniquely mobile skirmisher with a hit-and-run combat pattern\r\n\r\nNote the absence of a goal referring to Wukong's role/classification.  This is because we have decided NOT to push Wukong explicitly into the Bruiser role.  With these changes, we aim to provide viable build paths for both Assassin/Lethality AND Bruiser itemization.  We want your itemization to be a reflection of your preferred play style, enemy match-ups and team composition.\r\n\r\nIn addition, these changes should help alleviate some of the most common points of frustration noted by the community.  Specifically, we're targeting:\r\n\r\n*     Reduced mana costs\r\n*     Providing a Passive that feels powerful and interactive\r\n*     Higher R power/satisfaction\r\n\r\nHere is the official list you'll be seeing on PBE later this week.  NOTE- these changes are relative to the LIVE GAME and are still a work in progress.  Values and mechanics may still change!\r\n\r\n**P- Stone Skin:**\r\n\r\n*     NEW- For 3 seconds after exiting brush or stealth, Wukong gains a physical damage shield equal to 12% of his maximum health. This effect can trigger once every 10 seconds.\r\n*     REMOVED- Wukong no longer gains bonus resistances based on nearby enemy Champions\r\n\r\n> Wukong's old passive provided a lot of hidden power in late game team fights that was hard to notice or appreciate, and felt practically useless in the early lane phase.  This new ability will grant Wukong brief windows to make aggressive trades he normally wouldn't consider taking.  The values are tuned to encourage Wukong to stay in an extended fight using clever brush play and a well-timed W to earn two procs of the shield in a single fight.  Conveniently, Wukong will also be able to shrug off a bit of damage from jungle monsters that hang out near brush.  We're hoping this provides a new form of skill expression and mastery that enriches Wukong's evasive, tricky play style.\r\n> \r\n> Note that we are still iterating on the exact mechanics/rules of the shield- please let us know what you think!\r\n\r\n**Q- Wuju Strike:**\r\n\r\n*     Mana cost lowered to 25 from 40\r\n*     CD reduced by 1 second at all ranks\r\n*     Damage adjusted to 1AD +20/40/60/80/100 damage (+.5 bonus AD) from 10/40/70/100/130 (+1/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 total AD)\r\n\r\n> As Wukong's primary trading and CS tool, we're lowering its cost and cooldown so he can poke and farm more reliably in losing matchups.  We're also simplifying the damage model, since the old one was a little confusing.  The spell now applies BONUS damage on top of Wukong's basic attack.  That bonus damage is equal to the values listed above.  Note that we've DOUBLED the rank 1 damage of Q from 10 to 20.  You're welcome.\r\n\r\n**W- Warrior Trickster:**\r\n\r\n*     Now instantly dashes towards the player's cursor instead of a short range blink\r\n*     Dash is 350 range and 1200 speed.  Can NOT go over walls\r\n*     Clone is now treated as a stationary Champion and will attack nearby enemies, prioritizing the last enemy Wukong damaged\r\n*     Clone's attacks deal a scaling 60-100% of Wukong's AD based on spell rank and applies on-hit effects, but cannot crit\r\n*     Clone looks identical to Wukong's animation state on spawn, and animates as if he pressed the \"S\" key\r\n*     Cooldown increased to 24/21/18/15/12 sec (from the time of initial cast) from 18/16/14/12/10 (from the time the clone disappears)\r\n*     Stealth duration reduced to 1 sec from 1.5\r\n*     Note: you may encounter a few bugs with the clone's target acquisition- we're working on these!\r\n\r\n> A nimble, free-target dash opens up a ton of new ways for Wukong to outplay his opponents.  From dodging crucial skillshots like Illaoi E or Cho'gath Q, to aggressively repositioning onto the enemy back line during a chaotic team fight.  Conveniently, Wukong's clone is also great at tanking jungle monsters!\r\n\r\n**E- Nimbus Strike:**\r\n\r\n*     Now deals magic damage instead of physical (but still scales with Attack Damage)\r\n\r\n> This change will increase Wukong's early damage and make it harder for enemies to itemize against him with early Armor purchases, while slightly curbing his late game damage when building lethality.  Crucially, the spell still scales with Attack Damage, NOT Ability Power\r\n\r\n**R- Cyclone:**\r\n\r\n*     Tick rate increased to every .25 seconds from .5 (damage per tick halved to compensate)\r\n*     Each tick of damage now applies Conqueror\r\n*     Damage ratio increased to 1.25 AD/sec from 1.1\r\n*     Bonus MS% is now a flat 30/40/50% instead of ramping up over the duration\r\n*     E's attack speed buff renews itself while R is active\r\n*     Wukong can now cancel R early by casting another ability or recasting R\r\n\r\n> Hopefully R will feel better to cast and, ideally, channel for its full duration\r\n\r\nLet us know what you think of the changes after the next PBE deploy!\r\n\r\n-Lutzburg","replies":[{"poster":" E X Ø D ł A ","date":"2019-12-21T08:54:20.458+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":20,"body":"Hello Sir once again!

Overall it just means you need to think and act a bit quicker.  I prefer it as it is. Now we have a double dash one on W and one on E.","replies":[{"poster":" E X Ø D ł A ","date":"2019-12-22T08:26:35.889+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"but like did u even read what i suggest? xd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KeyBlade Wukong","date":"2019-12-21T09:03:19.215+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"I agree Too !\nI think u should think about that change\nBut anyways gj on the project! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eye Of Mordor","date":"2019-12-21T08:57:02.358+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":10,"body":"Totally Agree ma Dude &lt;3 \nI thought the same!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RoakOriginal","date":"2019-12-21T08:47:33.571+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not liking this.

That's...a LOT. (minus the duration it lasts, which is what, 1.5 sec?) \n\nI got pretty sad when I saw that, and immediately I wanted to check if it was also worsened if it is maxed... and yup, 0.5 seconds extra even there.\nThat's just overkill. (assuming it's 1.5 that the clone is up)\n\nFurthermore that 0.5 sec off of invisibility. Aw maaan... That's not a lot of time to do anything with.\n\nI understand you're trying to tone down the late game, but you've already done that with E being magic, and the passive incapable of working great in teamfights. \n\nDecoy aka Warrior Trickster is THE playmaker ability. It is what makes the character.\n\nIt is exactly this sort of thing I don't understand when reworking a character.\nYou see he struggles early, especially more as other champs get updated and more come out...\n\nSo you boost his early, and nerfs his late. It's ok, it's tough to give up something, but it's a needed change.\nThen you think his early is too good, and nerf the early, and further nerf the late. Now that's just rough. The Q change wont be much in terms of raw power. The swing time for that autoattack is just really high and clunky. Quite the opposite of old poppy Q for instance where you just immediate, feel the hit connect.\n\nAnd the movespeed on R is mostly just wasted stats. Yes, I can mention games where it helps or made a difference, but it's truly rare. And you die internally as well because it's such a long cooldown that using it as an escape feels horrible.\nIf the radius was larger, one could actually do a bit of outskill by keeping someone right on the edge where they can't auto-attack, but still get hit by the R vs melee, but you really can't. (like you do with lucian R, or taliyah's stones etc.)\n\nAnyway, so I'd give up that any day to get cd off of decoy aka warrior trickster\n\nFinally, why is the shield physical and not a general shield?","replies":[{"poster":"K6KillzU","date":"2019-12-22T03:20:51.238+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The q change is a nerf though.

Whilst I agree youve shifted late game power to early game I really dont see how you consider him 'power neutral' in the long run with how much youve hit his late game. You've obly somewhat hit your mark here.\n\n2- Give Wukong players the tools they need to feel competitively viable in early lane phase/jungle\n\nSeeing as we have no passive if we fall upon an AP champ in lane idk how you feel we have 'the tools to feel viable in early lane phase'. \n\n3- Create new outplay opportunities that enhance Wukong's identity as a tricky, uniquely mobile skirmisher with a hit-and-run combat pattern\n\nI think youve hit the mark on this one.

If that 10 second CD wasn't there then I wouldn't be as concerned, but that feels WAY too long to wait for a 3 second boost against AD champs, making him pretty much hard countered by AP. There's not a LOT of AP champs that go top, but {{champion:57}} would pretty much remove him from the game, and that's not what I'd personally want to see from a champ who's supposed to be early game, especially if you plan on making him a skirmisher. \n\nSome ideas for that passive to play around with:\n\n- mechanic that lowers the cool down of the passive. something akin to {{champion:44}}'s heal interaction with his Bravado. Even if it was a very tiny fraction of a reduction, I feel like it would make it feel much more viable to use in combat against someone like {{champion:254}} as an example.\n\n- normal shield that takes bonus damage from AP. That way it still can help against AP but will still have that intended weakness. currently it feels like the opposite of {{champion:39}} in clarity. She is (or at least was on release) distinctly \"I'm better against AD\" while this passive makes Wukong \"I'm bad against AP\", if that makes sense. \nIf he was still going to be late game I don't think that would be a problem since he'd scale up to the point where he'd need some kind of noticeable weakness, but being an early game champ (and I assume not a hyper carry or something), his game will be ruined if he goes up against an AP champ top lane. I can not stress enough how much him against {{champion:57}} is giving me flash backs of AS {{champion:96}} vs {{champion:33}} from the way it sounds.\n\n- Longer duration shield. Simple and honestly one that I think would become clear if it's viable after this does hit the PBE and we see if 3 seconds is long enough or too short to be as effective as it needs to be for the job it's made for.\n\n\nOther then that:\n** Q**\n> Damage adjusted to 1AD +20/40/60/80/100 damage (+.5 bonus AD) from 10/40/70/100/130 (+1/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 total AD)\n\n.... I don't math good, so I'm just going to assume this works until proven otherwise .__.\n\n> Note that we've DOUBLED the rank 1 damage of Q from 10 to 20. You're welcome.\n\n .>.> \n*angerly fixes bow-tie *  \nlIsTeN hErE yOu LiTtLe So AnD sO- (this is a joke incase someone couldn't tell from the way I wrote it .-.)\n\n**W**\n\n>Now instantly dashes towards the player's cursor instead of a short range blink\n\nThis will take some getting used to for sure, Though I think at the end of the day this will add some really powerful positioning mastery to Wukong that wasn't there before.\n\n>Clone's attacks deal a scaling 60-100% of Wukong's AD based on spell rank and applies on-hit effects, **but cannot crit**\n\nI know \"CritKong\" is more of a meme thing and not really something people would have considered viable, but kind of sad that this will prevent him from building 100% Crit (As the give away would be the lack of the clone doing the crit effect/animation on hit), Simple fix for that I believe would be for it to show the effect of a critical hit without it doing actual crit damage, but I suppose it's not a major loss either way :(\n\n\n**E**\nNothing really. Honestly I still think the Magic Damage with AD scaling is neat for this ability since as it stood before, it would 9 times out of 10 miss out on the armor pen from your Q seeing as you'd normally lead with your E to engage.\n\n**R**\nThis went from the part of his kit that was fine to keep the same to becoming my favorite part of the new kit (aside from the attacking clone). The damage reduction is kind of disappointing but fully understandable (and frankly worth it for an increased tick rate), As a neat side bonus the change to his MS and renewing the AS boost from his E makes his Ult feel more like an off shoot of {{champion:11}}'s then before, which is kind of nice to think about as a lore lover. I found that Wukong's old kit didn't really reflect the idea that he learned his combat style from Yi, but this makes it feel like he took Yi's Ult and adapted it to better suit his own style.\n_____\n\nOnly other thing I'm concerned about after all that is the visuals that we're getting with this. What was promised at the start of this update and what ended up being a MAJOR hold up was artists to work on new visuals which got a lot of people excited. But with these more recent editions of his update, a lot of us are feeling like they'll need much less visual work done then previous versions. Meanwhile {{champion:131}} who's update was supposed to be smaller seemed to have gotten some pretty good new visuals for her kit. \n\nNow of course a lot can be said about how much harder it is to code for Wukong's new mechanics vs rearranging some of Dianna's kit to be smoother, but as a player and especially as a player who's been told that that we'd be getting new visual effects, I'm very concerned that those \"new effects\" were downgraded for efficiency and may only amount to a shield bubble forming whenever Wukong's new passive is active. If that is more or less all we end up getting then people WILL be upset without a doubt. The outcry will be \"it took this long because of a need for animators and all we got was a shield bubble?\". I really wish we could find out more about the visual work that's going into this update to maybe help with those concerns, though I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\n\nThat's pretty much everything off the top of my head. While I'm still VERY disappointed that update isn't showing up till after the first of the year, I will at least say I'm happy that you at least gave us some more details about what we're now looking at when it does hit the PBE, allowing us to give some amount of feedback before it gets there (in a way, letting us help but letting you know of pain points you may want to keep an eye on). Much happier hearing something about the update rather then just finding out it's been postponed again (though this time due to technical issues) and signing off without anything more said on the matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joeda89","date":"2019-12-21T06:47:37.123+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":18,"body":"Well i guess theres nothing we can do now.

Half a second less to run into melee range so we can save to for when they use an escape.  \n\nmy disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.  \n\nE: manic damage.

However changing the name of Crushing Blow is very disappointing. Whenever I would hit someone with a crushing blow in lane I would shout \"CRUSHING BLOW. YOU'RE CRUSHED\" as a way to hype myself up as they would win the upcoming trade. Doing this was the only way to keep my morale up as I saw the downward spiral of laning Wukong. If that is taken away from him then my friends also cant run the \"Blow Brigade\" comp which consists of Wukong, Vi, Jayce, Naut, Braum(Crushing Blow, Denting Blows, Thundering Blow, Staggering Blow, and Concussive Blows\") With wukong gone it wont be a squad anymore and the team will have to break up. Doesn't that sound awful? You can prevent this Riot Games please. Let him remain the crusher. We may have learned from Master Yi but that doesnt mean we wanna be associated with him. Please remane Pooju Strike back to the CHAD CRUSHING BLOW. I'll buy some skins if i have too. Thank you for reading and have a happy holiday.\n\nSincerely,\n     BrawlerG31\n\nEDIT: \"I'm very unhappy\" should've been \"I'm very Happy\". Guess I'm still hurt over the loss of crushing blow","replies":[{"poster":"KBphan","date":"2019-12-21T21:19:05.588+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly Mr. Brawlerg31 here is right, crushing blows has always been a core part of wukongs identity.

To rip out the years of history and culture with this ability name change is devastating to wukong players such as Mr. Brawerg31.

IF SO, CORRECT ME PLZ!!!\n\nFull Lethality build: {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3181}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3117}}  = 255AD\nHP = 2748\nArmor = 100\nMR = 53\nBase Damage = 136\nBonus damage = 275\nTotal AD = 411\nPassive: \nShield = 12% of 2748 = 330 (at lvl 18, 330 shield is pretty negligible. Even {{item:3072}}  shield is higher)\nCD = 10 sec, Duration =  3 secs :\nQuestion: CD starts when shield appears or disappears?\nIf the CD starts after shield disappears, we will be forced to auto trade for 10 secs before we use the next shield by using w, which is not a wise choice. So only once per trade is possible\nIf CD starts after shield appears, 3 secs of shield + 7 secs of auto trades with no shield. Still I wont do that.\nSo basically, its once per trade.\nYou can trade every 10 secs.\n\nQ: By changing it to bonus AD, you are shifting power to mid-late game (contrary to what you wanted to do). Even then, it loses around 10% of the damage\nEg: \nCurrent Q in live servers does 411 + (130 + 170) = 711\nNew Q: 411 + 100 + 275/2 = 648.5\nNot only at late game, but at any point of the game, q loses 10% of the damage.\n\nThis is just a theoritical analysis. Gotta try it in actual game, before anymore comments on the Q changes\n\nW: \nW can't hop over walls:          :(\nDash distance increased :      :). Useful as he mentioned\nClones auto: With the Q damage decreased and E damage dealing less due to no lethality effect, I think we will be forced to use clones to fight rather than juke.\nGotta try it out.\nW invis duration reduced: I'm actually interested in knowing why this change was done. If there's any valid reason, I will accept it. ( i really can't think of a reason, thats why)\nClone stays for longer periods I presume.\nCD increased: its OK coz the timer starts after it is casted and not ended\n\nE:\nChanged to magic damage - so lethality doesn't work with E. But useful for armor stacking juggernauts and kinda useful against mages who build zhonyas (mid viable with E max proly)\n\nR:\nThank you for conqueror procing\nBEST CHANGE FOR WUKONG\nNO COMPLAINTS\n\n\nOVERALL:\nNow he will be a champion who can engage easily and tank for a bit. Then disengage after his shield expires with his w or ult. \nI really don't know how to use my passive shield twice in a fight without him dying with the lethality build.\nEven a tanky build is not tanky enough for Wukong because his base stats are not for a bruiser/tank, but its of an assassin/fighter stats. So you can't expect him to be good with full tank build also.\nHe is kinda a mixed damage dealer now with conqueror mostly being abused.\n\nI am excited and scared at the same time.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COMMENT AND SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MY ANALYSIS.\n\nI REALLY TOOK TIME TO DO THIS ANALYSIS\n\nREALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.\nTHANKS RIOT LUTZBERG","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeafyGreen","date":"2019-12-21T04:13:53.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"With all of these R QOL's I do not think insanely buffing the damage on it will help Wukong be a more figher and less e q r one shot champ","replies":[{"poster":"10DamageQLUL","date":"2019-12-21T08:09:53.567+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"He lost damage around the board he definitely won't be doing any of that, also the damage didn't get buffed at all just the tick rate, a full lethality wukong will have a hard time one shotting anything unless extremely ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2019-12-23T00:22:13.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Am I the only one who is not excited to see another rework of a champion that I consider to be already well-designed?\n\nI'll hold off final judgment until I play the new Wukong.... but there are important question marks that I did not see addressed regarding the process by which these changes were settled upon and that's why I regard these changes as a roll of the dice on Wukong's design.  IMO, it is a coin-flip to see if the new Wukong will be as well-designed.  It might be.  Some of the changes do look interesting and look like they are close enough to Wukong's play that he will remain fun to play.\n\nI'm not a Wukong main personally, but I know people who love to play Wukong specifically and I've _**always**_ had fun playing Wukong on those occasions I've played him.  I've noticed that many changes RIOT makes to champions have the effect of making those champions less enjoyable for me to play.\n\nI always worry in cases where RIOT makes changes to a champion that feels good to play that that champion will get added to my list of sad faces.\n\nFor example, I recently was testing out Evelynn in a practice just for fun and realized that I had forgotten the extent of the changes that had been made to her.  So I played around with her for a while exploring the changes and suddenly realized that she wasn't as fun to play!  I wasn't playing against any real people.  I was just exploring how she felt to play.  Maybe Evelynn is in a better place in terms of game balance, idk.  All I know is that sometimes RIOT makes changes to champions that are already fun to play (even if you aren't playing against anyone) and those champions suddenly become less fun to play.  So I have a concern - a legitimate concern.

Wow! I just love the ult changes. I was already quite pleased with the previously proposed changes to his R, but it seems like you've finally heard us as it now applies conqueror. Really like the flat MS% bonus, I think it's a nice QoL enhancement. Last time I think you had said the E AS passive would get paused when we ult. Now the buff renews when we ult? If I get that correctly, we can E in, auto-attack for 3.9 seconds, then ult, and we'll be rewarded with another 4 seconds of AS steroids as the ult finishes? I like it a lot. Buffs all across the board for his ultimate, can't complain, good work there.\n\nI do think the E dealing magic damage is a great idea. A lot of the players didn't understand it would still scale with AD in your last post. You made it quite clear this time, well played.\n\nThe lowered mana and cooldown on Q is quite sound. I feel like a 30 mana cost + refund on kills was a better idea though.\n\nI really like the target-free dash on the new W but there are caveats. I assume the loss of .5 second of invisibility is meant to compensate for the dash distance. I understand the thought process but still feel this is uncalled for, especially when comparing with other champions' stealth abilities duration. I already see the clone as an unreliable source of damage since any intelligent player will step away from it, and now they'll be assured to do so .5 seconds faster, which could really well make the difference and drop the clone's AA count by one. Honestly, this doesn't bother me that much, but I really feel cheated that you won't allow us to go over walls. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I always thought that one's ability to go over walls was a simple calculation involving (A) The range of a dash, and (B) the thickness of the wall. This is beyond me, how do you claim to \"enhance Wukong's identity as a tricky, uniquely mobile skirmisher\" when you shorten his invisibility time and won't allow his target-free dash to go over walls?? Please educate me, but I don't recall any champion having this wall-hopping limitation on a dash, targeted or not. Constantly being exposed to new champions with overloaded kits really leaves me shaking my head over this.\n\nI do like the concept behind the new passive but really dislike the physical damage only shield. If the idea is to keep him away from mid lane it sort of makes sense, but what I really see is Wukong being somewhat helpless vs most if not all AP tanks and mages in the top lane. Notwithstanding the physical only part of it, the shield does look substantial, more-so if you build health obviously, but I'm really not sure about the cooldown, seems like it'll only be proc'able once per fight most of the time, that's assuming you have the mana to do so... (10+ seconds fight for a champ that weaves in and out seems unlikely, and the 10-second mark is if you opened with your W). If there was some sort of mechanic to lower it, let's say whenever someone deals damage to your clone, that'd be nice. I feel like the values on his passive are the most prone to change so I'll keep an open mind and wait to try it on the PBE and see where all this is going.\n\nSo there goes my 2 cents.
