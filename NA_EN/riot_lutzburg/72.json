I find it frustrating, however, that the entire NA forums seem to go down at least 1-3 times per day, for anywhere between a few seconds and over 30 minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nIn the case of tonight, and what prompted this discussion, I was about to submit important edits to one of my concepts and the forums went down right as I was hitting Update.  Luckily I copy and save everything I work on to prevent the loss of my work, but I felt obligated to stay awake an extra 45 minutes in order to make the edits I wanted to make before leaving it for the world to see tomorrow.  This is obviously my own choice and I don't blame anyone for it, but it is definitely a frustrating and recurring problem that I don't see any Rioters discussing or presenting solutions for.\r\n\r\nSo, why does this happen and is there a plan to fix it?  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-01-15T10:55:05.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm relatively certain, and call me crazy, but it MIGHT have something to do with the little \"beta\" next to the bigger \"BOARDS.\"\n\nFrom what I can gather, it would appear that these boards might be some sort of an early access version to help work out kinks for a later release of a full fledged product or service of some kind.\n\nCall it a hunch.","replies":[{"poster":"Elphrihaim","date":"2015-01-16T11:26:26.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cale017,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=AA7HAnR7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-15T10:55:05.685+0000)\n>\n> I'm relatively certain, and call me crazy, but it MIGHT have something to do with the little \"beta\" next to the bigger \"BOARDS.\"\n> \n> From what I can gather, it would appear that these boards might be some sort of an early access version to help work out kinks for a later release of a full fledged product or service of some kind.\n\nIf that's the case, why was the full-fledged service offered by the Forums taken down, hm?","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-01-17T06:02:03.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elphrihaim,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=AA7HAnR7,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-01-16T11:26:26.479+0000)\n>\n> If that's the case, why was the full-fledged service offered by the Forums taken down, hm?\n\nBecause if they didn't, not enough people would have switched over to trying to use the Boards so that they could get enough of a test run for them.

They could've made an incentive to beta test this shit and people would've jumped at the chance. Instead we're all dumped here like guinea pigs while riot struggles to recreate something that's been commonly made since the last century. It's been a long time and yet there's still bugs I've seen since day one, though it matches their game and client well in that regard.\n\nThere is no excuse for forcing everyone into this early access garbage while riot drags their feet on doing anything worth a damn.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-01-16T04:33:45.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are still in beta, because there are bigger features they're still working on, but they are also the main NA boards.","replies":[]}]}]}
