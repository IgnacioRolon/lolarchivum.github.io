{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T07:06:38.612+0000","title":"Sharra, the Shadow Priestess","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage\n\n**Inspiration**: DoTs, spell vamp, and overall shadowiness!  My real goal here was admittedly selfish, as I simply wanted to create a champion that reminded me of my favorite World of Warcraft Class- the Shadow Priest.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Sharra is an aggressive AP mage with an emphasis on being a lane bully and forcing her opponents into making decisions they may not be ready for.  All four of Sharra's abilities leverage damage over time, and none of them provide much utility or crowd control.  Sharra is an excellent duelist but offers little in the way of team fights.  As is the nature of DoTs, her damage takes time to ramp up.  Her lack of mobility or utility offers her opponents a large window to focus her down before she has a chance to slowly whittle down her single priority target.\n\nIn combat, Sharra has access to a short ranged tether that suppresses the target's damage and fears them if they decide to stand and fight her directly.  She has a small AoE DoT effect which operates as her only form of wave clear, and interestingly has access to a DoT version of Nidalee's spear.  While applying her DoTs to a single target of her choice, Sharra enjoys passive spell vamp that increases the more DoTs she has active on targets at one time.  Her Ultimate allows her to combine all of her currently active DoTs into a single spell, which she can then cast on a target of her choice.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  DoT characters have been notoriously frustrating to play against (most notably Swain), as its inherently more difficult to gauge their power until well after a decision to engage has been made.  While Sharra’s theming and kit are all fine, there may just be something intrinsically anti-fun about DoT-based champions.\n\n**Appearance**: A robed, staff wielding female drenched in perpetual shadows which flow down her figure like a waterfall. Possibly hooded.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/tumblr_m64jqpPPaG1qicovoo1_1280_zps9a33ff93.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/shadow_priest_by_serraarc-d80t8qh_zpscd837c62.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/0vv0WgY_zpsaf9f416f.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/ebde36194b69bd164f3e2743406d5154487_zpsc6add221.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Amazing all-in, discourages disengagements, great lane sustain and harass, mild crowd control\n\n**Weaknesses**: No gap closer or escape, requires setup time to be effective, limited AoE capabilities for a Mage, mana hungry/high mana costs on abilities, poor wave clear, shut down by Cleanse/QSS/Zhonya’s etc.\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:50}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:76}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Sharra fires a long range bolt of shadow magic from her staff.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_641_btn_zps788a8d2d.jpg\n**Passive- Burdening Touch**: Damage over time effects originating from Sharra slow her target by 5% while they're active. This effect stacks with each subsequent spell affecting the same target.\n**Design Philosophy**: Sharra’s spells are designed to all overlap and affect a target simultaneously (up to six spells possible, in an ideal scenario).  A stacking slow creates a positive gameplay pattern that reinforces this behavior from the player.  Effects like Liandry's Torment and Ignite proc Burdening Touch.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5592_pas_zpsbd221548.jpg\n**Q- Crippling Apparition (6 seconds)**: Sharra fires a thin, lined skillshot (max 1300 range) that applies a DoT effect to the first target it reaches, taking the form of a shadowy viper. This DoT deals magic damage, the duration of which decreases the further it traveled to reach its target ( lasting between 3-6 seconds). The target is also initially slowed by 50%, which decays quickly to 0% over the duration of the spell. Thus, the closer the target is when struck, the longer and more powerful the slow.  Striking an enemy with this ability who is already affected by the DoT effect will have its duration refreshed.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is essentially a DoT version of Nidalee’s Spear, but in reverse.  Since Sharra is a close-and-personal type of mage, this ability has limited poke effectiveness but excels when used close up.  This ability also synergizes with Sharra’s Passive, as a longer-running DoT means a longer-lasting slow.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15627_pas_zps5393314e.jpg\n**W- Nightshade (7 seconds)**:  Sharra releases a burst of shadowy fog at a target location (700 range), applying a DoT effect to all targets in the area. This dot deals magic damage and lasts 4 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability functions similarly to Cassiopeia's Q, though it has a much larger radius and longer cooldown.  This is Sharra’s only AoE ability and her only means of wave-clearing.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5875_pas_zps43e0ce01.jpg\n**E- Debilitating Flay (9 seconds)**: Sharra targets a nearby enemy with a electrical tether from her staff (up to 300 range), which lasts 4 seconds and reduces the target’s damage output by 10/12.5/15/17.5/20% while active.  The afflicted enemy suffers magic damage over time while within range of Sharra.  If the tether breaks after 2 or more seconds, the target is feared for .5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage and fear duration, lower cooldown and increase enemy damage reduction.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is intended to be devious and cruel in its nature.  It acts as an incredibly powerful deterrent against all-inning Sharra.  This is because an enemy who is tethered and stays to fight deals considerably less damage, and an enemy who tries to run is crowd controlled instead.  While counterplay is somewhat limited, the ability does give enemies a 2 second window to decide if they want to flee or fight.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14216_pas_zps4c9d210d.jpg\n**R- Vampiric Surge (110 seconds)**: Passive: Sharra gains 5% spell vamp for every currently active spell.\nActive: Sharra applies fresh versions of all currently active spells on an additional enemy champion of her choice. If Sharra chooses to apply Vampiric Surge to an enemy already afflicted by one or more of her active spells, the damage of the re-applied spells is reduced by 70%.\nRank-ups lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive component of this ability allows Sharra to sustain in lane and survive her long-winded trades, which also require her to be in short range of her enemies  This is also a thematic necessity, based on her original inspiration as a Shadow Priest.  The active component is a way to make a predominantly single target, slow-burn mage into a 1v2 machine, basically doubling her damage over a single 4-6 second span.  The ability takes a heavy hit in potency when used against the same target, as this goes very much against the spell’s intended functionality, though it does synergize well with her Passive, as well as the passive component of Vampiric Surge.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2015-01-13T01:12:38.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your concept here.

All of the reference images I used are also of shadow priests wearing various raid gear.\n\nBased on your suggestions, I adjusted her cooldowns (some got higher, most got lower) and swapped the key bindings of her Q and E so that her more spammable spell was positioned as her Q.\n\nThanks for the feedback and the precious, precious upvotes!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-14T23:50:16.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sharra will flay the minds of every reader on these forums!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-27T22:02:42.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sharfalma, the Night Elf Shadow Priest of Nathrezim... my first love.

Liandry's is definitely awesome and it would be really neat if it counted as an additional DoT effect... same with ignite, perhaps?\n\nI think you make an EXCELLENT point about her E.
