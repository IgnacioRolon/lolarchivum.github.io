{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T06:07:55.947+0000","title":"Rothar, Emissary of the Trolls","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: AP Tank and Jungler\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a massive, hulking character similar in size to Nautilus, with a disruption and crowd-control based kit.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Rothar is a back line diving tank along the lines of Leona, and can be played as either a very tanky AP jungler or support-like peeler in team fights.  His kit allows him the luxury of trodding through enemy lines and literally picking up and tossing a squishy carry of his choice.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Rothar can be used as a catalyst to tell the next chapter in Trundle’s new lore as the King of the Trolls.  His kit is largely mechanically sound, though special care and iteration will likely be needed for his Ultimate.\n\n**Appearance**: A humongous troll with a massive cudgel and equally massive bulwark.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/ogre_by_antoniodeluca-d63vskh_zpsnzi8lvnb.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/12dcb0f637afeea0c692596bcaeec03d_zpste7oqzx6.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/200198-snow-troll-006_zps1xufijhm.jpg\n*Rothar after mercilessly pummeling his hapless victim and preparing to throw him into the waiting jaws of his allies.*\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Three types of crowd control including a reliable knock up, the ability to dive and survive, innate tankiness, long range slow, suppression ultimate\n\n**Weaknesses**: low personal damage, slow wave clear/jungle clear, reliant on teammates to capitalize on kit, no way to escape after diving, essentially must build tanky to accomplish intended role, very low AP Ratios on abilities\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:89}}{{champion:201}} {{champion:72}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Rothar swings a massive club/cudgel in melee range with one hand, holding a shield in the other.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13892_pas_zpsfs8xxagq.jpg\n**Passive: Bloodied Cudgel**: Every 5 basic attacks, Rothar slams his club to the ground, creating a shockwave that deals bonus magic damage to and around his target based on his level (20-150 bonus damage), plus 8% of his bonus health.\n**Design Philosophy**: As a single target damage dealer with an emphasis on utility over damage, Rothar needs some help in the jungle.  The bonus health scaling also synergizes with his role as a tanky diving champion.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11075_pas_zpsja4ihly1.jpg\n**Q- Walloping Bash (7 seconds)**: Rothar spins in a circle before walloping on his target with his next auto attack, sending them airborne for 1 second and dealing bonus magic damage. This resets his auto attack timer.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage to 40/70/100/130/160 +30% AP\n**Design Philosophy**: This is meant to be a simple, reliable form of crowd control along the lines of Blitzcrank’s E.  Rothar’s challenges are getting TO an opponent, but he should have an easy time locking them down once he manages to reach them.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8236_pas_zpsw42dp2fn.jpg\n**W- Entrenching Bulwark (12 seconds)**: Rothar lifts his massive shield, gaining armor and magic resistance for 3 seconds. Attacks made against Rothar during this time are stored in his shield, which glows brighter the more attacks it sustains. Following this, the ability can be reactivated (for the next 3 seconds), releasing the stored energy in a cone and dealing magic damage based on the number of attacks sustained (up to a cap of 8) plus bonus magic damage.\nRank-ups lower cooldown, increase resistances to 25/40/55/70/85/100 and increase damage to 60/120/180/250/320 +30% AP.  Each attack Rothar is dealt during this ability’s duration increases its damage by 5%, up to 40% bonus damage, or 448 +30% AP damage.  Minions and small monsters cannot trigger the stacking effect of this ability.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is quite similar to Leona’s W, without the accidental kill stealing nature of its after-effects.  The reactivation based around a cone-shaped skillshot allows Rothar to have more direct control over the ability.  Thematically, imagine a massive skull on his shield whose eyes glow brighter, releasing a hazing mist from its mouth upon activation.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10936_pas_zpsvh2ru4eg.jpg\n**E- Thunderous Quake (14 seconds)**: Rothar slams his club onto the ground, creating a long range zigzag skillshot that sends a fissure ripping through the ground at high speeds. This deals magic damage and slows all targets hit by 40%.  The fissure remains in the ground for 3 seconds, continually slowing enemies it contacts.  Once a target escapes from the fissure, they remain slowed for 1.5 seconds.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage to 60/90/140/180/220 +30% AP.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a dominant, powerful-feeling form of crowd control and gap closing that makes far more thematic sense than an ability to leap or sprint to a target.  This also creates a great opportunity for a Z shaped skillshot, rather than merely a line.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16626_pas_zpsqabnygtj.jpg\n**R- Merciless Pummel (120 seconds)**:  Rothar grabs an enemy champion in melee range (Skarner ult range) and suppresses them for 1.5 seconds, beating them with his club mercilessly and dealing magic damage (Rothar is also suppressed for the duration). During this time, the player must designate a destination for their victim via a radial line skillshot, as following the pummeling, Rothar sends them flying, dealing additional magic damage and knocking the target up to 1200 units back over one second.  (This functions similarly to Olaf’s Undertow.)  This ability can be interrupted by stuns, silences, knock-ups, etc.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage dealt.  Initial suppression damage increases to 150/250/350 and knockback damage increases to 50/100/150\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an incredibly powerful, single target suppression that acts as a cross between Skarner and Lee Sin’s ultimates.  The ability to choose a distance to fling the opponent is key in not creating scenarios where they are unintentionally pummeled over trees or cliffs.  The ability to interrupt the suppression is equally necessary to help balance the move, as it is most deadly during large team fights and Rothar is most likely diving through the enemy team to reach a priority target.  This creates situations where an enemy team will need to decide how best to handle the looming threat of Rothar’s Ultimate.  Alternatively, Rothar can use this ability as an unavoidable peeling tool to keep bruisers or fighters of the enemy team from reaching his carries.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2016-05-19T00:32:41.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminder for me to review this later","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2016-08-22T02:53:58.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm back! Sorry it took such a long time for the promised review\n\nI always liked Juggernauts and Rothar certainly fulfills the role's fantasy of a massive behemoth that will certainly wreck face if he gets close to you. I'm curious, what was your reasoning behind Rothar's AP scaling? It doesn't seem to fit his identity (though it definitely fills a role that is somewhat lacking in League gameplay)\n\nPassive (Bloodied Cudgel): Riot just made a post about Rengar and how they don't really feel it's within Rengar's identity to monitor his ferocity before a fight, as it runs contrast to his character. Perhaps this may be the same for Rothar? Not to mention, it's much harder to correctly manage your autoattacks if you want to have your first autoattack with a gank being enhanced with the passive. You could make it similar to Olaf's E or Master Yi's Q, having a timer cooldown being reduced by autoattacks, or having it refreshed after killing a unit like the {{item:3134}} passive (enforcing the bloody cudgel theme). That would give laning Rothar some important times to harass the laning opponent. I toyed around with the idea of having this passive give a small gap closer a la Illaoi W, but figured that it'd be too powerful with his Q and R.\n\nQ (Walloping Bash): Haha, I can totally see Rothar delivering a massive uppercut to the enemy. I like it.\n\nW (Entrenching Bulwark): I love this ability, as it reminds me of the old Odin'sVeil for the crystal scar. I'd love for this ability to have a HUGE impact on a fight if the enemy is paying attention to when he activates it. I know there's no numbers, but I'm imagining this being a turnaround ability for Rothar, but because of it, not being able to move as fast as he focuses on charging the bulwark (enforcing the Entrenching theme of the move)\n\nE (Thunderous Quake): I'm imagining visually something kind of like Braum R? Seems fine to me\n\nR (Merciless Pummel): My favorite ability, it just seems so gruesome!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-09T00:28:35.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big dumb troll is big and dumb.
