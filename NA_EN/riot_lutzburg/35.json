{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T08:58:05.177+0000","title":"Doran, the Master Forger","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":24,"down_votes":8,"body":"**Role**: Mixed damage Bruiser, AP Mage, Mixed damage Tank\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion concept revolving around the enigmatic Doran, who has several items available in the shop that are named after him.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Doran’s basic abilities mimic the stats of each of the Doran items, and his Ultimate helps drive home the ‘master forger’ and weapon smith theme.  His kit is as diverse as his items, and he can actually use the Doran items as recipe components for more powerful items, which solidify his role as either a bruiser, mage or tank.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Very high.  Doran is a very important, albeit enigmatic character in the League universe, and there may already be plans for him.  It may also be ultimately better for him to remain a mystery.  Theming aside, his kit is incredibly diverse and varied, and includes the integration of existing items as well as the creation of all-new ones.  The development cost of Doran is undoubtedly massive, which must always be taken into account; even for a studio like Riot.\n\n**Appearance**: A burly, muscular man in his 30’s.  He has a few tasteful tattoos and scruffy facial hair, and is clearly accustomed to a long life of hard work and intense manual labor.  Beneath it, though, is a subtle hint of deep intellect and engineering genius.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/blacksmith___mech_concept_art_by_klauspillon-d6t9jk7_zpszwqhnkrs.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/blacksmith_by_erickenji-d6utllb_zpsyjzurz1h.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/blacksmith_by_r1choman-d3rbcur_zpsxk69rwlp.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Doran joins the League to test out his own weapons and armor, searching for ways to improve them after seeing them on the Fields of Justice. To get the widest array of experiences, Doran has trained himself to be incredibly adaptive, able to fight as either a bruiser, tank or mage.\n\n**Strengths**: Incredible versatility, powerful level 1, gold-efficient exclusive item, powerful sustain and AoE, ability to forge items with “best in slot” stats\n\n**Weaknesses**: No gap closer, short range on abilities, reliant on lifesteal and sustain to trade, weak until acquiring upgraded Doran item\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:112}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:24}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Doran wields a massive forging hammer in both hands and uses melee attacks. When using abilities, the metal of the hammer rapidly heats and melts, then reforms into another weapon while that ability is active.  The weapon then remains in its new form until a different ability is cast.  This effect is purely visual and does not alter Doran’s auto attacks.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15936_pas_zpsqbh3eabi.jpg\n**Passive- Master Forger**: Doran possesses the ability to upgrade Doran’s Blade, Shield or Ring.  These upgraded items provide augmented effects for each of Doran’s basic abilities.  However, only one Doran item can be upgraded at a time.\n\n**Doran Item Upgrades**:\n\n{{item:1055}}   **->**  http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_9208_btn_zps5kjfniii.jpg\n**Doran's Saber**: 200 health, 90 AD, 15% lifesteal\n**Passive-** Siphoning Slash (Q) gains increased damage and an armor shred effect\n**Builds From-**  {{item:1055}} {{item:1038}} {{item:1053}}   +400g\n**Total Cost-** 3,190 Gold\n\n-----\n\n{{item:1054}}   **->**  http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15355_pas_zpsmgd4ohqo.jpg\n**Doran's Bulwark**: 900 Health, 60 armor, 15hp5\n**Passive-** Force of Will (W) gains bonus healing and armor, and retroactively grants improved health gains from its passive component\n**Builds From-**  {{item:1054}} {{item:1011}} {{item:1031}} {{item:3801}}   +400g\n**Total Cost-** 3,190 Gold\n\n-----\n\n{{item:1056}}   **->**  http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5523_btn_zpssnqjyibi.jpg\n**Doran's Crown**: 200 health, 130AP, 10% CDR, 12mp5\n**Passive-** Ring of Fire (E) gains a reduced mana cost and the ability to be cast twice in rapid succession before going on cooldown\n**Builds From-**  {{item:1056}} {{item:3108}} {{item:1058}}   +400g\n**Total Cost-** 3,220 Gold\n\n-----\n\n**Design Philosophy**: Doran’s kit revolves around the three items that bear his name, and this component was key in creating his abilities and mechanics.  I am definitely not an expert in allocating in-game stats relative to gold cost, so please be forgiving when reviewing these items, build paths and costs.\n\nThe important thing to note here is that Doran should have access to one of these items, whose primary stat is the highest available across all other items (90 AD versus 80 AD from Infinity Edge, 900 health versus 800 health from Warmogs Armor, and 130 AP versus 120 AP from Rabadon’s Deathcap, respectively).  This reinforces Doran’s role as the Master Forger.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8476_pas_zpskgugjoxv.jpg\n**Q- Siphoning Slash (6 seconds)**: Doran morphs his hammer into a sword and performs a cone-shaped cleave attack, dealing physical damage (+70% AD, +50% AP) and healing himself for 10% of the damage done (capped vs monsters).  The healing effect is doubled against champions.\n*Doran's Blade Bonus: increases damage of cleave by 15%.\nDoran's Saber Bonus: increases damage of cleave by 30% and causes the ability to shred 10% of affected targets’ armor for 3 seconds.*\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Doran’s ‘blade’ ability, and his primary physical damage source, as well as his source of sustain.  It should be leveled first for players who wish to act as an AD fighter.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6599_btn_zpsjidop3ij.jpg\n**W- Force of Will (14 seconds)**:  Passive: Doran permanently gains 10 health for every 500 damage he suffers, up to a cap of 800 health.\nActive: Doran’s hammer spreads shield-like wings and he assumes a defensive stance, increasing his armor by 20/35/50/65/80 and granting him a heal over time equal to 6/7.5/9/10.5/12% (+2% per 100 AP) of his max health over 3 seconds.\n*Doran's Shield Bonus: increases armor and heal value by 15%.\nDoran's Bulwark Bonus: increases armor and heal value by 25% and retroactively causes Doran to gain 25 health for every 500 damage he suffers.\nRank-ups increase armor and heal percentage, as well as lower cooldown.*\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive component of this ability rewards players who manage to soak up a lot of damage over the course of an entire game.  It functions similarly to Vladamir or Singed’s Passive in this respect.  It’s also ideal for junglers, who typically tank a lot of damage while clearing camps.  The active component mimics Doran’s Shield, increasing armor and applying dramatically increased health regeneration over time.  Players wishing to act as a tank or jungler should max this first.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_595_btn_zpscn8socx7.jpg\n**E- Ring of Fire (9 seconds)**: Doran’s hammer morphs into a staff as he summons a ring of fire at a target location, dealing magic damage (+80% AP) and slowing the target by 30%. If an enemy is caught in the center of the ring, they are stunned for 1.5 seconds.\n*Doran's Ring Bonus: reduces ability mana cost by 25%.\nDoran's Crown Bonus: Reduces ability mana cost by 40% and allows the ability to be cast a second time before going on cooldown. The same target cannot be stunned twice in a row from the second cast.*\nRank-ups increase damage and reduce cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Doran’s ‘ring’ inspired ability, which conveniently makes an actual ring on the ground.  It also acts as his primary chasing tool.  Players who wish to play as a mage should level this first.  The ability functions similarly to Leona’s Ultimate, though is much smaller in range and size.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17533_pas_zpsedgbf7js.jpg\n**R- Hammerfall (55 seconds)**: Doran super-heats his forging hammer and wields it in both hands, causing his basic attacks for the next 12 seconds to deal bonus physical damage (+30% AD). In addition, the point of impact for each auto attack leaves a super-heated aura in its wake that lasts for 6 seconds, which deals magic damage (+30% AP) over time to enemies who stand in it. Auras can physically stack on each other but enemies can only be damaged by one aura at a time.\nDuring this time, Doran can still use his other abilities, but his hammer retains its original form.\nSample Dialogue- \"Drop the hammer!\"\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is the culmination of Doran’s identity as the ‘master forger.’  It allows him to wield his forging hammer like a true badass and also allows him to deal consistent, continual mixed damage, which should be beneficial to him regardless of his build.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my unique concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-03-16T16:38:55.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"See, as much as I love the concept...\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Doran\n\n> The kick had rendered his mind soft, but it hadn’t robbed him of his passion. He still wanted nothing other than to craft, but where once he may have created singular masterpieces, he now crafted…somewhat simpler items, and many of them. He is a kind, goofy, good-hearted soul, and he takes pride in the work he does.\n\nI see neither kind and goofy nor \"kicked in the head\" in your kit.

I've also been professionally designing video games for seven years.  The concepts you see here represent well over 500 and probably closer to 1,000 hours of work, and plenty of time to \"think through things.\"\n\nMany of my older concepts did take considerable tweaking and in some cases full-blown reworks based on the current state of the game, as well as in response to new design philosophies Riot has learned and adopted over the years.  As far as concept creators go, I'd argue that I take time to consider why things might or might not work more than most others on these boards.  I specifically include a \"Risk Analysis\" section in every concept I publish where I force myself to sit down and blow holes in my own designs.  This level of self-editing is pretty much unheard of in this forum so I honestly take a bit of personal offense to the accusation that I'm not thinking things through.\n\nI don't know where you're getting the idea that the basis for all of my designs hinge on the fact that \"Riot hasn't thought it up yet.\"  That said, no, Riot has NOT thought of it all yet.  That's the point.  This game and the systems at play here are vast and varied enough to warrant an immense amount of new and creative ideas that push the envelope and try new things.  Look at the last few Champions Riot has released- Azir, Rek'sai, Bard.  These are all complex characters with mechanics that had never been introduced into the game before now.  THIS is the direction that Riot is taking the game in and I strongly believe that my concepts are aligned with this vision.\n\nThese concepts are simply words on paper.  Some of them are experimental.  Some of them are downright crazy, and I make sure to label them as such.  But that should be praised and not criticized.  New ideas can come from anywhere.  Mechanics, story, theme, a single germ of an idea for a cool and over-the-top ability; you hear Riot say this constantly.  If we can't be creative and experimental and try new things on PAPER, where else can we?  These forums should be a place to share and vet the unorthodox and the absurd, because that's where some of the best ideas can come from.

As for Doran, yes!  He is intended to feel like a Master Forger and he shouldn't necessarily be a \"jack of all trades\" throughout the whole game.  He certainly starts that way, but ultimately he will have to \"spec\" into a certain role and that will define his play style going into mid and late game.\n\n*Lutzburg, Master Champion Designer*, does have a lovely ring to it.  >_>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T18:52:54.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the comments about Doran as he relates to the lore-  I think it's a bit obscure to reference a Justice Journal entry from four years ago, given how much the game has changed since then.

As another example, look at things like the Freljord reimagining and poor, poor Trundle.  Things can and do get retconned all the time and let's be honest, Doran getting kicked in the head and becoming mentally handicapped is hardly an epic or satisfying character arc for one of the more infamous characters in League's yet-to-be-told story.\n\nRegardless of any of that, concepts can and should sometimes take creative liberties.

I'm glad you love my approach to Doran as much as it seems like you do.  I had a ton of fun making him.  Your interpretation of his passive is accurate.  I really like the thematic idea of Doran needing to, let's say, channel at the fountain for a somewhat hefty amount of time (10+ seconds?) to craft and swap out his upgraded Dorans item.  I worry that it removes the strategy of making a choice as the game goes on and sticking with it, but based on the recent Viktor rework, maybe that's not such a bad thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-12T07:49:26.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's to a new Doran!
