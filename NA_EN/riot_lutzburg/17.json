{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T07:07:00.379+0000","title":"Sprocket, the Conniving Contraptionist","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Role**: AP Support\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to design a champion that builds walls and other obstacles to impair the enemy team from approaching.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Sprocket is meant to embody the ‘engineer’ archetype typical of many class-based combat games.  His kit is incredibly powerful from a utility perspective, but he deals very low damage.  In fact, a majority of his damage ends up coming from his auto attacks, which deal magic damage and only further entrenches him in a very niche role based very strongly on team composition and communication.  Put simply, Sprocket is definitely not for everybody.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Incredibly high.  Sprocket has a lot of weird abilities and powerful utilities which make him a potential nightmare to balance.  His kit may prove unviable, completely broken, or impossible to balance between the two.\n\n**Appearance**: A male Yordle, middle aged, a bit of a gadgeteer who loves playing tricks and pranks. Fancies himself quite mischievous. Carries a giant drafting compass on his back, as well as dozens of rolled up blueprints.\n\n*Note- Yordle reference images are always difficult to find, so please excuse these re-purposed images of Ziggs.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/ziggs_sneak_peek_zpspw1kx4tm.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/bombs-League-of-Legends-waffles-Ziggs-yordles-_350955-34_zpsm2rly0d6.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Uses energy as a resource, possesses several types of crowd control unaffected by tenacity, passive sustain and regen, powerful auto attack poke/harass\n\n**Weaknesses**: Very low damage output, cannot spam abilities, very reliant on enemy positioning to be effective, requires set-up time to be most effective and does poorly against impromptu fights or ambushes.\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:268}} {{champion:432}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: An incredibly long ranged auto attack, equal to Annie's or Zilean's.  Sprocket tosses a bolt/gear/spring at his opponent.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15766_pas_zps5hwtdrbs.jpg\n**Passive- Energy to Spare**: Sprocket uses Energy as a resource, which caps at 200 and regenerates at a rate of 10/second.  Sprocket's auto attacks deal bonus magic damage up to a cap based on his level. The actual damage dealt is a percentage of that cap equivalent to his current energy level. For example, at level 1, his basic attacks can deal up to 20 bonus magic damage. If Sprocket's current energy level is 150 (**75%** of his max energy level), his auto attack will deal 15 bonus damage (**75%** of the max bonus damage).\n**Design Philosophy**: With the rest of his kit centered so much around utility and crowd control, a majority of Sprocket’s damage has actually been relegated to his auto attacks by way of this passive.  This places him in a very interesting, niche support role, where a majority of his poke and trades will come from his autos rather than his abilities.  The system for calculating the bonus damage is designed in such a way that a prepared, fully set-up Sprocket player will deal much more damage, as their traps and contraptions have likely been set and are not likely to be used in the immediate future.  A Sprocket who is rapidly trying to deploy new traps has likely been caught or is in a rough situation, which is the most effective counter to him.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5302_pas_zpsumeozz4v.jpg\n**Q- Spring Trap (5 seconds, 40 energy)**: Sprocket places a barely visible trap at a target location that arms after 1 second. If sprung by an enemy unit, that unit is briefly knocked up into the air and suffers minor magic damage. A single trap can only affect one enemy unit. These traps may lay dormant for up to 2 minutes before vanishing.  Sprocket can have a max of 5 Spring Traps. Casting subsequent traps destroys the oldest one active at the time.\nRank-ups increase damage done.\n**Design Philosophy**: These can be used as wards or traps against junglers when placed along the river or within bushes at bottom lane, and function similarly to other “trap” style abilities in the game.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10573_btn_zpspc4b8cve.jpg\n**W- Impenetrable Construct (14 seconds, 60 energy)**: Sprocket places an underground and invisible wall with spikes adorning the top at a target location using vector targeting. Pressing W again activates the wall, causing it to rise and dealing moderate magic damage while also slowing nearby enemies by 40%.  The wall is targetable and has health based on a percentage of Sprocket’s Ability Power.  The wall acts as impassible terrain to enemies and lasts until destroyed, though allied champions may pass through unphased. The hidden wall may lay dormant for up to 4 minutes before disappearing. Enemies are able to see where Sprocket is placing his wall while it “arms” over the course of 3 seconds. Only one wall can be placed at a time, though multiple walls can exist simultaneously once risen.  Sprocket can activate his wall globally, so long as he is not dead or under the effects of crowd control.\nRank-ups increase damage done and wall length. Wall length is roughly equivalent to Anivia's, rank per rank, though is much thinner.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability allows Sprocket to literally create a fence of protection around his lane, warding off junglers and ganks alike.  Enemy players can dismantle these walls after they rise, however, and champions with blinks or dashes can also get through them.  Sprocket players may leave lane to create these walls across the river or tri bush, where the enemy team can’t easily dispatch of them.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16246_btn_zpste2tvytf.jpg\n**E- First Aid Station (24 seconds, 150 energy)**: Sprocket erects a First Aid Station at a target location that emits a regenerative aura, slowly granting health and mana/energy to all nearby allies. The structure lasts 2 minutes or until destroyed by an enemy unit. Only one Station can be active at one time, and creating a new one will instantly destroy the old one.  If a Station is destroyed by an enemy and the ability is off of cooldown, it reverts to a 5 second cooldown.  Stations grant vision roughly equivalent to that of a Vision Ward.  Station health is based on ability rank, starting at 250.\nRank-ups increase regeneration rate and station health to 250/325/400/500/700.  The station also possesses scaling armor and MR.  For reference’s sake, a full build AD Carry should be able to destroy a rank 5 Station in 3-4 attacks.\n**Design Philosophy**: Yet another utility ability, the First Aid Station allows players to sustain in lane over very long periods of time.  Sprocket essentially creates a fortress out of his lane, ideally isolating all intruders from reaching them.  This is very much a preemptive ability, however, as it costs nearly all of Sprocket’s energy to cast.  In addition, it creates very cool, dynamic objectives for the enemy team to focus down, and can press the advantage once they do.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16233_pas_zpsmww2g5js.jpg\n**R- Devious Contraptions (55 seconds, no cost)**: Passive: Sprocket enjoys 20% reduced cooldowns on activatable items.\nActive: For the next 8 seconds, Sprocket's ability costs are reduced by 50%. Additionally, any cooldowns he may be suffering from are reduced to 3 seconds upon activation.\nRank-ups lower ability cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: As a gadgeteer, the passive component of this ability is a fun, thematically interesting idea, and also grants mechanical advantages for his most prominent role as a support.  The active component allows Sprocket a brief ‘oh @#$%’ window to rapidly set up a new ‘base’ during a chaotic or unexpected teamfight.\f\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T07:14:18.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think, guys?
