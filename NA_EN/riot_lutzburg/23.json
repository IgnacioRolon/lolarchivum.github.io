{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-11-27T23:01:08.821+0000","title":"Wukong Update- Progress Report!","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to give you all an update on the status of the Wukong changes we've been working on for the last few weeks.&nbsp; When we last spoke about it, the team and I were beginning to dive into the existing work we had started earlier in the year.&nbsp; We regrouped and defined a few key goals for what we wanted to accomplish with these changes, based on the feedback we got from Wukong players.&nbsp; Those goals are:\n\n1. Give Wukong more tools and agency to make proactive plays during the laning phase\n2. Provide Wukong with quality-of-life improvements where possible\n3. Shift Wukong's power curve towards early game instead of late game\n\nWukong has a very sharp win rate percentage based on game time, getting as low as 42% before Baron spawns to as high as 58% once the game has gone on for 35+ minutes.&nbsp; These changes should help smooth out that curve, so that Wukong feels competitive in the early game without dominating team fights with his innate tankiness and high burst damage.\n\nFor the quality-of-life improvements, I did my best to listen to the fans and focus on the areas you cited as most frustrating-&nbsp;**high mana costs and low Passive/R satisfaction**.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these upgrades, Wukong is gaining extremely powerful new tools in the form of**&nbsp;a free-target dash, more convincing clone deception, and a physical damage shield**.\n\nHere is the change list we're currently working on.&nbsp; Note that these changes are relative to THE LIVE GAME; not the last version you saw on the PBE or on our forums.\n\n**P- Stone Skin:**\n\n* REMOVED- Wukong no longer gains resistances for nearby enemy Champions\n* NEW- Whenever Wukong is invisible to the enemy team for at least 1 second, he gains a temporary physical damage shield based on his maximum health.&nbsp; After being spotted, the shield disperses after a few seconds\n\n> _We've been experimenting with a new Passive that grants Wukong a temporary physical damage shield.&nbsp; The idea here is to increase Wukong's lane power and outplay potential while reducing his innate tankiness in team fights.&nbsp; We've been trying a handful of different versions, but here's the most recent.&nbsp; Note that it might change!_\n> \n> _We see this as a tool to reward extended trading patterns, incentivizing Wukong to dip in and out of brushes and use W as a re-engage tool rather than just an escape tool.&nbsp; We're hoping this manifests in some cool top lane brush out-plays!_\n\n**Q- Wuju Strike:**\n\n* Mana cost lowered to a flat 30 from 40\n* CD reduced by 1 sec at all ranks\n* NEW- Spell's cost is refunded if it kills a unit&nbsp;\n\n**W- Warrior Trickster:**\n\n* Now instantly dashes towards the player's cursor instead of a short range blink\n* Dash is 350 range and 1200 speed.&nbsp; Can NOT go over walls\n* Clone is now treated as a stationary Champion and will attack nearby enemies, prioritizing the last enemy Wukong damaged\n* Clone's attacks deal a scaling 50-100% of Wukong's AD based on spell rank and apply on-hit effects\n* Clone looks identical to Wukong's animation state on spawn, and animates as if he pressed the \"S\" key\n\n**E- Nimbus Strike:**\n\n* Tertiary target range check increased significantly\n* Now deals magic damage instead of physical\n\n**R- Cyclone:**\n\n* Tick rate increased to every .25 sec from .5 (damage halved to compensate)\n* Damage ratio increased to 1.25 AD/sec from 1.1\n* Bonus movement speed is now a flat 30% instead of ramping up 5-40% over the duration\n* E's attack speed buff now pauses while R is active\n* Wukong can now cancel R early by casting another ability or recasting R\n\n> _Hoping these buffs make it more attractive to channel Cyclone for the full duration, rather than always canceling it after the knock-up._\n\nWe're aiming to push these changes to the PBE sometime in December.&nbsp; Based on your feedback, outstanding bugs and a general balance pass, we aren't able to provide an exact release date just yet.&nbsp; We're still exploring some experimental mechanics outside of the update's original scope, which takes extra time we didn't initially account for.&nbsp; I understand this news will frustrate some of you, but I hope this list proves that we're committed to meaningfully improving Wukong's play experience.&nbsp; \n\nThank you for your patience,\n\n-Lutzburg","replies":[{"poster":"Decoy Reborn","date":"2019-11-28T14:43:36.544+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Lutzburg , Thank you for letting us know that you've been

him less of assassin and less of bruiser, he need that q heal back plus the ability of his passive to proc extra range on any skill cast.\nPlus allowing e to cast multi clones as well as last change, cause that changes just make him weaker assassin and weaker bruiser i honestly preferred the older change of kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Decoy

major concerns about this iteration, its all just initial concerns. \nIt is entirely possible that when I play this version on the pbe, that all my concerns will be alleviated and I will love this version more than the other one that went up several months ago. \n\nI'm a bit disappointed. Aphelous and Diana are about to break the game in half but these changes felt so...restrained. \nCouple of major concerns:\n> P- Stone Skin:\n> \n> REMOVED- Wukong no longer gains resistances for nearby enemy Champions\n> NEW- Whenever Wukong is invisible to the enemy team for at least 1 second, he gains a temporary physical damage shield based on his maximum health.  After being spotted, the shield disperses after a few seconds\n\nI'm really concerned that this passive will be even more useless than his current one. The armor/mr wasnt great but it was always on/always helping. Wu has 0 ways to keep enemies fighting so why wouldn't they just avoid fighting until the passive wears off. There are already a tone of anti-physical champs in the game and having another physical shield seems flat/disappointing. Even the other passive of gaining a huge amount of arm/mr but needing at least 3 enemies felt better. \n\n\n> Q- Wuju Strike:\n> \n> Mana cost lowered to a flat 30 from 40\n> CD reduced by 1 sec at all ranks\n> _**NEW- Spell's cost is refunded if it kills a unit **_\n\nThis change is fantastic. This is the shining light so far. Nothing bad to say. If anything else about this ability changes please keep the mana refund.\n\n\n> W- Warrior Trickster:\n> \n> Now instantly dashes towards the player's cursor instead of a short range blink\n> Dash is 350 range and 1200 speed.  Can NOT go over walls\n> Clone is now treated as a stationary Champion and will attack nearby enemies, prioritizing the last enemy Wukong damaged\n> Clone's attacks deal a scaling 50-100% of Wukong's AD based on spell rank and apply on-hit effects\n> Clone looks identical to Wukong's animation state on spawn, and animates as if he pressed the \"S\" key\n\nThis is probably the biggest disappointment in the whole kit. This ability has the most potential design but this is just kinda useless. The damage is only useful for jungling. Lets be honest. No one is going to put early points into this ability. It's going to be a 1 point ability for a long time. So I dont really care if the ad goes up as it scales. Dashing quickly is way less useful than escaping over walls. Not even close. W should have been where the damage mitigation was placed, not his passive. IF AN ENEMY DAMAGES MY CLONE I SHOULD BE REWARDED! Please implement this. This is one of the few ways wu players can really express themselves. The number of aoe abilities now is insanely high. Clone is not a damage mitigation ability in the current state of the game. It may feel bad/frustrating to chase a wukong and have him dash over a wall but guess what. Its frustrating for every champ that does. Why do those other champs get a way out but not wukong. It's always frustrating when a champ dashes over a wall regardless of which champ it is so please don't single out wu.\n\n> E- Nimbus Strike:\n> \n> Tertiary target range check increased significantly\n> Now deals magic damage instead of physical\n> \n\nLooks fine. As long as it doesn't scale of ap it should be ok. \n\n> R- Cyclone:\n> \n> Tick rate increased to every .25 sec from .5 (damage halved to compensate)\n> Damage ratio increased to 1.25 AD/sec from 1.1\n> Bonus movement speed is now a flat 30% instead of ramping up 5-40% over the duration\n>_** E's attack speed buff now pauses while R is active**_\n> Wukong can now cancel R early by casting another ability or recasting R\n\nI really like the tick rate increase and the move speed being instant. That's gonna feel great. Was it really so out of the question to add some kind of attack speed scaling. I'm pretty sure garen e is still gona out damage a lvl 6 wukong ult.  Realistically we are only going to get maybe 2-3 ticks in before it becomes better to cancels the ult to auto or q or e.  This doesn't solve the problem that a DoT ult like his just feels bad unless we get something for hitting every single tick. A DoT ult is inherently worse that an ult that deals its damage up front. Lastly, could the range on r be increased by like 1-10 units so that it has the same range as q. Currently Q range is larger than ult range, so often you will hit a max range q then immediate r, only for them to be out of range. \n\n\nThank you again for working on the monkey. I may very well be in the minority but I still wanted to share my thoughts as a long time wu player.","replies":[{"poster":"Lorthos","date":"2019-11-28T01:21:18.839+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I am envisioning the use of his passive differently, but I see it going something like this: You go into a bush then eaaq like normal, but now you have a shield so the enemy doesn't want to trade back.  And even if they do you can w after the shield is broken and replenish it.  The invisibility coupled with a renewed shield dissuades them further from trading back.  IMO it works well with Wukong's trading style of hit and run.","replies":[{"poster":"Joeda89","date":"2019-11-28T01:30:53.127+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is this is his current style.

Actually the present Wukong has not too much connection to his really design, so I thought for a Wukong who actually has more skills from original design like golden eyes.

It wasn't all bad, but having range that runs out quickly after engaging gives ranged champs an easier time kiting you.\n\nYes i played him on pbe , he was perfect jungler and had amazing clean clear.\nYet he was good top laner too, i remember i stand toe to toe with yorick which one of the worst counter to current version of wukong and new kit change will make him useless against champions like yorick again.\n\nAnd best thing about about the old changed it can allow you to build him like J4 as tanker or buriser or assassin.\n\nSo yes i wish they stayed with old version and give it that sweet R change then polish and launch him.\nBut right lets ruin him, he will be more garbage with this change cause no healing for clean clear and in same time useless passive special against mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2019-11-29T18:15:46.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The extra range after each abilities was so cool (with conqueror would be amazing btw).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-11-29T21:37:59.969+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharpest glasses,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=ws7hu2EH,comment-id=0011000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-29T18:15:46.462+0000)\n>\n> The extra range after each abilities was so cool (with conqueror would be amazing btw).\n\nWe thought it was neat, too, but in practice it wasn't actually that useful.  E puts you into melee range so you don't need the extra range, and R is a long duration channel with movement speed, so you don't need the range there, either.  So basically W was the only spell that benefited, and given it has stealth + dash (and is oftentimes used to run away) it didn't get that much use there, either.  That's why we felt it was best to keep it limited to Q.  A 300 range auto attack reset is still really strong.  :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saìyan","date":"2019-12-03T20:04:44.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why cant wu just have his whole kit be ad dmg why this magic dmg on his e now?

It still scales with AD, not AP.  Since most characters have lower MR than Armor, and MR doesn't scale with level as strongly as Armor does, this will generally cause E to deal more damage in the early/mid game, but less in the late game assuming he's building a lot of lethality.\n\nThis is in accordance with our stated goal of shifting some of Wukong's power to the early game from late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LÈ APE","date":"2019-11-27T23:32:21.402+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Blukachu","date":"2019-11-27T23:42:45.582+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They want you to explore other build options but tbh with thos change list im 95% sure lethality will still be best build.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2019-11-28T00:24:13.249+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"@Riot Lutzburg, thank you for listening to us and give us a shield instead of resistances with requirements.

I always read that it's bad for lethalitybuilds but you have to understand that lethality wukong doesn't fit well into the game because he has low basestats and needs a damage buff but that's not easy because wukong can quickly get too strong again like lutzburg or meddler said before. So now they are working on new ideas so that magicdamage fits into wukong's kit and wukong is easier to balance without going too far. Moreover many don't see that pure AD is a weakness of his earlygames there as meddler and lutzburg said he can be countered easily with only a little early amor.

Does he wear the shield everytime he's out of enemy vision? (for example in the Jungle)\n2.

Keep the dash over walls from the Prototype Rework.
