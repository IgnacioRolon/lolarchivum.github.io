{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-03T22:46:10.573+0000","title":"Constantine, the Spectral Rider","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Role**: AD Jungler, Bruiser\n\n**Inspiration**: This one was all about fantasy fulfillment for me.  I wanted to create a skeletal cavalryman wielding a lance who could summon spectral steeds in combat.\n\n**General Design Philosoph**y: Constantine is an AD Jungler similar to Amumu and Skarner.  Constantine uses mild but constant sustain, powerful positioning tools and gap closers to set up initiations and ganks from incredible distances.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Constantine has an incredibly cool theme and inspired kit, though the mechanical clunkiness of his E could prove too difficult to overcome from a usability perspective.  In addition, his Ultimate may need some tweaks, most notably its multi-target component.\n\n**Appearance**: Similar in appearance to a Stalfos from Legend of Zelda, specifically the mentor from Twilight Princess. Constantine should represent a mix of undead tropes as well as certain \"magical\" elements inspired by The Void. The rifts he opens summons a spectral horse, which should be reminiscent of both a ghost and a cosmic-like energy source.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/phantom_ganondorf_by_whitefoxcub-d5bqc0x_zps159286b8.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/tbK0a_zps92842efa.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/yNQPdpb_zpsafd0ddcf.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/UndeadCavalry_zps27849a13.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/phantomganon_zpsc8e8a293.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Space_Horse_by_PhantomPirateX_zps2bdd5686.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/354de6_494de270d6485d86b10b61945419f457_zpsbdd43281.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/PhantomStallion_promo_zps3766bb60.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/spectral_horse_by_syntyni-d6707mm_zpse173d729.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/skydg8_zps111e4bcd.jpg\n\n**Lore**:  Constantine was a cavalryman who accompanied Kassadin to the Void.  Whatever happened while he was trapped there has... changed him.  Though he has managed to return to Runeterra, Constantine will never be the same.  The corrosive, toxic energies of the Void infected Constantine and his trusty steed, Nightmare (thanks to Okido for the name suggestion!).  She is neither alive nor dead, trapped between the two realms.  While Constantine himself relegates himself to Runeterra, Nightmare spends most of her life still trapped in the Void.  Luckily, Constantine has gained the ability to open tears to the Void, where he is able to summon Nightmare for brief periods of time.\n\n**Strengths**: A series of positioning tools and several forms of crowd control, powerful zone denial, lane/jungle sustain.\n\n**Weaknesses**: unreliable gap closer, no defensive steroids for a bruiser/diver, whiffable ultimate, long cooldowns on most abilities\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:72}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:90}} \n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7445_btn_zpse6f4d760.jpg\n**Auto Attack**: Constantine prods his enemy with a long range (175) melee jab from his lance.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13692_btn_zps2717705b.jpg\n**Passive- Endless Decay**: Constantine regenerates 15% of the damage he suffers over 5 seconds. This effect takes the form of a renewable Heal over Time spell.\n**Design Philosophy**: This acts as a novel, delayed form of sustain which ultimately ends up acting as a long-term HoT.  With no defensive steroids as a jungler, Constantine needs some form of survivability in combat and the jungle, and it comes to him in the form of Endless Decay.  While powerful in small skirmishes, the long-term nature of this heal makes Constantine susceptible to burst damage and Grievous Wounds.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6731_btn_zps5d574875.jpg\n**Q- Decrepit Lunge (4 sec)**: Constantine lunges forward with his lance slightly (275 units), dealing physical damage to all enemies in its path.  This ability is cast as a skillshot.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: The range of the lunge is small enough that the primary purpose of the ability is not to act as a gap closer; rather it is to be used to strategically enter or exit the travel path of the spectral horse at the last second (see Temporal Rift for details). It can also be used as a repositioning tool to better aim Impaling Strike.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10789_pas_zpse6b971be.jpg\n**W- Siphoning Void (12 sec)**: Constantine creates a life-sapping zone at his current location with a 500 unit diameter, slowing all enemies who stand on it by 70% and dealing magic damage equal to 1/1.5/2/2.5/3% of enemies’ max health each second.  The healing effects of Endless Decay are increased by 50% while Constantine is standing on a Siphoning Void.  The void lasts 5 seconds and remains wherever it was cast.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: Once Constantine dives into the fray with his Temporal Rift, Siphoning Void can be used to lock down the enemy team long enough for help to arrive.  This ability is also extremely helpful in the jungle.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14102_pas_zps8ec427ea.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15353_pas_zpsead96291.jpg\n**E- Temporal Rift (18 sec)**: Upon first cast, Constantine creates a temporal rift at target location, with the opportunity to place a second (within 1,100 units of the first) for the next 6 seconds. Once the second is positioned, a link is formed between the two and a spectral horse charges out of the first in a line towards the second. Enemies in the horse's path take magic damage and are knocked aside. If Constantine is in the horse's path, he automatically mounts it upon contact, causing the ability to deal additional physical damage. Constantine dismounts the horse as it reaches the second rift.  The width of the horse’s charge is roughly the same as Hecarim’s Ultimate.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Constantine’s most iconic ability.  While somewhat mechanically clunky, it allows an extreme amount of customizability and positioning power from the player’s perspective.  Temporal Rift is Constantine’s engagement tool, and can be followed up with any one or more of his abilities to devastating effect.  Players can place both portals immediately for a quick engage or escape, or plant one behind their opponent and proceed to bait them into poor positioning before deciding to pull the trigger on the move from an unexpected angle.  The strategies and counterplay that result from this ability are *staggering*.  Get it?  Horse puns.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12518_pas_zpsac45f0f9.jpg\n**R- Impaling Strike (80 sec)**: Constantine extends his lance in a line (cast as a skillshot with a range of 250 units), impaling any enemy champion(s) in its path for massive physical damage, dealing more damage the closer the target is to Constantine. After a short moment of suppression, Constantine retracts his polearm, pulling any victims to his location before releasing them.  Constantine is immune to crowd control effects during this time.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is a multi-target suppression which also suppresses Constantine while being cast.  Constantine cannot be CC’d during this animation to preserve both its functionality and its incredibly strong visual impact.  This ability can be combo’d into with Q or E, and can be compared to Malzahar’s own Ultimate in the sense that Siphoning Void can be cast first, causing impaled enemies to take bonus damage while stuck in the damaging zone.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=nested)","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Patton","date":"2015-01-04T20:52:43.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this one a lot lutz and i think that his E is fine as not an ultimate, it is a positioning tool. I think you need to manage the damage on it so that is not abused tho. I feel his portal would be taken to lane and then he portals, drops his drain zone and hits with his Q, takes minimal counter damage cuz it happens so fast and then heals a good portion of what happened to him via passive. The problem with creating strong junglers right now is they are taken top lane and dominate due to good poke but more importantly the sustain they have. If you can buy flask and pots and stay in lane by warding till 3K gold cuz you never have to back, its broken.\n\nI love the potential he has from the jungle and i think he would be a great gank champion riding in and impaling over aggressive sons of B's. An interest effect you might have is when he is riding his stead if he hits somebody it knocks them down. This would be a form of soft CC, possibly pushing them to the ground. I thinking Knight's Tale and the lancing of an opponent off his horse. To make it work you should have it push them back as well but the visual move would knock them to the ground, a displace but not one that Yasuo could use as a ult knock-up cuz its a knock down. We dont need more knock ups.... Yasuo....\n\nLike this one a lot over all :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T10:42:34.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha I was honestly expecting downvotes for my terrible void pun earlier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-03T23:11:25.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and regarding the aura, I specifically a-void-ed that because I wanted the strategic element of planting it and giving opponents the opportunity to work around it.  I think it adds a lot of counterplay for an otherwise guaranteed sum of damage (like Amumu's tears).  It also combos well with his R, as mentioned, when skillfully employed.  The mechanic and thematic similarities to Malz is quite true, but I personally don't feel that's a strong enough reason to adjust the kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T22:57:11.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great review, thanks Dr Patton.  Definitely a fair point about good junglers also being great top laners (Rek'Sai).  The best way to combat that, I think, is in scaling.  What separates a jungler from a top laner in many cases is their ability to use gold to a greater effect.  If I keep Constantine's AD and AP ratios low, and don't put too much power in having a level advantage, then I think his power levels will be suppressed enough in the top lane that it isn't seen as a mega OP pick.\n\nI thought about having him carry his opponent or knock them to the ground outside of the displacement that already happens (like Draven's Stand Aside) but I was finding it difficult to justify that much added utility when he's already getting a super long gap closer out of the deal.

Normally when I design a champion that has such a one-off, untested mechanic, I like to pair it up with more familiar concepts that are already understood by both players and the readers on these forums.  That's my excuse for the similarities, at least, haha.\n\nAs far as swapping the E and R, for the purpose of gravitas I would agree with you, but a bruiser needs a gap closer and relegating it to his Ultimate would bring with it some unwanted baggage- namely a drastically increased cooldown.  Besides, suppressions are still hella powerful and iconic in their own right, so I wouldn't pass it off as just a fancy stab.  :p  I do see your point about Xin and Jarv, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-02-07T09:28:24.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still inspiration, be sure to check out my gondola champ coming out soon, i'll have to give u credit, couldn't come up with a good 3rd ability","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-04-10T09:21:44.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Lutz, \n\nI'm here from your Frolov Commander of the Skies Concept.

I actually dont see him coming from the void, he seems more like an undead charatcer from the shadow isles, well both origins can fit him, but shadow isles seem where his kit, and horse are leaning. Did he go to the void with Kassadin, die and end up at the shadow isles? Or did you decide not to go the shadow isles route because you didn't want people to think that he was once one of the spectral riders in Hecarim's ult. People really shouldn't compare him to Hecarim anyways they are not alike at all, and he only rides his horse for a short while, not all the time. I really like this guy. I like how his E is a gap closer and damage dealer and connects to W which connects to Q, and R for a great combo.\n\nI have a solution to the clunkiness of his E. You can use the same targeting system as Rumble's R or Viktor's E; Activate the ability, click and hold down the left mouse button on the origin point, then move your mouse to where you want the ability to be aimed and release. You can deactivate the targeting by right clicking without losing the ability to use the attack. This allows the chose a start point and direction, while still allowing him to trick enemies with feinted ability placements, (I think your the first to do something like that which is totally awesome, i really like it).\n\nHere is a suggestion to the way that the ability description can worded with this new (for you) targeting system.\nUpon initial cast, Constantine creates a temporal rift at target location, and selects the direction and range (up to 1,100 units) that he wishes the ability to go. Once the ability is positioned a second rift appears at the second targeted location, and a link is formed between the two. A spectral horse (nightmare!) charges out of the first in a line towards the second. Enemies in the horse's path take magic damage and are knocked aside. If Constantine is in the horse's path, he automatically mounts it upon contact, causing the ability to deal additional physical damage. Constantine dismounts the horse as it reaches the second rift. \n\nSo while Rumble's and Viktor's abilites are just a damage and done attack, where nothing is seen by the enemy until you release that left button; on yours the portal would appear when the left mouse is clicked and stays until the right mouse is clicked or you release the mouse and the second gate appears. This way you still get all the things you want, but it will be so much more easy to cast! This ability could really use an animation to clear things up. I'd do it but im currently wrapped up with one for Embertime.\n\nTo address the \"problem\" that GreenLore brought up , and didnt suggest any  solutions for (i dont think W is similar to it, and if it is, a lot of League abilities are copied within league it self), i would suggest making a direct connection between the W and another ability. Such as, if another ability is used within W, it would gain a minor buff, or it would apply a minor debuff to enemies inside W.\n\nHow fast does the horse move relatively speaking? Can Q be cast while he is on the horse? Would it make him get off in the direction that Q is cast, or could it be used to hit people out of the horse's width, who've dodged out of the horse's line? That way even if he missed he could still hit them as he passed by? If the horse ran through a W would it be sped up? Or if any enemies took damage from a horse while in W would the horse stomp on them stunning them? Can R be used while on the horse?\nthis is my fave concept of yours.\nI love this guy so much =D\nso much.\nso.\nmuch.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T03:24:39.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gLanjA9i,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-01-07T20:12:10.726+0000)\n>\n> Ive gotta lot of stuff to say about this really great concept.

I actually dont see him coming from the void, he seems more like an undead charatcer from the shadow isles, well both origins can fit him, but shadow isles seem where his kit, and horse are leaning. Did he go to the void with Kassadin, die and end up at the shadow isles? Or did you decide not to go the shadow isles route because you didn't want people to think that he was once one of the spectral riders in Hecarim's ult. People really shouldn't compare him to Hecarim anyways they are not alike at all, and he only rides his horse for a short while, not all the time. I really like this guy. I like how his E is a gap closer and damage dealer and connects to W which connects to Q, and R for a great combo.\n> \n> I have a solution to the clunkiness of his E.

Keep in mind that he's not a native of the Void; he's more like Kassadin, who was a normal mage (or in this case a cavalryman) who became corrupted/infected by the powerful forces of the Void itself.\n\nI appreciate your idea for the input of his E, but I'm afraid that would take a major part of the spell away from the player.  Namely, if it used vector targeting, the player would need to cast both portals at the same time.  A big part of this spell's counterplay and juking potential comes from the ability to cast the spawn point at first, and then choose when and where to cast the end point at a later time (up to 6 seconds later).  Even if you kept the first portal hidden, the user is still forced to be clicking and holding their mouse awkwardly until they wanted to release the ability.  This would prevent them from doing anything else, which wouldn't feel good at all.\n\nI personally don't think that Constantine's W is a copycat of anything.  It uses very simple and commonly used mechanics, but there are no champions that have an ability that auto-casts at their current location and then becomes stationary.  It's unique enough while also being simple and effective at what it's supposed to do.  The only change I could see making is to increase the healing of Constantine's passive while standing on the zone, but if anything that would just make the ability more of a copycat of Trundle.\n\nThe horse moves as fast as a normal projectile would... probably a bit faster than Morgana's Dark Binding.  I didn't intend for Constantine to be able to do anything while on the horse because A- it happens really fast and B- he is essentially choosing to turn himself into a projectile.  It's already dealing a lot of bonus damage due to the fact that he's along for the ride.  I think that's enough.  If he misses with his E, I kinda think that's fair play because either he aimed wrong or his opponents juked appropriately.  No need to reward  him for that.\n\nI'm really glad you like Constantine- he's in my top 10 favorites for sure.  You gave him a ton of thought and came up with some clever ideas for how to improve him, so thank you!  You also made me think about things I hadn't needed to yet, like the speed of Nightmare (who is now named as such in the original post!)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-05T22:29:43.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope people can see that there are still a lot of major thematic and mechanical differences between Hecarim and Constantine.
