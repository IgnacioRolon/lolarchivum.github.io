{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T01:06:08.646+0000","title":"Klaus, the Jovial Chameleon","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Role**: AP Jungler, Tank\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion who could dynamically adapt to the types of damage it was receiving on the battlefield.  Naturally I thought of a chameleon almost instantly and the rest of Klaus’ kit was inspired by that theme.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Klaus is a sticky initiator and damage-centric tank.  He requires the use of multiple positioning tools to achieve auto attacks at both melee and long range.  His core play patterns involve latching onto and slowing enemies with his long chameleon tongue, or alternatively initiating a quick roll to close the gap.  Once close enough, Klaus can utilize dynamic auto attack ranges, either lashing out with his tongue from range or slashing with his vicious claws in melee range.\n\nWhile his attack patterns sound rather violent, Klaus himself is only after a good meal.  He can’t help it if his hunger pains put him in a sour mood!  Just think of him as a jolly, pudgy lizard who just wants a taste of all that life has to offer.  ;)\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Klaus has a powerful suppression Ultimate, which are always scary to balance around.  His superior mobility might also need to be toned down, though the rest of his kit is fairly easy to envision in a healthy light.\n\n**Appearance**: A fat, hungry chameleon with a heavy German accent, somewhat inspired by Augustus Gloop from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Belome from Super Mario RPG\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/chameleon_and_kid_by_froggiechan-d56606e_zps1f7c5a7e.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/9891-chameleon-green-fun-animal-toy-0492_zps82d2b312.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/which-are-the-coolest-disney-animal-sidekicks-1574159290-jan-18-2013-1-600x500_zps86e9e78d.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/198528-300px_mmxstingchameleon_zpsfcb26c4f.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/308755-belome_zps9c86392e.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Missing, but probably involves being hungry, wandering off and accidentally finding himself on Summoner's Rift.\n\n**Strengths**: Very \"sticky\" and great single target peel, strong initiation, suppression Ultimate, light tankiness, short cooldown mobility\n\n**Weaknesses**: \"slow to start\" initiation that can't come as a surprise, whiffable Ultimate, reliant on auto attacks for damage\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:72}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:33}}\n\n**Auto Attack**: Klaus slashes with his claws in melee range (125 range).  When he is out of melee range, Klaus will automatically switch to a long ranged attack, lashing out with his tongue (400 range).  For clarity and usability's sake, an attack range indicator will appear like a ring around Klaus when he is nearing the edge of one attack type and into the other.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13660_btn_zps06bfd79c.jpg\n**Passive- Adaptive Armor**: Klaus gains a stacking buff every time he takes damage from a large monster, cannon minion, tower or enemy champion. He gains 5 armor every time he takes physical damage and 10 MR every time he takes magic damage, up to respective caps of 20/40/60/80 based on level. This buff lasts for 3 seconds and refreshes on hit. Klaus's skin color changes hue and intensity based on how much bonus armor or magic resistance he has (red for primarily AD damage, blue for primarily AP and purple when sustaining equal and mixed damage)\nDesign Philosophy: This is a thematically fun ability that provides Klaus with some much-needed contextual durability when he engages and sticks to his priority targets.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13907_btn_zps4928778d.jpg\n**Q- Tongue Lash (10 sec)**: Klaus fires his tongue like a lined skillshot with incredibly long range (900), latching onto the first enemy unit it contacts and dealing magic damage.  This creates a tether between the two with a breaking range of 1200 units.  For the next three seconds, or until the tether breaks, Klaus’ target is increasingly slowed, similar to the effects of Wither (15-40% over the three second duration).  While tethered,  Klaus cannot use ranged auto attacks, but can toggle the ability off by re-casting it while it’s active.  Casting Rollout instantly breaks the tether.  Rank-ups increase damage, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: The slow isn’t that powerful and is meant to be followed up with Rollout in most situations.  Instead, Tongue Lash can be used from long range to “fish” for an initiation, slowing down targets long enough for Klaus to close the gap and then hard engage with Rollout.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_2222_btn_zps73112934.jpg\n**W- Hunger Pains (12 sec)**: Passive- Klaus \"tastes\" his target whenever he attacks it from long range with his tongue, healing him for 5/8/12/15/20 +.5% bonus health.  Klaus is a picky eater, however, and does not receive this effect from enemy minions.  Active- Klaus begins to salivate uncontrollably for the next 6 seconds, putting him into a frenzied state.  This causes his melee attacks to deal 120% base damage plus magic damage equal to 20% of his AP.\n**Design Philosophy**: The healing component of this ability keeps Klaus healthy while he’s chasing down fleeing targets through the enemy front line, while limiting his sustain in a jungling or laning environment.  Since most of his kit revolves around utility and initiation, his W acts as a much-needed offensive steroid for the only meaningful way he can rack up damage- his auto attacks.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16558_pas_zps278a6f87.jpg\n**E- Rollout (6 sec)**: Klaus quickly rolls a short distance, colliding with the first enemy unit he contacts along the way and knocking them up momentarily.  This also deals minor physical damage.  Following the roll, Klaus's attack speed increases by 15/25/35/45/55% for 3 seconds. Activating this ability instantly breaks the tether of Tongue Lash. Rank-ups increase attack speed buff and damage, as well as reduce cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: Rollout is a fast and simple ability on a relatively short cooldown, giving Klaus almost Vayne-like mobility in short bursts to zigzag around a team fight and land his Q or R on the right target.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17225_pas_zps732a667a.jpg\n**R- You Are What You Eat (115 sec)**: Klaus fires his tongue like a skillshot at moderate range (300).  If he connects with an enemy champion, he pulls them to him, constricting them and effectively suppressing them for up to 2.5 seconds.  This deals very minor magic damage over the duration (25/40/80 per second), and also temporarily buffs Klaus’ stats by a percentage of his victim’s.  The amount of stats Klaus obtains is based on the duration of his suppression against the target (between 20-60% of the victim’s armor, magic resistance, attack damage and ability power).  These bonus stats last for 10 seconds.  If Klaus misses with this ability, half of its cooldown is refunded.  Klaus's Tongue Lash is instantly disabled when casting this ability.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is easy to miss, so it should be used in conjunction with Tongue Lash and Rollout to ensure that enemies don’t have anywhere to run.  This ability can, of course, be interrupted via all conventional forms of crowd control.  The \"reeling in\" mechanic of this ability adds a visual time stamp that lets all other players know at a glance how much longer the ability will last, which subsequently indicates to everyone how many bonus stats Klaus was able to siphon from his target.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=nested)","replies":[{"poster":"Blitzidious","date":"2016-05-02T11:41:23.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like Riot took some inspiration from Klaus when making Tahm Kench.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-05-02T22:35:54.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LadleLancer,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9pN0OEb7,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2016-05-02T11:41:23.987+0000)\n>\n> Seems like Riot took some inspiration from Klaus when making Tahm Kench.\n\nHeh, it's quite possible.

Klaus' auto attacks work similarly to Thresh's.  They are ranged when they have to be, and melee when they can be.  This happens automatically.  If he's out of his melee attack range, he'll start using his tongue; otherwise he uses his claws.  It's the same way that Thresh uses his hook like a whip at range and more of a slash in melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-06T04:01:46.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"................i am such a idiot omg hahahahahahah wow, i am sorry XD. just for clarity could you add that in a P.S thing under it?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-06T04:14:43.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JellyJackJak22,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9pN0OEb7,comment-id=000a0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-01-06T04:01:46.729+0000)\n>\n> ................i am such a idiot omg hahahahahahah wow, i am sorry XD. just for clarity could you add that in a P.S thing under it?\n\nI already changed it before you even asked.

Like you said, his utility is already impressive so he might not need the luxuries of things like max health damage.\n\nQuestion: What counts as range for W's healing? Not melee? Max range?\n\nPretty similar to what was thinking. What I was just thinking is that since he has only one less form of CC than Nautilus (aka the champion with the _most_ forms of CC) that he needn't such luxuries. I could definitely see him working somewhere in the jungle, at least, with so much to work with, and can be controlled or control as easy as the other.\n\nI also feel that auto-attack reliant damage isn't so much a weakness right now as it is an advantage (arguably). Strong auto-attacks (ones that heal / have some sort of way put push an advantage (See: {{champion:48}} ) are really strong, with or without constant CC or gap closers.(See: {{champion:77}} )) especially since they don't have a chance to miss.\n\nBut item builds here would feel awkward. The aim here is to have both AP and tankiness, but the flaw here is that building tanky straight up would just be more efficient.  If the cooldown on E is as low as I think it is (around 5s max rank), then he could just go full tank with 1 or 2 AP items, the same way some bruisers just go 1 or 2 AD items and then full tank, especially if he can constantly apply a knock-up with AS steroid and already-intact % damage on top of it. I'd imagine he would build very similar to Elise (Jungle), Rumble (Top) or Thresh or Morgana (Support).\n\nMy suggestions:\nMove any benefits from ranged auto-attacks to melee auto attacks, because he IS a \"ranged tank\", and, unless he is meant to play like Thresh (support; peel), give him incentive to get all melee up in their grill.\n\nSo yar! I think from that you have enough to work with.\n[I might start posting my own ideas here in a while, now that you're back :D]","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-04T15:37:12.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok yeah i see that cap now, i did miss it sorry. do you think that the passive could use a CD after the max has been reached?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-04T08:33:14.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love the Passive for so many reasons the only suggestions that i have is a cap on the stacks and CD, i which i cant be active, maybe after limit of stack is reached.

Perhaps you missed it, but there is a hard cap for the stacking stat gains of Klaus' passive, based on his level.  I agree with you and Pickle that there is too much power packed into his W.  As far as the thematics of it, the idea is that he is foaming at the mouth and its his saliva that is toxic or corrosive.  Maybe a bit of a stretch but not too bad, I don't think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T02:00:40.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks to your feedback, I have made some adjustments to match what I said in my earlier post.  :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T01:53:51.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great feedback as always, GreenLore.\n\nHis Q is interrupted if he ults; I should clarify that in the description.\n\nFor his attack ranges, I imagine there would be a light ring or cast range circle around Klaus as he's attacking so that the player knows where exactly the conversion between ranged and melee will take place.\n\nI had a stealth ability originally for the same reasons you mentioned, and then took it out also for the same reasons you mentioned.  XD\n\nThe ult suppression works just like Malzahar's, only it's a skillshot.  The \"reeling them in\" portion is mostly just a visual tell to show the duration of the spell.  I think it adds to clarity because the closer his target gets to him, the tankier he becomes, which lets everyone know at a glance just how 'roided up Klaus got in the exchange.","replies":[]}]}
