{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T04:27:21.822+0000","title":"Agatha, the Encroacher","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AP Support, AP Mage\n\n**Inspiration**: For Agatha, I wanted to create a stealth-based champion who wasn't a typical assassin/fighter, but rather a support character. The idea of a champion that can create her own fog of war is very intriguing to me.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Agatha is a long range support and utility champion with a decent mix of sniper-like offensive capabilities. This brutal combination is offset by a massive lack of mobility and slow base movement speed. Thematically, Agatha creates a fog at her current location which expands as she remains somewhat stationary. This fog grants stealth for nearby allies and also augments her other abilities.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Very High. To be honest, I’m quite worried about Agatha. She is susceptible to feast-or-famine gameplay based on match-ups, she has a potentially broken ultimate and her stationary gameplay could prove unfun. All that said, she’s unique as hell and I would place her firmly in the “let’s prototype it and see what happens” bucket.\n\n**Appearance**: Agatha is a young maiden straight out of an ancient folk tale. She is elegant, ominous, somber and slightly cryptic. She wears a long, flowing gown and has long, jet black hair. Adorning her is a necklace of pearls, as well as seashell pendants and other aquatic accessories. A thick and encroaching plume of fog constantly emanates from her and slowly disperses as it expands around her feet.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/AsShestoodontheShore_zps94725d20.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/annabelle1_zps38ef9dda.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/IL020_5_zps222973fb.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/season01_ep19_ss01_zps4d960029.jpg\n\n\n\n\n**Lore**: Agatha is directly inspired by an old folktale in which a maiden sees her beloved off on a voyage to war. The soldier promises to come back for her, so she waits for him day and night, never leaving her spot perched on the cliff. Tragically, her lover never returns and the maiden eventually turns into a stone statue, eternally gazing out to the horizon and waiting for her beloved to keep his promise. This is a real story of ancient times and was also parodied in an episode of the Pokemon anime.\n\n**Strengths**: Agatha becomes a long range turret and supremely powerful backline cleric-style support if left alone. She excels in early laning phase and objective control when she gets time to set up.\n\n**Weaknesses**: Agatha is extremely susceptible to being rushed. In general, if Agatha is kept moving or dodging things, she is massively weakened. This makes her a particularly poor choice for mobile team fights. She also has a notably awful base movement speed.\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:101}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:69}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Agatha fires a shadowy bolt from her fingertips at 375 range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15771_btn_zpsac6268a6.jpg\n**Passive- Rolling Fog**: When Agatha stands still, a rolling fog begins to form at her feet. This fog continues to expand the longer she stays relatively stationary (she has 400 units worth of wiggle room). The shadowy plumes expand up to a 375 range over 6 seconds(this works somewhat similarly to creep from Starcraft) Allied units who stand within the fog become stealthed, with mechanics functioning identically to brush (units are revealed when attacking). Agatha herself remains visible. The fog disperses 2 seconds after Agatha moves out of its range. This ability begins after Agatha remains stationary for 2 seconds. If Agatha goes out of range of the fog, she can re-enter the center circle during the 2 second grace period to essentially refresh the effect's duration.\n**Design Philosophy**: the two second duration and two second activation prevent two fog patches from ever forming at once. The wiggle room is a realistic necessity to prevent Agatha players from being relegated to standing completely still in order to maximize the potential of her kit.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10167_pas_zpsa84fd7b1.jpg\n**Q- Suffocate (6 sec)**: Agatha targets a small area from long range (900) similar to Casseopeia's Q, creating a plume of fog that deals magic damage to all enemies in the area and quickly dissipates. Suffocate's cooldown is reduced by an amount relative to the size of the rolling fog surrounding her, down to a 2 second cooldown.\nRank-ups increase damage dealt.\n**Design Philosophy**: Agatha gains power the longer she remains still, becoming a long range, rapid fire sniper tower. This synergizes both with her passive and her E. Mechanically, Suffocate’s cooldown is reduced by 1 second for every 1.5 seconds her Rolling Fog is allowed to grow.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8412_pas_zps556cdc9e.jpg\n**W- Beacon of Hope (16 sec)**: Agatha casts a beam of rejuvenating moonlight on an allied champion, healing them for 80/120/160/210/260 (+40% AP) and increasing their natural vision radius by 200/225/250/275/300 for 3 seconds. The healing component's effects are increased by 30% to allies who are stealthed or have recently been stealthed (up to 2 seconds).\nHidden Passive: This ability heals Diana by +1 and Leona by -1.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase heal/vision amount.\n**Design Philosophy**: A relatively standard but powerful heal that rewards stealth gameplay. The vision reveal helps Agatha and her allies track down fleeing enemies through the fog of war and is also thematically appropriate.  The theme is carried over further by allowing Agatha to personify a lighthouse onto an allied target, in the hopes that they can catch a glimpse of Agatha's long-lost love.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_3202_btn_zpsca0815a0.jpg\n**E- Lingering Touch (Passive)**: Agatha's auto attacks gain 50/75/100/125/150 range (granting 625 max range) and deal 10/15/20/25/30 (+30% AP) bonus magic damage. Her first auto attack against an enemy also slows the target by 30/40/50/60/70% for 1.5 seconds and deals double the bonus magic damage it would normally apply. This places a debuff on the target called 'Lingering Touch' which prevents the effect from occurring again for 6 seconds.\nHidden Passive: auto attacking a ward reduces its duration by 10 seconds. This effect can only occur once per ward.\nRank-ups increase attack range, damage and slow amount.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an intentionally simple, passive ability to both offset the complications of her passive and ultimate and further solidify her role as a backline support. The on-demand slow applied by Agatha's initial auto attack acts as her only means of escape from enemies who smartly attempt to rush her in order to diminish her siege and sniping power. Ranking this ability first over Q or W allows for greater poke and utility in lane at the expense of healing or pure damage.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14784_pas_zps420d2031.jpg\n**R- Shadow Veil (120 sec)**: Agatha begins to channel, temporarily deactivating her passive and using that energy to place a shadowy veil on an allied champion within a 1500 range. After 2.5 seconds of channeling, Agatha cloaks and stealths her allied target for 6/8/10 seconds. Agatha must remain tethered to her target to maintain the stealth effect, but the range is semi-global and increases with rank (3000/4500/6000 range). This prevents gimmicky edge cases involving Teleports or Shen Ultimates. If Agatha's target leaves the ability's range during the channel, she will still cast it successfully. The veil will disperse after the full duration, after the stealthed champion uses an offensive ability, or if the allied Champion goes out of Agatha’s range. When the veil disperses, a large smokescreen effect spawns at the target's current location for 1.5 seconds, denying affected enemies vision. Rank-ups increase stealth duration and tether range, and decrease cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a game-changing Ultimate with a ton of power packed into it based on team compositions. Note that Agatha can cast Shadow Veil on herself. Presumably this will synergize with other stealth-based champions much in the same way as Cass’s Twin Fang reset. For example, Twitch would receive bonus attack speed when coming out of Shadow Veil, and all Shadow Veiled allies would receive the bonus healing effect from Moonlight.  Note that this ability might require a form of global cue for the enemy team, such as Rek'sai's screech or Sion's bellowing clanking.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"W0ŁF","date":"2015-01-02T05:00:33.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"her and rengar on the same team= win","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T05:46:03.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=R3VIV3D,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=mnT77EWL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-02T05:00:33.545+0000)\n>\n> her and rengar on the same team= win\n\nYep, Rengar would be able to activate his leap while under the effect's of Shadow Veil.

You are welcome to examine all of my concepts with a fine tooth comb!\n\nOh, and if you like Evelyn, just wait until I reveal Annabelle, the Forsaken Bride.  She was engaged to a handsome Demacian knight, who Evelyn shared feelings for.  On the day of their wedding, and in a fit of blind rage and jealousy, Evelyn secretly snuck into the chapel and murdered the knight before Annabelle's eyes.  She was so devastated by Evelyn's actions that she immediately began searching for her to exact her revenge.  After ages of endless searching but unable to find the stealthy Evelyn, Annabelle eventually passed away and became a spirit, trapped in the physical realm until she can finally bring Evelyn to justice.\n\nThat's when she discovers that Evelyn was hiding in the one place Annabelle couldn't reach her- the Fields of Justice.  Having learned this, Annabelle pleaded with the Council for admittance, which was granted.  Now Annabelle finally gets her chance to get revenge for the murder of her fiance... at least she can bring justice to ***Evelyn, the Widowmaker***.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WhoraThaExplora","date":"2015-01-06T16:45:37.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somehow I ended up here. I was taking a look at some of your champion concepts, and this one in particular stood out the most. I can not express how intrigued I am concerning this concept. I took one thorough read through which made me fall in love with this champion.\n\nI myself have been trying to come up with an AP champion who could manipulate the fog of war; without it being completely overpowered. \n\nThere are many questions and suggestions that I would love to ask/suggest to you.\n\nLore Wise: It would be nice to know where she resides now and what her motif's are? Is she still the same person she was before? Or has her demeanor changed? Why has she chosen to join the league? Here is a chance for you to add a little bit more detail to her lore.\n\n For example: When I read her lore and look at her, I cannot help but think of her as a Shadow Isles Champion.\n\nI have a suggestion that might help clarify her background that could potentially be added to her lore.\n\nSuggestion: \n\nOnce a human/mortal; who eventually lost her lover who resided on an archipelago of islands located northwest of Valoran (Pre-Shadow Isles). In turn she eventually turned into stone. However, dark magic awoke her and turned her into something more (Post-Shadow Isles). Now a spectral being filled with despair and longing (quite similar to kalista and thresh etc... in a few ways) who now is in search for her lost husband who she believes abandoned her. (you can put a twist on to her lore, with her becoming some sort of embodiment of hope and despair or longing).\n\nIt is \"assumed\" that mordekaiser is the oldest Shadow Isles Champion. Potentially she can be.\n\nIn addition, you can tie her in with so much shadow Isles champions lores; as well as the recently released \"The Pledge\" video showcasing Kalista surrounded in a shroud of \"fog\" hunting her next target.\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive is really interesting. I enjoyed reading that.\n\nHer Q is decent (would love to see how much dmg it can do). (However, I have a problem with the CDR. If you compare it to champion, lets say Syndra who starts off with a 4 Sec Cd Q and with max CDR has a Cd of 2.4 sec's. Then looking at Agatha's who starts off with 6 sec Cd with a max Cdr would have a Cd of 4.4 seconds which is still spammable. For a suggestion why not just have it detonate \"lingering touch\",  instead of it reducing the cd of her Q; why not fear enemies effected by Agatha's Fogs (her passive, her q and her ult) if detonated.\n\nHer W is really really intriguing. (It would be nice to see it used) (suggestion: instead of using the name moonlight. Why not call it \"My beloved\" its almost as if shes reminiscing about her loved one.)\n\nHer E is incredible. (In addition to add to what I had mentioned previously about a fear on her kit which would help her kite more as well as increase her survivability rate since she has no escapes. Maybe you should look into making her E a passive and an active ability. \n\nFor example:\n\nThis could be Agatha's passive: Agatha's auto attacks gain 50/75/100/125/150 range (granting 625 max range) and deal 10/15/20/25/30 (+30% AP) bonus magic damage. Hidden Passive: auto attacking a ward reduces its duration by 10 seconds. This effect can only occur once per ward.\n\nActive: Her first auto attack against an enemy also slows the target by 30/40/50/60/70% for 1.5 seconds and deals double the bonus magic damage it would normally apply. This places a debuff on the target called 'Lingering Touch' which prevents the effect from occurring again for 6 seconds. (with having a passive and active ability, it would somewhat balance Agatha with the fear I suggested. I personally think that if an enemy with 'Lingering Touch' dies then the debuff should spread to nearby enemy champions (small radius) which would increase the amount of fears Agatha can put out. You could have a CD of 18 at all ranks for her active; therefore she can make some plays.) (with max cdr it should bring it to about 12)\n\nHer R CDR in my opinion needs to be at 120. If you compare it to the CDR of a Lux Ult, the cdr is at 80... So with that said Agatha's Ult with max CDR will be spammable every 30 sec's?\n\nNevertheless, this concept is very interesting; which ever route you choose to go with will not disappoint. In conclusion, I would just like to see some base stats/quotes/edited lore/potential dmg ratios on some of her abilities. Then you will have a remarkable champion.\n\nP.S.

Thank you so much for all the kind words and incredibly detailed feedback.  I greatly appreciate it.\n\nI like your concepts for Agatha's lore and welcome any additional details or direction you have regarding this.  I don't have a perfect vision in my mind for her back story, so feel free to interject here as you wish.\n\nRegarding her Q, perhaps you misread but it has a 6 second baseline cooldown but can get down to as low as 2 seconds without CDR when she has maxed out her passive effect.  So basically you're looking at 1.2 second spammable Q's, which work like minor pops of Cass Q's.  I refer to her play style (coupled with her E) as an anti air turret that just shreds and melts at all incoming forces.  The turret reference is apt because she must remain stationary to earn these effects.\n\nFor her W, I think it would be a cool lore-gasm if she referenced her beloved while using the spell audibly, or the buff she put on her ally was called \"Light of Hope\" or something like that.  In fact... what about calling it Beacon of Hope?  That would help instill the Lighthouse-esque nature of Agatha watching over the cliff side.\n\nI am very hesitant to give Agatha a fear or any other type of hard CC.  Her kit makes her incredibly powerful when she has the ability to set up, so the natural counterplay is to rush her.  If enemies rush her only to be feared and shredded into bits, that would make for a very poor user experience and semi uncounterable.  As I said in the design philosophy, making the ability wholly passive also helps offset the complexities of her kit on both a mechanical and positioning level.\n\nI totally agree with you on the R cooldown, though.  That was an oversight on my part so great catch there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-13T17:49:07.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agatha is encroaching on the front page...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T22:13:17.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agatha just keeps waiting on the rocky perch of the forums for her love to return to her...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-03-10T23:58:52.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like her background.

You're right about the counterplay cue... though it was actually already listed on the last line of the ability!  :D\n\nRegarding her defenses, I made her mobility range 400 units because I felt like that was a decent amount of space in which to dodge skill shots and position herself appropriately.  That said, her immobility is her defining weakness, and she excels using very long range and reliable poke, among her suite of other utilities to support her laning partner.  I think when she's played optimally, players will stay very far back and shred enemies who try to rush her (like D Day at Normandy Beach).","replies":[{"poster":"Spirangle","date":"2015-01-06T16:43:20.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I wasn't very specific.

Agatha's ultimate means that somebody is stealthed and that a smokescreen is going to occur somewhere soon; this is always powerful but it's most dangerous during team fights where multiple opponents could lose vision. I suggest that Agatha have a very obvious visual cue like Agatha glowing or her fog swirling around her to signal to both her teammates and her opponents that somebody is about to be stealthed, allowing her opponents to react. This is purely a suggestion because it risks Shadow Veil being too powerful during late game.\n\nI underestimated Agatha's offensive capabilities.

However, I specifically themed the ability around moonlight because she's imbuing them with a lunar energy that brightens them up like a lamp.  The extra light beaming out of her target on all sides is what pushes back the fog of war, which is why I think it's thematically appropriate.  :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-06T02:29:34.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like Agatha.
