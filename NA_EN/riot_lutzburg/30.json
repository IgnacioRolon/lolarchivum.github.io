{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-03T06:00:08.756+0000","title":"Ophelia, Daughter of the Monolith","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Role**: AP Support, Tank\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to explore the lore behind Malphite, which we know very little about.  I thought the best way to do this would be to create another Monolith champion, and given how Malphite came to be in Runeterra, I decided to explore the idea of him having a daughter that he was separated from during his volatile and unwillful transition into the League.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Ophelia is a powerful, engage-prone support and tank with an emphasis on enduring the bulk of enemy fire for the sake of making huge, game-changing plays.  Her suite of skills includes a powerful skillshot engage tool, multiple ways of shielding herself from damage, a blinding sandstorm and an Ultimate that lets her command a tidal wave of tectonic plates that rake and sunder the fertile soil of Summoner’s Rift.\n\nOphelia’s name is based on the geologic term “*ophiolite*,” which has aquatic connotations associated with it, helping to reinforce her lore as a river rock golem.  Even more obscurely, Ophelia was the name of a character in Shakespeare’s “*Hamlet*,” who famously fell from the top of a tree and into a stream.  This runs as a direct parallel to the origin story of the Daughter of the Monolith.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Ophelia explores an untapped species in the world of Runeterra, brings out another badass female support champion who isn't overly sexualized, and positions herself as a play-making tank who is both similar but thematically quite different from Leona.\n\n**Appearance**: Ophelia is a slender but still sturdy and powerfully built female rock golem.  Having grown up in stream-laden cliffsides and lush, water-rich mountaintops, Ophelia’s form has undergone the effects of erosion, obtaining a very smooth, river rock texture to her skin.  This is augmented by light clumps of moss and other light vegetation.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Golem_Girl_zpsc40a7219.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/EarthElemental1_zps247e11a9.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/female_magic_golem_by_kaelula-d6t8mrn_zps99408fd2.jpg\n*Example of her moss-covered body*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/haunted_zyra_by_rikanee-d758ttk_zpsbd754936.jpg\n*Example of her smooth, but still distinguishable rock skin tone*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/6cae84a74167ab11b7e46032d2130427_zpsd305f787.png\n*Examples of possible action poses and animations*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/female_version__malphite_by_kukuruyosechs-d62amvq_zps77435b39.jpg\n\n\n> **Lore**: _When the League’s Council summoned Malphite from the realm known as the Monolith, his physical form was clutched from the world he knew and violently tossed across an inter-dimensional portal.  Such a jarring experience would naturally shake anyone up; even if they were made of rock!  As such, during this volatile migration to Runeterra, a small shard of Malphite was loosened from his body, falling away into a peaceful, mountainside brook.  Over time, the natural, magical energies of the brook began to nurture this tiny pebble, and it started to grow.  Before long, Ophelia was born of the brook itself._\n> \n>_ The young and sleek earth golem grew up in complete isolation from human contact, much less the parental love and guidance of her father.  Malphite, of course, had nary the slightest inclination that he had a daughter. It wasn't until years later, well into young Ophelia’s adolescence, that she was finally encountered by a group of roaming nomads who had recently made a stop in the brook she called her home. She reached out to them with a timid and inquisitive nature, and was thankfully met with kindness, as well as more than a little shock and disbelief.  It wasn't long before these humble nomads began to teach her their language, and of the world beyond her isolated life on the steppes of a Runaterran mountain._\n> \n>_ After some time, it dawned on the nomads that their new friend, who they named Ophelia, bore more than a slight similarity to the legendary warrior Malphite, of the Monolith.  After telling Ophelia about this fearsome but just being, her eyes lit up.  Unaccompanied and ignorant to most of the world around her, Ophelia made her way to the steps of the League itself.  After a heartfelt and surprising reunion with Malphite, Ophelia’s next choice was an obvious one to her.  With a smile on her face and an aura of pride and youthful determination about her, Ophelia decided to join the ranks of the League, side by side with her father._\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful initiation, ability to turn fights around at the last second, great at splitting up enemies during team fights, innate tankiness\n\n**Weaknesses**: Low damage output, skillshot dependent, must put herself in harm’s way to be effective\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:89}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:127}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Ophelia uses a massive rock gauntlet to punch enemies in melee range (150).\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16557_pas_zpsa4a4ad15.jpg\n**Passive- Rock Bottom (90 sec)**: When a nearby ally's health drops below 25%, Ophelia gains a massive damage-absorbing shield based on her level (200-1,500 at level 18) and her spells' cooldowns are reduced by 5 seconds. The shield lasts up to 8 seconds.  This effect has a 90 second cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an awesome play-making tool that feeds off of rapid reversals of fortune.  If Ophelia’s allies are on the losing side of a skirmish at bot lane, she will experience a brief moment of God Mode, providing her with both the defense capabilities and cooldowns needed to re-engage a fight and turn the tides at the last moment.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14190_btn_zps448cb088.jpg\n**Q- Subterranean Uppercut (8 sec)**:  Ophelia fires her rock gauntlet into the ground as a long range (1000 units), thin skillshot resembling a mole traveling directly below the surface. The subterranean gauntlet briefly knocks enemies aside as it travels and deals 30/60/90/120/140 (+20% AP) magic damage to them. While the spell is traveling, Ophelia can choose to reactivate the ability to teleport to her gauntlet.  This causes her to erupt from the ground in order to re-attach herself to it, knocking up any enemies above her in the process. This secondary activation also deals 70/120/180/230/280 (+30% AP) magic damage. Visually, when Ophelia chooses to erupt from the ground, her former avatar will crumble into dust wherever she was previously standing.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Ophelia’s primary initiation tool and allows her to transform herself into an underground torpedo.  This ability is similar to Lissandra’s E in many respects but is a necessary and thematically badass way for getting Ophelia into the heart of a battle.  Visually, this ability looks similar to Glacius’ [uppercut move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hvXnbkChVA#t=89) from *Killer Instinct*.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12749_pas_zps7e7ee6fa.jpg\n**W- Blinding Sandstorm (12 sec)**: Ophelia envelops herself in a sandstorm for 4 seconds, granting her a shield that absorbs  80/130/180/230/280 (+15% bonus health) damage. Enemies caught in the sandstorm are buffeted with 5/8/12/15/18 (+3% AP) magic damage every .25 seconds. In addition, enemies who remain under the effects of the storm for more than 2 seconds consecutively are blinded for 1.5 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: The damage component of this ability gives Ophelia some offensive capabilities when diving into the thick of the enemy team, while the blinding component helps keep her alive long enough for her back line to kill the enemy’s front line first.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16396_pas_zps4a0aa920.jpg\n**E- Seismic Tremors (6 sec)**: Ophelia punches the ground with her gauntlet, sending out a quickly expanding circular shockwave similar to Nautilus' Riptide. This shockwave slows all enemies by a variable amount and also deals dynamic magic damage to _enemy champions_. While Ophelia can cast this ability every 6 seconds, it has a secondary charge-up effect that takes 20 seconds to reach max power. This charging process is thematically tied to that of an earthquake on the Richter Scale. The longer Ophelia stores the ability before using it, the more damage it will deal and the greater the slow value and duration will be (up to 70% for 2.5 seconds). The visible tremors also change in appearance and intensity to match the ability's power level when used.\n**Design Philosophy**: By only allowing this ability to deal damage to enemy champions, it limits Ophelia’s power to wave clear and exist as a solo lane champion.  Furthermore it prevents her from pushing her lane unintentionally or accidentally stealing CS from her Marksman (Hello, Leona!).  The charging mechanic of this ability functions similarly to the passive component of Thresh's Flay.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11732_btn_zps8c7b5002.jpg\n**R- Tectonic Shift (110 sec)**: Using a similar casting mechanic to that of Karthus’ Wall of Pain, Ophelia summons an 1,100 width wall of rock plates at a target area that is 1,800 units away.  After erupting from the ground, this massive tectonic plate moves towards her at a missile speed of 900 and, like the parting of a tidal wave, disperses as it reaches her.  All enemy units are raked and pushed along the wall, and suffer 175/275/400 (+60% AP) magic damage upon initial impact. Units can move along or ahead of the wall while being raked, or blink over it (though conventional dashes don't work).\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: In essence, this ability functions like a reverse Nami Ultimate, carrying long range or fleeing enemies towards Ophelia and her team.  This ability is great for isolating enemy carries who just had to grab that last CS in mid lane.  This ability can also be used more creatively, if Ophelia engages the back line with Subterranean Uppercut, positions herself even further behind the enemy back line and then casts Tectonic Shift, she effectively walls her squishy enemies away from the support of their team.  Sure Ophelia will likely die in the process, but isolating her allies from enemy threats is a righteous and noble way to go out.\f\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread)","replies":[{"poster":"SlushieDee","date":"2015-03-30T14:48:11.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot please hire this man","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-30T17:52:10.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlushieDee,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=BgAceIUL,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2015-03-30T14:48:11.022+0000)\n>\n> Riot please hire this man\n\nI completely support and encourage this!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-06-29T17:05:11.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really interesting idea.

It is intended to provide some small counterplay options (like Graves dashing sideways and then being dragged for a brief moment before escaping it), but basically if you get caught by this thing, you're along for the ride.  Most of the counterplay should come from the affected enemies' lateral movement (do I roll left or right?).  It's intended to scale in width with rank but I forgot to include that, so I'll add that now.
