{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T01:08:17.839+0000","title":"Atlas, the Thundering Templar","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AP Bruiser, AP Tank, AP Jungler\n\n**Inspiration**: [This classic Legend of Zelda enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZV5W5O3gw) was the core inspiration for Atlas.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Atlas is a uniquely mobile champion whose kit revolves around carrying, tossing and being tethered to a massive ball and chain. He is an evolution of Orianna in a sense, if Orianna was physically attached to her ball.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate. His kit is incredibly unique and therefore untested. However, his visual appeal is inherently strong and his sheer size makes him an ideal candidate for players to simply want to hulk around on the Fields of Justice.\n\n**Appearance**: A massive, hulking knight in shining armor, with a unique steampunk or ‘Tesla’ inspired design. A battery pack with a tesla coil is strapped to his back. His most distinguishing feature is the massive morning star which he carries in one hand. The ball itself is incredibly massive and roughly ⅔ the size of Atlas himself.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Ball_amp_Chain_Trooper_Artwork_A_Link_to_the_Past_zpsc0ebc6c1.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/castle_crashers__the_lightning_knight_by_darthagnan-d6dzdwb_zps3072dc2a.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Great team disruption, sustainable damage, powerful AoE, reliable stun (in melee range), does not require a resource to use abilities, very long range gap closer\n\n**Weaknesses**: Dependent on flail positioning, slow movement speed, tethered to flail at all times, not innately tanky, dependent on movement speed items\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:61}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:85}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A melee fist attack with his free hand, constantly holding the morning star or its chains in the other.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10685_pas_zps975c77c3.jpg\n**Passive- Weight of the World**: Atlas’ base movement speed is 300. Atlas gains 25-100 (scaling with level) movement speed when his flail is grounded.\n**Design Philosophy**: Atlas has two sets of movement speeds, depending on whether or not he is wielding his massive ball and chain. Thematically, it makes a lot of sense that Atlas would move faster when not weighed down by a 2 ton iron ball.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14465_pas_zpsf9122567.jpg\n**Q- Flail/Grab (8 sec)**: Atlas tosses his massive morning star at target location (700 range), dealing AoE physical damage and grounding it. (Casting Q again near or on the star will cause Atlas to pick it back up). Atlas then becomes tethered to the star (900 range). Atlas’ movement speed is lowered by 150 if he attempts to travel outside the flail’s tether range, dragging his flail behind him until he picks it up again. If Atlas casts Grab within 3 seconds of casting Flail, then Flail can be cast a second time before the ability goes on cooldown.\nRank-ups lower the ability’s cooldown and increase the damage dealt.\n**Design Philosophy**: Flail’s cooldown is very low, as it is Atlas’ primary initiation and mobility tool during a fight. Casting Flail activates his passive, allowing him to run very quickly to ‘catch up’ to the flail in order to throw it again. The ability can be cast twice in rapid succession so that it synergizes very strongly with his E, which allows him to reel himself to his ball at any time. This essentially allows Atlas to ‘leapfrog’ to a far-off position almost instantly.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8515_pas_zps6a328fdc.jpg\n**W- Static Chains (10 sec)**: Passive: Atlas supercharges his gauntlet with electricity, causing his basic attacks to deal bonus magic damage when Static Chains is off cooldown.\nActive: Atlas’ chain transforms into a slack lightning tether for 5 seconds. Enemies caught in the chain suffer magic damage every .25 seconds they are in its range. Atlas can move and cast other abilities while Static Chains is active.\nRank-ups increases the ability’s damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: The active component of this ability works similarly to Karma’s old tether. While this was a mechanically interesting ability, it did not work well on Karma due to her desire to stay at long range and not interact in a melee zone during team fights. In addition, the tether was a rigid line, which meant that the window for catching multiple enemies in its path was slim. With a slack tether, Atlas can actually move around a battlefield with the chain, almost similarly to Singed’s poison trail. Even still, the ability’s use during laning phase is limited, so the passive component was added to provide easier trading and last hitting mechanics in-lane.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15994_pas_zps11ce1366.jpg\n**E- Reel/Bash (7 sec)**: Atlas tugs on his chain with one hand, quickly reeling himself toward the morning star with his other hand outstretched. The first enemy he collides with is scooped up and slammed into the flail upon arrival. This deals physical damage and stuns the target for 1.5 seconds. If the star is not grounded, Reel becomes “Bash”, a targeted ability similar to Singed’s Fling with its range indicator centered around the flail. This smashes a nearby target into the morning star, dealing physical damage and stunning them for 1.5 seconds.\nRank-ups lower ability cooldown and increase the damage of Reel/Bash.\n**Design Philosophy**: Another ability that synergizes with the rest of Altas’ kit. Atlas can Flail over targets at moderate range, placing them between himself and the flail. Casting Reel essentially turns Atlas himself into a skillshot stun that takes effect once he and his target reach the flail. As the stun is a core part of Atlas’ kit, Bash was needed for when the flail is grounded near an enemy during a non-mobile duel.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12231_pas_zps63808917.jpg\n**R- Ionic Pulsar (85 sec)**: The morning star becomes electrified for 9 seconds, passively emitting an aura that deals magic damage each second to enemies around it, as well as slowing them by 30%. Enemies affected by Reel/Bash take bonus magic damage. Enemies damaged by Flail during this time are also stunned for .5 seconds, but receive a debuff called \"Shock Resistance\" that prevents them from being stunned subsequent times for the next 5 seconds. Rank-ups increase the passive damage, as well as the bonus damage from Reel/Bash. Rank-ups also lower the ability’s cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: Atlas’ kit is all about synergizing with his placement of the flail. As a bruiser/tank who will be causing chaos in the middle of a team fight, the Pulsar provides moderate damage to all nearby enemies as well as creates a mini damage steroid for his E. Finally, the additional mini stuns and slows provide some much needed crowd control to offset Atlas’ initial speed and stick problems.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T03:28:42.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Jelly- Happy to review all of your concepts later this evening!

I am not a huge fan of adding values to most of my concepts, as I feel like they draw too much attention to subjective details and away from the core concept I'm trying to achieve.  I believe numbers are definitely important, but not necessarily this early on in the design phase.  As far as lore, I haven't given much thought to Atlas' just yet.  Got any ideas?

Yes, the goal with Atlas was to make an incredibly slow and heavy-feeling champion that can also fling himself great distances using clever hookshot-esque mechanics.  He can *get* almost anywhere in an instant.  *Leaving* that location in a reasonable amount of time is another story, though...","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T02:48:39.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he dose sound like he could be a powerful Ganker if you can manage to land your skill shots. now this maybe my ignorace or something but both the concepts pic are both knights but the 2nd look something we might see from Zaun using the electrcty, so dose he have an electric theme applied to him?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T03:02:43.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JellyJackJak22,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=M7R9KWZb,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-02T02:48:39.907+0000)\n>\n> he dose sound like he could be a powerful Ganker if you can manage to land your skill shots. now this maybe my ignorace or something but both the concepts pic are both knights but the 2nd look something we might see from Zaun using the electrcty, so dose he have an electric theme applied to him?\n\nYes, there's absolutely an electricity theme.  In my description I was referring to it as a \"tesla\" or \"steampunk\" theme, which are both pretty common tropes but neither one perfectly matches what I have in mind.  It's a very...* industrialized* type of electricity.  Something out of the Industrial Revolution, perhaps?\n\nBut yeah, his chain becomes electrified when using his W, which works a bit like Karma's old tether mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T03:08:45.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmmm interesting. could impose on you to check on a few post i recently posted & have you look at them & tell me what you think?\n\nA Combination Idea - Freljord + Bard = ?????\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ijYg3o71-a-combination-idea-freljord-bard\n\nSuolo, the Living Land\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/OcJRqE2V-suolo-the-living-land\n\nRaphael, the Flying Wrestler\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/MqwYdVLt-raphael-the-flying-wrestler","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-08T21:30:59.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I feel like my concepts are carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-29T17:59:39.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of my first concepts and also one of my very favorites...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dryditch","date":"2015-03-18T20:28:26.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is amazing!
