{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-04T02:49:20.091+0000","title":"Richter, the Crystalline Miner","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage, AP Support\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion with a “pick a card” style ability that had even more dynamic and varying effects.  Richter was the fourth of fifth champion concept I ever designed formally.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Richter is designed to be an AP Mage with a slew of new mechanics and ability types never before seen.  He shares a bit of spamminess a la Ziggs, but also a lot of environmental awareness and forethought in where and when he uses his abilities.  Richter can channel a sifting spell that lets him find rare minerals of variable power and effect, throw volatile energy crystals that explode on contact, construct a conveyor belt that rapidly shuttles anything on top of it in a single direction, and even plant (and detonate!) a massive stockpile of explosives from anywhere on the map.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: High.  Richter introduces a suite of new mechanics and abilities that might be too complicated for users or too difficult to program.  That said, any one of these abilities could be altered or trimmed to accommodate the rest of the kit.\n\n**Appearance**: An elderly Yordle with a whiskery white beard, mining hat, pickaxe, and satchel full of crystals.  Overall theme is dusty and energetic, mildly obsessed with crystals.  While the reference images below showcase the shopkeeper from Summoner's Rift, *it is merely a reference and in no way am I suggesting that Richter is the shopkeeper!*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/shop-keeper-16-9_zpsc7c608d9.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/intro-screen-3_zpsfa641b95.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/bombs-League-of-Legends-waffles-Ziggs-yordles-_350955-34_zpsd5f176ba.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Richter was once a famous miner and tasked with being the foreman of a massive mining expedition at the Crystal Scar.  Unfortunately due to his carelessness, there was a massive explosion that got him in a bit of trouble.  Coincidentally it was this explosion that helped shake the Crystal Scar open and awaken Skarner.\n\nSince then, Richter opened up a shop in the Quarry District of the Dominion map.  However, when his business was formally quartered by Demacian soldiers as a strategic stronghold during the great war against Noxus, he decided to join the League in order to help end the war so that he can get back to work.\n\n**Strengths**: Pseudo global Ultimate, ability to earn bonus gold, suite of crowd control and utilities\n\n**Weaknesses**: Channelled ability, long cooldowns on most abilities, melee auto attack\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:115}} {{champion:4}} \n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13042_btn_zps3d9312bd.jpg\n**Auto Attack**: A melee range pick axe that he dominantly wields in one hand.\n\n**Hidden Passive**: Richter gains 1 bonus AD when purchasing a Pickaxe, and says a custom line of dialogue upon purchase.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15688_btn_zps79643c92.jpg\n**Passive - Gold Rush**: Richter earns 2AP for every 100 gold currently in his possession, up to +100 bonus AP at 5,000 gold.\n**Design Philosophy**: A fun, thematically relevant ability that plays off of the term ‘gold rush.’  As a miner, Richter becomes more powerful the more gold he possesses.  This inherently gives Richter an edge during drawn-out lane phases where both mid laners have a lot of gold but have not yet returned to base to spend it.  Admittedly I liked this ability so much that I reused it on one of my other concepts, [Cornelius](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/38X6yjLQ-cornelius-the-gold-miner).\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_993_btn_zpsbfc8ff6b.jpg\n**Q- Crystalline Blast (4 sec)**: Richter throws a small blue crystal at target area that detonates upon impact, dealing magic damage to enemies caught in the blast.  This ability can be augmented with Richter's Sift ability.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: An easy-to-cast, spammable ability that provides Richter with high, sustainable damage.  As his other abilities require long setup times or are more useful for their utility, Richter needs a way to be a constant damage threat.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11173_pas_zps6bcd879b.jpg\n**W-Sift (variable cooldown)**: Richter immobilizes himself and begins a channel, as he sifts for precious crystals. The longer he sifts, the rarer the crystal he finds. Finding rarer crystals also increases the cooldown of the ability. Cast W once to start sifting, and recast it to stop.  The ability automatically finishes channeling after 3 seconds.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6541_btn_zpsea204268.jpg\n**Sift- Empowered Crystal (8 sec)**: found from .5-1.4 seconds. An intensely purple crystal that causes the next Crystalline Blast to deal bonus magic damage.  Next Crystalline Blast must be cast within 8 seconds or the effect is lost.\n\tRank-ups increase bonus magic damage done.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6542_btn_zps3b626cad.jpg\n**Sift- Emerald Dust (14 sec)**: found from 1.5-2.9 seconds. Infuses nearby allies with a rejuvenating essence, dramatically increasing their health regeneration over 4 seconds, based on AP.\n\tRank-ups increase healing done.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6545_btn_zps661974e1.jpg\n**Sift- Gold-Crusted Gem (24 sec)**: found at the conclusion of the full 3 second channel. Richter earns 5/10/15/20/25 bonus gold for finding this gem.  In addition, an explosion of gold dust showers the area, offering a 200/350/500/650/800 magic damage shield to all nearby allied champions. Allies caught in the aura share the shield evenly, which lasts up to 15 seconds.\nRank-ups increase the shield's strength and bonus gold.\n**Design Philosophy**: Sift is a fun and dynamic ability that can serve a wildly dynamic set of circumstances.  It can be used to augment damage, provide an AoE heal over time for allies, or earn bonus gold and create game-changing effects during a team fight by drastically increasing the allied team's defenses just before or during an impromptu team fight.  A small perk of this ability is the fact that Richter players can usually sift for a gold gem just before leaving the fountain, earning a free 25 gold every so often.  The ability’s excessive cooldown prevents this from being abused, however.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6498_pas_zpsc16b027d.jpg\n**E- Rollout (18 sec)**: using vector targeting, Richter dispatches a set of rolling panels (essentially acting as a makeshift conveyor belt) at a target location that grants 100% bonus movement speed in a single direction to both allied and enemy champions who walk over it. Units will be carried in the direction of the conveyor belt until they move off of it.  In addition to this, Crystalline Blasts can also use this conveyance system to increase their range and travel speed, as they do not shatter when contacting the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt lasts for three seconds.\nRank-ups increase the length of the conveyor belt and lower its cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: An amazingly fun and unique utility ability that is reminiscent of Galio’s E on steroids.  This ability forces all units on the battlefield to interact with a ridiculous movement speed modifier.  Players can move perpendicular to the conveyor belt to quickly remove its effects.  This ability can be used to create a speed boost during a chasing team fight, or to repel enemies away by aiming it backwards as they chase you.  The interaction with Crystalline Blast functions not dissimilarly to that of a slingshot.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10175_btn_zpsce77e762.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6588_btn_zps4b851ab2.jpg\n**R- Blast Zone (120 sec)**: First cast- Richter channels for 3 seconds in order to plant hidden explosives at his current location, invisible to the enemy team, in a large radius. This can be interrupted, and all players on the map are alerted with an audio cue that the explosives are being planted… somewhere.  Following this, the ability becomes global, as Richter can choose to  detonate the explosives at any time.  This ability only goes on cooldown after being detonated.\nSecond cast- A fuse appears near the blast zone and begins a 2.5 second arming sequence.  The physical explosives also become visible at this point.  After 2.5 seconds, a massive explosion occurs with a 700 diameter range, dealing massive magic damage based on enemies’ proximity to the blast’s epicenter.  Additionally, several giant crystals randomly erupt from the ground at the blast site, creating impassible terrain for 3 seconds before shattering.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lowers cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: A combination of several ‘global’ ultimates, including Pantheon’s, Teemo’s, Karthus’ and Ziggs’. While the bombs can’t be seen by enemies, they CAN spot when a Richter player is placing them.  One popular spot for Blast Zone is in or near the Baron pit.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-13T08:07:44.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of, I made a small change to his Gold Sift ability, changing the MR buff to a long-duration, magic damage shield that is most useful as a \"pre-team fight prep\" ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-13T07:58:19.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's see what kind of readings we can get on the Richter Scale tonight. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-31T19:16:58.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that Richter and Cornelius share a lot of similarities, but I still like them both for different reasons!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senteth","date":"2015-01-10T03:54:31.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something about sift...

I do agree that the ability is a wee bit clunky.  I'm only able to justify it because Richter is such a back line, immobile champion who relies on spammable poke.  Unlike other mages like Orianna or Lissandra, it doesn't really matter if Richter needs to chill out for a second or two in order to ready his next ability.  That said, if you have any suggestions on how to improve the ability's usability, I am definitely open to hearing them.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Senteth","date":"2015-01-10T19:22:10.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"===== W: Sift =====\nCost: 5/10/15/20/25 mana per second.\nCooldown: none\n\nRichter immobilizes himself and begins a channel, as he sifts for precious crystals. \nWhile channeling Richter gains 1 crystal per second, and he can hold a total of 20 crystals.\nRichter gains 1/2/3/4/5 AP per crystal in his possession.\nAlso Richter can use these crystals for his basic attacks by throwing them to deal 10/15/20/25/30 +0.5 AD +0.3 AP damage at targets within 650 meters.\nWhen attacking targets within 150 meters, Richter will use these crystals to augment his pick instead, this deals 20/30/40/50/60 +1.0 AD +0.3 AP damage.\nRichter will also gain 1 gold every 5/4/3/2/1 second(s) of sifting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-10T01:56:51.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, I am really surprised about Richter's lack of feedback here.
