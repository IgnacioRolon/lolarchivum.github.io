I know its just 750 RP skin but how about u instert some proper Lion sounds as QoL change. (bard gets changed chimes and meeps so why not add some few QoL changes for sejuani)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-18T17:18:07.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! \n\nBard Bard is a 750 RP skin, but part of a 750 RP skin includes all new model changes, and his meeps are models. Wild Card Shaco is a prime example of models changing, despite being a 750 RP skin - new clones, new JitB, etc. You are correct that we do something have QoL changes, such as Prehistoric Cho'Gath's Vorpal Spikes changing because of the model changes and we wanted cohesiveness there. \n\nAs for Sejuani Dawnschaser, since Bristle did change more drastically than other skins - she's riding a freakin' lion! - the sounds you're hearing are actually lion SFX, as opposed to the base SFX that Bristle has. May not seem totally obvious at first. Take another listen and lemme know if you can decipher them as lion (her joke is the best example, imo). :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kukiel","date":"2016-11-24T05:46:23.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I'm also interested on this skin, but I wanna know if the lion blinks.\nI watched a preview video on Youtube and it looks like it had a lot of coffee in the morning.\n\nI'm happy it has lion SFX :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-01T17:13:29.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just loaded him up in the game, and he doesn't appear to be blinking.","replies":[{"poster":"Kukiel","date":"2016-12-04T14:37:28.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No matter, I still like the skin :D  and the pretty Lion (I just spent my saved RP on Elementalist Lux tho, so Sejuani will have to wait)\nThanks for caring for the community, I really appreciate what you and Riot do, I've never seen something like that in other games.\nCongratulations for you and your colleagues!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YourSh4dow","date":"2016-11-19T07:44:23.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for response!!! \n\nwell I tried it again and I now can hear its changed even tho very slightly. BUT they are still extremely muffled (say Project: Yi level muffled if u remember his bug with sounds). I had to increase my sound system volume quite a bit (and game sfx slider to 100%) to even hear that. \n\nMaybe increase lion volume? Ideal case for it would be something similar to when {{champion:107}} uses his W roar but on Sejuani Q during her charge, and in less extent her emotes.\n**\nTL;DR want lion sounds louder, barely hearable. Q sounds should be more lionish.**\n\nP.S. am using 5.1 Surround speakers in case it would have to do anything with this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-22T17:51:50.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome. :) \n\nI can speak with the audio team - this may be something we wanted a bit more quiet, but again, I can sync up with them.\n\nPROJECT: Yi should have been resolved several months ago, because you're right, the audio was wicked low, as compared to other skins. \n\nYou surround sound shouldn't have related issues to this bug, it's game side. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
