My ping is constant on NA but sometimes it would lag for no reason in particular, most of the times it would be delays and unable to process what was happening on screen. It also freezes from time to time and spikes to 350-500. \n\nI have repaired my client and still no fix available. However, if I switch and play on other servers such as Japan and Korea, everything runs very smoothly, no lag, nothing. And it's not only me, my friends (we use different routers since we don't live together) have been experiencing the same types of lags; some worse than mine. I hope there's some sort of fix for this :C All we can hope for now is that when the preseason patch comes, everything would be fixed and dandy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T23:16:33.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some connection issues, so it's good that you've done some troubleshooting steps already.  You can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these matches to get a closer look at what's happening.  My guess is that either packet loss of a poor connection is causing this, in which case I'd recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve.
