I lost connection completely, so I closed my game and restarted it. So I opened the client patcher and re-logged in. It didn't give me an option to reconnect, and I was stuck in the main lobby. I checked my match history to see if somebody ended (the game was fairly close to being over), and the game isn't there. I used my LoLSumo app to see if the game was still going, and it was. Now I'm not sure what to do.\n\nEDIT: The game is over but isn't in my match history.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-12T23:29:19.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that's pretty heckin' weird.

Never showed up.
