I was playing an ascension game and everything was going normally until our Lux used her first transformation. After this she had some disturbing second light lux following her, and her particles were the same as her base form. After transforming again the second Lux thing went away but our Lux had her base elementalist Lux Particles. I apologize if the other bugs reported were the same as mine but I felt a video would be helpful. \n\nEDIT: This is on PBE I apologize for posting this on the wrong board but for whatever reason I can't post anything on the pbe forums. {{sticker:sg-soraka}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Skwillexy","date":"2017-12-11T21:14:20.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her fire form particles (Q,W,) are weird too on live servers.Her Q looks shorter and smaller than usual and her W has no sparks on itÂ´s way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-07T17:43:16.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey TornFlame! \n\nYou had me freak out for a second 'cause I thought this was on live. ;-; Ahhhh. Okayyy, only on PBE, got it! I know people have been poking around with some VFX files, I'll see if they know anything about this. I appreciate the report! \n\nRegarding PBE boards - if the PBE is down for maintenance, you may not be able to log in.
