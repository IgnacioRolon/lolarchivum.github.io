The most recent summoner spell added to the game was Barrier in the beginning of season 3, over 6 years ago. And as time has gone on the game has changed a lot while the list of summoner spells actually dropped with the most recent removal of Revive(2015) and Clairvoyance(2016). As such this post is on my thoughts on the 3 most seen summoner spells, my thoughts on limiting players to 1 summoner spell. And some new additions and improvements to current summoner spells to allow more options working off of the idea of having 1 summoner spell to choose from.\n---\n**The Big Three**\n\nCurrently the top 3 summoner spells are Flash, Teleport, and Smite. \n\n{{summoner:4}}  being the primo defacto movement summoner is the top because it gives champions so much ability to move offensively and defensively. You will never enter a Draft or Ranked game without seeing it. Flashy plays are always exciting to watch and there are many memorable uses of it like The Insec, Flash juke, The Doublelift, etc.\n\n{{summoner:11}} Smite is arguably the most important summoner spell in the game and that is a major problem. The fact that it is a necessity in order to play the jungle role greatly limits summoner spell diversity in the game. There are currently only a small number of champions (Hecarim, Olaf, and Udyr off the top of my head) who you could see in the jungle without having Flash and Smite as their summoner spells, and these are the two top summoner spells in the game.\n\n{{summoner:12}} is picked in nearly every game because it&#039;s essentially another movement summoner, it&#039;s distinction from flash is the channel and global range. It&#039;s an extremely essential summoner for top lane, thought the recent cooldown increase has opened up other summoner spell uses. Lane ganks, Teamfight flanks, Teleporting into the enemies base to end the game are among the most notable and impactful uses.\n\n\n\nThese three are the most game changing summoner spells in the game. And because they&#039;re so impactful, and because there are so few and so less useful summoner spells, these three crowd out the others completely. And Smite is the biggest offender. The jungle role is almost completely locked with smite as currently you cannot function in the jungle without it.\n---\n**Limiting Players To 1 Summoner Spell**\n\nThere has to be drastic changes in order to shake up summoner spell usage. And limiting everyone to 1 to me sounds like the most reasonable option. When selecting your summoners it&#039;s always Flash + The actual summoner you need in the game. My theory is that because we have 2 spells to choose from, Flash is always the second option. \nIf Flash is no longer that default second option, people will instead choose the summoner spell they need for that game.\n\nThe benefits of a 1 Summoner Spell game\n- Greater summoner spell diversity in the game\n- Flash is no longer &quot;the&quot; definitive summoner spell to take\n- Allows the buffing of summoner spells to make them feel more impactful\n\nThe Cons of a 1 Summoner Spell game\n- Dealing with Smite and its overbearing nature on the game\n- Flash being crowded out in favor of other summoner spells\n- Immobile champions feel more vulnerable \n\n\nI feel that the good out weigh the bad, and by introducing new summoner spells and changing old spells you can make up for the power difference that 2 summoner spells bring while bringing out greater diversity in summoner spells. Below are a few ideas on new and adjusted summoner spells to fit the idea of a 1 summoner spell game.\n\n---\n**New Spells**\n\n**Airburst** - Release a powerful force of air from your champion, pushing back enemy champions.\n- Disengage focused summoner\n\n**Bolt** -  Summon a bolt of lightning dealing true damage to all enemies struck. Deals 350% bonus damage to shields\n- Anti shield summoner spell \n\n**Summon Minion** - Instantly summon the next wave of minions, later in the game summon a super minion in place of the next wave  of minions\n - Roam countering and wave management summoner\n\n**Abscond** - After a delay become immune to all CC effects and quickly travel towards your base for a few seconds\n- An escape summoner\n---\n**Old Spell Adjustment**\n\n**Revive** - Instantly revive yourself at the summoner platform, or revive a dead ally from their death location. Revived ally gains invulnerability as they recover up to 50% of their health and mana\n- adding the ability to revive an ally to increase its power\n\n**Clairvoyance** - Reveal an area within a large radius of yourself. Enemy champions in the revealed are marked and reveal their location (does not remove stealth/camouflage). Enemy wards and traps revealed permanently lose their stealth.\n- Would be added as an available summoner spell in unsealed spellbook\n---\n**Current Spell Adjustment**\n{{summoner:7}}  - Aoe heal based on missing health that removes grievous wounds. Increases health regen for 30 seconds, but reduces subsequent uses of Heal during that time.\n- Giving aoe to have more power in teamfights, adding regen during the 30 second debuff window as I feel summoner spells shouldn&#039;t have drawbacks\n\n{{summoner:6}}  - After movement speed buff ramps up allows you to move through walls. You remain in vision and targetable while inside terrain.\n- Making it a more versatile roaming summoner spell\n\n{{summoner:21}}  - Shield additionally blocks spell damage over its duration\n - Differentiating it further from heal (original idea for change blocked 1 spell and granted allies the shield as well)\n-EDIT: changed from spells to spell damage\n\n{{summoner:12}}  - Gain CC immunity during channel, can channel to any location within allied vision\n- Removing the ability to interrupt the channel and removing reliance of a ward to join teamfights\n\n{{summoner:4}}  - Cooldown reduced by 1 minute, gain decaying movement speed after flashing\n- Small changes as I feel flash would drop in value with the limit to 1 summoner spell\n\n{{summoner:1}}  - Break free of all CC excluding knockups and removes debuffs. Grants CC immunity on cast\n- Cleanse should not be weaker than QSS\n\n{{summoner:3}}  - Stronger slow that decays, duration increased to 3 seconds. Additionally removes any beneficial buffs on the enemy champion.\n- Exhaust is underrated, so no drastic changes\n\n{{summoner:14}}  - basic attacking the enemy you ignited extends the duration by up to 3 additional ticks of damage\n - Giving some small power making it more impactful \n\n{{summoner:11}}  - [Removed] Instead added as an active on starter jungle items.\n- Best option for this summoner is to move it to an active slot on the jungle items, both freeing up a summoner spell slot for players while not needing to make major changes to its effects, and by proxy, jungle itself.\n\n**My Thoughts**\n- Limiting Players to 1 summoner spell would greatly increase the summoner spell diversity in the game\n- 1 Summoner limit allows for the spells to be buffed to feel more impactful\n- There&#039;s a potential for flash to still be picked over everything else, but with my proposed changes I feel the opposite will happen\n- Smite being moved to an active item may cause problems with people re-learning the right button to press for smite, but could be solved by binding the jungle active as needed\n- Smite was the hardest thing to think about, because of all the intricacies of jungle. Took a couple days of thinking before realizing the best option would be to have it as an active item. As junglers build those starter items already, so this change doesn&#039;t affect jungling at all. Laners who want to be an additional smite on the team would have to take up an item slot to do so. Also means Unsealed Spellbook doesn&#039;t allow for an overwhelming smite advantage.\n- Ghost might still be a little weak even with giving it terrain ghosting\n- Summon minion might be too strong with a super minion, but also too weak without it. late game grief potential if a team opts to send 5 super minions down one lane. But they would sacrifice a lot to do so","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-10-07T02:42:04.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-10-07T06:44:45.429+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from flash isn't ignite the most picked spell in the game, i see like 7-8 ignites a game.

Only because that is kind of Kayn's thing already. Im sure something else could be done.\n\n2) My only problem with Smite is: What prevents it from being picked up by everyone later to secure baron/dragon? I suggest a solution, that the smite damage should have a base damage that ramps up with jungle camp/epic monster smites. So, smiting a jungle camp and securing the kill with it is what would ramp up its damage, making it impractical for people outside of junglers to use.\n\nThis would also leave the option open for, say, a roaming support to pick up and attempt to steal jungle camps etc, but it would be a risk/reward scenario.\n\nThe other thing though, is you would really need to look into the jungle enchants, as I think it would also open things up like Sion (and other tanks) getting the %HP increase from cinderhulk as well as access to things like challenging smite for duels. I like what you have as a base idea there, but there is definitely a lot more that goes into it.

I read comments saying \"Junglers are gonna be crazy buffed as they get smite and BLANK whatever summoner spell they pick, I agree with those. One way to compensate without giving everyone 2 summoner spells would have to be a role specific starter item. As you suggested smite be the Jungler starting item, imagine if supports had exhaust or ignite, ADCS Heal or ignite, Mids Ignite or shield, Tops Teleport or ignite. But then that's just giving us 2 summoner spells.\n\nIgnite that can do 40% max health in true damage... gross. 3 autos isnt hard to get, so that would be dominant. That may REPLACE flash as #1 summoner spell, unless it was changed to MAGIC damage with grevious wounds removed then sure, have it do that.\n\nI also read Flash deletion comments, it's an idea sure, but is it a Good idea? Imagine all the rage after people hit D or F to find that their Flash was replaced by some other spell that they had to put in its place. That's one way to lose a playerbase. 99.99 percent of players use flash, it would not be smart to force a change to the entire playerbase. \n\nGhost that goes through walls. Thats basically taking it literally. Like some people said that is buffing ghost to be stronger than Flash in all scenarios, unless flash was given a longer distance (which erases it's current potential) with a short speed boost, like half a second.\n\nYour new spell ideas are neat aside from Summon Minion and .... Abscond? . Air burst could give a non mobile mage who didnt take flash a means to escape. Basically an insta cast Janna Q. Bolt which removes a shield can be neat. Itd stop Sions everywhere, XD. Maybe lower it's TRUE damage to shields though, heck remove it entirely and make it a short slow that damages Magic and Physical Shields. That can stop a fleeing Karma or Janna.\n\nSummon minion is just not a good idea. Zzrot is already a thing. Abscond is basically a shorter recall that doesnt put you on fountain based on my guesstimates. It's not needed.\n\nOverall I don't support the idea.

Of course, many of the specific changes you've outlined here sound sort of ludicrous, but the thinking is definitely on the right track.\n\nHonestly, I think riot should consider something like this. Everyone get's one summoner, and all the summoners are blatantly OP specifically because everyone gets one. So long as no one summoner is universally more useful than any of the others (Which is why flash is the perma-spell that everyone always takes forever). This means flash should stay somewhat close to it's current form, while the rest get buffs. Flash is more generally useful, and so it's effect is weaker compared to the others.

You vaguely talk about diversity, but you never tell us precisely why we need to change. Remember that even if the current situation is not perfect, there is a cost to change, so the issue solved must be serious enough to justify the cost, and this is not clear at all here. Sure it *could* be more diverse, it could be *better*, but why is it *bad* that everyone has Flash?\n\n2) Your theory that \"Flash is always the second option\" and so if we allow only 1 summoner Flash will drop in usage is entirely unproven. **My** theory is that Flash is always the first option, and that if you allow only 1 summoner, Flash will crowd all the other options. And my theory is backed up by the fact that if Ignite is sometimes the first choice (meaning it's better than Flash) and sometimes TP is the first choice (meaning it's better than Flash), then you should see people with Ignite/TP sometimes. And you don't (outside of a wild Shaco Top every couple hundred games).\n\n3) Why do we need new summoners, or to bring back old summoners that got deleted? Again, cost of change, etc. You shouldn't introduce new stuff just for the sake of novelty, so why these new spells? And especially for old spells that got deleted in the past, they were removed for a reason. Why should they get back?\n\n4) Why buff existing summoners? You say \"because we only get 1, so it can be more powerful\", but that doesn't work. Too much power concentrated in a single ability is a bad thing. See how they nerfed old Seju R, how they removed old Poppy R, how they entirely reworked old Galio R, how new Warwick R is not point'n'click anymore, etc. Basically, take any rework ultimate and compare it to the previous version.\nAnd current summoners are already among the most powerful abilities in the game. Making them even stronger is not a good idea, even if we get only one. You can see how other people already complained about your buff to Ignite, because they already *perceive* the current Ignite as strong, but in reality the same problem will apply to all your buffed summoners.\n\n\n**My conclusion:** Flash is crowding out other options, and it might be *interesting*, but it's not *needed*, to see more diversity. I can agree on your goal, but not on its priority compared to other works or on its importance. Even more so with Smite.

With the increased emphasis on skill shots, and set up abilities, and combos. Any character without a quick any direction dash will need to take Flash. \n\nOtherwise they are just gank fodder. There’s a reason why good players point out when flash is down so the jungles can start focusing in on ganking that land. \n\nKnocking those low movement champions to just one summoner slot means they will just need to take flash with nothing else. Especially now that the cooldown is a minute faster. \n\nNow having Smite become the active of your basic jungle items. That’s an interesting idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexilus","date":"2018-10-07T18:55:46.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're over estimating flash a bit.

I would be fine with its nerf as long as its at least the range of Twisted Fates ult's second cast (5500 units)\n\n\nActually while im typing this, is clairvoyance actually going to be a Quinn w that reveals traps and wards?
