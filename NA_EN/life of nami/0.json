I believe now after you bring your range indicator on and right click, you don't move where you right clicked. So for someone like myself who constantly brings up the range indicator for precision and then canceling it with a right click to move, it seems like a stutter.\n\nI'm not sure if that's what you said and I'm reiterating, but I think its important for Riot at least acknowledge this bug :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EvilScotsman1974","date":"2015-04-10T00:32:37.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"here we go with what i said about generic response\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/ztdTJiYj-gameplay-normal-cast-abilities-cancel-improperly\n\nthis thread is about the same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hokusai","date":"2015-04-09T19:28:46.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you can see that this bug affects many peoples gameplay, whether you use regular range indicators or smart cast with range indicators. There was nothing wrong with the way it was before. Frankly I don't really feel confident in my play and I wouldn't want to jeopardize my team due to this.

Alot of champions will stop the auto attack even if the animation finished, dealing no damage.\n\nSome of these champions did not have this problem before this patch.\n\nPathing also seems to have gotten worse, but that has been bad since 5.1, so, ye.\n\nThere is also a bug with canceling abilities too.

I use smart cast on all hotkeys with range indicators on. If you're holding down an ability key to aim then want to change where you're moving to and quickly cast a spell a lot of the time you'll be releasing right click when you want to cast an ability. Doing this causes the range indicator of the spell your casting to pop up quick and cancel itself out leaving you with no spell cast.\n\nI've played one game since this patch because of this and in team fights where you're trying to react quickly I could not get my spells off and was mashing my QWER just to get anything out.\n\nI really like the range indicators and use the crap out of them.
