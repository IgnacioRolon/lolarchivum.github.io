Whats going on here? Can login into client but says i can't connect to game. Get no UI in pick phase, forcing a dodge. Sometimes the picking lobby just stops responding any buttons. Have 100 mbs and until 7.x patches I've never had an issue.\r\n\r\nDuring games I don't receive any ping twitches. Latency stays at 43-46 pretty much consistently. Problem is sometimes I don't quite get to that point. I can't say it isn't on my end, however I can say I have a fairly experienced background in networking and my connection and all pathways to the game are certainly as clear as possible.\r\n\r\n*repost, guessing I was deleted due to wrong thread*","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-13T21:17:57.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it definitely sounds like something is giving your network a hard time getting connected to that game lobby. Since you mentioned the UI doesn't show in the lobby, along with the random forced dodge, it seems like the client can't grab the data for the UI and then your connection (for some weird reason) drops you out of the lobby.\n\nI'd like to have you try the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure the problem isn't somewhere in there. Let me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
