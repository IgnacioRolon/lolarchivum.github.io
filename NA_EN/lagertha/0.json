{"poster":"Lagertha","date":"2018-09-10T06:12:57.555+0000","title":"PTSD, League of Legends, and Recovery","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks in advance to all who take the time to read my story.\r\n\r\nThere's always an apprehension when I talk about my PTSD, will they believe me, will anyone understand?  I wasn't in a war, I don't have any medals, I didn't watch my parent die or anything that shouldn't objectively be easy to get over.  I'll skip my childhood, which probably plays it's own role in my brain boiling over, because the real messiness came as an adult.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to describe how someone ends up an an abusive relationship, like a lobster slowly coming to a rolling boil.  You excuse the warning signs, and exercise entirely too much forgiveness.  You want to believe that people are good and that people can change.  You give second chances, third chances, fourth chances, over, and over, and over.  You believe the crying and the promises to change as you cling to the few happy moments.  It started when I was six months pregnant.  I don't remember the events leading up to it, but I was naked, and came at my skull like a kamikazi a good seven times.  Afterwards he cried and called his mom sobbing.  There were a few other times he pinned me to the floor, the wall, and growled like a wild animal.\r\n\r\nThe weird part was we started seeing a counselor, this by the way is unethical, because my partner wasn't receiving individual treatment, and the counselor knew about the abuse.  It played a strong role in how long I stayed.  It also helped stop the physical abuse by teaching my partner how to control feelings instead of fists.  Looking back it was a weird cumulation of events.  My partner had selected a counselor who had cheated on his wife, and subsequently blamed her for leaving him.  We knew way too much about him.  They attended men's gatherings and naked sweat lodges together. My partner started a weekly men's group that was unspokenly for white straight men only, with weird justifications about how they just wouldn't be able to understand the struggle of minorities.  We even went to events where he announced to a crowd of 300 or so people that my ex was like his son.  Needless to say, you don't need to be a mental health professional to understand the problematic dual relationship that blossomed.\r\n\r\nI realize now, that I was not allowed to have my own thoughts.  It sounds silly coming from someone in a masters program with an IQ that should be more than adequate, but it's slow, festering, and pervasive.  Comments that slowly erode your confidence, sanity, and place in the world.  They don't even have to be believable, because the irritation will wear you down.   My ex wants to become a psychologist so it not only came in comments about my body and my eye liner, but my intellectual thoughts as well.  Before I scare you from ever seeing a psychologist again, just remember there are good ones and garbage ones just like any other profession, but I digress.  \r\n\r\nEventually I decided being alone was less frightening then spending a lifetime with that man.  It takes the average woman (sorry men I know you are affected too) 7 times to leave a relationship.  It's not some heroic act where a scorned woman blasts Aretha Franklin as she shimmies out of the house telling him to marry the dog, it's the most sad and desperate act you can imagine.  You hate yourself, and you're terrified, and if you get out, had you waited another ten minutes, you probably would have stayed.  When you barely have the strength is when you leave.  When you muster the tiniest little bit of energy, and hopefully have someone waiting on the other end who can help protect you when you get out.  \r\n\r\nFor me it was my friend.  I called her, and she understood what needed to happen, she helped give me that final push, and I left in secret.  I called him the next day and told him the bare minimum.  You never tell a person like that more than you have to, because they'll convince you to go back.  His family has money, and he proceeded to unleash a legal hellstorm.  He sued me for full custody, tried to get a restraining order, forced our house into foreclosure, and made false claims to DCF.  It was the restraining order that tipped me over the edge.  He called the police when I was sobbing and begging for him to not force the house to foreclose.  He had lied and strung me along for months about selling it.\r\n\r\nI'll never forget that day in court.  We were the last ones to present, and we listened to a child sexual abuse case (father perping on a daughter) for hours prior.  He got up on the stand and lied like a magnificent actor about how dangerous I was.  He had prepared an hour long presentation to the judge, and it was in those moments I began to truly understand what a monster he is, and that he did not possess any real moral values or empathy.  I don't remember the actual speech, but afterwards is when I began to really feel the terror of what I could not get away from.  My state is very pro father and without well documented abuse I can't get that custody taken away.  I wasn't even allowed to block him from texting me upwards of thirty times a day thanks to Family Court.\r\n\r\nThe terror and anger became my existence.  I stopped functioning.  I couldn't get out of bed.  I lived like this for a while, about a year, I'm not sure how I lasted that long between the panic attacks and finishing school.  I stopped painting, watching tv, and couldn't watch movies or listen to new music.  In a way I was frozen.  But I've always been good at fixing me, and I understood I had to start finding people to trust.  The first was Dan, he was in the Navy, and as depressed and lost as I was, but he introduced me to emotional survival and League of Legends.  I started playing music that made me cry, and practiced not reacting to the sadness.  Over and over I practiced not crying.  I started counting the days between crying, and like a muscle built up a tolerance.  A lot of people think bottling emotions is awful, but when you have too many, it's necessary for survival.  Those emotions can be handled later.\r\n\r\n_And then there was League._\r\n\r\nTo this day I have yet to find a game as immersive as League of Legends.  It quickly became the reprieve from my suffering, something new I could do!  League takes my focus off of my hypervigilance and helps me reset my anxiety.  When I play League makes me forget about the monumental load of stress that I carry.  I think the psychological term is \"flow.\"  I started off playing it for hours everyday, it became my reward for functioning in the real world.  I did some homework?  1 hour of LoL as a reward.  I went to work? 2 hour reward and then homework.  I sent off 5 job applications? 2 hours as a reward.  Eventually I started medication too, because I was ready to get better.\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely I started being able to handle more and more...\r\n\r\nFor anyone who is wondering I actually work with high risk sex offenders now, and am working to transition into data analysis.  I'm marrying a wonderful man and we won our custody relocation this summer :).  I still play League but I've started doing other things again, listen to new music, watch new tv shows, and can even watch new movies!  Slowly but surely everything is coming together...\r\n\r\nAs for dealing with my ex I've developed a lot of experience working with manipulators.  He's still a nuisance, but predictable and manageable.  Feel free to PM me if you want any advice, I'm always happy to help.","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2018-09-10T07:05:36.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I understand you've been through a lot but honestly League isn't the best option.

As someone who has also been through several abusive relationships, reading through your experience made me feel grateful that I managed to have an incredible support system who encouraged me to get out and leave and defended me and protected me. I am not trying to invalidate or lessen my own experiences here by comparing it to yours either. I just know that reading through what you wrote was something I knew very well myself but without the extremes of a child or custody or housing involved because I was so young in my own experiences. I feel like in a similar way league was an escape for me too, because it was during that relationship that I really first started playing. \n\nAnyways, I am both proud of you and overjoyed that you were presented an outlet to help you with your trauma.

I'm sorry about your heartache, I got my heart ripped out several times before I met my fiance.  After the last one I knew I wouldn't be the same, and I don't love that way anymore.  Don't get discouraged, you'll figure out what pattern you're repeating.  For me I kept getting sucked into the magnetism, everyone I loved was like a magnet, I wasn't sure how I would live without them and it was devastating every time.  I started looking for people who were boring, which probably sounds really silly, but it was exactly what I needed.  Someone who didn't have that trait that kept leading me to the same pitfall, that instant \"this person is unbelievable!\" feeling.  Don't give up, it's like playing the lottery, keep playing those numbers and you will find the love that you deserve.  Sorry if I sound preachy, I used to be that person that thought, \"I am never going to find anybody,\" and I think everyone needs to be loved, especially someone who has life donors (parents) that don't read science or believe in accepting glaringly normal things like hair color, skin color, or men who love other men.\n\nI love repeating these stories because I really believe there is hope for everyone.  I had a homosexual client (child sexual abuser) who met the love of his life, if a child rapist can find a man there is just hope for everyone.  My old boss, a delightful and sassy %%%%%%, lost his husband of 18 years to cancer.  He waited a year or so before dating again, but he found a man way before i did, lol, I think he only spent 2 months on eharmony.  \n\nI know you didn't ask for any of that unsolicited advice, but I feel for you, I'm glad you have an outlet, and now a single mother in CT who cares about you ;)\n\nKeep pushing through my friend, I believe in you <3","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2018-09-11T05:46:48.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are such a lovely person you have no idea how much it means for you to take the time to say all that <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MeilinII","date":"2018-09-10T22:42:36.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP are you me?

I was lucky enough to be able to make the break clean and though the loser tried to find me and harassed a lot of friends, I was far enough away to focus on me.

My understanding of it is that it has very little to do with any particular kind of experience, so, having your leg blown off or being in a car accident, but it's when a person comes face to face with Malevolence and the veil of reality gets peeled back for a moment and you realize \"There are people in the world who are evil\".\n\nAnd then, because you're self conscious, you realize for a moment that you too are evil and you don't know how to deal with that.  That's how it happens for a lot of soldiers.  It isn't even that anything bad happens to them, it's what THEY then do about it and the thoughts that rise in their own heads they never thought they could contemplate, let alone act out.\n\nAnyways, Glad to hear you're functional, but if you ever want to get off the meds, look deep inside yourself and ask what it was you were contemplating when that experience was happening that you don't want to look at.  That's the source of your PTSD.","replies":[{"poster":"Lagertha","date":"2018-09-11T02:51:58.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right about any kind of trauma doing it, it's just more surreal when it's slow and hard to label.  Especially when trauma impacts your memory, and the things that were abusive are more subtle and harder to remember.  I'm not an expert in neuroscience, but what I've managed to gather so far is that it's a nervous system disorder that leaves you in overdrive and produces structural differences in the brain.  Three years ago I would have agreed that people are evil, but I think that gives them too much power and doesn't accurately label it.\n\nThe sex offenders I work with abuse for a variety of reasons whether it be selfishness, a lack of empathy, or a lack of insight.  It's rarely just one factor that plays in.  In my ex's case I think he has a profound lack of empathy, a need to feel unique, and a healthy dose of laziness, but I don't think he's evil.  If anything his behavior is wildly predictable in only a way that someone abnormal can be.  \n\nAs far as realizing we are all evil, you're diving in deep, but the only I've been able to find psychologically is \"the lucifer complex,\" from the guy who did the Stanford Prison Experiment.  It's been a while since I've researched it, but when normal people do horrible things, I believe according to the theory, it's a mixture of role conformity, power imbalance, and anonymity.  On a personal note I suspect some of those who rape during war could have also found a convenient outlet, similar to priests who abuse by finding a way to be around children.  Eventually I'll do some more research on this for my masters.\n\nAs far as realizing you are a monster I have mixed feelings about this, but I think the concept you're getting at is congruence, or that our sense of self needs to match our actual self.  Oddly, I think in the right context I think embracing it can be empowering.  When you hit someone back who is hitting you, when you fight back, I think you're definitely right that if you are not able to recognize that this does not make you a monster, it will be stressful.  I don't know why some people are so self-destructive, the people who embrace being the monster just to be a monster, it's so individualized.  However, one mistake I never try to make with people again is operating on a higher moral level, in this case, acknowledging that you can be vicious is empowering because you are using it to survive.  Had I continued to expect normalcy and rational behavior from my ex I would have driven myself insane, and I did, for a while.  It wasn't until I started testing that I thought he lacked empathy, watched, observed, and read about narcissism that I really began to understand him.\n\nI'm going to quote Lady Sylvanas here, \"honor means nothing to a corpse, Saurfang.\"  In other words in this case, taking the high road, means nothing to someone who has no value for morality.  When you are negotiating for your child's welfare, the moral high ground doesn't get you anything but the possibility of a good feeling due to feeling morally superior.  People who are more focused on being treated fairly lose custody hearings to the parasitic parent, or ending up in prison like Saurfang.  I don't care about feelings, I care about results, and in a way I've embraced the monster inside, the monster he showed me, the monster he helped make.  I can play all of his games and I play them better, because I don't play them by default, or because it's fun.  I play them when he doesn't want to take care of his child, or tries to use my child as a pawn.  When your life is a game to someone else you become the better player.  Nothing about using his weaknesses against him has made me feel like a victim, or escalated my symptoms.  If anything it's more peaceful, because I was the one who stopped the harassment  by being smarter, not the police, not the court system, me.  \n\nAs far as the medication I did resist for a long time because I used to be granola crunchy.  It took a long time to shed that person I was, but now I prefer to live a life of statistics.  My odds of bringing my nervous system back down to normal are remarkably increased with medication management and treatment.  Medication doesn't have to be permanent because you are rebalancing chemicals.  The taproot of my PTSD is that I'm terrified with being someone who gaslighted me.  I uncovered lies about that relationship long after I was out of it.  But with a great partner it's slowly getting better, but it doesn't change overnight.  For me, getting through PTSD was about learning to embrace this new person, not the way I was, and that's how I've been able to recover some of those parts.  I'll never feel that trusting or free again, and I'm good with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Unwardil","date":"2018-09-11T11:52:23.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lagertha,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=wNdm2Zsa,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-09-11T02:51:58.096+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re right about any kind of trauma doing it, it&#x27;s just more surreal when it&#x27;s slow and hard to label.

We are good and evil at the same time and what makes a good person is that they consciously look within themselves, to see the monsters within and then they choose to use them for good.  Because the monster is your strength and you can't act in the world without the exertion of strength.  Like, literally and metaphorically right?  If you have no strength at all, you can't even move your muscles.  \n\nBut when you let the monster make the decisions, either because you're too weak to control it or you just don't realize that monster is there, that's when a person does evil.  So a good person is like a Pokemon trainer with very high level Pokemon who only ever lets those Pokemon out to do good things.  That's why kinds love that game.  It's very metaphorical.  Go out and find all the monsters and then make them do YOUR bidding. \n\nThe reason I say all this stuff is because your story is actually very similar to someone I know very well.  She had similar experiences with manipulative partners as well as undergoing a traumatic brain surgery which made her develop PTSD.  Heavy stuff right?  But here's the really, almost silly part about it.  None of those things, and trust me, she had A LOT of reasons to have PTSD, but those weren't the real problem.\n\nThe problem was that when she was very young, her mother lied to her about a birthday present.\n\nSound ridiculous right?  But that was the moment she lost faith in her parents and from there it spiraled inevitably to patterns of betrayal in her adult life and made her develop PTSD.  Once she identified that, she could look at every PTSD flashback for what it really was and could slowly start coming off drugs and it wasn't a cure exactly, it's just she became strong enough to face it when it happened all by herself.\n\nJust thought I'd share that on the off chance in might be helpful in some way.\n\nHaving a loving supporting partner though, that's the best medicine right there.  \n\nGood luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-09-11T11:45:32.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't possibly imagine what you've been through, but I understand where you're coming from.

Since you're completely done with the past, it's great that you close your horrifying-emotional chapter with your ex-partner. I read your entire story and through your text as far as I can see you sound like a very interesting and intelligent person.  I'm sure that on a long run you be completely fine, you pass a lot of difficulties in your life already I bet nothing can stop you now. Bad experiences in life are just a part of the life they are inevitable eventually they will send you to the Greatness. A man who leaves a woman with such a great personality must be a loser because in a real love the appearance does not count, with time beauty might fade out but personal character stays for life. I have to admit League is quite fun and relaxing game, great place to escape, jump into the virtual world where you can become a Legend and battle for victory. Now about your health issue, medicine is ok, but you need to know that its a temporary solution. I would suggest looking into the unconventional and natural medicine along with exercise. Fresh fruits and vegetables will significantly improve your overall and mental health, remove smoke and alcohol or limit to the minimum. Red beets are great for you they clean your blood, protect DNA, lower tension and stress, favorably affect the nervous system, you can cook the soup eat raw or make a juice. I wish you all the best. Stay happy! :) {{summoner:1}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captainn Ginyu","date":"2018-09-10T08:02:33.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this game gives me PTSD....\n\nall jokes aside its rough man but yea league probably isint the best game a lot of people here would rather trigger it than help you with it","replies":[{"poster":"Lagertha","date":"2018-09-11T03:19:40.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, I know right, but it's a good way to practice not reacting to people.
