Thus, morgana, while rejecting her destiny, acts nevertheless unconsciously as an aspect of justice. Her mind rejects this, but she is constrained by her celestial nature to do justice.\r\nThis explains that she has as many wings as kayle, because she too represents justice.\r\nPlease Riot, tell me I'm right!\r\n(sorry for my bad english)","replies":[{"poster":"Jellbug","date":"2019-03-09T02:57:14.653+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!
