I have a feeling these two have little to no correlation. I was wondering if so how do i get my level up on the boards? \r\nThank You!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T23:03:48.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Often times if you haven't used the boards in a long time, your Boards and Summoner profiles will have fallen out of sync. It seems this post forced a manual sync as you now show as level 30.\n\nHappy posting!","replies":[]}]}
