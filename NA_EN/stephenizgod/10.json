{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2018-08-22T00:33:53.382+0000","title":"Ally Minion Block Should Be Removed","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Gameplay+","up_votes":197,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off I want to start by saying, I don't know what happened in the last few season but minion block has gotten out of control. Before, you just pathed kind of weird but you would move around minions. Now you just glitch back and forth or spin around or you are stuck in walk animation but not moving.  \n  \nAlso I want to be clear, I am going to use the word \"mobility\" a lot, I am referring to Dashes, Flashes, and Leaps. Certain champs have MS boosts, which is mobility, however they are still effected by minion block. \n\nMinion block used to be an actual mechanic to be aware of in lane, certain champions and items even had built in-mechanics to deal with it. Now with mobility creep, only a few low mobility champions are really impacted by it. With the unknown changes to how you path around minions causing you to be essentially stuck in a broken animation, it is just straight up a disadvantage to anyone without mobility.  \n\nThis is even more a problem on champions that summon pets, like Yorick. The other day I summoned Maiden and had 3 ghouls, I landed an E on an enemy who then flashed over a wall and out of vision while I was attacking them. Since they no longer had a target they began attacking the minions that had aggro'd to me. This pinned me against a wall for about 6 seconds until I could throw my E at my opponent again and force them to move. I was literally stuck with no way to move, I clicked frantically and nothing was working. This was about 6 seconds of not being able to move, if my opponent was a ranged champion I would have been dead for free due to a broken mechanic.  \n\nSpeaking of, this mechanic clearly favors Ranged champions over Melee champions in an already skewed match-up. Ranged champions don't have to deal with this problem since they don't need to run through 2 waves of minions to engage. Even if they do get minion blocked, they can still Auto-attack from a distance which makes it less of a problem.  \n\n---  \n\nSo the solution in my opinion should be to remove Ally Minion Block.  \n\n**Should We Remove All Minion Block?**  \n\nNo. Enemy minion block should stay, you should have to consider this before blindly charging into your enemy. While this still favors Ranged over Melee in a Ranged vs Melee lane, it is a valuable safety measure in the Bot lane where it is a 2v2 sometimes 3v2.  \n\n**Won't This Just Make Ranged vs Melee Lanes Worse?**  \n\nYes, by itself it would make this match-up a lot worse. In order to counter-act this, minion aggro would need to be changed for Ranged champions. Personally I think it is a bit unfair that Ranged champions can poke then back off a few steps to break aggro without actually being in any danger of losing CS or EXp. Meanwhile Melee Champions can't get anywhere near the wave. So I have 2 proposed changes that may balance this out:  \n  \n *  Ranged Minions have increased range against Ranged Champions. No change to Melee Minions as increasing their aggro range may allow too much lane manipulation by Ranged Champions. Obviously breaking sight/vision would stop aggro as it does now. \n\n *  A stacking damage buff to minions, every time a Ranged Champion gains and loses aggro minions will gain a temporary boost to damage. This would stack up to say 10 times and stacks would fall off after a few seconds, like lets say 3-5 seconds.   \n\nPotential issues? Well this could drastically effect Bot Lane where there is generally 2-3 Ranged champs and 1-2 Melee champs. It may or may not be a problem, I am a bit unsure on it so I don't really have a suggestion on it. Open to suggestions/discussion.  \n\n**Why Not Just Push the Minions Out of the Way?**  \n\nI believe this would become a problem of lane manipulation, you would be able to push your minions to have an advantage in the first couple waves. In order to not have a disadvantage, the other person would need to do it too. Then it becomes a necessity for both teams to do it. It would be easier to just remove ally minion block entirely and have both teams start off on equal ground.  \n\n**What About Champions That Have the Ability to Ignore Unit Collision?**  \n\nThey still get to ignore enemy minion block so I don't see a problem here.  \n\n**What Happens to Ally Pets?**  \n\nI think Unit Collision with ally pets should be removed, but there would obviously be no change to their aggro. They would retain any collision they have with each other, minions, enemy champions, or other pets. This would only affect Ally Champions.  \n\n---  \n\nFrankly I just don't see a point in ally minion block, I never did to be honest but at least before it wasn't as broken as it is now. It doesn't happen often enough to be a huge problem, but when it does happen it is tragic and feels bad. This is one of those situations where you are fighting against the mechanics of the game, which is usually a sign that something isn't working properly.  \n\nWhat are you thoughts on it? I am open to suggestions.  \n\n**EDIT:** Getting a lot of comments on this and I just can't respond to them all. A lot of people who disagree are mentioning very specific circumstances where no ally minion block would be an issue for balance. I just want to say that 90% of these comments, those issues already exist in game. There is nothing stopping you from sitting in your minions, as I said in the above post, minion block is only a huge problem in situations where your pathing causes you to get stuck. Otherwise you rarely have issue running through minions, other than odd pathing every once in awhile. Sitting in your minions is a valid strategy that exists in the game right now, specially against skillshot reliant opponents. 9 out of 10 times you run through your minions with no problem or even acknowledging that unit collision exists, but that 1 out of 10 times you are stuck for no reason and die because a broken buggy game mechanic. It is only 1 out of 10 times, but thats enough for me that it needs to be removed. I mean i doubt majority of the player base would even notice if it was gone.  \n\nI don't quite understand the issue some are having of an enemy bully, such as Darius, sitting in his minions and getting free harass on you everytime you go to farm... that already happens... This would only make it easier for you to go in towards CS and out through your minions. Yes, it would allow Darius to do the same through his minions, but generally Darius is standing between you and your CS.  Most lane bullies will, so i am not sure how that relates to my post.  \n\nStanding on Minions to block CS with a large champion is another matter though. I agree this may be a problem, however this is one of those \"see how it plays out\" situations. It may be worth blocking 1-2 minions every wave or you take a crap ton of free damage from the enemy while they try to CS. Cho'gath and Sion can already do this and I don't see too many people complaining about it.

You can claim that now you can occupy the same space as a minion but most if not all champions have a larger hit box than minions. Standing on top of a minion will cause you to still get hit. You'll still need to stand behind minions to avoid skill shots. \n\nAs for zoning, the situation is the same. A Darius can already stand right in front of/behind his minions. If the change were implemented, the only difference is that champions who zone will be slightly closer. Another possible difference is, depending on how the minions line up, champions like Darius will be in a better position to punish because they'll no longer be walled off by their own minions. Minions aren't intended to wall off anybody so this can't be an excuse to keep minion block.\n\nThe biggest problem with ignoring ally minion block is when you're chasing someone and then they run through their own minions. You'll have to go around the minions instead, thereby creating extra distance.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-08-22T14:41:10.388+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're forgetting one key thing:\n\nWhat's stopping a Cho'gath or whatever from physically sitting on top of his cannon to stop you from killing it, if you can just stand on your minions?","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainSeto","date":"2018-08-22T15:50:21.696+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The large amount of free damage you get on him, while he tries to prevent you from getting some gold.

Basic idea being that it prevent minion block / pathing issues but also makes it so that units can't just drift seamlessly in and out of their units to attack / retreat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreatWhiteNorth","date":"2018-08-26T18:46:34.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck no.

I&#039;ve played League of Legends for many years, it&#039;s my favourite game to play with friends for a variety of reasons yet recently with meta changes and other things I&#039;ve been struggling, the challenge makes it all the more fun to win but I&#039;m all the more butthurt to lose and can&#039;t help blaming champ and meta changes, BUT one thing that has been consistently a &quot;feature&quot; that has bugged me and many others is minion blocking. The instance by which a large group of minions can block or cause a problem with the player&#039;s pathing when trying to move through them. Sure, there have been examples of specific ways around this with a large handful of abilities being able to ignore unit collision and other methods mentioned below:\n\n* {{champion:12}}  Alistar&#039;s Trample - while active\n* {{champion:201}}  Braum&#039;s Unbreakable - while active\n* {{champion:119}}  Draven&#039;s Rush Blood Rush - for 1.5 seconds\n* {{champion:105}}  Fizz&#039;s Nimble Fighter - persistent\n* {{champion:86}}  Garen&#039;s Judgment - while active\n* {{champion:120}}  Hecarim&#039;s Devastating Charge - while active\n* {{champion:40}}  Janna&#039;s Zephyr - when not on cooldown\n* {{champion:126}}  Jayce&#039;s Hextech Capacitor - for 1.25 seconds after casting Transform\n* {{champion:38}}  Kassadin&#039;s Void Stone - persistent\n* {{champion:85}}  Kennen&#039;s Lightning Rush - while active\n* {{champion:121}}  Kha&#039;Zix&#039;s Void Assault - while active\n* {{champion:56}}  Nocturne&#039;s Duskbringer - while on trail\n* {{champion:421}}  Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s Burrow - while active\n* {{champion:6}}  Urgot&#039;s Purge- while active\n* {{champion:77}}  Udyr&#039;s  Bear Stance - while active\n* {{champion:8}}  Vladimir&#039;s Sanguine Pool  - while active\n* {{champion:238}}  Death Mark  - while active\n\n{{item:3046}} previously had a passive to allow you to ignore unit collision yet that was removed a while back.\n{{summoner:6}} currently allows this yet it&#039;s not viable on a majority of champions.\n{{champion:120}} also had a passive that used to allow him to walk through units, keep this in mind as this wasn&#039;t a specific gameplay mechanic that was introduced to help his kit but rather because he is a MASSIVE CENTAUR THAT SHOULD NOT GIVE  A HOOT IF LITTLE MINIONS ARE IN HIS PATH.\n\nYet this isn&#039;t justification for it still being a problem in the game. Sure, when minions are moving its fine for them to have a collision because they almost always move around or get moved out of the way.\n\n**Example videos** - None of these are mine and all the rights and credit goes to the respective creators.\n [Minion Blocking Montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmdG1HdMvsI)\n - This video alone should be enough for riot to change the game a little.\n [Huni kill on Darshan during the NA LCS 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3YG8Rmwyhk)\n - Literally had a game professional match paused because of it.\n [Time-stamped Clip from a compilation vid](https://youtu.be/8kCenqQk2j8?t=35s)\n - Jayce dies due to minion block under enemy tower.\n [Renek Minion Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=110NXVKrB1o)\n - The last clip is weak as it is just an example and probably didn&#039;t affect the game in a major way, but ALL of the others did.\n\n\n**INTERESTING POINTS**\n\n* It can be realised that a minion wave that will most likely block pathing has built up by you or your enemy team and utilised to an advantage.\n\n* Its part of the game and can be learnt to play around it.\n\n* There are already existing ways around it.\n\n* There is nothing currently viable for every champ or a broad way to get around it other than flash and ghost that is available to all champs.\n\n**SOLUTION**\nIt would be relatively easy to allow champions to push minions out of the way when they&#039;re not moving. Somewhat dissimilar to {{champion:120}}&#039;s old passive many if not all champions have the power to easily shove or push a minion out of the way. The {{champion:58}} clip for instance;\n&gt; &quot;Renekton is a terrifying, rage-fueled Ascended being from the scorched deserts of Shurima.&quot; - [League of legends Renekton Feature Page](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/renekton)\n\nHe is literally a DEMI-GOD CROCODILE THAT WAS ONCE A NATIONS GREATEST WARRIOR!!!! THAT IS NOW BEING BLOCKED BY SOME LITTLE BLUE TWIT&#039;S THAT HAVE FORMED A SEEMINGLY IMPENETRABLE DEFENSIVE LINE. Not only that but it was a traitorous act smh\n\nAll jokes aside the other clips prove my point, and the point isn&#039;t that Kruggs are a sticking point, but that on a whole, a dragon shapeshifter or an enormous dive suited &#039;man&#039; shouldn&#039;t be caught in awkward situations by ANY creep or monster. Neither should any champion and although I&#039;ve only outlined 1 way to solve the problem there are many. Riot has done a great job with changes in the past yet this issue hasn&#039;t been addressed properly or at all and I doubt this post will go anywhere but to the bottom of the pile. I actually hope it gets some sort of looking at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its Luc not Luc","date":"2018-08-23T14:16:35.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a brilliant idea that they should implement into the PBE for a while before entering it into the main game.
