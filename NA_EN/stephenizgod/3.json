I had a poppy with Warmogs and the Dragon claw or whatever and he 1 shot her with his ult. Every time he ulted one of my units died (with the exception of my Lucian which was weird...), and it was impossible to kill him because of his Gnar and Lulu which basically negated any attempt at hitting the Veig. As far as I know, not many champions are capable of just erasing a champion every few seconds, so this was pretty shocking. Even knowing he could do that, there was nothing I could have done. It was too late to spec into something that could hit him reliably (I was Noble Knight Gunslinger).  \r\n\r\nUntil it gets addressed, what are somethings I could have done here? I tried to go for Guardian at the last second because it was flooding me with Leona and Braum, but it didn't help. I guess an Aurelion or Varus would have been good if I could get a level 2? I'm not sure how to handle level 3 Veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-07-20T02:45:46.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"veiger insta kill all lower stars units so a 3 star veiger will one shot any 2 stars unit, the reason your lucian was not killed is most likely because he is 3 stars and the rest are not.\n\nalso nobles/guardians are no match to magic damage as they give armor not mr so they are hyper weak to any magic damage, and your comp was pretty heavy defense wise but garbo offense wise that veiger can ult multi times.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2019-07-20T02:52:01.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My poppy was level 3, my Darius was level 3, my Morde was level 3.

I agree with no damage, but I think even more damage wouldn't have helped. He focused heavy on defense too he just had his Veigar which was obviously destroying my team. I think long range damage would have been helpful though, like a Varus or A Sol.

Aurelion, Varus, Karthus, MF, or something like that.  It always helps to have Sorc as well, but no guarantees on that.\n\nThis is more a weakness that I've found with the hard frontwall of a Noble Knight combo; They're amazing at staying alive, but they can't make their way to tbe backline carries.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2019-07-20T02:53:53.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MISS FORTUNE!!!!
