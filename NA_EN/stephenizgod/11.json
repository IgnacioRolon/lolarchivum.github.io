The Support is not your disposable garbage, they are not expendable, they are your teammate. Too many times I die because i use my shields/heals/CC in order to peel for my team only for them to let enemies jump right on me so they can get away. Like literally just let enemies walk right past them and do nothing to help me even though i just used everything to help them.  \nIts a shitty feeling to see your 5/2/x score and my 0/6/5 score, when I got you all 5 of those kills and all 6 of my deaths are because you can&#039;t dodge a skillshot so i had to take it or I used my abilities to save you while i get attacked only for you to ditch me. Its even worse when i get &quot;Omg why are you dying so much?&quot; well because you can&#039;t protect yourself and you are a crappy teammate...  \nNotice how when we hit their support their team jumps into action to save them? Notice how they win the teamfight because you abandoned me and they didnt abandon their teammate? Why are you not seeing that?  \n\nI wanted to just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and protect myself, let my teammates die to ensure i survive, use my teammates to get away.... but I am there to Support you so that is what i try to do. If we lose you can blame me all you want, but i know that your 10 kills wouldn&#039;t be there if it wasnt for me and your deaths would be double or triple what it is...  \n\nPlease treat your support like they are part of the team.  \n\nEDIT: Ok so a lot of people are completely misunderstanding my point. I am fully expecting to die alone when i sacrifice myself. As the Support, it is my job to get the ADC fed, they can't do that when they are dead. So yes i will gladly die to save the ADC, that is not what my post is about though.  \n\nWhen in lane and the enemy Supp and ADC are focusing me, I land all my CC, but my ADC is doing nothing about it and i end up dying for free. I am part to blame for getting caught, but so is the ADC for not helping. If the ADC gets caught its my fault for not protecting them, according to them. When I use my abilities to help our front line and lock down carries but my team just runs away, this leaves me with no abilities to defend myself with.  \n\nExample: Shen is waiting for me to land a Binding, i was Morgana, and is pinging Lucian. So I get Lucian with it, his team comes to help and i land a 3 man ult with Lucian still in my Q, so i ping to go in. Im fully expecting Shen to Taunt in and for Ezreal to pick them off from behind, that is what the smart teammates would do as i had 4 out of 5 people locked down, 2 of which were carries. So i shield Shen so Lux can't bind him and wait for his taunt. Nothing happens. In fact Shen taunts over a wall to escape and Ezreal is farming minions. Of course with no way to defend myself I get killed, Ezreal retreats, and Shen GOES BACK IN AND DIES.... This didn't happen just once either, I was constantly being abandoned. Id take Lux binding for Ezreal because the Lux would wait for him to warp before throwing it and he was incapable of dodging, but id land it on Lucian and still Ezreal would do nothing.  \n\nThis happens to my far too often, I am forced into sacrificing myself for an incompetent ADC, who does nothing to help me even when it is in their best interest to do so. Not only that but most teams wont even both to use any form of CC to help me, because i am just the Support. If you watch the pros you notice that they treat every part of their team as important. Yes, the Support can be sacrificed, but it is not ideal and it does not mean you should do it. They are part of the team too and are in fact a very important part. If they have to sacrifice themselves it most likely means YOU screwed up. ","replies":[{"poster":"Troiann","date":"2016-01-26T05:32:51.249+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"It depends.

I've gone Nunu before and know what his strengths are and how he is best used (for me) as a support. It was me and Lucian against a Zilean and Tristana. My first thought was, she is going to push and Zilean is going to help, so I got my W first and was using it over and over again on Lucian. Instead of using this AS and MS boost to shoot and stop the push, he just ran around... and waited for the minion to be low enough to \"last hit\". I was about to say \"gg\" right there because Tristana got her E first and was really pushing hard, the amount of minions went to three times the amount; that's about the time where he even started hitting stuff. He even waisted a lot of mana from his Q, rather than just start with his simple E to spam his passive (which would be what I would do). Things only got worse as he would never get close to Tristana or Zilean, and I couldn't help because of that. In fact, I made things worse trying to help the guy, by trying to E Tristana... that only made her and Zilean focus me while Lucian ran back to the turret. I got labeled as a feeder at the end because they always focused me in team fights. So that leaves me with what I hate when I support:\n\n* If the enemy is not last hitting, why does my ADC think it so clever to keep last hitting?\n* If I'm being targeted, at least deal some damage to them. If at best, you could get two kills out of it, I've supported enough to know that its not hard.\n* Junglers should gank often, even if level 6 is far off, getting to level 3 should mean they have 3 abilities open. They can do a combo of some sort and damage the enemy if possible or make them fall back if the bush is warded. It may not do much, but it helps pushing, CS, and gives us a upper hand in the lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Alleo","date":"2016-01-27T02:04:57.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play ADC the thing I hate to play against the most is a zoning bot lane ie.

It's kind of like if an adc sees a fight going south, it's better for him to live and get out to be able to *insert upcoming obj or scenario here* then jump in trying to make some kind of LCS play.

The goal is the same for both summoners, get money, protect your turret, each other, then try to kill the enemies/turrets or deny them gold, in most cases. Now letting the ADC get the creeps and kills is the most efficient way to do this true, but no where and I mean no where, is there anything remotely close to \"Support is my, the ADC's, bitch and they get me fed and die because I'm an ignorant, sad af and can't wipe my own ass ADC.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, in an even well-classed match, if there is going to be a death, then supp is generally worth the least amount of gold to the other team, so the supp taking the death is still pursuing the goal.\n\nBut, if I'm supporting an ADC that is a mental midget, i tell them once or twice to be more careful, position better...yada yada, if they don't take the advice, I don't abandon them, though I do stop taking needless deaths for them. \n\nConfucius say \"L2wipeyourownass\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-01-26T05:42:04.261+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":20,"body":"Here's the order of importance.\n\nADC > Mid > Top ~ Jungle > Support. I am not disagreeing with you that the support is not just a meatshield but technically anyone is expendable for the ADC. This is why even long ranged mid mains rarely complain about no peel while ADCs complaining about no peel is everyday.\n\nThe ADC is theoretically the most important member of the team because they provide late game DPS at a safe range. There is no other champion class that can provide sustained damage so safely. They also are useless when they don't have gold so usually teams will funnel their gold into the ADC.\n\nThis is why assassinating the enemy ADC is a good strategy: you are taking out the player who is likely to have the most gold on the enemy team, and the highest priority target, all in one go. Even if you die, as long as you yourself are not an ADC, it's worth since you'll likely have less gold and be a lower priority position. \n\nThis is why Rengar and Nidalee are good: they can assassinate on a JUNGLER or TOP LANE budget rather than a MID LANER budget, allowing your mid to be reserved for things that are not easily found in the jungle or top such as ranged waveclear, poke and high damage AOE. Even if they trade 1 for 1, you are trading a jungler or top for an ADC.\n\nThis is also why Brand and Annie Support were considered good: they are an AP damage threat, but from the support position. If they nuke any non-support down in a fight, they have already made a great contribution and it doesn't matter what happens to them afterwards, because they've already taken out a higher gold position as the lowest gold position.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-01-26T06:30:47.937+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I agree with you somewhat, I know that me dying is better than my ADC dying.

Sometimes I sacrifice myself so my carries, who are on a killing spree with a high bounty tag, can get away, denying the enemy team that shutdown gold.\n\nIf enemies are stupid, I can just get them to force their important spells (like their ults or summoners) on me, and my team can just show up and get an easy win because the enemy team already have no more important spells that should've been used on my carries, not me.\n\nIn lane, and your support is in trouble? Maybe it's time to get some trades in, and save your support if still possible; he might even give you a double! And especially when the enemy botlane is focusing him, and not you, the ADC, so why are you still chickening out when you're not in danger?\n\nGetting into trouble as a support is usually an opportunity, not a waste, so quit crying. KDAs on supports don't mean much; you can't judge how good a tank and/or support is by numbers alone. If they are the ones bitching and crying about it, then that's their problem because they are missing out opportunities to turn fights around and just give up.\n\nThough here's one more thing: make sure your team is ready to fight before you even want to engage. If you can't even do that, then that's your problem. Otherwise, you should have a brain to know when or when not to go in. Supports are just as important as their teammates, but sometimes sacrificing yourself for a good cause is necessary sometimes; someone's gotta do the dirty work and clean up the streets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2016-01-28T05:02:35.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i'm sorry but if {{champion:238}} {{champion:54}} and {{champion:11}} are heading our way and you didn't notice in time, i will not hesitate to abandon you.

The example you gave sounds more like your team was kinda just dumb, not that they left you behind because you're just the support. Also how exactly did you land a 3 man ult on morgana when you can only hit two people with it? o.0\n\nAnother thing, if you watch pro games teams will regularly sacrifice the support for the greater good of the team. Can you kill their top laner and trade your support for it? WORTH. Sacrifice your support to stall while you finish baron? WORTH!

Do you read what i am writing? Majority of the comments disagreeing with me are just made up scenarios that twist what i said so it is 100% my fault, this is not the case. I didn't say I get jumped on because im not paying attention and no one saves me... I said I use all my CC, Shield, Buffs, etc. for the team to engage with but they let enemies run right by them to jump on me or run away instead of engaging leaving me with no front line and no CC to defend myself with. If i can't CC them its kind of hard to run when my teammates saved all their abilities to escape. There is such a thing as Cooldowns and when i use my abilities these \"Cooldowns\" prevent me from reusing them. If i don't have Flash up im basically a walking target, since my entire team, front line included, is already way back at the turret.  \n\nBefore you say \"Well what were you doing using your abilities when we werent ready to engage, id abandon you too if you just blew all your CC without warning.\" or \"if you didnt hit the carries than there is not point in engaging so its your fault.\" because A) when there is a teamfight and everyone is just waiting for a chance to go in, i don't necessarily need to wait for someone to tell me to go use my CC. Its fairly obvious when we will be engaging and when we are just trying to stall, and B) I normally only hit the carries, if i don't we don't go in because there is no point, so we keep looking for an opportunity until i land my CC on a high priority target. In my original post a specify that i CC and exhaust the CARRIES on the enemy team and i still get left behind even if my whole team i full hp and all there.   \n\nSo please enough with the made up hypothetical situations that are 100% my fault, because i gave actual examples in my games that happened to me. They are the reason i made the post in the first place, i was getting annoyed that it kept happening.","replies":[{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2016-01-28T23:37:49.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said people abandoning supports was becoming a bad trend, so I gave you a scenario where i have no qualms about abandoning my support.

This is not limited to supports. This happens to every single role. Playing {{champion:54}} and you ult in but your team doesn't follow. Landing an epic Mega Gnar combo but your team doesn't follow. Locking up the ADC with {{champion:254}} but your team doesn't back you up. This is not limited to supports so....what's your point? Yes it sucks that your team didn't have your back, but that doesn't mean everyone thinks supports are worthless meat shields.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-01-29T02:29:00.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not really abandoning your support though, thats your support not playing safe and dying for it. Its not your problem if they are not paying attention, that is not what my post i about though.  \n\nIf i was playing Top lane and noticing this I would be posting about that, but I am only noticing this as a Support. Its more than going in an not being followed up though. During laning phase when I am trying to trade with the enemy because my ADC is getting poked down and instead of helping or trading while i have them CC'd, they will farm or run needlessly. Leaving me with no defenses and no back-up, which usually leads to me dying. My issue is that most people think \"Well the support is expendable anyways so its ok to let them die\", my point in my post is that they are not expendable. Yes, it is better to lose the Support rather than most other people on the team, but that should be a last resort or at least with their consent. It doesn't mean they are useless and expendable, so all im saying is at least give a bit of effort to being a good teammate. If your support lands all their CC on the carries, either kill them or don't let the front line walk through all of you and watch as your support gets slaughtered. During laning phase, learn to trade WITH your support rather than using them as a decoy to avoid trading. If you want to play safe, simply say so, but sometimes people get hit by abilities and its not always the best idea to abandon your Support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
