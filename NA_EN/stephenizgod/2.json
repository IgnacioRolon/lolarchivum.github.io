I have not found a comp capable of out DPSing how many voidlings he can spawn. Then you add Yorick and Annie and there are too many targets on the field which makes it impossible to kill their actual units. Azir nukes back lines for no apparent reason even with no items. But the main issue is Malzahar, he covers the entire field within seconds and its impossible to kill them faster than he can spawn them. At least that is how it seems to me, i have tried a few different comps but nothing seems to kill them fast enough before him and Yorick swarm the field. Even if you kill their units, their spawns deal damage to you so if they have only 1 unit left you take damage as if 3-4 units were left. Which late game means 20+ hp damage for barely losing.  \r\n\r\nObviously there has to be a way of beating them that I am missing, I just can't figure it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Lee Keburn","date":"2019-11-11T22:26:39.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree Summoners is an issue.

Berserkers do pretty good if i can get Olaf but he is one of the most contested units it seems. Predators were the most success i've had but it seems once you hit level 8-9 they can't do enough damage. Electric relies on getting Lux because Ornn Voli and Zed definitely do not hold up to level 3 Malz. I have tried that one thinking the AoE would melt the summons, but it didn't do nearly enough damage.  \n\nSo far the only comp i can beat them with is Desert, Blademaster, Shadow, Cloud, Mystic. But it is so highly dependent on getting Yi 2 with good items and possibly a Cloud lux.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-11-11T22:21:00.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voli + Zed can 1 shot minions and their casters.\n\nPut Thornmail, Red Buff, and GA on Zed.
