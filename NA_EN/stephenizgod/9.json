So my problem with Rengar is his ability to jump on you from really far away and kill you in under a second. That&#039;s cool and all because he be an assassin but there is very little counter play since by the time you hit any sort of button to protect yourself, you are already dead. Again he is an assassin so this is normal, the only issue is the other assassins can be stopped by a silence. If you nail the silence BEFORE they jump on you then you done good, but if you fail you are dead, and rightly so. Rengar is hella diffent, cuz the fool can still gap close onto you even while silenced and since his AA&#039;s do a bazillion damage you are still dead before you can react. When your only form of CC is a silence (i will explain the scenario shortly) you can&#039;t stop him from killing you despite the outplays and skill. So i figure hey a silence should be able to prevent him from leaping at you...  \n\nNow for the scenario that brought this subject up: I was Malzahar (make sense now?) and i had just killed 2 people, one of which with my ult. Then here comes this Rengar and i know i can kill him as long as he doesnt kill me before i put on my E and Ignite. Well here he comes chasing me and im waiting for E to come off CD so i flash and start running. I nail him with my silence taking out a third of his life (he had no MR and i was fed) so for sure my E and Ignite plus Voidy should kill him, i throw down my W on me, turn around and hit E on him but right when i do he jumps and instantly erased me. He erased me so fast my E didnt even go off on him despite the fact i hit it before he jumped.  \n\nSo how is that fair? My skills required much more skill, timing, and placement and yet i still lost. My Q is not overly hard to land but it is harder to land on a moving target that is about to leap on your face than just left clicking on an enemy and instantly jumping on them. The Rengar absolutely did not deserve the kill, i definitely played the situation better by hitting him with my Q and readying my W below me where he would surely land.  \n\nJust to be clear i am not mad i was erased so quickly, im not mad my E didnt go off, im not mad Voidy stood there like an idiot. I am mad because i played correctly and did the only thing i could (malz only has a Silence) and timed my abilities correctly but i was defeated merely by kit design. If that was any other assassin, my Q would have won me that fight or allowed me to escape at the very least. I know not all Silences are as hard to hit as Malz&#039;s and his isnt even all that hard, but they at least take a bit more skill to properly place and time then Rengar&#039;s jump.  \n\n**EDIT**: So somehow ive been misunderstood... IM NOT ASKING TO CHANGE SILENCES TO EFFECT ALL PASSIVES! Only Rengars... why would i want it to effect everything? That is stupid. It stopping Rengar is not stupid, in the situation above i was left with no option but to die despite me being mechanically better. That to me is not a fair situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2015-10-05T18:28:30.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be like saying that Aatrox/Zac/Anivia passives should be countered by silences...taking away their revive.

I hadnt built my damage yet, all i had was Rylais' which is defensive mind you, and Liandry's which also gives a decent amount of life, i really didnt have my major damage items. Zhonya's is not a bad choice normally but i was in bot lane against a Kog and Thresh so its not really optimal as i dont want to be standing in one place for thresh to grab me, although every time he did i took out 90% of Kogs life. At this point where Reng killed me i didnt have many items and im not complaining that i died which everyone seems to think. I am complaining about a lack of counterplay for certain champions. Im merely pointing out that Rengar can only be stopped by hard CC, so a champion like Malz or Raka have no way of peeling or out playing him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-10-05T18:25:50.006+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say no one is reading your post correctly, but I'm pretty sure everyone is, \n\nThe short answer, no.

If you know that Rengar's jump is just an AA modifier then you'd understand why your request doesn't make sense. It'd be the same as if silences stopped Kalista's hopping. From the wiki:\n\n**Silence:** A unit that is silenced cannot cast abilities or activate items for the duration.\n\nMobility like Rengar's and Kalista's is not a cast ability.\n\nIn regards to your original post - You talk about it being unfair that you had no tools left to disable Rengar **after you had already used your hard CC to kill someone else**. You **did** have a tool to stop Rengar but chose to use it on someone else. Of course a glass cannon assassin is going to be able to blow up a squishy immobile mage if you don't save CC for him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valrun","date":"2015-10-05T18:41:23.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: Someone already said this, and you still don't get it.\n\n\n\nThe thing is, his passive jump isn't even a spell, it's more like an AA enhancement. \n\nAnd nobody is reading what you said wrong, we're all just taking it as you said and we're just saying we think you're wrong and this is a poor idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-05T18:43:07.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude seriously?

No one is suggesting Rengar is balanced, but trying to make it so silence effects only one passive in the entire game is a terrible design decision, regardless of who it is on.\n\nAnd a little food for thought, if the issue here is that no one understands what you are trying to say, that means you're doing a poor job of explaining it.

You can't just make a 1-off change to a champion like that.  That puts an unhealthy burden of knowledge on the players.\n\nIt's not that it isn't a good/bad change for Rengar.

BTW if that was any other assassin i would have killed them, my silence would have stopped them from jumping to me and i could have clicked E with no fear and then kited them using Voidlings as a shield. So i didn't get out played, his kit allowed him to kill me for free.\n\nIf you died, then that flash didn't get you out of range of his abilities and you need to rethink where you flashed to.\n\nAlso, If he had flash, then there wasn't much you could do in any situation.  Accept the death an move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-05T18:13:51.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">And you guessed wrong, it happens. No need to call for a Nerf, just play it better next time.\nWhy not flash into the Drag pit then? It sounds like you were close to it. Flash over the wall from where he came from? Like, there are a million things you could have done differently, and the only way to get better is to look at that a figure out what you could have done better.\nCalling for a Nerf doesn't help you get better  \n\nPlease dont judge me based on your assumptions of what happened... I was too far from Drag pit i was not quite in the Tri-Bush i was near it. I flashed over that wall next to Tri-bush, he had Mobi boots though so i knew he was going to catch me. There was nothing to do, if i flashed near red buff i would be cut off from a possible retreat and there were no wards in that area so its possible there was an enemy in there. I flashed in the direction i did because i thought i could kill him if i had an extra second for CD's but also because its possible he would give up thinking i had allies near me.   \n\n>Yup, and since you were missing a key part of those abilities, you are vulnerable. #counterplay  \n\nOk so im dead gg i should have just stood there and let him kill me. You are right and i am wrong for trying to out play him.  \n\n>If you died, then that flash didn't get you out of range of his abilities and you need to rethink where you flashed to.\n\nAlso, If he had flash, then there wasn't much you could do in any situation. Accept the death an move on.  \n\nNo it did get me out of range of his abilities... He is faster then me though so he got to the tri-bush before i could get far enough away. I also needed my Q to stop him from further casting and the flash gave me time to use it. He did not have flash actually he used it previously, but thats beyond the point, i should not just sit there and let him kill me i should try to kill him or escape. Unfortunately i died and its whatever we won and i wrecked bot lane. Everyone is just assuming im complaining but i honestly think i should be rewarded for better mechanics, if i was a mobile champ i could have won but i was an immobile champ, they are already weaker just because of that i think its fair counterplay against a highly mobile champ that me landing a silence should be rewarded.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-10-02T22:06:36.861+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, anything thats a passive will not be affected by silence, silence implys an active, rengars jump is a passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-02T22:11:47.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Which is why it should be made to be silence-able.

If Swain is silenced while in R form he is stuck in R form until the silence wears off (or he runs out of mana). Your suggestion would require an entire re-writing of silences that would make them literally on of the best soft CCs in the game then (silence an adc, now they don't have their steroids. Silence a fighter, now they dont have their passives or abilities. etc.). Additionally, that makes a soft CC that is somewhat rare hard counter multiple champions in an unintuitive and powerful way (silence Anivia, now she doesn't have her egg WHICH SHE LOSES ALL RESISTANCES AND BASE HEALTH TO HAVE EXIST. Silence Ashe/Kalista, suddenly you have a literally useless marksman for however long they are silenced. Silence Tryndamere, guess he can't crit or have the AD from Q now!). You also can't make it work specifically on one champion only as that gives a MASSIVE burden of knowledge on any player and sets precedent for such unintuitive and backwards changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-02T23:24:40.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uh no... all i said was to code Rengar's jump so he doesnt jump while silenced... im not asking to change Silences, only for Rengar so there is a possible way to counter play him.

If you know there's a rengar, why are you going near bushes when he can kill you?\n2. If he's going full damage he's squishy, stick next to someone with cc (or use your own). In your case you should have waited until he'd jumped out of the bush to flash, once he has no bush to jump from his ult is the only way for him to gap close.\n3. His ult not only gives an exclamation point, but makes a very unique noise when he's nearby during it, buy a pink, or upgrade a red trinket and you can see him coming. \n4. Grouping is rengar's biggest weakness, he can't pick off a target with 4 other champions nearby without sentencing himself to death and chancing him getting nothing out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-05T17:21:43.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK! This is why its impossible to post anything... no one reads my posts before commenting that im an idiot...  \n\nI was all alone and had just won a 2v1 as Malzahar. I was near Tri-bush in bot lane closest to Dragon. Rengar came through the bush near Krugs, i was in jump distance so i flashed before he could jump. I needed my abilities to come off CD so i could kill him before he killed me. I timed my Q so he would run into it when he entered the bush, it hit and took out about 1/3rd of his life. My E, W, and Voidling should have been able to kill him. So i threw W down on me, i knew where he would land, and hit my E but before it even went on to him he jumped and killed me instantaneously. NOW! im not mad i died so quickly im mad i out played him but it amounted to nothing, he won simply through kit design. I timed my abilities and their CD's perfectly so i could kill him but i lost because Malzahar can not stop Rengar from leaping on to him without his Ult which i did not have. Malz is immobile with low MS and no escape, his only form of CC is a Silence (not counting his ult which also suppresses him) which has no effect on Rengar.   \n\nIm not complaining about Rengar, his ability to instantly kill someone is BS but its no different then any other Assassin.
