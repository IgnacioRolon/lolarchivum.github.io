Have you tried it yet? Its pretty typical of League fans to read changes and immediately start imagining every terrible thing that can go wrong with the kit instead of what can go right. Understandable, its your favorite champ, you dont want their kit to be changed too drastically, but you need to give this kind of stuff some time before posting 50 posts complaining about it. So far from what ive read 90% of you have indicated in some way you have yet to actually play it and are just automatically assuming it is terrible and Riot balance team should be fired and also cancer on their families......  \n\nI was not happy at first with the Mordekaiser changes, i dont like damage being sacrificed for tankiness. Sure he is a big metal armor guy but i didnt want him to be a tank, i wanted damage moved from his E into his ult and mobility placed onto his W. I havent tried it yet though so i cant say whether i like these changes or not, they arnt what i thought but that doesnt mean they are bad.   \n\nIf you want your posts to be taken serious you need to actually play the champ in at least 3 games then come up with a detailed post full of actual facts about the rework on whether you like it or not. I plan to do that with the Mordekaiser changes when the PBE finally comes up for me.  \n\nBRING ON THE DOWNVOTES!!! Every downvote will be proof im telling the truth and you know it lol.  \n\n---  \n\nOk so i still havent had a chance to play Mordekaiser but i did get a chance to play Veigar. I will post my experience here.  \n\nSo at first i was a little annoyed that his Q was a skillshot, i kept forgetting and it made me miss a lot of CS lol. Then i started to figure out how to get 2 minions at once, which is extremely easy. I probably nailed 2 minions 90% of the time, it was actually really fun. It got even more fun when i started farming and poking my enemies haha. The only issues i have is how hard that pushes the lane, i was constantly at their turret because i was farming with my Q **too** well lol. Also the Q forces you out of safety for farm, you are put into a situation of Farm with Q and Take Damage or Just AA it because its too Risky. That is a pretty big problem for squishy mage like Veigar.  \n\nThe E was hilarious fun, as a Malz main, i had no issue with the Delay and it was really fun to watch them panic not knowing where to run. Most of the time i would W in a spot that forces them to either take my W, take my W and get stunned, or flash. All 3 options are a win for me haha. It was really easy to land it for me on one person, but when there is more then one it is almost impossible. Also if they have a gap closer or escape it was next to impossible to hit them, they would jut dash away and then my only form of CC was gone.   \n\nThe W was fun to use more often and the Ult wasnt all that bad with the nerf. Overall it was fun learning his Q and the lil mini game with 2 minion or 1 minion and poke. I think this rework is overall a buff, he will probably receive a few buffs after this as his burst is kind of smaller.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-02-14T01:17:53.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am completely aware of how people (myself included) post before trying changes. I can see by reading the Mordekaiser changes are good.\n\nI dont have a problem with a delay on Veigar's E, but making his Q a skill shot as well. Is worrying. He already has problems with mobility working around his W and E. His Q being a skill shot just worsens the issue and to me will make Veigar even more countered by mobility. I dont want Veigar to be a \"pick mobility now because they have Veigar\".\nI can totally see how this is compensation. Double the normal Q farm late game. But I dont find it worth it if it makes Veigar even more \"categorized\" into being a only pick of they have this group of champions. Unless they make his Q have a lot more projectile speed, I think Veigar will be kicked even more into the only counter immobile AP casters group.","replies":[{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-02-14T01:37:24.736+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 'double q farm rate' is pretty darn generous. I don't think that you are gonna get 2 low minions line up for you (with none in the middle) that often.\n\nRiot has generally made changing something from a point and click to a skillshot with some compensation (see Bola). In all honesty the way the projectile behaves will pretty much decide whether this is a buff or nerf overall","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-02-14T02:31:56.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im iffy on the morde changes waiting to try him  \n\nVeigar i feel they went the \"only imagine the good things\" route and did not look too much into the \"bad things\" that this new kit brings. Yea it hitting 2 minions can be a fantastic thing! but not only will it rarely ever give you 2 kills (not until late game but thats when he already needs to have the scaling) it will not be easy to control it. The delay on Veigars stun might not be the direction they want to be honest, his stun has very little counterplay and instant CC you cant see coming is never fun. The delay may or may not be a bad thing ill have to try it out a bit to decide, im pretty good at hitting Malz Q (since he is my mid main) which also is telegraphed and has a delay so who knows.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-02-14T06:03:44.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am actually looking forward to your thoughts on the Metal Man. \n\nLike it or Hate it, you are giving it a chance and going to give us a good read about your opinion and not treating it like facts/threats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firancil","date":"2015-02-14T03:34:52.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played them, I honestly love it, his Q use to be terrible because you needed it to stack your AP but it cost a good chunk of mana to use, but now you have good options with it and a bit of a mini game, you can set up the minions so when you q you're guaranteed 2 AP or you can set it up so you can get 1 AP and get poke on the enemy champion (Also though it wasn't said, killing champions STILL gives the +5 AP no matter how you kill them) and since it's damage doesn't fall off based on when it hits it'll deal full damage both times, at mid game and being decently farmed that's about 500+ damage per Q on 2 targets.\n\nThey also addressed his stuns poor counterplay, which I honestly agree with, now people have a split second to escape it instead of just being stunned and killed in 0.1 seconds, his ult AP ratio was a nerf, but honestly at late game you're still hitting the enemy carries for 1.5K and hitting the APC for a LOT more.\n\nHe feels a lot more fun to play in my opinion and I really hope the changes stick.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-02-14T04:07:52.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree i had a lot of fun learning to use his Q effectively, it was fun farming and poking at the same time. The hitbox is slightly funky though sometimes i hit a minion that was not actually in line to be hit and sometimes it will miss a minion that i thought for sure it would hit. Also it being a skillshot sometimes forces him into risky situations to get farm, and most of the time the risk far outweighs the reward of 1-2 minions.  \n\nThe stun i have no issues with at all. Im use to Malzahar, so hitting the stun was easy for me.  \n\nI cant wait for the Morde changes to go through, they arnt working for me.

Although he still has no meaningful gapclosers or such besides his W but thats a big maybe.

Has the members of the balancing team actually tried playing the champions they changed? Because I did, and I can say that the change to Veigar IS a nerf. It's not as big of a nerf as the people on the boards make it out to be but it's a nerf nonetheless and yet the message we got from the balance team said that it's, and I quote \"a compensation for the loss of DFG\" which means A BUFF.\nAs for the Morde change, I haven't played him but as his  role changes so will his build but that haven't happened yet and people haven't adapted to it yet, so the info PBE shows us might not be FAIR but what is seen clearly is that people do NOT want to have Morde in their team. He sucks at being a tank , yet we were promised that he'll \"probably output more sustained damage than he did currently\" implicating more damage through prolonged skirmishes yet when he builds tank items he doesn't come even close (Q cd went down by 1 so to output more sustained damage you'd have to fight for WAY LONGER than you're able to)\n\nTL;DR\nBoards are overreacting but the changes are NERFS while we were told they'd be TRADEOFFS or BUFFS, and most players didn't try the PBE but apparently neither did the designers.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-02-14T02:49:38.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So im pretty sure the Morde changes are not working right now.

Why pick the new Mordekaiser over Swain or Rumble in the AP bruiser department or over Zac, Cho'gath, Sejuani, and even Nautilus in the tank department? All Morde really had going for him  in his kit was his burst due to how badly the game has been mobility creeped.\n\nIn my opinion, his Creeping Death should have an Ally/Enemy double component which would make it more fitting with the theme overall. Allow to, on ally cast, grant the resists, aura damage, and magnet movement speed to both parties while giving it a minor slow (30%ish) and the damage over time when cast on enemies, but no double shield and thus no resists granted.\n\nWould open it up to more strategic use where Morde could use the magnet effect on an ally or minion to gain speed to /help in a chase or help an ally escape while keeping superior damage over time due to the double auras ticking over time in a team fight, while the slow gives him a small amount of team utility to assist in said chases or pressure the enemy backline more effectively which he will not be able to do with the new kit.","replies":[]}]}
