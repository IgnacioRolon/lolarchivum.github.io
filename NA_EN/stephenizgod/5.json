Just saying he creates a very unfun environment so id recommend removing him from One for All in the future.  \r\n\r\nAnd to those who are not banning him id highly recommend you start :) you can beat him but the point of One for All isnt really to win, its to have fun and he is not that fun to fight.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-20T07:44:47.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first OfA match this year was Raka vs Darius.\n\n...

This is THE problem with OfA and I don't know why people can't see it. The majority pick everyone whines about is a minor issue, and in fact, majority pick is almost a necessary evil to minimize the damage. SO WHAT if you FINALLY get the champ you wanted after 10 games? Won't matter if everyone else in your team DOESN'T want it, and decides to ruin it for you hardcore. Or even if they don't try to ruin it, they suck at the champ, feed early as a result, and ultimately have a horrible time so that YOU can \"get what you want\" but not really.\n\nOfA right now is all about 1 to 4 players suffering so that 1 to 4 players can have their say, and ultimately, it ends up wrecking it for everybody, regardless of who wins what vote.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-10-20T21:42:41.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't care about sucking at the champ, there are champs i cant play all that well so i dont really expect everyone to be amazing.

There are several games where either a) players don't know what they're doing, and basically let everyone know they're not having fun, or b) players don't know what they're doing, but refuse to realize that, and will use their ignorance as an excuse to rage about picks.\n\nA few games ago I got Lee Sin. I didn't vote for Lee Sin, don't play Lee Sin, and don't care to, but I still enjoyed it... ... except when I had to here some random dude go \"Oh my gosh, who's idea was it to pick Lee Sin?\", because we were, shocker, having trouble against Heimer. There's only so many face-palm poses I have in my repertoire, and not enough time in the 10 seconds after that comment to use all of them before going back to pwning Heimer (I know how to counterbuild. It wasn't that hard, for me at least, to deal with him.) Really? \"Why pick Lee Sin?\" Is that even in question?\n\nI can have a lot more fun when I know that a) my allies are having fun, and b) if they're not, they won't use that as an excuse to make the dumbest illogical assessments of why the game is playing out the way it is. I want teambuild so that the people who want to, Step 1) Pick Darius, Step 2) Pick Darius again, and then Step 3) Pick Darius can do w/e the heck they please without making people who like variety suffer through the monotony.

Yes you are going to win with Lux any noob can spam spells and hers have the potential to either do a lot of damage or lead to a lot of damage and possibly a kill.

Also, you DO have a good idea of when he's going to be picked unless you can't catch on. People think he's op and an easy win, so any time he's not banned he's usually picked. Just fucking play Gnar.
