The moment you take on the &quot;open mid&quot; attitude YOU ARE THE REASON WE LOST. Not the kill difference, not the gold difference, not the objectives, etc because we haven&#039;t lost yet and throws CAN and often DO happen (specifically at Low ELO which is why I brought it up at the beginning). Once you open mid, that is when we actually lose and it is 100% your fault at that point. If your team says no to &quot;open mid&quot; you need to keep playing, the same way you need to keep playing if the Surrender vote fails.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think it needs to be a separate Report option is because it can be hard to detect I feel. Even if they say in chat &quot;open mid&quot; it may not be obvious that they aren&#039;t trying to win. They may go up 30-40 CS or get a kill or two, but at the end of that day when the enemy wants to take our Nexus the will have made no moves to stop them. It is a bit different than feeding or AFKing, as they tend to continue playing just not in a manner that helps you win.   \r\nThere is a &quot;Giving up&quot; option but like I said it can be hard to tell when someone is actually giving up, so I think &quot;Open Mid&quot; should be added to that or it should be its own option.  \r\n\r\nPlease don&#039;t give me reasons or explanations for why &quot;open mid&quot; is valid because its irrelevant to my post. I specified that I am talking about 1 or 2 individuals on the team who have taken on this attitude when the rest of the team wants to keep trying. &quot;Open Mid&quot; is something the whole team needs to agree on, because if not everyone does agree and you do it anyways, at that point you are intentionally losing the game. There are times when I have agreed to &quot;Open Mid&quot; because the game was over before 20 minutes, but these are super rare and almost always complete stomps where the enemy would have won in the next 5 minutes anyways.  \r\n\r\nA little backstory here for why I bring this up, in the last 6 ranked games I played yesterday, 3 people wanted to &quot;Open Mid&quot; and they basically stopped trying to win ( 1 in one game and 2 in another). I won the first time, my team did not want to &quot;Open Mid&quot; with this person and we let them do their thing while we won the game. The second time however there were 2 people who stopped trying, one of them was our most fed carry. Nothing we could do at that point but lose. It is just frustrating because if these people had tried we possibly could have won. I don&#039;t particularly care about losing if we just plain and simple got outplayed and beat, but when my team is the reason we lose it is pretty frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-01-07T22:25:28.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you look at the descriptions of the reports categories. \"Unsportsmanlike conduct\" covers \"giving up\"","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2017-01-07T23:49:06.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I mean is \"Open Mid\" should be an option everyone is aware of, so they know that if they say and do this they can be banned.

Same goes for AFK jungle farming.\n\nThat being said, people whom consistently AFK as a method to give up are punished with a 14-day ban (and probably leaver buster's low priority queue).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-01-07T19:05:41.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, open mid became a thing because of Korea to my understanding\nWhere as it serves no real benefit of the losing team, I can see it becoming a problem.\nI believe reporting under one of the current options will meet your needs.

Here it only serves the purpose of wanting to end a game that is 100% lost. However it is used far too much and it is starting to irritate me. It tilts the living hell out of me when my team stops trying, I figure if people know that \"open mid\" is a reportable offense they will be less likely to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-07T21:04:38.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"They got first blood, gg open mid\"\n\"Top got killed 1v1, gg open mid\"\n\"They got a fire dragon, gg open mid\"\n\"Jungler started topside, gg open mid\"\n\"We have an Aatrox, gg open mid\"\n\"We have a Yasuo, gg open mid\"\n\"They have a Yasuo, gg open mid\"\n\"Support warded outside bush, gg open mid\"\n\"ADC missed a cannon minion, gg open mid\"\n\"Today is Tuesday, gg open mid\"","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2017-01-07T22:00:14.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't take some of those seriously, but I have seen some of those and people legit stop trying.
