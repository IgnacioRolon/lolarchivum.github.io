When I first started talking about reverting him he was still sort of new (maybe half a year after) and i got a lot of backlash. I figured people assumed he was fine as is.**  \n\n*Also a lot of people talk about his Ultimate but clearly don't understand how Suppression works. Take Cleanse or buy QSS against anyone with hard CC and you are a good smart player, but take it against Malzahar its because he is a bullshit champ.... like how is his R any different than the other hard CC in the game? because its longer? Ye it also locks him into place and he is a squishy champion. The damage was never insta-burst levels and this was during a time when resistances were actually useful too. Your memories of being insta-bursted by Malzahar tend to leave out the 7+ kills and 4 items he probably had. He was an ambush-**assassin** meaning if you walked into his area without vision or teammates you were dead. No different than any other assassin except his took place over 2.5 seconds instead of half a second. Never forget Malzahar used to be an **ASSASSIN**. *\n\nHopefully we can get a Rioter in on this to clarify if they have any plans for Malzahar.\n\nJust going to say: I understand that this is probably going to get downvotes, but idc\n\nI miss old Malzahar. I miss playing around his old Passive, his new Passive was busted on release but now is just a slight annoyance. There isn't really any playing around it; is it up? Ok be aggressive. Its down? stay near turret and wait while E and Voidlings push mindlessly.  \n\nHis major weaknesses to high mobile champs was never addressed in his rework, instead he is largely untouched as far as his weakness go, you just overloaded one of his strengths (pushing) but then had to nerf it because it was too strong.  \n\nI think one of the goals was to make him a minion master, but other than spawning them he doesn't really do anything else. Yorick feels more like how Malz should have been, which is probably why i switched from Malz to Yorick. At least old Malzahar you had to plan around your Passive to make them appear, that required actual thought to spawn 3 Voidlings.\n\nMalzahar was part of the mage rework, but i think he really needed his own separate VGU. His Suppression is controversial, core to his kit but feels bad to play against. This alone requires a ton of work on how to keep that lock-down identity while fixing the negativity surrounding Suppression.  \n\nThis doesn't really have anything to do with disliking change btw. I loved Old Yorick, despite how crap he was, but i love New Yorick even more. Same for Xerath.\n\nSure Malzahar is in a decent spot right now, but honestly he is no fun to play as or against imo. I really enjoyed playing old Malzahar, he was the first champion I played that I felt I was decent at. He was the champion that made me want to play Ranked, and basically sucked me into the game.\n","replies":[{"poster":"FilDaFunk","date":"2018-08-04T21:27:24.737+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unpopular Opinion: This is a popular opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-08-04T22:40:04.504+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Popular opinion: this is a popular opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-08-04T22:44:50.304+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Opinion: this is an opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-08-04T23:29:39.214+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Popular opinion: Onion is White Diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-08-05T00:12:49.894+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unpopular opinion: Pearl is White Pearl.","replies":[{"poster":"KÎŢŢΥKÂŢKÂŢÂRÎÑÂ","date":"2018-08-05T05:09:44.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unpopular opinion: opinion does not rhyme with onion","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-08-05T00:47:32.447+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That kinda makes sense for the gem position on her front face.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KoreanEzMode","date":"2018-08-04T18:08:52.017+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"I preferred old malz","replies":[{"poster":"Recon1212","date":"2018-08-04T22:08:26.180+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can't say I enjoyed being walked at and getting R'd under tower, I do think reverting him and working on numbers with the old kit would be better than whatever the fuck he is right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2018-08-04T20:31:38.143+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%.

Emphasis on \"if\"\n\n---\n\nWhat I do have an issue with is that Malzahar is no longer as free as he used to be.\n\nBack before the pre-rework, you could go AP or AD because your kit allowed you to focus on either your spell damage or your voidling damage.\n\nHe used to be able to cast his spells wherever the fuck he wants unlike now where pool is fixated on R simply because Riot and community believed that Null Zone's sole purpose in life was to be used in conjunction with Nether Grasp.\n\nHe used to be able to play the lane how he wanted to. Yes he could play passive, but he could also play aggressively if the player wanted to. Now every time someone asks \"How do I do well on Malzahar?,\" every single piece of advice always starts with \"Well... You gotta play like a bitch...\"\n\nAlso not a fan of mandatory resetting of E to deal damage because it -forces- you to focus on one target whereas before you could throw your spells in all directions and still deal a decent amount of damage (i.e. Null Zone the enemy front line, Q & R on the Zed diving your ADC)\n\nNot to mention resetting mechanic encourages spamming abilities rather than careful usage of your abilities due to longer cooldowns...\n\nEssentiallly, I miss Malzahar when you could -choose- what variation of items you wanted to build or play however the fuck you wanted because you could.\"\n\nFrom my reddit post because I gotta get to work :/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-08-05T17:38:42.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the worst part about his rework, and something that was obvious from just reading the kit's design, was that they completely removed the malzahar player's agency. \nThey forced players into a particular pattern of spell usage, they shifted a significant amount of his damage to voidlings (after removing player targeting controls), and they made it so that his early game wave clear was dependent on the enemy's ability to play around you rather than your ability to properly set up the minion wave.
