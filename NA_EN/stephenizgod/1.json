It has actually cost me a few kills where i would have killed them if i could see them. Im basically tethered to them so it doesnt really make much sense why it shouldnt allow him to see them. Even if its only him gaining sight, it should still do it. Its a problem i have had for awhile i just keep forgetting to post about it haha. Just to be clear this is really only a problem because people have an instant to flash or dash before they are actually suppressed, so if they make it over a wall, around a corner, or into a bush i lose sight of them.   \n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-20T04:51:57.686+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good suggestion, we'll try that out.","replies":[{"poster":"Carry","date":"2015-03-20T15:00:44.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":35,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rNXbAtXX,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-20T04:51:57.686+0000)\n>\n> Good suggestion, we'll try that out.\n\ni've got a better suggestion for u to try out. don't buff cancer champs with 55% winrates and zero mechanics. heimer, malz, swain, sion, mumu, sej all need nerfs. srsly don't buff any of them.","replies":[{"poster":"WeFlyNoLie","date":"2015-03-20T17:11:00.253+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being toxic will only get you downvotes.","replies":[{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2015-03-20T17:47:55.116+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"he is somewhat right, although for the wrong reasons\n\nIf Malz gets buffed, he could become FotM \n\nWhich subsequently means he'll be kneecapped a patch later \n\nI don't want my main kneecapped \n;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-03-20T22:37:25.196+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is somewhat wrong and also entirely wrong.

If you make it over a wall, into a bush, or around a corner that cuts off vision, Malzahar will lose sight of you.

His kit is to melt someone in a 1v1 early mid game, late game he is meant to catch someone out or lock down someone in a teamfight so your team can kill the others.
