Good for you, you are quitting... fine... quit. Talking about how you are going to be better for it and all this crap, i say bs you will be playing again in like a week, but whatever. Honestly its ridiculous, you need to wait 2-3 weeks tops for the game to be balanced to a state of normalcy. You don't like the changes? Thats fine and i respect that but don't come to the boards and post about how you are quitting because no one cares, also i can see that you are still playing... Its even funnier when someone is using a smurf so you can't tell if they are still playing lol.   \n\n90% of you are not quitting, the 10% that are quitting are probably just done with the game and that is fine, but please do us all a favor and just quit. Riot isn't going to notice and for every 1 person that quits 20 more join. Sooo you are not proving anything specially since its only been 1 patch and the game isn't even close to where its going to be in a few weeks.  \n\nTo those quitting, good bye now stop posting about it.  \n\nIncoming Down Votes  \n\n**EDIT**: Well its been awhile and I've noticed something, a lot of people are calling me a hypocrite. Yes my post is indeed a complain post complaining about complainers, i see that, i knew it when i made it. Still though a lot of you are telling me my post is worthless, i shouldn't have posted, i can't silence others so should stop posting, etc. All of those statements are themselves hypocritical which makes you a hypocrite as well lol. Just like I can't silence these posts i dislike, you can not silence me. So before you comment \"this post is hypocritical\" just remember 20 people before you have already said that lol. Anyways thanks for reading and leave a comment, positive or negative doesn't really matter.  \n\n**EDIT 2**:  \n#*Hawkefire (NA)  - about an hour ago*\n  >Stephenizgod (NA) - about 4 hours ago: \"Wth lol how do you not see this... I am asking them to stop posting\"\n---\n>***Hawkefire (NA): \"EXACTLY. Stop telling them to do that. You can disagree with someone, but don't tell them to simply shut up because you disagree with them.\"***  \n\nI mean do you guys not see the contradiction in your arguments? In the same comment he tells me to stop because he disagrees with me, but then says you cant tell someone to stop because you disagree with them... Im  legit baffled. Are you guys understanding my pot calling the kettle black comments now? It can not be any clearer than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Gharris","date":"2015-11-19T23:55:26.980+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":17,"body":"My Jungle Bard game has never been stronger.

I expect that for the first week or so, but not at this point.\n\nThere are some updates/changes that actually make me wonder if they even bothered to take the time to test it. The Juggernaut update made a handful of champions to do a pretty stupid amount of damage with insane survivability (Garren, Darius, Mord). When you see updates like that and the most recent pre-season changes to ADC's like you mentioned, how can you not see that they are pretty overpowered?  I'm not sure if this falls on the Riot Teams for not testing it enough before throwing it on the PBE or a lack of PBE players really noticing them.  \n\nRegardless, over time iv seen riot heavy nerf/buff people in the past. Now they seem to do very small nerfs/buffs each patch so the change of being broken or too nerfed isn't likely. Its odd how it goes from small tip toes of > Example: Zeds AD on Q was looking too strong.   40-55-66-70 to 42-57-68-73. To huge buffs to the ADC's and how much Crit AD's are getting at such a fast pace.\n\n\n When playing Ranked you practically have to ban whatever is currently broken, rather then trying to ban out a potential popular team comps or counters.
