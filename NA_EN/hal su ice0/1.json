A Feminist Speaks Out","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":7,"down_votes":218,"body":"Edit II: At the present moment, the poll is in shambles and I believe this to be due to the length of my post. People are just coming in and voting in the poll immediately without reading through the post, so please don't pay heed to the poll numbers. I believe that any sensible person who reads through all of the examples I have given in my post will agree that Riot has shown a pattern of sexism in its champion and skin design. Please read before voting.\n\nEdit I: A lot of people have taken this post to mean that it is appropriate to attack me with slurs and insults to my intelligence - this is not the case. Be warned that the moderation team is now watching this thread like hawks.\n\nHello everyone. It has come to my attention while I was browsing the 5.9 patch notes earlier that there is a new skin theme, the SSW Skin Theme, that gives five champions a nice new skin, sponsored by our favourite electronics company. Unfortunately, the percentage of these skins that are going to male champions is 100%, and the corresponding percentage for female champions is 0%. This demonstration of inequality in Riot Gaming&#039;s treatment of its male and female champions is inappropriate and sexist, and for me, it is the final \"straw that broke the feminist&#039;s back\", so to speak.\n\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen male champions getting the \"long end of the stick\", so to speak, within League of Legends. Did you know that the ratio of male champions to female champions is 124 to 82? Did you know that the total number of male skins in the game is 41% higher than the number of female skins? Can you believe that in addition to these telltale statistics, a vast majority of the female skins and champions are sexualized for the straight man&#039;s* viewing pleasure? \n\nBut wait, that&#039;s not all! Did you know that during the world cup last year, the login screen featured seven male champions sporting their World Cup skin themes, and zero women? And did you know that out of the six champions that received skins in the Chroma debut, only one was female? It is clear that at the Riot Headquarters, the representation of women in their game, as well as the idea of womens&#039; sports, are just laughing matters.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, in order to \"vote with my dollar\", so to speak, I will be girlcotting all Samsung and League of Legends products, sending a letter of dissatisfaction to Samsung, and amending my F rating for Riot Gaming on the Better Business Bureau&#039;s website to include this latest offense. I urge all feminists to do the same so that we can send a clear message that this pattern of male favouritism is not tolerated outside of Riot&#039;s Headquarters.\n\n*also included within my use of this term are all other groups of people who find viewing pleasure in the sexualization of female champions","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-14T17:11:11.831+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hiya,\n\nJust wanted to jump in here and explain the decision making behind the SSW Championship skins. \n\nEach one of these skins honors a player of Team Samsung White, the winners of the 2014 League of Legends World Championship.

Of course you don't. \n\nIn the final against Star Horn Royal Club he played - Jayce, TALON, Fizz, Orianna. \n\nIt was a decision between Jayce and Talon and they chose Talon. He DID play Talon in the playoffs. He played it in the CHAMPION match. Aside from Orianna (WHICH THEY ALREADY HAVE A CHAMPIONSHIP SKIN FOR SO THEY ARE NOT BEING SEXIST) the options were ALL male. \n\nThe skins were chosen for champions that the players were KNOWN for or AMAZING on.\n\nFOR THE 1,000TH TIME AND I WILL KEEP COMING HERE TO PROVE TO YOU WHAT YOU CONTINUALLY DENY....you are wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Hal Su Ice0","date":"2015-05-14T17:36:21.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":28,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ArchAngel415,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=kEBBiWNj,comment-id=002100010000,timestamp=2015-05-14T17:31:03.291+0000)\n>\n>\n>x\n\nAs stated on the official article, \"Pawn didn't play a ton of Talon at Worlds 2014\", but he was still given the skin.

You spout off about things you have no idea about and then make a complete ass of yourself on as grand a stage as you possibly can find. You literally do more damage to the cause you're trying to champion than you do good.\n\nBeing that there are more male champions than female champions it only makes sense that the number of skins for male champions is higher. The skins that you're on about being all male are skins that were chosen by the players of Samsung White that they felt were most key to their victory at season 4 worlds, so of course you weren't polled on the skins. Go win worlds and you can select your own skin for whichever female champion you want.\n\nNot only do I disagree with your statement that almost all skins for female champions are massively oversexualized, frankly it is entirely unfounded. I personally believe that I could walk out onto the street and find at least 20 examples of female dress in reality that are easily more sexualized than 95% of the skins you'd find on this game. So frankly I feel that the skins are no worse than what women wear in reality.\n\nFurthermore anyone with have a bit of common sense could tell you that you have far better sales volume when things are more appealing to look at. That goes for both male and female products in game and in reality. That's just the way that marketing works and I can guarantee that it works on you just as much as it works on us men.\n\nFrankly I'm not sure why I'm even taking the bait and posting on this as it's clear from your previous responses that you're just looking for an argument that you can then take to tumblr or reddit or wherever. Cut only the parts out that would support your case, and get the rest of the \"feminists\" like yourself, and mind you I'm using the term very loosely, to throw up a fit of rage and accuse every man in the world of metaphorically raping you because we have male sex organs. People like you who claim to be after gender equality actually boil down to not looking for equality, but rather for payback and revenge.\n\nYou bastardize your own cause for little more than attention and frankly it's just downright shameful because there is true gender inequality that exists in the world, but instead of spotlighting that, you find the most insignificant thing and turn your own cause into a complete joke.\n\nI really and truly hope that you find a better way to go about this kind of thing, because if your type is the face of the feminist movement, you won't be getting anywhere.\n\nEdit: Furthermore if you're going to do a boycott, do a proper boycott.

Just because I am a woman and a feminist does not mean that I should be restricted to talking about feminist problems in other countries wherever I go. I am human just like you and I play this game just like you do, and if I want to make a thread about a feminist issue closer to home then I am free to do so. \n\nAnd this **is** a feminist issue, no matter how insignificant it may seem when juxtaposed with other feminist issues around the world. It's a feminist issue because there are twice the male champions in this game than there are female champions. That's a fact. There are roughly twice the male skins than there are female skins, and even though that's based on the sexism with champion genders, that doesn't magically make it not sexist.\n\nAs for sexualization, yes you could go down to a Las Vegas street corner and find women dressed like this, but for one thing this is supposed to be a battlefield, which is why most male champions aren't wearing t-shirts, and for another thing most women don't have the breast sizes that we are seeing in this game on 90% of the female champions. Also, we don't see platemail with penis bulges like we are seeing plate male with breast bulges, that is another manifestation of the sexualization of female champions.

Just because I am a woman and a feminist does not mean that I should be restricted to talking about feminist problems in other countries wherever I go. I am human just like you and I play this game just like you do, and if I want to make a thread about a feminist issue closer to home then I am free to do so. \n> \n> And this **is** a feminist issue, no matter how insignificant it may seem when juxtaposed with other feminist issues around the world. It's a feminist issue because there are twice the male champions in this game than there are female champions. That's a fact. There are roughly twice the male skins than there are female skins, and even though that's based on the sexism with champion genders, that doesn't magically make it not sexist.\n> \n> As for sexualization, yes you could go down to a Las Vegas street corner and find women dressed like this, but for one thing this is supposed to be a battlefield, which is why most male champions aren't wearing t-shirts, and for another thing most women don't have the breast sizes that we are seeing in this game on 90% of the female champions. Also, we don't see platemail with penis bulges like we are seeing plate male with breast bulges, that is another manifestation of the sexualization of female champions.
