The Augment chests alone are actually 295 RP, all ready to be opened as if you bought a key already with it. \n\nSo the Augment chest is already 95 RP Cheaper than buying 2 hextech chests with keys and your trying to say 10 project cores = 1 gemstone...?\n\nProject cores are worth **at most** 250 RP for 7 of them. And that's only using a very loose comparison to buying a summoner Icon, because you actually have to still buy Another item from the market just to combine said item with the 7 project cores to get one of the 3 summoner icons (That item is about 75 RP or 750 IP).\n\nNow, I want you to realize that people have easily spent over 15000 RP or  $100 on Hextech chests, just to pull only 1 or 2 gemstones.\nThat's about 85 Hextech chests, for only 2 gemstones. You need 10 to make anything useful. So if we use that figure, that's about $500 for 10 gemstones. That's not even guaranteed gemstones by the way, but that's what chance tells us we'd have to buy to land 10 of them so far.\nAnyway, thats about $50 per one Gemstone or 7500 RP.\nCompared to the project cores that were basically free in the augment chests but were worth about 25 RP each. (250 -75 = **175 RP value of 7 Project cores**)\n\nIn other words... A project core isn't worth anything. Realistically, 300 Project cores = One gemstone. and that is being very generous to the project cores...","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yucko","date":"2016-08-08T01:09:57.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I see what you mean.... \n\nHowever i wish i could do something else with them other than just get Essence.

But the 25 RP for Core was me being extremely generous towards the project cores worth. Even getting 1 RP per 5 or so cores would be reasonable considering how much free junk those chests give you.
