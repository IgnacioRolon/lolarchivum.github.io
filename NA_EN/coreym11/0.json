His whole kit covers up all his flaws. He's melee BUT he has 2 sheilds, 1 part of his passive and one an ability to block all projectiles. Have fun poking that down. Trying to slow him? Sorry, you really can't if hes in a minion wave it doesn't matter he will just dash around instead of running. So this champion must not have any harass in lane? Wrong again he has a 2 seconds Q and on the 3rd hit it throws a tornado that goes half way across the lane and crit. Ok, best thing I can do is hide under tower and farm cs? Nope, his ultimate takes him out of tower range and shreds your armor. To add on top of this he also gets double crit chance and hes practically an early and late game adc. He doesn't really fall off, he only gets stronger as the game goes on. Since he is melee, he gains base armor and magic resist throughout the game on top of that. Oh almost forgot he has no mana!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nIf this champion's kit is balanced, it must be ok for them to give my immobile adc dashes, a GA passive that prevents me from getting assassinated, and on top of that double my attack range.\n\nA yasuo player must not face any hardships in lane. No wonder when a yasuo main plays any other character and gets bullied they afk.\n\nNothings going to be changed about Yasuo, but this champion really is disgusting and a balancing nightmare.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-07-13T00:14:36.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His ultimate only takes him out of tower range if you're standing on the edge of tower range. It doesn't teleport you somewhere else, it just puts him on the side of you that is out of tower range if possible. If you're hugging the tower, that's not possible. \n\nYasuo's weaknesses are that his whole kit is telegraphed and avoidable, and he must push the wave constantly. \n\nYou know when he has his tornado, so you can be ready to sidestep. You know when he has a shield available, and you can take that shield away with one autoattack. His dashes move him a set distance, and he can't dash mid-dash, so his endpoint is predictable. His Windwall has one of the longest non-ultimate cooldowns in the game. If you can bait it with a spell, you're spell will be back before he gets another Windwall. Once it's out, you can simply walk through it or around it and not be hindered anymore. He doesn't have an ult if you can avoid the tornado. \n\nHis dashes damage the minion wave. He needs to hit stuff with Q to build up the tornado, which is his only form of ranged damage. You are free to hit him with autos and spells to pop his shield and get his health low, and the wave will naturally push to you, setting him up for an easy freeze. \n\nYasuo is a skill check champion. He tests your ability to manage the wave, manage cooldowns, poke while farming, and avoid skillshots. If you fail the test, you feed Yasuo.","replies":[{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2019-07-13T00:25:07.791+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> and he must push the wave constantly.\n\nThis is kinda the issue.

If he's ever a little stronger than \"sort of viable/balanced,\" he'll get a nerf.\n\nKeep in mind he currently has a pretty critical bug where W sometimes won't start blocking projectiles until it's fully formed, so he's extra-weak right now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2019-07-13T04:53:36.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember the days when I crush Yasuo's with Veigar and Poppy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Sutpid Idot","date":"2019-07-13T00:01:35.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny thing is yasuo on release was fucking awful.","replies":[]}]}
