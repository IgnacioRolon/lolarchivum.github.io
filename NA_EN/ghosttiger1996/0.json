Let’s say she pre stacked it. \n\nThat’s still 5 auto attacks, on a single target before it makes any difference. \n\n5 auto attacks from a\nShort ranged, squishy champion that dies instantly is someone sneezes next to her.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-15T19:15:17.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Ragna said, Vayne's ult makes her invisible.

And again. 5 attacks for the items passive to matter. In a meta where a fart kills people.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-15T19:26:28.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is more than enough.

Nor does it change the fact that she needs 5+ auto attacks to get this done. Assuming she gets an invis on each auto (she doesn’t) that’s 5 different opportunities for you to instant kill her.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-08-15T17:04:10.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Applying a extra silver bolt proc regardless of it being either 1st 2nd or 3rd is strong.
