You do NOT have to play as Kayn to complete these missions. \n\nI was in an ARAM as Ivern and I had a Kayn on my team. We lost the game and my mission did not immediately reflect playing a game as, with, or against Kayn. I logged out and back in a few hours later and it shows as I have 1/5 of Darkin Path. \n\nJust now I was in an ARAM as Teemo - no Kayn on either team. I got a killing spree but my mission does not show that part completed. I will edit if it shows up later. You may need a Kayn on either team to get credit for all missions? Would suck if you have to play AS him to finish the win/kill parts. I really hope I don't have to buy a champion just to do this...","replies":[{"poster":"ZefZero","date":"2017-08-12T18:46:30.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the 1st part of each mission may be completed by not playing AS Kayn. And yes, there still has to be a Kayn on one of the teams.\n\nAs far as other missions go, does it really surprise anyone that Riot would make certain missions have a champion specific requirement as well as a short completion window thereby \"forcing\" you to spend RP to get said champion? It just seems like a normal business model to me.\n\nI mean, how else is Riot supposed to make money?! /s","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T20:26:35.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It can be missed pretty easily, but those missions need to be completed *while playing as Kayn* in each form. \n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/23a8f76325f980ca71f2eda34b596a8d.png","replies":[{"poster":"ZefZero","date":"2017-08-07T23:42:13.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not necessarily true. Read the WHOLE sentence that you marked. It says \"except where noted\". Even in the 1st part of each section it says to play \"as, WITH, or AGAINST\" each form.
