I'm wondering if Malz is getting any auto attack animation changes. His aa on live feels terrible and it's really apparently how bad it feels when you play a newer mage(like Lissandra or Syndra) and then go back to Malz. It's slow and overly clunky. If it gets changed to something more fluid and responsive that would be a malz main's wet dream.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Kayn","date":"2016-04-20T17:14:36.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty rito","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Karma Deified","date":"2016-04-19T20:42:13.801+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The voidlings won't be baby Kha'Zix anymore?
