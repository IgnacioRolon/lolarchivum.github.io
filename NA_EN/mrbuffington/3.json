Basically, if you've ever had this feeling:\r\n\r\nhttp://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/482/template.jpg\r\n\r\nI want you to post that moment in the comments, and we can all laugh at ourselves together :D\r\n\r\nHere's ~~one~~ two of mine: When I first started playing {{champion:1}}, I didn't know that Tibbers actually did damage *on cast*, so I would summon Tibbers whenever he was off cooldown at any random spot on the map and basically have a super minion that followed me around. (I also didn't realize Annie had a passive).\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"sync2","date":"2014-07-15T07:31:29.744+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That time I tried to kill the second turret without realizing I can't hit it while the first one is still up Ah, the memories.","replies":[{"poster":"MarhsallLee67","date":"2014-07-15T20:35:05.635+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not too long before I hit level 30, there was a TF on the enemy team who ulted into our base and promptly died to the nexus turrets because he thought he could kill the nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-15T14:18:15.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha, and wondering why I can't just kill the inhib since I chased a person all the way into their base? ahaha, good times","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2014-07-15T21:03:17.039+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I build whatever looked the best for the first few games...","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-15T23:51:22.689+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought Trinity Force was the best item in the game so I would build 2-3 of them every game.
