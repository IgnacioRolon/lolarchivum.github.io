I'm looking to pick up Kog'Maw, and I noticed that Kog'Maw's little snot-craters aren't exactly the same diameter as the hitbox. I think this could help newer Kog'Maw players land their ults, though I'm worried it may make them too easy to dodge (maybe if the indicator was only visible to the allied team)?\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-07-16T04:52:26.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spot on! We should do this, and I feel we should definitely show them to the enemy (kind of like Xerath ult). Yes, this will make them easier to dodge, but the play shouldn't be \"I hit this because my enemy had no idea how big the AoE was\"--it should be \"I put this in his path forcing him to walk into it\" or \"I anticipated his movement and hit it\".","replies":[{"poster":"Privet","date":"2014-07-16T05:28:07.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please no more indicators :( \n\nWhy not change the visual cue to better represent the damage impact?

Using Kog'Maw's ult isn't about aiming, it's about outsmarting the enemy. You aim at where they are if they're trying to CS. They  either move and miss it or get the CS but take damage. Or you aim it where you think they're going so they run into it. If you give it a range indicator then you should give it a shorter delay before it lands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-16T13:42:14.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! I was curious how you think this may affect his play. For me, Gragas' Q can now be used as a zoning tool or for damage, but the latter is more if I detonate upon arrival (double tap Q), so my opponent has less time to react. For Kog'Maw (and Karthus), there's a bit of an animation before the spell actually hits, so it's a bit more difficult to land. Have you or anyone else at Riot noticed any differences in Karthus since his VU? Thanks again!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-16T13:09:52.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yes, this will make them easier to dodge.\n\nI'll add on here that this isn't a bad thing!\n\nLet's take a hypothetical situation where, because of the indicator, kog hits enemies 50% less. Kog just got a big nerf. All this means is that now Riot can safely give kog a buff (ie, larger aoe on ult) to bring him up to his former power level.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-16T13:39:26.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually was about to ask if range indicators warrant a buff, since it technically is only supposed to provide information, but they can harm the champion. For example with old Karthus, all you may know about his Q is that the AoE is larger than the actual animation, so either you get hit when it doesn't look like you should have, or you realize it's larger and are zoned way out of the area.\n\nOn the other hand, this could also be a good zoning tool. Playing Gragas support, I can shove my opponents way off the minion wave by threatening with barrel. I think a small buff in the form of CDR or mana cost reduction could accompany Kog if this is the case, but it may not be necessary to hit a larger buff, like damage increase or larger AoE (though that would be nice).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Privet","date":"2014-07-16T02:25:35.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AoE indicators are annoying and look out of place.
