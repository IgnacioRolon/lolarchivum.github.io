The message on the top of the screen pops up saying attempting to reconnect. Then I'm dead. IDK what is happening because I'm at a constant 90 ping but the game just attempts to reconnect every 5 minutes and disconnects me. It is really annoying, should I reinstall the game? Or is it my pc? Or my router? Any way to fix this? Need help, please.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T17:28:04.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that despite your ping, your network is unstable and kicking you off the game server.
