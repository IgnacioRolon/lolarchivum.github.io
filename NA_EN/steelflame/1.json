But a few of the new items/reworked items are looking very scary in the hands of our old favorite toplane menance, {{champion:92}} Riven (And other AD assassins won&#039;t be sad with this build either).\n\nDeath&#039;s Dance\n3400 Gold\n+64 Attack Damage\n+10% Cooldown Reduction\nUNIQUE Passive: Dealing physical damage heals for 12% of the damage dealt. (33% effectiveness for multi-target effects.)\nUNIQUE Passive: 20% of damage taken is dealt as a Bleed effect over 5 seconds instead.\n\nMaw of Malmortius\nTotal cost increased to 3250 from 3200\nRecipe now: Hexdrinker + Serrated Dirk + 850g\nAD lowered to 55 from 60\nMR increased to 50 from 40\nNow grants 10 armor pen\nLifeline&#039;s shield now 300 + 1 per bonus MR  from 400\nBonus AD based on missing HP removed\nNew Unique Passive - Lifegrip - When Lifeline triggers, gain +25% Attack Speed, +10% Spell Vamp, and 10% Life Steal until out of combat.\n\nYoumuu&#039;s Ghostblade\nTotal cost increased to 3200g from 2700g\nRecipe changed to include Serrated Dirk + Caulfield&#039;s Warhammer + 1000 gold.\nAttack damage increased to 65\n10% CDR\n20 Arpen.\n\nThe big worry is Death&#039;s Dance, although I can also see Riven being a massive PITA with the other ones as well.  ~~Oh, don&#039;t forget that there is now a mastery which grants arpen per level, up to a total of 56 at level 18.~~  ~~Meaning with this build, just for flat arpen, she has 86 Arpen available to her. ~~  If that wasn&#039;t enough, she still has Black Cleaver (which for a Riven, was buffed, lol)\n\nThe Black Cleaver\nPrice increased to 3500 from 3000\nRecipe now Phage + C. Warhammer + 1150g\nAD increased to 55 from 40\nHealth reduced to 300 from 400\n\nMore AD, less HP.  As far as Riven cares, a buff, as more AD just makes her shield better, and her do that much more damage.  Also lets her grab a CDR item as it&#039;s build path that is actually good for her, to boot (C. Warhammer is 25 AD, 10% CDR.  It builds into D Dance and Youmuu&#039;s Ghostblade as well).\n\nSo lets go over it... she has ~~86 Arpen~~38.6 arpen, Cleaver shred, Maw&#039;s new lifesteal/Spellvamp on shield trigger, 20% of damage is turned into a bleedout (Good for her shield, as she can potentially negate part of the bleedout with it), 12% physical vamp, and 40% CDR.  Oh, and 240 bonus AD before runes and masteries (0nly mastery I am taking into account for her numbers is the Arpen one).  On 4 items.  If you still want to get boots, you can, and GA was buffed as well with higher armor and MR.  Or you could get a Deadman&#039;s or Randuins for hp+armor.   And Elixer of Wrath was buffed too, at least for in combat power, with 15% physical vamp from 10%.\n\n\nAD carry overlords?  No, its AD assassin/caster overlords.\n\nEDIT : Someone pointed out the arpen mastery was wrong, so I removed that part of it.  Messy wording made me think the two sections on it were Arpen and Mpen, not flat+scaling per rank of both.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-01T05:16:07.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death's Deal isn't very good on Riven. They tried to add in such an item onto 3's that built from a Brutalizer, but since Riven's Q, W, and R are all AoE, the item only heals for for 4% of the damage done.\n\nAnd the new mastery doesn't actually give 56 ArP... It barely gives anything. At max level, it's only about 8ish. It's base 3 (At all 5 points) plus .3 (At all five points) per level, so that means 3 +.3x18 to be max. So you have 3+5.4, totaling 8.4. It's... really not that great.\n\nCurrent ArP max is the 8.4 from masteries, 19 from runes, 20 from Youmuu's, and 10 from Maw. That's 49. Considering LW no longer affects base armor, the flat ArP will actually be needed late game since most tanks have around 90-100 base armor that can only be reduced by % Reduction and flat ArP, so Cleaver, J4/Wu Q's, and other things of that nature.

Such messy wording on so many of the things made me mistake it.  MB on that, but that just means she can get the CDR cap increase mastery for for 45% CDR instead.\n\nAnd remember, DD is working on her AAs and passive too, not just abilities.  Is it the greatest thing ever?  No.  Is it still good?  Yes.  Because she still gets what is worth 12% lifesteal on AAs, she just also gets the ability portion to boost the power of her Q, W, and R possible heal, especially when hitting more than one person, say because of a flash jump.   And the ability vamp isn't nearly as powerful as the other passive, which gives her significantly more ability to survive burst by just giving her a chance to react to it by culling 20% of the damage and re-applying it as a DoT.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-11-01T05:06:33.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I've seen a few rivens on the PBE its not that scary.

By the time he gets it, it's already around the 100ish it did before, but now it maxes at 150. On TOP of that, Shiv is 30% crit so he no longer needs to have the 10% in runes, which is a LOT of help actually, making his early game good. The 10% from the new Shiv and the damage is more than enough to put him through the roof since currently on live he's balanced around 10% from runes, which cut into his early AD a LOT, or they HAVE to build a Trinity, which can't crit and its overall stats are meh as a whole for him unless he's top and needs that slight bit of beef.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-11-01T05:29:59.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I dont have my PBE client open right now for the specifics, but the amount of healing yasuo gets is honestly insane.

His crit with an IE and Shiv is usually about 400-500ish on a squishy. 15% of 400-500 is 60-75. That's not actually a whole hell of a lot. It seems to heal more than what it says and more often than what it says is the biggest issue. I had a Yasuo with only a Doran's Blade, IE, and Shiv and he crit with his AA for 600 and then with his Q right after the AA and healed for well over 400 health. It seems to be a bit bugged or something. It might be healing based off of what the damage 'would' be prior to armor rather than the actual damage dealt.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-11-01T17:34:08.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah every 2 seconds on top of his other lifesteal items.. its more than he gets now man.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2015-11-01T05:31:43.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The big thing going for Yas is he is getting that Crit-steal on Shiv's aoe damage, which counts as a crit for it.\n\nAgain, got to see it once more than just the PBE has access to it (Because lets face it, massive majority of the PBE players are bad.
