Just that my name isn't french anymore, but the name's quintessence would be kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance &amp; as always excuse any grammar mistakes, I'm as little english as I am french ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Cerebral Absence","date":"2016-08-02T15:46:39.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks guys! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-01T20:09:08.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we don't offer free name changes.
