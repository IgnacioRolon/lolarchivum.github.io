His username is Bondsie. Yesterday evening he arrived home and was unable to sign into the client (incorrect username/password message). He was positive he entered the correct password, but tried to use the password recovery option anyway. This also failed, as he never received any email to reset the password. \r\n\r\nApparently, he created a ticket in regards to the issue and even received an email with the ticket number (#24489362), but when trying to click the email link to the ticket, he is told it does not exist. Has anyone experienced this issue? is there a way to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T05:02:35.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your friend's ticket was answered by one of our recovery specialists already. His entire correspondence will be over email for his ticket. If he's still having issues responding to his ticket, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"dcb89","date":"2016-12-10T17:03:16.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Targons Blade! According to what he has been telling me, he was contacted in regards to the ticket, but the ticket was closed. He was sent a form to answer for security reasons, but some of the questions he has been unable to answer due to playing for several years (eg. what was the first 450 RP you have purchased). As a result, the support person helping him will not accept that he owns the account and reset the password. is there any way he can verify his account otherwise?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-11T22:46:28.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recovering an account can be tricky, especially if you've been playing for many years and hadn't logged some basic account details somewhere to assist with a potential account recovery. Unfortunately, there is not another route to recover the account other than providing the recovery specialists with enough details about the account so we can confirm the correct owner. It may help to review the questions a few times to ensure the most accurate information is provided.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
