People figure out a meta, pick the best stuff, etc. It&#039;s also why many people are pissy about URF being spread through the year rather than on a single two week period. I, in my infinite slowness, just realized why this is actually a fantastic thing. We&#039;ll have URF back about five weeks from now, or about a month and a half. You know what else we&#039;ll have in that time?\r\n\r\nThe mage reworks and maybe one extra patch.\r\n\r\nThis is the secret beauty of these patches. For a more immediate example, the last time we played ascension was two weeks ago. When Ascension comes back? Taric rework, mage items and all those mage updates will be on live. Holy crap, that completely changes the way we played Ascension from last time. THAT is why spreading game modes out is smart. Rather than giving us two weeks to completely adjust and form a slapdash meta, we&#039;re going to be playing these games in a different environment every time we play.\r\n\r\nNew champions. New Items. Reworks. Whatever have you, this drastically improves the lifespan of the game. Kudos to Riot, that&#039;s actually brilliant.","replies":[{"poster":"El Condor Pasa","date":"2016-04-22T07:00:17.131+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":34,"body":"They get stale **fast**.

How frequently do their patch notes make changes to game modes other than Summoner's Rift, or include buffs/nerfs because of the metas involved in other game modes? Without balance changes intended for URF the mode would stagnate. Anybody who remembers the first time we had URF likely remembers we had the same 6 bans and same 3-4 dominaring picks after a few days prior to the permabans. That was after a week, give us a month and we'd have full tier lists. \n\nARAM works because it's random. Random locks, with rerolls, plus the Snowball summoner spell prevents stagnation while allowing variance. If we want URF permanently they'd have to add similar things just to keep us playing it. Even then I doubt ARAM and URF could coexist.","replies":[{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2016-04-23T02:15:45.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SLAYER6752,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YvMnQGVY,comment-id=00060006,timestamp=2016-04-22T18:17:55.473+0000)\n>\n> Riot doesn&#x27;t want to make balance changes with respect to other game modes.

It's objective based, there are clearly defined goals for the mode beyond \"spam buttons, kill people\", good map, etc. I would play Ascension, and more than that, playing Ascension would not alter my enjoyment of other game modes. \n\nARAM isn't random. That's easily fixable, and the mode would benefit immensely from it, but this simply goes back to the issue of alternate game modes not being supported.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rozencrantze","date":"2016-04-22T06:54:45.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I never got bored of urf.. i play several different champs even if they arent the best.. its just so much fun.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2016-04-22T06:56:27.928+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got bored after having to deal with the same AD Malz/Shaco/Ezreal/Vlad comp for the 12th time.

If that is false and we do keep on repeating, then we get well over those 14 days and that more than makes it fine. \n\nI guess another factor would be people that actually work, since not everyone on League is little 13 year old brats. You could be working those 2 days and literally miss out for over a month until it comes back.
