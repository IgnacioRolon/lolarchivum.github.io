Depending on your build/how you do. Once you do, however, your gold becomes absolutely meaningless. The only possible thing is for a quick switch in terms of items OR sell boots, buy banner, buff minion, sell banner for boots. Otherwise you just get an enormous mound of gold that builds up and up yet does nothing.\r\n\r\nAs a comparative example, in DoTA2 even if you reach maximum build, there&#039;s still other stuff to buy, One-time pricy consumeables that give you perma-stat buffs. The buyback system. etc. I&#039;m not saying League needs THESE specific systems but it would be nice to be able to do something when we&#039;ve got billionaire gold with nothing to do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-07-31T21:26:27.571+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to investigate late game gold sinks at some point.
