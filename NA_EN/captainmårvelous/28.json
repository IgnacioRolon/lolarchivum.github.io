But really, I want to sit down and ask why Volibear isn&#039;t being touched. At all.\r\n\r\n#1.) Volibear&#039;s Gameplay Pattern is the simplest in League of Legends.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not exaggerating either. Where is the skill expression in Volibear&#039;s kit? Almost everything in his kit is &quot;Run at you and check your stats&quot;. To further iterate this, here are some comparisons to &quot;Simple&quot; champions:\r\n\r\n{{champion:1}} Has the ability to time E during the Q for a surprise stun. Sure, it&#039;s not much, but it&#039;s something. \r\n{{champion:86}} Villain mechanic and canceling E for reduced CD. Also timing courage for CC waves.\r\n{{champion:254}} Contains one (1) skillshot. \r\n\r\nVolibear&#039;s got nothing. No timing involved. No planning. Nothing but psuedo-mind games in passive baiting.\r\n\r\n#2.) Volibear has an insanely strong theme wasted on such a generic kit.\r\n\r\nVolibear is a ursine (read: bearman). But it&#039;s not just that. He&#039;s a psuedo-shaman of storms and controls lightning. He&#039;s the leader of his people. He&#039;s one of Sejuani&#039;s councilers in the Freljord civil war. This character oozes potential for someone who does...well, anything with his kit. Instead, Volibear recycles parts from almost every other brusier to be the generic bruiser/diver/juggergod kit.\r\n\r\n#3.) Volibear can never afford to be strong.\r\n\r\nRemember that time Volibear got nerfs because one guy was spamming him in, like, challenger or something? Volibear is a stat-stick champion. A champion who is only strong if his numbers are filthy mcdisgusting. If his numbers aren&#039;t strong, _he isn&#039;t worth picking_.\r\n\r\nBut for all my complains, Volibear&#039;s biggest issue is that he&#039;s old. He, more than anyone else, reeks of a design Riot put out because they knew a bear-in-armor would sell. He&#039;s a character shipped out ASAP to cash in on a meme that was quite popular at the time during Season 2. I&#039;m not a volibear main, as I said, but this is a champion that deserves better than what he gets.","replies":[{"poster":" Jar Jar binks l","date":"2017-07-19T21:54:07.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"I know really, they rather give fking swain a vgu , where he is already in a fine spot","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-07-19T21:58:56.255+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain IS NOT in a fine spot.

You could argue baiting your passive but that's not really a skill so much as taking advantage of your enemy being careless. Volibear has no skillshots, nothing he can \"miss\" per say unless you don't get close to them. \n\nVolibear, in that regard, is a champion of touching. A champion who only wants to walk up and give you a big ol' touch. Then it becomes a question of if you survived him touching your forehead or if you died.

It's a game of chicken, so to speak, with her lane enemy. Annie is banking on her lane enemy not knowing/realizing the Q-E-Stun trick while her lane enemy is hiding or aware of the fact that annie could very well do this sort of thing. It's a simple mechanic, yes, but there is depth there. However small it is.\n\nNow let's take a look at Voli Q as an auto-reset. For one, Volibear has to use it to get in so the first Q isn't going to really have that mechanic. Beyond that, while you can auto-reset, most of the time it's better to use it as soon as it's off CD for the sake of having hard CC. Theoretically you can have this mechanic but in terms of Voli's role (A disrupting bruiser/juggernaut), you care more about the CC than being able to auto-reset.\n\nStuff like the Q dash-cancel isn't usually placed in Volibear's hands either. If you cancel the dash, it's less about _you_ timing it right but more about your enemy waiting too long to dash. _You_ don't have the mechanical say in this, the enemy does.\n\nBut let's pull back: Almost everything you've focused on is something either already in another champion's kit or with little strategic depth. Knowing to execute with W isn't exactly a \"mechanic\", it's more so just using the skill for its intended use (And even then sometimes it's just better to use it while trading).  Passive-baiting isn't a mechanic so much as it is praying that your opponent overcommits with it up. (Unlike the annie situation, once again it's all in the other player's hands.) but most of all, anything that would make Volibear more complex is usually chalked up to obvious uses of your kit. Knowing how to use Volibear, not showing \"mastery\" of volibear. It also doesn't help that certain mechanics in volibear ala AA resets can be applied to any other champion with the right items. \n\nI'll concede that maybe the E fear is decent for trading and a neat little thing. But even taking that into considering, Volibear falls insanely flat in mastery, execution skill, player/enemy combat patterns and a variety of other fields more so than most, if not all, other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2017-07-20T22:32:55.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You completely glossed over using ult chain lightning on minions to damage.\n\nTiming his Q to cancel dashes is HUGE and its completely in your hands. You can reactively cancel a lot of jumps (kha, trist) and the only way they get away is if they jump before you get close, which isn't always possible using bushes (also in which case they cannot fight you either - and ALSO they just wasted their only esape s. Or for example Camille, if she doesn't hookshot away before you get close, you hold your Q for her hookshot and she never gets to use it. \n\nAlso MANY times, especially in ganks, you don't start with Q. That's stupid. You just get a flank position or use ghost/righteous glory to just \"walk up\" to them. You then E  them for a very long slow. You always save your Q - its your most important ability in terms of CC. After they dash/flash, then you Q, get another burst of movement speed. \n\nAlso the auto-attack reset is VERY important to apply your bite quicky (auto-auto-flip + bite mid-flip). This allows him to turn a chase around (you're at 5% health, theyre at 15% health, you E for slow and run until bite is off CD, turn , auto-auto-flip execute before they can do much).\n\nALSO, you can fear Heimer turrets/shaco clone etc. Another good interaction.\n\n**But that's not what's important**\n\nThe whole essence of this thread is flawed. \n\nWhat's important is that he's not necessarily a \"stat stick\" champion. He provides really good pick potential and has good dive/peel potential (flip is great peel/pick, your E slow is disgusting to help your backline kite). \n\nYour bite + smite is also good at securing objectives. \n\nIDK why you're so hung up on volibear being a \"stat stick champion\" when shit like Dr. Mundo or Udyr are literally just a walking ball of stats and ACTUALLY have no reason to be picked unless they're broken stats-wise.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-07-21T01:18:21.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">IDK why you're so hung up on volibear being a \"stat stick champion\" when shit like Dr. Mundo or Udyr are literally just a walking ball of stats and ACTUALLY have no reason to be picked unless they're broken stats-wise.\n\nI can actually answer that, which sort of goes to the onus of this thread as well as why I focus on Volibear and not other, (possibly) more problematic champions:\n\nNobody really talks about Volibear.\n\nUdyr, for example, has been in the PBE cycle for months now with all sorts of changes being thrown around. Mundo has shown up a few times as well, along with just recently with some major changes. Both of these champions have had work done to a scale far greater than Volibear. The last touch-up volibear had was in 7.7 that...gave him more bounces. That's it.\n\nMy problem is less so outright anger and more so frustration. Volibear, a legitimately interesting champion from a thematic point of view, is seemingly neglected. Before the ult buff, Volibear's last touch was a nerf in 6.19. Before that, a bug fix in 5.22. Now, I can't say I expect volibear to be touched in EVERY SINGLE PATCH, but when a champion like Udyr gets a ton of work or a champion like Mundo gets entirely new mechanics added, seeing Volibear left behind just feels...wrong.\n\nSo, to sum up, I hate the idea of Riot leaving behind a champion which has so much potential and neglecting him until years down the line when more problematic characters are taken care of. Volibear, as a champion and as a concept, deserves better than that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hypernater","date":"2017-07-21T06:00:54.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a voli otp all i can say is this: while most of that is true, it just feels ridiculously disjointed, his q is very underwhelming when trying to chase people, that it almost forces you to buy dead mans. he shouldnt be as item dependent as he is. not to mention that there are so many better gap closers in the game which are safer to use. he just feels old, and his q and e only slightly work with each other and his ult is good early game then quickly goes to shit. there are just other champs that do everything he does better","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-07-20T10:06:36.188+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he can throw the fed ennemy assassin/bruiser into your squishies so it's an interesting mecanic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-07-20T08:23:34.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with this post.
