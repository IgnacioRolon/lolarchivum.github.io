Fuggo the Ugly Dog could be the most off-putting champion in the game but if his R is \"instantly win the game\", he'll be picked regardless of how ugly he is.\n\n#Using Data\n\nTo start, we'll be using the [\"Champion Popularity\"](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/11/champ-popularity-mixing-math-art/) article Riot published only a little while ago. While this is missing some champions, we can get a rough idea. TL;DR: Champions who sit in the upper right quadrant have both a lot of people playing them and a lot of people who play them frequently/semi-frequently.\n\nAs a run down, I went through the list and cut out extra data to get clear views on \"popular\" champions as of Patch 7.16\n\nhttps://puu.sh/CApxc/fec20dfca5.png\n\nSo using this, we have our list of \"Popular champions\":\n{{champion:8}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:222}} \n\nFor the sake of safety, I also double-checked champions who were close to the corner/bottom of the graph. Champions generally above Fizz, Kalista and past Talon and Rakan were usually \"safe\" in terms of popularity, remaining in that zone overall and rarely (if ever) dipping out of it in the span of two seasons. While it doesn't include everyone, the main disqualifications are Vladimir, Kalista and Lulu who heavily dip out of the popular category. \n\nhttps://puu.sh/CAq7D/3027553979.png\n\nWith all this gathered, we can dig into the meat of champion popularity.\n\n#Obvious Stuff (Kit-wise)\n\nSo this stuff is fairly obvious and doesn't really need a lot of explanation:\n\n* There is a lean toward damage dealers/assassination characters.\n* Carry ADCs are generally popular.\n* AD > AP\n* esports\n* Riven, Kayn and Yasuo are the anime trinity of popularity. \n\n#Not-so-obvious stuff (Kit-wise)\n\nWith that all taken care of, let's look into some less-obvious stuff:\n\n* There is an emphasis on **BIG** ults.\n\nFinal Spark. Super Mega Death Rocket. Chronoshift, Cataclysm, Last Breath, The Culling, etc. Players seem to gravitate towards champions who have great, huge, spectacular moments of power. These ults can change the course of a fight and look good doing it. If I had to guess, I'd say it comes down to ults feeling spectacular and players like having an ult that makes them go \"Alright boys, time for my final attack\".\n\n* There are also quite a few \"Super Saiyan\" ults. \n\nHighlander. Spray n' Pray, Final Hour and Grandmaster's Might all give players a feeling of becoming a stronger version of their character. Nowehre is this more evident than in the top of the list, Kayn. Kayn's ability to transform into a superior version of his base self leads to an amazing feeling of \"power spiking\" and that you're ready to throw down. I'd say that this goes back into the natural love of getting stronger: Players love feeling that they're \"better\" than the start of the game and playing an evolving/upgrading character helps cement that.\n\n* An even mix of easy and difficult champs\n\nWhile one might assume the most popular champs are always the most difficult to play, this doesn't seem to be the case. There are plenty of characters who mesh with players that are both difficult (Zed, Lee Sin, Draven) and easy (Xin Zhao, Garen, Janna). I'd say this comes down to these characters being the baseline. Either you see these characters playing at the highest tier of play and desire to be that good or you're attached to the character you started using at the start. \n\n#Discussing Character\n\nNow we come to likely the most subjective part: Characterization. \n\nWhen looking at the list, you have a mishmash of archetypes. Despite this, you can boil down some common character tropes into some aspects people often find enjoyable about their specific characters. Think of this more so exploring what players _really_ love about their characters.\n\n* Most characters on this list are outright \"badasses\"\n\nDarius is the hand of Noxus who can cut a man in two. Kha'zix is an all-consuming predator from the void. Warwick is a monster who chases down others the moment he gets a wiff of blood. Players not only love being badass but they love FEELING like a badass. I'd say it comes down to general feelings on power. People want to feel strong so they gravitate to characters who feel strong.\n\n* Many characters on this list are, either in voicework or in-lore, cocky.\n\nKayn is the darkin-wielding animeboy who is better than you. Ekko loves talking shit. Jhin cares so little about you that all he's going to talk about is his art. Hell, Pantheon's voice line is \"You're gonna die at my feet pal\". While I might be stretching, players love a sense of feeling \"better\" than their opponent. Thus, they'll gravitate to champions who love to push their smarmy edges over others and tease/mock opponents about how much better they are. Maybe toxic players just wanna trash talk without a ban?\n\n* Waifus. \n\nYep. Don't really have much to add here. Just. Y'know. Waifus.\n\n* A Good (or bad) Guy\n\nIf you look on the list, most of these characters (at a glance) fall under either the good or bad guy. While the lore usually goes deeper and you can make cases for certain champions, there's definitely a \"feel\" that characters like Garen or Lux are outright the good guys while Zed or Thresh are the evil guys. If I had to make an assumption, players gravitate to what they know and if they want to play league, they probably have the notion of playing a character that is either the good guy of the story or the bad guy. Not to knock anyone who likes playing as these characters but I'll definitely attest that there's fun in taking a side. (Even if it turns out that in the lore, your goody hero man is actually kinda bad).\n\n* Cinematics, Other Media and More\n\nSurprisingly, while most people assume that the media presence comes after the character, media presence can boost character popularity. For example, Jinx's \"Get Jinxed\" music video had millions of views and was a gateway for those who never saw League and liked the character. Thus, they gravitated toward her. Warwick's rework teaser featured a grim, dark and terrifying hunt through the streets of Zaun. Let's also not forget characters like Lucian, Jhin and Draven who had absolutely bitchin' login music. While people assume media comes after, Media can definitely play a part in hyping up your champion.\n\n#Wrapping It All Together\n\nSo let's take what we know and \"make\" a champion that will check as many boxes as possible:\n\nTimmy, The Popular Dude...\n\n* Is featured heavily in promo material and/or had a special teaser created by Riot (Cinematic, music video or otherwise)\n* Is either extremely easy to play or has an extremely high skill ceiling.\n* Is designed (from a character perspective) to be a really cool badass good/bad guy a a glance\n* Has a very strong ultimate that either improves him and/or deals a bajillion damage\n* Has the ability to be a carry or assassin\n* Might be a super hot girl\n* Might be anime.\n\n\"But Cap, I designed a champion that doesn't fit these boxes! If I work for Riot one day, does that mean my champ will suck!?\" Wait why are you asking me this reader? No! That's not the point at all.\n\nThis is a metric of \"popular\" champions, not necessarily \"successful\" champions. While there are plenty of popular and successful designs on this list such as Jhin or Lee Sin, there are also plenty of flops or divisive characters like Yasuo or Thresh. The good thing about League is that there is a place for **EVERYONE** in this wide world of 140+ champions and even if your champion isn't popular, there's bound to be someone who loves them to death. Just remember this if you're trying to make a champion to appeal to the broadest, widest category. If not? Well, who cares! Make something for those million people who are gonna love your champ and nothing else.","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-01-22T04:57:55.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am insulted that you did not put swain in the \"popular champions category.\" As a swain main, I am highly offended.\nhttps://ih0.redbubble.net/image.440792311.6816/mp,550x550,matte,ffffff,t.3u3.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2019-01-22T05:04:47.367+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Apex,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KnV0AdmE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-22T04:57:55.623+0000)\n>\n> I am insulted that you did not put swain in the &quot;popular champions category.&quot; As a swain main, I am highly offended.\n> https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.440792311.6816/mp,550x550,matte,ffffff,t.3u3.jpg\n\nPlay Swain more so he gets in that category then.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kurorade","date":"2019-01-22T18:04:13.303+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is so popular he shows up twice lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-01-22T05:51:34.054+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you are saying is riot needs to make a confidant anime best-girl waifu with an ult nearly as big as her boobies and that she should be easy to learn and is crazy OP if you finally master her?\n\nGun Paladina - ADC/Healer designed either to work as a carry ADC or e-girl support.  \n\n* Passive: Supporting Fire - you get a little life steal to start out with that increases with your ult ranks, allies near you get healed for half this amount.  This will keep you alive to make it easy for starters but making full use of the passive will be a little tougher.  Works for both ADC and support.  ADC GPs would go traditional crit builds while supporty ones will opt for life-steal builds.\n* Q: Smiting Shot - your next AA has more range, is AoE, and deals bonus damage to your primary target.  This should be your poke and your wave clear.  Good players will know when to use it for which use.\n* W: Focus Fire - 3 hit passive that deals a little bonus physical damage to enemies and heals you and allies near you.\n* E: Thunder Shot - a click to target AoE skill that knocks both allies and enemies away from it.  The closer they are to the center, the further they go.  You can either use this to reposition your allies, pick (peel) enemies, reset a small skirmish in laning, or maybe knock people over a few walls.\n* R: Goddess's Gainaxing Gauss Guns - a big AoE skill that executes really low enemies and stuns or charms everyone with more HP than that for a second (stunned/charmed champs take no damage).  You get 2 seconds of bonus stats for each enemy champ hit.  Basically you want to use this to begin a team fight or to end one with it.  Either way, it checks both the big ult box and the super-saiyan ult box. Should provide big moments in game because it can either kill or do no direct damage with nothing in between.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2019-01-22T06:07:33.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Linna Excel,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KnV0AdmE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-22T05:51:34.054+0000)\n>\n> So what you are saying is riot needs to make a confidant anime best-girl waifu with an ult nearly as big as her boobies and that she should be easy to learn and is crazy OP if you finally master her?\n\nI'm not saying Riot should do anything.\n\nBut that 700m isn't going to make itself back.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-01-22T07:42:33.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KnV0AdmE,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-01-22T06:07:33.140+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not saying Riot should do anything.\n> \n> But that 700m isn&#x27;t going to make itself back.\n\nid say they already have enough characters in this game. they should focus more on using this information to build on existing characters.\n\nfor example garen has a great basis to fit what makes a fun and popular champion. all they have to do now is add a bit more skill expression to his already existing kit, like they did with the 0.75 second tenacity + dr on his w.\nif they were to improve/rework the villain mechanic and gave him improvements to animation cancelling in his kit, hed do a lot better at high mmr imo, and people who want to main him because they like his character would have more of a reason to stick with him.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2019-01-22T07:52:28.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KnV0AdmE,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-01-22T07:42:33.070+0000)\n>\n> id say they already have enough characters in this game. they should focus more on using this information to build on existing characters.\n> \n> for example garen has a great basis to fit what makes a fun and popular champion. all they have to do now is add a bit more skill expression to his already existing kit, like they did with the 0.75 second tenacity + dr on his w.\n> if they were to improve/rework the villain mechanic and gave him improvements to animation cancelling in his kit, hed do a lot better at high mmr imo, and people who want to main him because they like his character would have more of a reason to stick with him.\n\nThis is never going to happen. Garen's basically going to remain a beginner champion and relatively ok in high ELO because Riot has set themselves on the path of never disrupting low-tier enjoyment for the sake of high-tier balance. Plus, you assume that \"improving garen\" will make him more popular. Barring him becoming meta/op, you're not getting new Garen players unless you rework him. Same reason why reworks often drastically alter characters but keep the core theme: They're not for the 0.001% of players who like playing that character. They're for the 99.999% who like the idea of the character but hate the kit.\n\nAlongside this, there are still abilities, ideas and more that have yet to be explored within league. Sylas, for example, has ult-stealing abilities. You can't really say anyone else in League has such a skill and giving a rework a skill would likely come off as haphazard. I mean who are we gonna give that to? Ryze? Syndra? There's still room and niches for new champions, just at a slower pace than where it used to be.

Which is >fine.\n\nadding more and more champions at this point doesnt bring more players in either. the amount of people who have every champion in the game unlocked is extremely small. there isnt much of a payoff in adding more content at this point.\n\nthey could explore more, but its also making the game increasingly unstable and difficult to balance.\n\nevery new element they introduce to the game interacts with every existing element (items, other champions, runes etc.).\n\nmeanwhile with each new champion added to the game, the chances that they have time to attend to existing champions that need some sort of work gets smaller and smaller.\n\nthere is only so much you can do in a single patch without breaking the game. if the game has 150 or 500 champions, doesnt change that they can only work on 20 champions per patch. either at some point you run into tech problems (piling up bugs as a result of too large scale patches), or the changed interaction between all of those champions and items causes more imbalance than before.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2019-01-22T08:06:39.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KnV0AdmE,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-22T08:02:42.396+0000)\n>\n> i dont think theyre mutually exclusive.\n> \n> {{champion:19}} {{champion:14}} and others have proven this.\n> \n> there is a number of champions in the game who have a low skill floor and are easy to pick up, and at the same time have enough skill expresssion to be effective at high mmr when mastered.\n> \n> garen is pretty much 90% of the way there aswell. the difference in strength between high mmr and low mmr is a lot smaller than it used to be.\n> \n> all he needs at this point is tweaks to his existing mechanics.\n> \n> things like\n> \n> - increased animation speed on his q with champion level to be able to auto animation cancel properly with the ability\n> - removing the lockout from casting w during the q animation\n> - reducing the lockout from cancelling his spin to 0.5 seconds \n> - slight rework to the villain mechanic to give him more agecy over the ability\n> \n> his base kit doesnt need to be changed anymore.\n\nThose, however, were both full reworks and had portions of their kit completely changed.

For example:\n\n>mostly champions with not many weak points, huge mobility and potential to 1v5 the enemy team like Yasuo, Riven, Fiora, Zoe, Pyke, Irelia or Akali\n\nWhile a lot of these champs are strong, a lot of what you listed also has a massive divide between a good and a great player. So it doesn't just fall to \"lol bad player abusing simple ~~chumps~~ champs but rather people seeing a good <x> player, then wanting to emulate or try to be them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khä Zïx","date":"2019-01-22T22:12:44.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mained Khazix since S4 before he was cool.

While Swain and Lissandra can def. be badass, if you ask someone what a badass is they'll usually give you a stereotypical answer. \"They're a lone wolf take no prisoners who doesn't care about what it takes to complete the mission and also they're super cool and buff\".\n\nIf it helps, consider it \"Stereotypical\" badass than just badass","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poldy Scarecrow","date":"2019-01-22T18:37:49.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a pretty good read.\n\nImo {{champion:62}} could tick all of these popular boxes (minus waifu) with a little bit of work.
