(@Narrative)","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":27,"down_votes":8,"body":"I just got done reading the Targon interview with the foundations team. It was cool, yeah. However, this part at the end from Ant kinda struck me.\n\n>**Reynolds:** That&rsquo;s why we call it Foundations. It really is just the foundation that players and Riot teams can build upon. It&rsquo;s like a sign that says, &lsquo;Demacia is kind of in this direction, now go play and create cool stuff.&rsquo;\n\nI have to ask: Is that what is really going on here?\n\nI want to point to two major parts of this argument: The anti-fan fiction rule and the feedback the lore team gets when it comes to these stories. Because when you compare these notes to what Ant said, there is a clear and distinct difference between what you guys are wishing to create and what you guys are making.\n\n#The Anti-Fan Fiction Half\n\nA long time ago it was told that players cannot make fan fiction stories canon or suggest major plot points. This kinda stung. Hell, if you know me, I&#039;ve actively been trying to learn and get on the lore team for a few years now (I&#039;m making zero progress but that&#039;s the price you pay for not having professional experience). Riot Narrative, and the team, made it clear that while players may ask to learn more about these characters both champion and non-champion, none of our feedback would actually contribute directly to a story, which brings me to my first flaw:\n\n**Are you setting up foundations for what we can explore or TELLING us what we will explore?**\n\nPiltover/Zaun was referenced a lot and I&#039;d like to think of that place as my home turf when it comes to fan fiction. I&#039;ve spent more time writing stories, designing fan concepts/champions and overall trying to flesh out those two places on my own. I should be rather happy about the idea that Riot wants to expand and explode out those regions. Rather, I&#039;m worried. I&#039;m worried that any cool idea I spent years building up on will be completely obsolete. I&#039;m worried that even if I did contribute feedback about these champions, it would largely be ignored.\n\nIt makes me feel like the stories I, and others, create for Runeterra are afterthoughts. That I&#039;m not allowed to explore and play with this world as I and any other see fit. Rather, I&#039;m being told that THIS is what the story is and you have to submit to the narrative team&#039;s design. You&#039;re allowed to play in the sandbox, you just have to use THIS shovel and THIS pail. Perhaps I&#039;m extremely biased when it comes to this but it feels as if the player comes second and the writer comes first. I also understand this is a legal thing with the whole &quot;What if they stole MY story&quot; or &quot;Omg Rito steal my idea gib RP forever&quot; but I kinda think that&#039;s still a weak argument. One last thing: I&#039;m not a great writer. I&#039;m not going to pretend I can stand up with guys like Graham who held the 40k universe in the palm of his hand like a writing deity. It just leaves a sour taste that our stories and our ideas don&#039;t just play second fiddle, they play off-stage in the green room.\n\n#The Anti-Feedback Half\n\nI&#039;ll come out and say it: There seems to be no feedback when it comes to lore changes. We can say they&#039;re awesome or that they&#039;re not-so-awesome, yes. We can ask what regions we&#039;d like to explore. But when it comes to actual champion and story feedback we can&#039;t really make any significant changes. Period.\n\nTake the Targon examples. A lot of people are upset that these characters so fundamentally changed. Pantheon got completely mind-wiped, making him somewhat one-dimensional even if his backstory is thicker. Diana and Leona have completely switched roles, with Diana being the rough-but-peaceful celestial while Leona became the zealot of her religion, even if there&#039;s more power for the two of them to actually work together. People addressed these concerns ( Ryugi did an [amazing post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/oEjabY06-narrative-team-an-open-discussion-about-mount-targon) on the discussion) but they&#039;ve largely been ignored. We don&#039;t have a two-way-street. \n\nIn some aspects I understand this as well. You can&#039;t pull in a VA to completely rewrite the VO. You can&#039;t dig up Pantheon&#039;s old VA and ask if he&#039;d like to rerecord everything when you&#039;ve got 10 other projects requiring 12 different VOs (Hey maybe some of them are dual champs, y&#039;know?). But it&#039;s not the case when it comes to a story. Yes, it isn&#039;t feasible to ask for the writers to completely scrap a story and it is hardly fair to ask them to completely and utterly remove something. That doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t ask for minor changes. That doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t provide feedback to these characters. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nFor Rioters reading this, I apologize if I came off as harsh, overbearing or maybe just know-it-all-y. I&#039;ve played League for five years and really dug into the story for four of those years. My criticism doesn&#039;t come from a place of rage, it comes from a place of passion. I don&#039;t want to shove and push and demand an answer, I&#039;d just like to establish an open dialogue and try to get some feedback and a two-way-street going.\n\nIt&#039;s clear from your Narrative post that you want this place to be fun for both you and us. It&#039;s clear that you want this world to be something we can all play around in and something where both fan fiction and fan fact (That&#039;s my word for writers on the payroll. Do you like it?) can come together and work as a cohesive unit. You may not be able to directly pull stories and quotes 1:1 from us but that doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t work with you if you&#039;ll let us. I just want Runeterra to be a place where we can all share stories.\n\nThanks for reading this, if you made it to the bottom. No TL;DR. Go read. It&#039;s story and art, you should be accustomed to reading.\n(PS: If anyone else is gonna be at GDC, be sure to meet me there. I love talking about this stuff even if I&#039;m just a super fan)","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2016-03-02T21:17:01.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Many words.

Everyone has their own view as to what these new tales mean for how it’s impacted the champs’ previous lore and how those characters are now perceived. As Ant in Oz says, there can sometimes be a sense that a champ’s entire story is conveyed within their bio, that it’s the essence of their beginning, middle and end. A sense that this is their story and here it ends, now go play them…\n\nBut I think it’s fair to say that we see a champ’s bio as the starting point of their story life. It’s the information that tells us who they were and what happened to mould them into the champion they are now. A good bio gives us enough information and story to know who that champ is and what’s driving them onwards - their motivation. it makes us want to know more about them, allows us to identify and/or empathise with them and makes us care about what happens to them (or what we want to happen to them). A good bio allows everyone to take the champ’s story onwards in their games, fan-fic, art, cosplay or forum discussions. It allows them to talk to others about how a champ’s story might develop and what great or nefarious destiny might lie in their future.\n\nTake the Bilgewater champions, for example. We took their bios and pulled them forward into stories like The Reckoning and Shadow & Fortune, and even then, their stories have threads yet to pull. We wanted to show that stories develop, that actions have consequences and that the bios are just starting places for us to develop the champs and the world of Runeterra. So look at the bios and story text here as a place where the endless possibilities opened up by Mount Targon and its associated champs can be explored. What lies in store for Diana and Leona? What might happen if Pantheon comes face to face with Leona? Why are the Aspects coming to Runeterra right now? These and a hundred other questions are ripe for the asking, and the potential for new and exciting stories are wide open for everyone’s imagination to run with.\n\nRace you to the summit…\n\nGraham","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2016-03-05T04:09:19.542+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of something that's always on my mind whenever conversations about lore happen is this:\n\nProbably the biggest issue with Leauge's lore is that basically the entire span of its existence after the demise of the Journal has felt like a drawn out cycle of reinventing origin stories. At the moment it feels like we only have page 1 written for like, I dunno, 20 champions? The rest of the bios might as well be wiped completely clean for your more passionate readers because of the uncertainty of knowing what a champion's base personality and motivations are going to end up being once that are revisited. League's lore has always been pretty shallow, sure, but I don't really understand when your teams go heavily about the process of expanding lore by rewriting from page 1 instead of generally taking the tactic of letting the shallow first impressions and trivial details of the origins stand and continuing with page 2 to develop that character into something more complex. It often feels like you're keeping us trapped in shallow knowledge of the world when that happens.\n\nI don't know if what I've said just now makes sense to you, but maybe I can explain better by comparison.\n\nA big reason why I think it feels like any backlash against character reimaging which occured during the Bilgewater event seems so much more minor and praise more evident is that every character's past really felt like a continuation of everything that had come before. Granted, most of the characters involved in Bilgewater had pretty vaguely defined plot points to work with whereas you're reordering a whole lot of proper nouns and specific accounts of events with the Targon set, but most of these characters did still undergo pretty extreme transformations. Graves' entire point of existence in League being defined by his motivation of revenge against Twisted Fate, for example.\n\nI like most of the work done with Targon, really. But you must understand that the revelation of a new lore which redefines a lot of these trivial story details and names feels a lot like a promise of broken continuity for however so many years in the future it takes to resolve the game's lore in the piecemeal fashion it's being done.\n\n\n----\n\nA separate comment on Pantheon.\n\nAtreus' lore was really well done in my own opinion. I just think you should consider that since it takes so long for any sort of development to happen with characters in a roster of hundreds, the fact that the final part of Pantheon's lore comes across like a full-stop period mark on what potential he can reach as a character is what's causing a lot of the frustrated reactions. Leona and Diana have very visible possibilities of character growth built into their futures as aspects of Targon. Pantheon simply seems to have a rote duty to perform.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-03-05T03:09:06.358+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This entire post, and most of the anger the narrative team gets, is entirely because lore doesn't come out that often. It's hard to see that the bios are just the beginning of a champion's story when, for almost every single champion, it is the entirety of their story. Most champs get a brief intro and then nothing for the next couple years.

That's not a commitment to champs being anything more than their bio. The client doesn't even have anything more than a couple of lines with no link whatsoever to long lore - that's not a commitment to lore, period.\n\nWhen I see stories from events added to the client as links in champion profiles or some sort of 'lore library' in the client, I'll believe bio's aren't the end all be all. A player who joined today would have no idea that long lores or the scene bits even exist from inside the client and no simple way to be find the old stories.

(It feels weird calling you by your name. Like 99% of Rioters I call by handle but I guess that comes from the major author name status.)\n\nI'm glad you guys have long-term in mind. Hell, I think Bilgewater is legitimately some of the best media League/Riot has ever produced. However, the fear I (and others) have is that Riot is gonna take a while to bring these further stories into the light. Which leads to fears that all these grand stories you guys have planned of gods, heroes and furry gremlins with blowdarts are gonna be missing in action. In hindsight we can't really blame you for that, as you guys have a lot on your plate, but I think people might like a teaser or (at the very least) some plot-hooks swinging from the rafters even if we don't get the full story.\n\nLooking back to Bilgewater, making the place a gangwar of MF vs. GP was amazing and it left Bilgewater feeling natural. Like the story concluded but there was still more to explore. No idea if you guys got plans for Targon but I hope this gives us a nice stage to stay on, even if the story is just a short one.\n\nThanks again for coming in.

We wanted to show that stories develop, that actions have consequences and that the bios are just starting places for us to develop the champs and the world of Runeterra.\n\nI think what you fail to see is that there was a huge difference in how the Bilgewater lore and the Targon lore was handled. Like you just said, the Bilgewater lores were pulled from their bios. They weren't rewritten, they were expanded upon and fleshed out. All of the actions that Graves and TF took were a result of their existing lore. Nobody was up in arms about TF and Graves resolving their issues because that evolution of the story made perfect sense from the characters we knew.\n\nMeanwhile Riot threw that out the window with the Targon lore. You didn't expand upon the characters, you rewrote them. I could not care less where the characters can go from here if they're not the same characters. \n\n>But I think it’s fair to say that we see a champ’s bio as the starting point of their story life.\n\nBullshit.\n\nIf you considered bios as starting points then you wouldn't change them. There's a difference between upping the quality of a bio and changing it. Making something come to the same general conclusion by taking a different path does not count as being the same character. I would have been fine if Leona became a zealot as a continuation of her lore. I would have been fine if she and Pantheon had some momentous falling out. I would have been fine if Diana evolved into a more reasonable person.\n\nAnd this whole \"you can't please them all\" argument is completely totally irrelevant. If you're concerned about angering the new lore fans by changing the lore back to satisfy the old lore fans then I have a perfect solution: Don't make the lores different in the first place. But since the lore's already been changed my message to the people who'd be upset if it were reverted is this: Piss off, we were here first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ant in Oz","date":"2016-03-05T00:49:00.429+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi there CaptainMårvelous, and everyone else who has chimed in here. \n\nAs always - I love the passion from everyone, and that everyone here is having an intelligent, well-reasoned, respectful discussion. Huzzah!\n\nThis is not Riot with a capital \"R\" speaking, this is just me as a gamer and fan of LoL (which I played for around 3 years before I'd ever considered the idea of working here), someone who's been a professional writer for around 15 years, and someone who has worked in other IPs that also gets lots of fanfiction/fan-art etc created around it.\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n\n-  No one here, let alone the writers, would want people to stop writing fanfiction. Fanfiction is awesome, and there are plenty of people who make the jump from writing fanfiction to getting employed professionally to write. It's an invaluable place to learn and hone your craft, get feedback from people who know and love the world and characters your are writing about, and just generally interact with an IP that you love. Do it, and keep doing it.\n\n- Player sentiment towards characters and world-building (which can be expressed in a myriad of ways, from fanfic, to cosplay, to fanart, to conversations, headcanon, board posts, memes, or whatever) IS a strong voice in the direction of the Lore. Truly. This is true in many big IPs, though stronger in LoL than any other IP I've worked in. I know it can be hard to see that sometimes, especially if the canon veers away from what an individual sees as things that are core to a character/place. This is typically more of an issue when that character/place is less defined, requiring players to fill in the blanks - in these cases, different headcanon starts to form among different people (which can vary hugely - especially across different cultures and languages). Rarely does everyone agree perfectly - opinions of what's cool varies, and different headcanon ideas tend to gain traction in different eco-sytems. We do listen, though, and players' opinions do massively influence us - though this more often on the macro level than the micro level. By that, I mean if all players tend to love \"X\" about a character, we'd be wise to understand that and find room for \"X\" to live on unless there's a good reason not to. We are more likely to look at big trends/global sentiment among players than individual ideas. This can influence us in little ways - little nods to fan-favorite things (like helmet bro popping up from time to time, urf sneaking into splash art, etc), or in bigger ways - such as helping to establish the personality of less established champs. \n\nAs a personal example, some of the feedback regarding the new Pantheon bio and color text has really got me thinking of story ideas exploring how a little hint of Atreus may still be in there, which hasn't happened with previous incarnations of the Aspect. Perhaps something is different this time around, and the personality of the host starts to re-emerge... \n\n- A bio is not a complete story/character arc. It's most definitely not the start and end of a character, or the be-all-and-end-all. For example, just because the bio doesn't come out and say \"Pantheon and Leona are friends\" - and might even show them being antagonists in the past -  doesn't mean they can't become friends or allies in future stories, etc. We haven't done heaps of ongoing storytelling in the past, but we definitely want to do a heck of a lot more going forward - the Bilgewater Burning Tides story, and the Harrowing \"Shadow and Fortune\" story was a start towards that. We do want to develop our character's arcs and their stories - they are not static.\n\n- I get the frustration when something changes in \"Lore\" that invalidates something someone's written in fanfiction. It's a bummer. (It also happens professionally as things develop, btw.) Hopefully these changes are for the better, but this stuff aint an exact science, and it's all pretty subjective. It's also something that is very difficult to avoid or mitigate unless we just stop and leave the lore exactly as it is - but that way leads to stagnation and wouldn't be satisfying to anyone. LoL has many, many millions of players, and a heck of a lot of fanfic being generated every day in 40+ languages - it would be impossible for us to have any kind of development with our characters and our lore without invalidating some fan-fic here and there. Note also that this is not restricted to just fanfic - it's a similar thing to making a cosplay outfit or artwork, then that champ getting a re-work and new splash. The more our world and characters get established, fleshed out and developed, the less this becomes an issue - and the more that fanfiction and what you call 'fan fact' (like the term, btw) can work together without clashing.\n\n- Should we be aware of the ramifications of any changes we make, and have our finger on the pulse of player sentiment? Hell yeah. This is super-important. It's also important not to try to appease everyone with every change - that way leads to blandness and a solution that may not _offend _anyone, but also doesn't really _satisfy _anyone. We should never blindly make a change that no one wants of course (this is where understanding players and their often contradictory opinions matter), but also we shouldn't be afraid to make a change that some people might not like (but others do), as again, if we try to please everyone, or design things (especially characters) by committee then we end up with really boring and unsatisfying characters/stories/worlds.\n\nAnyway, apologies that this has turned into a wall of text!

It' s very hard to keep focus on stuff, compared to the new lore where everything is so much tailored: main characters are on the spotlight but are so interwined with their reality that every step they make feels like a step in a real world, NPCs are more fleshed out or stand out more into their homes and there is no need of paragraphs to give a cultural impression of an object.\n\nAnd when the old lore got out of these boundaries... how much they could hold?

Sorry if i was so dense!\n\nWell, in a sense you are right the old lore on that regard was more cohesive. Personally it' s something i never really \"appreciated\", in the sense of noticed, that much because to me was a no problem: like in the real world weird things stay together so do in Valoran, all that mattered to me were few themes and the narrative style.

Mainly the Leona one. Personally, I don't mind Leona's change but for others, it's a big deal.

In that regard, you guys can't be blamed. You're updating an entire IP and it'd be pretty cruel to chastise you. I don't want to say pick up the pace because, like it's been established here, I kinda don't know what I'm talking about and focus on ideals more than reals. \n\nI am surprised that you guys say you're so tuned into player feedback.

It was an event so major and worth remembering that Riot placed this item into the game as a manner of commemoration to the game's fan-driven story. \n\nFan fiction can be an afterthought depending on the content. Most fan fiction is bad, as I'm sure we're all aware. However, there are gems to be found and stories that can transcend and perhaps even do better than Riots own team. Star Wars entire EU (RIP forever old friend) was entirely fan fiction. However, characters like Mara Jade and Admiral Thrawn proved to be so popular that they're coming back from the EU into the new canon. Characters, made by fans, are now canon.\n\nThat is the power fan fiction can have. I'm not saying that all fan fiction will hit this level and I'm certainly not suggesting that Riot should let fans run free with their game and commit chaos to the story. I am, however, sincere and honest in my belief that fan fiction is necessary for the IP just as much as any core-story.

I do have more to add though. When it comes to getting feedback from the fans/community on lore I think people tend to get to attached to certain ideas and their fav characters. It makes people scared of progress or change (understandable) even when it might be necessary. I'm not saying Mount Targon ABSOUTLEY NEEDED a lore update, but I am glad they finally got around to it.  The new lore paints a more refined picture of Mount Targon and gave the characters a more consistent theme. I def expected major changes to my fav characters (Diana, Leona), but the changes will (hopefully, we still have 2 more champs to go) work better for the champions as a whole. Many people talk about the flaws in the new lore when the old lore was far from flawless. Don't get me wrong I still like the old lore, but I do feel that it needed change/an update.\n\nI mean when you look at lore in a bigger picture Diana, Zed, and Morgana all share the same story in a way. \n-They all felt oppressed/alone in their society  \n-They find something magical and ancient that gives them powers\n-They killed people who opposed them after getting said powers \n-They serve as an \"evil\" counter part to another champ\n\nLots of similarities...\n\nThe Mount Targon \"event\" isn't quite over yet so I'll have to wait and see how I feel by the end of it all...but for the time being I am okay with the changes.

Diana in her lore certainly wasn't this saintly woman. She was a tortured and bruised woman who lashed out and killed others. Leona was a stalwart protector but she wasn't desiring to kill everything that moves. She had goals and boundaries. Now it's kind of reversed and, to a lot of people, it's wiping away key aspects of the characters. Pantheon is the most egregious example but honestly he had little to go on.\n\nAs for fan feedback? Yeah, I know it's a lot of people to listen to but there honestly needs to be some feedback. Rioters should address criticisms about their narrative viewpoint and respond, even if the end result is that nothing is changed.

Look at Ionia. We still have all these shadow factions, warring clans and post-war devastation but we still have characters being introduced and changing the lore with every introduction. Don't hype up some major event unless everyone can play. Bilgewater worked because it was a self-contained story. Shurima worked because it was self-contained. Freljord (And Targon to an extent) didn't work because they set up this grand war to begin...and then ditched it. I know there are places that need help but that is NOT what should be done.\n\nThe argument with the retcon is a flawed one.

The time to rewrite it. B.) The time to proof-read and edit for correction. C.) The time to make it multi-lingual and D.) publish it to the main website. A talented team, as I assume Riot is, can do that in two days to a week. Difficult, maybe, but shouldn't fans feel like they're being listened to?

By extent, they deal with the same thing: thousands of different feelings on what a champion should play like, scale like and move like. A deep thought on where it should go and what should be done with this champion. A primarily NA/English feedback train and at the end of it you're still going to end up with dissatisfied people.\n\nThe thing that is gained, however, is valuable. People are listened to. People, even if not all feedback is responded to, get to make their voices heard. There are several central threads on what Riot wants to do during the mage update in the Dev Corner, why would it be so difficult to do one for Targon? Again, maybe not directly changing things but at the very least there can be a feedback loop going. All I'm saying is that if other teams can do this from splash artists to designers to modelers, why can't writers? \n\n \n> Writing professionally, it tends to not be that easy to make changes.

I just can't get behind the team saying \"Cool thats nice\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-03-03T14:37:44.519+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HFYAKFh5,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-03-03T00:56:18.571+0000)\n>\n> Leona was a stalwart protector but she wasn't desiring to kill everything that moves. She had goals and boundaries.\n\n\nI think you are misinterpreting her color text here a bit.\nIts not Leona who wants to kill the people,its her sun powers who want to do that,because as her color text says \"The** being** she had joined with atop the mountain longed to burn these men with its cleansing fire.\"\n\nSure Leona is a more agressive in her new lore,getting angry at diana for what she said about the moon,being willing to defend herself against atreus and trying to kill diana to avenge the elders,but she is far from \"desiring to kill everything that moves\"\n\nThis is actually something that is reflected in Dianas moon powers(when she uses them against the horrors it says that she gets filled with hate by them) and is something that was actually implied to some degree in dianas original lore,where her character took a turn to the extreme the moment her moon powers awakened,which did cause some people to speculate that the moon powers were actually responsible for dianas fanatismus.\nAnd if Dianas moon powers have their own will,then it would make sense for leonas sun powers to be the same.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Norscout","date":"2016-03-02T20:10:44.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You have alot of great insight and many good ideas.

Much if not all of the core personalities are still there, though things become muddled due to the overall dark tone and foreshadowing of what it to come. Without me going back and reviewing Diana and Leona's lore, there was easily enough of the original in place for me to accept them as the same characters and more or less just expanded lore. Diana is still an outcast, hated and prone to bursts of violence, but it was never in my mind that she did not desire some sort of peace and acceptance. It was the vehement rejection of her truth that kept her there and I most certainly never thought that despite how \"good\" Leona was that she would ever directly support the Lunari. Perhaps not blind in her faith, but also not easily dismissing it either and that aspect comes through.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that the original lore and this event cover different times within the champions lives, so where they're going and where they have been can still fit together. Particularly with Pantheon, much as I dislike his blank slate status as of now. I'm not saying I support flat out changes to lore, but this is hardly a case of Leona being turned into Draven. Which reminds me that we still need a Solari skin for Diana and a Lunari skin for Leona.","replies":[]}]}
