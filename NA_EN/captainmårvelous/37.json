Specifically:\n\n>Mages is our minimum target. Fighters in bot lane&#039;s on our &#039;probably not doable this time round, but let&#039;s give it a shot and at least understand what else would be needed&#039; list.\n\nSo let&#039;s do this. Let&#039;s talk about mages bot lane and if/how they could work. To begin, we need to understand the difference in playstyle, kit and what these characters bring to the table. Now, bear in mind, I&#039;m separating this from the _CURRENT_ state of the game and aiming more at what ADCs _SHOULD_ be. Please don&#039;t come in going &quot;REEEEEEEEE ADCS DONT PLAY LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW THEY RIGHT CLICK KILL EVERYTHING REEEEEEE&quot;\n\nSo, historically, ADCs:\n\n* Massive DPS output from auto-attacks and some abilities.\n* Shine brightest mid-to-late game.\n* A focus on single-target DPS.\n* Peerless objective damage to both towers, inhibs and epic monsters.\n* Designated tank killers thanks to penetraton and steady DPS. \n* Forced mostly into glass-cannon buildsets with usually one defensive item or so.\n\nComparatively, mages:\n\n* DPS output from spells and the occasional empowered auto-attack.\n* Shine brightest early-to-mid game in most cases.\n* Varied DPS sets. Some are burst mages on single targets (Veigar, Syndra) and some are AoE monsters (Orianna, Vel&#039;koz)\n* Control of objective/space varies mage-by-mage.\n* Goal varies, again. Mostly aim for weak/low MR targets however.\n* Tend to have open build paths where they can build some defensive and some offensive.\n\nWith these historic parameters in mind, let&#039;s turn back and look at the situation where a mage bot-lane WAS successful in the pro scene.\n\n#Missing Link: Ziggs botlane.\n\nFirst, we ask why it worked. Ziggs received a change in the mage update where his satchel could kill towers at lower % of HP. This meant that Ziggs had strong objective control. Ziggs also had his passive which dealt more damage to structures, meaning a passive/lichbane combo could decimate a tower if left unguarded. Finally, Ziggs was an all AoE champion and could easily shove the wave into an ADC&#039;s tower. This would force the ADC to be on the backfoot. \n\nFrom here, we see a slight pattern. Ziggs could:\n\n* Shove a wave better than an ADC\n* Had comparable or even superior tower-destruction skills.\n* Semi-reliable DPS thanks to low CDs and his passive.\n* Decent enough tools to dual an ADC early, albeit he wasn&#039;t as high a hyper carry.\n\nThe problem here is that Zigg&#039;s abilities were all focused on killing towers. If Ziggs didn&#039;t have these, there&#039;s a good chance he wouldn&#039;t be the power pick he was. Because of this, he was able to circumvent the biggest issues of killing towers and consistent DPS.\n\n#Giving Mages Bot-lane tools.\n\nFor mages to go bot-lane, they need two things:\n\n* 1.) A tool to better take towers/epic monsters.\n* 2.) Tools that can&#039;t be abused in the mid lane.\n\nThis is the tricky part Riot has to look into. Balancing an item to kill towers with solo lanes is tough. You could force it to be &quot;Only when &lt;number&gt; of champions are nearby&quot; but then you have situations where mid-to-late game every mage is getting it. Mages would also need either low CD abilities or tools that allow them to do damage more consistently compared to an ADC, who is usually doing (early-to-mid anyways) one auto-attack worth of damage every second, unavoidable.\n\nAlternatively, Riot could change how towers work to allow mages to deal more damage to them. Of course, this brings back the fear of what could happen to solo lanes. Plus with all the &quot;TOWERS SO WEAK REEEEEEE&quot; I can&#039;t imagine the community would welcome another tool that makes them weaker, even if just for one class.\n\n#The Discussion\n\nI didn&#039;t walk into this thread expecting to have an answer. Rather, I just tried to outline some of the core things that separate mages/ADCs and how you could go about closing the gap between them. So this is on the community now: Let&#039;s hear some ideas. Alternatively, if you think I got something wrong and mages need something else to survive botlane, lemme know.\n\nThis thread should be about how Riot could make mages work botlane and, maybe if we&#039;re fortunate, discover some tool or knowledge that could help bot lane be opened up to even more combinations of champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-02-26T00:37:47.550+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't really try. 99.9% of people will just keep playing ADCs in bot lane because trying to break the meta is risky and there's not a big incentive. Relatively few people really care about it.\n\nI've played Vel'Koz bot lane many times and have found it to be an extremely effective and reliable strategy but I don't really care enough to keep doing it. I just do it when I felt like playing him but I ended up in that position. So I don't think ZIggs was the only mage to be good in bot lane, but largely a lot of sleepers haven't been discovered.\n\nAnother reason the meta resists change in this game is that players believe that ADCs are necessary. So they will want to have an ADC in another position. This means to successfully find a new strategy you have to experiment with two positions/roles. Once again, there's very little incentive to do that kind of experimentation.\n\nI think to really play a new strat, you have to accept not having certain champs you are comfortable having. You have to give up the ADC and focus on midgame domination. But then again, there are ADCs specifically for that type of strat anyways, so again, what's the benefit?\n\nNobody has sufficient incentive to push for mages bot lane or any other large scale meta change. Meta changes will happen organically without any sort of arbitrary direction. Every now and then somebody discovers an exception to the meta... The ADC who can go mid. The mage who can go bot lane. The ADC who can jungle. The Tank who can go mid. The support who can go mid/top. etc...","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainM책rvelous","date":"2018-02-26T00:51:43.529+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">I've played Vel'Koz bot lane many times and have found it to be an extremely effective and reliable strategy but I don't really care enough to keep doing it.

While there was some early experimentation around season 1/2, you'd think that it'd take less time than 7 seasons to find another character that can effectively go botlane in a proplayer spotlight. (No, we don't talk about Mordekaiser). If there were sleeper picks, I think someone would have found them by now or we would have seen someone play them. As it is, Ziggs is so far the only champion to crack open the bot-lane meta. \n\nThat said, I don't think you're far off. I think there are certain champions who COULD work bot lane with a bit of help. Viktor, for example, would probably love to go bot with someone to farm his hexcore quicker and not worry as much about someone all-in-ing him at level 6. \n\n>Nobody has sufficient incentive to push for mages bot lane or any other large scale meta change.

While recently, we've seen more champs who are more flexible (Galio for example can be played in a variety of ways and champs like Ekko usually find a way into the meta from mid to jungle to top), most cases of a champion/role being played in a new way are exceptions, not breaking open the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2018-02-26T01:15:19.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"H처pe","date":"2018-02-26T15:04:50.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fate Fire,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fsFZ4Z5Q,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2018-02-26T01:15:19.482+0000)\n>\n> \n> I&#x27;ll bring up the point of Smite Support (double Jungle) Singed that was quickly shoved out.

For a while now I have experimented with mages bot for fun. If I had to make a \"signature\" mage to be played bot it would be Xerath, basically just an AP Sivir. He has decent mana sustain with new runes and his passive, he wave clears really well, and he does a decent job of doing DPS rather than raw nuke because of his relatively medium/low cooldowns of about 3 to 5 seconds per spell. I think a key part of allowing mages bot lane is the tower taking. A way to introduce that mechanic to them I think would be slight alterations to Nashors Tooth.\n\nNashors has historically been a very niche item for AP and Hybrid champions who happen to use a lot of autos. Casual on hit builds for Ori and TF, or even a meta core item on Azir. I think with some light changes Nashors could be made to fit the role of allowing mages to take towers similarly to marksmen well. And what I think makes it less likely to be abused in a solo lane is the attack speed that mid mages don't want, since most of them are designed to nuke and bottle objectives.\n\nI would advise a test of lowering the AP, keeping the attack speed about the same, and upping the scaling on the passive, with the added note that the passive applies to towers.\n\nWhy this won't be abused mid. Mid laners are solo, and as such they only have one champion to face off against, as well as one champion to depend on. If the AP of Nashors is lowered and the scaling is increased, it helps bot lane much more than mid because of two reasons.\n\n1.  Mid laners won't get enough damage out of it for their spells to be useful in killing their opponent in a fight, similar to if they rushed something like older Rylais in that nobody ever got in lane outside of a few exceptions like Sol. This is evident in that Lux won't rush current Nashors and Lichbane against Zed, even if both those items do help her take tower much faster simply because Zed will kill her no problem for not having enough AP to threaten him.\n\n2. And two, bot lane has four champions, so both mages have someone to help them shove to wave and fight, making it less damming that they don't have as much AP, similar to how it isn't the end of the game that some marksmen don't do as much damage early, because their support helps them manage the wave and trade with the enemy. \n\nThese changes in addition to longer match times and runes like Gathering Storm could allow mages to fill a similar late game team comp at the expense of a marksmen. I myself have won games with triple mage compositions simply because even with MR a Malzahar, Lux, and Xerath will just overwhelm a frontline that happens to get caught in the vast amount of CC an extra mage can bring. But at the same time if the team fails, they lose and rightly so because they did not take advantage of their mid game team well.\n\n\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Metallikaiser","date":"2018-02-27T04:07:47.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to try different people in botlane, and I happen to be a bot Mordekaiser main so obviously I have a unique perspective on this.

That's their general power as a class, independent of their position on the map.\n\nNo, the reason ADCs are situated as the usual gold-gaining partner in the duo lane is that their champion archetype (ranged champions with a focus on auto-attack damage) is the least negatively affected by sharing XP.\nChampions can generally be sorted, as far as their relative dependency on Gold and XP are concerned, on two axis: The first being their range of abilities and, more importantly, auto-attacks and the second being their general balance focus between abilities and auto-attacks.\n\nOn the first axis, shorter-ranged champions, especially if they have a melee auto-attack, are more dependent on levels than their longer-ranged compatriots. The reason for this is that their lower range necessitates their movement into the enemy's sphere of influence to do their stuff, and thus open themselves up for all the nastiness that the enemy can throw at them. You can't hurt what you can't hit, after all, and that goes in both directions. Thus, shorter-ranged champions want that tankiness they can get from leveling up, especially since base stat growth is notably higher the lower your general ranges are to boot.\nLonger-ranged champions, on the other hand, have their range as their form of safety, and that seldomly changes significantly over the whole level range (only exceptions: Tristana, Kindred and Gnar). In addition, their defensive stat growth is lower anyways.\nThus, longer-ranged champions are better suited for sharing experience from a defensive perspective.\n\nThe second axis is where offensive prowess comes into play more strongly. Generally speaking, ability-focused champions are more dependent on XP than those who draw the bulk of their damage from auto-attacks. This is not only linked to base damage improvements with ability rank-ups, but also to the improved non-damage aspects - most skills get a combination of improved cooldowns, longer durations, better CC, better utility and better ranges with each skill point you put into them. While the damage increases can be duplicated by purchasing stats (meaning, gold), these secondary aspects cannot - in fact, things like shorter base cooldowns actually scale multiplicatively with purchased CdR!\nAuto-attack damage, on the other hand, does not scale as hard with XP. Only 3 out off the 5 factors that scale auto-attack damage are even affect by XP at all - critical strike chance and critical damage are both stats that can only be purchased with gold. Additionally, Resistance Penetrations is not universally affected by XP, too - it exists only on specific champion's kits.\n\nThe combination of these two axis matters even more for ranged, auto-attack-based champions - what is usually known as Marksmen. Their longer-ranged nature means lower base stats, anyway - not only for defensive purposes, but also for offensive ones. For most Marksmen, the amount of AD they gain from 17 levels worth of XP is equalized by as little as 1300 gold - the cost of a single {{item:1038}} . AS gains from levels are very similar - average AS gain is about 51%, which is about 4.25 {{item:1042}} s' worth (1275 gold). And out of the class, none gets Armor Penetration with XP.\nThis makes the class notably less affected by sharing XP if they have access to a whole gold stream. And it is the reason why the gold-gaining partner in a duo lane is usually a Marksman.\n\n----\n\nNow, should Riot open that position up for champions of different classes?\n\nAbso-frigging-lutely. This is a change that is very necessary for the game to evolve, as it would be a huge help to balancing out other classes. Since the bot lane position is usually occupied by a Marksman with his strength of sustained damage and tank/tower/objective taking, a good team comp would put a lot less emphasis on the same power from a different position - or, to put it differently, Juggernauts and Skirmishers who share sustained damage and tower/tank/objective taking as one of their class strengths become a lot less desirable.\n\nAnd that is why I don't think Riot should give bot lane mages the same strengths as Marksmen - because that doesn't fix the issue with the locked bot lane in the first place. Rather, Riot would ideally find a way for mages that are not sustained-damage based to express their strength in the bot lane - thus opening up teamcomps to go look for that sustained damage in other positions.\n\n----\n\nNow, this is just my opinion.

The adc will die once you close the distance, the vast majority of mages will just CC you (usually dealing lots of damage in the meanwhile) and back-off, even in long lanes.\n\nZiggs bot worked because he has ridiculous pushing power and adcs at the time where trash (the whole \"adc in 2k17 lul\" meme), if he and similar types of mages were given itemization to exist in bot lane they would probably be overbeaeing anywhere else.\n\nThink about it, why do mages go mid? Because they scale the most with both levels and gold.\nWhy do adcs and supports go bot? Because adcs scale hardest with gold and least with levels (at least historically, more and more adcs have abilities tied to levels nowadays), while supports dont need either due to their utility.\n\nKmowing this, we can easily conclude that if mages are viable in the botlane (AKA, they can thrive in a low EXP environment) then they will most certainly be broken anywhere else. Either that or their sole job botlane will be to nullify a character on the enemy team, by making the enemy adc useless.\nNeither prospects are any good since the former means they will simply be numerically OP while the latter means they will be massive lane-bullies that make a player unable to play the game.\n\nI honestly think Riot has no way of making mages viable in a duo-lane unless they are broken, either too strong in general or too weak to exist in a solo lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2018-02-26T09:57:31.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think that the only change that Mage's Need are an increase in the % of AP converted to damage on auto attacks to structures to be improved from 40% to 45% (5% makes a HUGE difference), and that the bonus should be applied to Epic Monsters as well (Dragon/Baron/Rift Herald). This would allow them to be slightly better at taking towers without overly weakening them, while also allowing them to deal more damage to neutral objectives while they have to wait for cooldowns.\n\nI also think specific champions should be reworked to be better suited to the bot lane 2v2 scenario. Champions I think would work great:\n1. Kayle: She's historically been a big DPS based character that deals heavy hybrid/magic damage. I think having a better E Cooldown would help Kayle out a ton, or a more powerful heal so that she can better take the harass that comes when her E is down early game. This could also boost her jungle, making her a more viable flex pick that could go to a variety of locations.\n2. Azir: He's actually got the scaling pattern of a hypercarry ADC, and if they weakened his early game enough, I'd wholly support some buffs to his late game damage. I think nerfs to his early soldier cooldown, and soldier damage with buffs to his AP ratios, along with reducing his soldier's range from 850 down to 700. This means Azir has a bit less of a \"control\" Zone. Next you could also bring back his W \"Nuke Tower\" ability in exchange for a much longer Soldier cooldown overall. This means that Azir would have larger windows of openings for bullying, trades and some better sieging power.\n3: Cassiopeia: Another high DPS mage that has the scalings to work as a bot lane mage. Honestly, she'd need a slightly longer delay on Q explosion so it's a bit easier to avoid, but a slightly higher heal on the E heal on poisoned target. Though this would have to be a very \"Cautious\" change, as it could actually really mess with the flow and timings that many long time Cass player's have.\n\nThose are the 3 \"Mages\" that I think deserve to be bot lane AP carries the most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blu 1","date":"2018-02-26T02:47:18.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think:\n\n{{champion:82}}  style bonus xp would be needed\n\nAlso probably EITHER more base AD or more mana regen.

Unless someone else can fill that role on the team then the bot lane carry has to be able to do it. So the real question is: How can we make mages be able to kill towers and control objectives in the bot lane and not in the mid lane? Right now the only way for mages to kill towers quickly is if it's built into their kit (Morde, Ziggs) or if they can build correct itemization(Lich bane or nashor's) but both of those options can be used in other lanes easily. \n\n\n You could  change a core item in the different build paths to opt into a structure damage route. {{item:3070}} , {{item:3010}}   building into an item that lets spells deal reduced damage to turrets so mages who can spam abilities like {{champion:69}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:1}}  {{champion:101}} {{champion:136}} could opt out of hard scaling/poke builds for seige builds. {{item:3057}}  variation that does more damage to bot tower pre 25 minutes or something forwave clearing lich bane users like {{champion:245}} {{champion:142}} and possibly {{champion:131}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:17}}\n\nMaybe another change could be a new type of support or support build path that can help supports enable different types of champs.  Maybe this could be done by a support item or new support champion that uses a toggle system that lets the support farm the wave but give all gold to the binded teammate(to help with bruisers getting over harassed trying to walk up to farm before they spike) For example a champion like {{champion:143}} {{champion:90}}  or {{champion:74}}  builds an item that lets them just sit back and try and push waves and keep safe while someone like {{champion:41}}  {{champion:266}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:157}} scales up for late game team fights.\n\nEdit: {{champion:41}} and {{champion:75}} actually wouldnt work too well becuase they have to be the one farming because of their kits but maybe a new type of bruiser niche could be filled by adding true scaling bruisers who can't survive in lane alone.

For example, giving the bottom outer turret low MR, but not the mid lane turret, would allow bot mages to push better without necessarily bleeding over to better mid lane power. Similarly, giving Dragon and Baron, but not Rift Herald, lower MR, and rebalancing certain outliers in the mid lane or jungle, could also allow bot lane mages to contribute better.\n\nWhile this might be a bit riskier, I also think we should start making at least some abilities affect turrets: one of the major reasons why marksmen are considered the only class capable of pushing is because they're the only class whose abilities can damage turrets with some consistency, due to providing autoattack steroids. Allowing all classes to damage turrets in their own way would equalize the playing field significantly, without taking away the innate DPS advantage of marksmen. There might be an objection that some spells outrange turrets, and could therefore push too safely, but there are many ways to approach this: one easy solution, for example, could be to just make some abilities not affect structures at all, but even that might not be necessary, since marksmen already have \"abusive\" pushing power via heavy manaless damage and the occasional ability to outrange turrets (RFC banks on this), and are doing just fine. Moreover, several other MOBAs let their characters damage structures with their abilities, at no real negative cost to game health. In fact, in many cases this makes games healthier, since it becomes much more difficult to turtle up and discourage opponents from pushing. Therefore, removing the AP-to-damage ratio structures innately have, and instead allowing champions to damage structures with their abilities, with fine-tuning as needed, could diversify pushing significantly.\n\nIf I have one criticism for this discussion, it's that it focuses a little too hard on trying to make non-marksmen carry by giving certain champions the same strengths as marksmen. While I do think strengths like pushing power and objective control shouldn't be exclusive to one class, I don't think homogenizing class profiles would be all that beneficial to diversity either. Ultimately, a carry curve is defined by the ability to scale extremely well to the late game, so if certain champions get to carry through factors other than just pushing power, we should be valuing that, sooner than trying to bend them into fitting a mold. One strength I think should be valued, for example, is the AoE potential of many mages: just as a skilled marksman can take down an enemy team via sustained damage, so should a skilled mage be able to wipe out multiple enemies at a time with proper aim and/or setup. Therefore, allowing mages to contribute equally, yet differently, to teamfights could give them a significantly better chance of competing with marksmen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-02-26T03:04:58.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what happens if these options for botlane work out better than normal ADCs?
