As they go through the history and (slowly) saying why are things the way they are. The mythology acting for the foundations/ building blocks telling us things like- why is Zaun situated beneath Piltover? So on and so forth. \n\nHere the audience is learning about the past, which can form a loose structure for how the future might go. AS things progress with more stories, we (the audience) gradually understand core truths about this overall world. All you need to do is be observant and absorb the knowledge you are reading. \n\nInstead of saying, here's all the very specific truths- so Yordles have 4 fingers on each hand, their max height is 90cm and all have coloured fur x,y, z. Instead focus on giving us the bigger, more far-reaching truths. Like how Yordles are attracted to Runeterra cultures and enjoy manifesting around certain human ideals. Here the audience can take that broad truism and think about how it effects stories and characters. \n\nBut I dont want to be told exactly _what_ specific Yordle is like, I'd rather learn of the generality's of Yordles, backed up with mythology that explains _why_ they're certain ways. Because League is a mythic universe, gods exist and people can interact with them, theoretically you can meet the person who made Braum's shield, you can meet Ornn. Because the makers of this universe exist, so mythology is much more important and should be very vivid. \n\nOnce you know the mythology you have that frame work, a new lens you can use to understand things. Built upon that you can start changing things- I know what Yordles are like in general, but the future has room for a variety of different Yordles that could expand the knowledge of the world.\n\nI think asking for trivia to then be confirmed or made official, like a champion's height or what's the cuisine like in this universe, is asking the really wrong kind of questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-04-29T11:15:45.784+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Champion facts are important.

On the other end of the scale, just how short is a Yordle?  Would one come up to your waist, or your knee?\n\nThese facts have implications.  If Taliyah, Tristana, and Cho’Gath sat down for dinner, then they would not be eating the same meal.  Taliyah would have roasted sheep loin, a two-fisted bowl of root soup, and a tall glass of goat’s milk.  Tristana would have half a sheep chop, an orange, and some water.

Knowing that Caitlyn is a skilled artist and draws her own wanted posters tells us something about the world, contextualizes her skill and tells us something about her life we may not have known. Knowing that Illaoi likes mangos tells us something about where she grew up and makes us ask other questions: Are mangos Bilgewater delicacies? Are they common? Is this something akin to Illaoi's people?\n\nYou're also focusing too much on answers being specific and ironclad. If I told you \"all humans are six feet tall, have dark skin, blond hair and love pizza\" that would make humans pretty boring, right? If most yordles are carefree and aloof yet Poppy is a rigid and heroic soldier type, that tells us something about who Poppy is, where she grew up, etc. It's these small notes that help separate the champions and characters of the world, as well as point out where there are inconsistency due to upbringing, traumatic events or otherwise.\n\nFinally, you assume we have \"core truths\" to work off of. Which we don't. Yordles are short. Ok, how short? Is everyone Poppy's size? Is she a giant among yordles? Are we to assume Poppy is short even for yordles? How about Kayn? Is it easy to classify Kayn as non-Ionian by birth? Is black hair uncommon in Ionia? Does he tower over other Ionians and seeming imposing? \n\nOne other thing is that we can't get these major answers of mythology because maybe they're spoilers. We would love to have a whole page of darkin lore but then Riot is concerned we'd be spoiled on who the next two darkin champs are. We can't have more info on the darkin war because that further spoils the other champions and storylines. Etc etc. The world is wrapped in spoilers and we can't delve too deep.\n\nThe biggest problem with your argument is that you want to focus on the broadest concepts. In wanting to know only the why, you end up making the world feel fake. A cardboard cut out. A world with plaques attached to everything telling us why this is important. If it doesn't have a plaque, don't bother looking at it. Real life and world-building isn't like that. There has to be room for both the grand lore set pieces as well as the tiny things like if Demacians have great oral hygiene. Does it have to be all encompassing? Not at all. But focusing only on the whys is the situation we're in and how the league universe feels more like a theme park of neat things rather than a grounded world: Colorful and fun for an afternoon but with little substance.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-04-29T23:05:30.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one actually read or just misinterpreted what I said if you think it was about no trivia at all. \n\nTrivia does run the issue of being incredibly pointless when its stuff like \"Taliyah likes Rocky road ice-cream.\" Or the type of music she might like from IRL.

A Rioter responded and basically said Sion would tackle Galio's foot really, really hard, and fans were seemingly not all that ecstatic about how obviously silly this idea was.\n\n\n> We don't have a world map.\n\nI did say I agreed to an extent and this would be it. It should not be difficult to make a world map, you could easily have a rough map \"found\" in an archive or make it something Ezreal made up in his spare time (he doesn't need it after all so losing it wouldn't matter) if you don't want to use the resources to make a very good version. It's not the best, but it's something if you're holding out on the \"big\" map.\n\n\n>  We don't have basic tech levels\n\nI disagree that this is a good thing to have, especially in a setting as weird as League. There's plenty of settings where the technology they have available doesn't always add up to what you see (Attack on Titan has space-age 3D gear, black powder cannons, plus the Titans). The more detail you add, the more evident contradictions start to be once the gaps in technology start appearing. This area is one best left vague imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IAintDarius","date":"2018-04-29T13:08:23.423+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Breast comparison chart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stupafly","date":"2018-04-30T12:38:01.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"While playing the game, I care much more about gameplay than lore.\n\nHell... even while not in-game i care about gameplay more than lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonyWolf77","date":"2018-04-30T02:56:22.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's respectable that you have these kind of expectations for a hugely successful and WIDELY popular craze that has been league of legends since its debut back in 2010 or so. However, you do have to remember this is an entire WORLD they're building here. And to be totally honest, I like to go by a bit of a personal theory of mine that I'm pretty sure not a lot of people tend to take into account; whether or not you agree with me is up to you.\n\nIn a fiction world affected by stuff like magic and whatnot, it can make \"progression\", put lightly... tricky. In other words, if you think of our world and the way cultures equate to one another, how do we fight wars? Well, with tanks and guns that were developed by all of us. An American tank functions almost the same as a German or Russian tank, but their designs, intricacies and inner workings are all slightly different, but at the end of the day we're all on the same level. In a world like Runeterra where some places have an abundance of magic (Ionia), no innate magic at all (Zaun), or even places that despise magic (Demacia, not sure if retconned), it would take a TON of thinking and analysis to make those kinds of relationships accurate, because strictly speaking, Ionia should technically be ruling the world if they had access to the most valuable resources (assuming that's magic).\n\n Not only that, but the concepts that league of legends brings to the table are pretty easy to link together because they all share a common theme amongst their traits: they're all based on older depictions of _LEGENDARY_ tales. Pirates, ancient Egyptian rituals and religions, Nordic cultures and religions, ninjas and angels and demons, and even the age old ideas of chivalry, steampunk and Castlevania-esque themes come into play here. \n\nNow I know I kind of went off on a whim here and for that I apologize but here's a more generalistic approach to the situation that I'm hoping you can at least understand, if not agree with. It's so difficult to come up with specifics until you come up with a baseline first; that's why I think they never come out with a hard set depiction of Runeterra for example. Artists never EVER start on the miniscule details on a piece because if you find something unsatisfying, it ruins the whole work for you. You start with a base, and add details as you get more and more specific. That said, League is constantly evolving. The problem with Riot making a specific decision in those areas is that it makes VGU's and other updates so hard to follow through with because they have to basically reinvent all of this unnecessary fun (sorrynotsorry but it's true) for... the story. Example: Old Urgot to new Urgot. Do they look the same? not really. Do they look like they would weigh the same? For sure the hell not! But it would be unsatisfying to see and that's frankly a pain in the ass to deal with. Same goes with things like traditional foods and such across Runeterra. I mean, sure, you could go grab a Big Mac in piltover if you want but that would uh. Kill the vibe a little bit. It would be too much work for them though if they constantly had to put out stuff besides Yordlecakes, Honeyfruits and Rotten peaches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-04-30T00:11:47.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"World map is a must that much is clear. food, technologies, currencies ,cultural and social constructs, those are all great in helping us create a better picture of Runettera.\n\nBut do we actually need height and weight? if yes,why?\n\nAlthough i understand the need of age and date of birth , to pinpoint some of the events in the lore.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-04-30T00:35:42.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So we know who is 6'4\" and rows for UC Demacia.\n\nReal talk we need it so we can contextualize champions interacting with each other.
