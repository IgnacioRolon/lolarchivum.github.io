We see the strife of war wrought upon an otherwise peaceful nation. The noxus-ionia war was a powderkeg that allowed individuals who had grown unhappy with Ionia&#039;s stagnation to rise. Not only that but every champion is now affected by this conflict in some way or another. The radical, changing ideals of the world has both people openly embracing it (Zed, Akali), trying to encorporate it into Ionia&#039;s mantra (Karma) or those who are so devastated and are unsure about where to go (Shen, Yi)\r\n\r\nIn addition, most of Ionia&#039;s lore progression ties back to the old lore. It&#039;s not a 100% total retcon, it feels like the organic growth of these characters. Akali leaving Shen due to his indecision and Shen grappling with the world changing around him. Zed&#039;s &quot;haha fuck order&quot; isn&#039;t just detesting the old ways but his sense of justice being shaken by a questionable decision made by his master and brother. Karma being torn between her past lives staunch tradition and her current avatar&#039;s personal view on Ionia. (Although Karma needed a tweak) And I&#039;m not even getting into the race-relations with the vastaya, Riven&#039;s story or Yasuo&#039;s mentorship with Taliyah to atone for what happened in the lore.\r\n\r\nKudos Riot. Out of all the regions Ionia is likely the most well-developed and interesting zone you&#039;ve ever tackled.

The biggest aspect of recent events is Azir returning to life and the rebirth of the sun disc. While important, it only feels like most characters there are awaiting reactionary stories/tales of what happened. \n\nIonia, conversely, feels like a more modern place with a lot more stories being told in the now. Everything feels like it's talking about the ramifications of what happened in the Ionia/Noxus war and that every character has been personally affected in their story going forward, plus it radically changed who they were before to what they are now. That still exists in the Shurima/Targon/etc. zones but I don't think it's as realized as it is in Ionia.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-07-30T20:05:45.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you think that's what makes a region interesting, yes.

Even the idea of Xerath and Azir meeting in the Capital is more exciting for me than entire Kinkou Order.\n\nIn short, what I'm trying to mean is, this is a completely subjective discussion. Everyone will have a different opinion. That's why I find title of thread wrong. And I'm saying that as someone likes Ionia. Ionia is a beautiful region and it is definitely not my least favourite, but it is still overshadowed by a few other regions for me.

But a worse story and setting. \n\nPart of that is probably because the continent still feels disparate despite the recent attempt to unify them under that mythology. \n\nHow do the people in Targon feel about Azir’s return?  How are their lives changed? What were the economic consequences of Xerath basically taking control of the capital of Shurima?\n\nThe Southern Continent as a setting feels pretty flat and lifeless. It’s just populated by a bunch of characters that harken back to a time that honestly sounds more interesting than any of the stories the Southern Continent is currently telling. \n\nOn the other side Ionia has a history and a vague mythology. It’s there. But the story as a whole is focused so much more on the present. How did the Vastaya react to the Noxian invasion? We know that. How did the turmoil effect the peope’s daily life? We know that too. The setting feels more alive and in the moment. \n\nMy only problem with it, other than my general apathy toward the Eastern aesthetic (just never interested me for whatever reason) is that it doesn’t quite follow through with the eatablished implications of the setting. Almost universally when a people that have known peace for several centuries get invaded by a people that have an army of veterans the results are... not pretty. \n\nGo read about the Japanese Invasion of Korea if you want some nightmares. Now Korea eventually won that war, but only because China ended up getting involved and Korea just so happened to have one of, if not the, greatest naval commander of all time. \n\nBut that’s not what happens in Ionia. People just seem to pop out of the woodwork with a deep understanding of martial arts that, for no actual reason, remain actual effective fighting arts that did not become largely useless and sport-ified as should have happened. \n\nBut that’s really a minuscule nitpick of a complaint compared to what Riot has done.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-07-31T10:22:13.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But saying not knowing what Targon thinks about Azir's ressuraction results lifeless continent is pretty biased...\n\nI can find many question similar to this for Ionia. And they are even a whole region, not seperated like Mount Targon and Ionia.\n\nExample, what are Karma, Shen and Zed's opinions on Varus? What does Ahri think about Kinkou Order? What action will Zed take for Syndra, a thread for Ionia? \n\nThere are many unexplored and untold relationships in both continents, not just in southern continent.\n\nAnd saying eastern continent is lifeless is already wrong even with this questions.\n\nWe know people are going to Capital of Shurima, and gates are open. We know there are people who don't agree on Azir, like Taliyah. We kinda know how Fall of Shurima affected shuriman people. We know some shurimans willingly went under Noxus control. \n\nYes, eastern continent definitely focus on the past more than present currently. But you can't expect every continent to be told in same way. Writing stories on present of Shurima without its past would create many questions like how Shurima fell, what is Xerath, what happened to the Ascended after the Fall etc. It was necessary. \n\nAnd now, even there are still many questions of the past, there are enough of past to tell the present. They will eventually come there. And you know that, present Ionia also has past of it, and they will eventually come there too.

I kinda agree with what riot was wrote so far considering if your home is being invaded I would think your first thought would be to defend it, most of the younger champs agree with this new mindset of action while if you look in the stories in the universe page most of the elder background characters wish to stick to their past traditions.
