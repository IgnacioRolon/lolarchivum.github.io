It let him do some cool trading patterns and survive lane, enabling him to exist when he wasn&#039;t in the best state. Sounds cool right? VIktor taking a keystone that isn&#039;t obvious and finding success....nope. According to a forum post, this was to show &quot;how dire the state of Viktor was&quot; that he had to take fleet footwork to survive. \n\nWe're now seeing it again with Klepto viktor. A response to Urgot/Aatrox/etc. and other slow moving but strong champions where Viktor can poke and harass. A meta adaption to a common strategy? Countering the current &quot;OP&quot; picks with an unexpected and unique playstyle? Boards should be **LOVING** this! _Nope_. This is a &quot;cancer playstyle&quot; that &quot;isn&#039;t fun to play against&quot; and should be reworked or removed.\n\nEvery time I see something weird or unique come out, it&#039;s not a cool adaption to the state of the game. It&#039;s not  an evolution to playing a champion and a viable alternative. It&#039;s written off as &quot;unfun&quot;, &quot;not how the champ should be played&quot; or &quot;garbage&quot;. Taliyah becoming a jungler isn&#039;t a weird a cool new evolution of the character, it&#039;s Riot killing Taliyah and the only way she can survive is in the jungle? Even if she&#039;s still got some power in the midlane? (According to OP.gg, she&#039;s sitting at a 51% winrate and a 14% pick rate. Really killed her midlane, eh?)\n\nFor a community that looks back on the glory days of going AP Tristana, On-hit GP and more, you guys sure are quick to demand Riot remove a new playstyle whenever it appears. Who deems what is &quot;a viable playstyle&quot; and what is &quot;a bulshit adaption&quot;? Why is it that a champion going a rune-or-mastery path they don&#039;t usually go become a sign of how far that champ has fallen? Why can&#039;t we accept that maybe this champ finding success with this set-up _isn&#039;t_ a sign of the champ being in dire straits but a sign that the champ can find success with a new way of thinking?\n\nEDIT: To add an important comment from below that I made.\n\n>Again: The problem isn't \"I think Viktor should get some nerfs\", the problem is that apparently people would rather see a new and emerging build completely and utterly removed rather than balanced to accommodate a new playstyle. People don't want Viktor top to be a thing you can pocket pick, they want it removed because Viktor should ONLY BE AN AP MIDLANER AND ANYTHING ELSE IS AGAINST THE GOSPEL.

As it turns out, it&#x27;s _NOT_ that Viktor crushes any below-S-tier toplane. It&#x27;s that you need to pick the right thing against him....dare I say, an _adaption_ to what you usually play. (Unless it&#x27;s Irelia.)\n> \n> \n> Then why does Viktor have to follow the rules and get gutted rather than _breaking the cycle_ and letting small nerfs change things?

It's easy to blame a pick that's a good matchup rather than your ability to create advantages or to learn to try other champions.  Its easier to blame a teammate than it is to figure out how to improve.  And frankly this probably happens all over the place, ADCs have often been infamous for blaming sup/jg and plenty of ADC mains (myself included) blamed Riot for ruining the role when mages became optimal in bot during 8.11.\n\nBut holy shit, I don't think I've seen more blaming the game anywhere other than toplane this year.  Specifically these onetrick bruiser players who are constantly complaining about whatever ranged bully is currently popular while kissing the feet of Hashinshin.  It's understandable that its frustrating dealing with Gnar, Jayce, Ryze, Viktor, Quinn, w/e happens to be out there.  But these picks also get stomped by certain assassins, bruisers, mages, and tanks based on matchup.  There's plenty of flavors of melee champion.  But instead of adapting, we've got this culture that wants Riot to gut anything with range because that's easier than actually learning your matchup or another champion.\n\nIt's ok if you think the state of the game is better when there's more melee champions toplane, that's a fair opinion and most champions designed for the role are melee champions.  But we literally had double mage meta in S1 and there's always been a couple of floating ranged bullies in the toplane champion pool.  When dealing with melee vs ranged, melee typically gets more loaded abilities, more dashes, more power.  Meanwhile ranged has the power to kite, they always get the first shot, and if they position right they should be able to poke.  It's basically an explosive all in vs draining your opponent very generally, and while this often leans harder into one or the other I think the variety of champions available has created a healthy balance when the numbers are in a good spot... though I guess this state of the game that's been going on ever since League was live is suddenly unhealthy uninteractive garbage that should be deleted?\n\nIt's honestly disheartening how common this mindset is, but honestly Riot seems to know better than to act on whiny impulses... most of the time.  Though honestly even if Riot did listen to some of this, look at how many mages, marksman, and fighters with ranged abilities there are in the game.  Even if you keep gutting them there'll always be another one unless you delete half the champions and turn the game into \"League of Melee\".  And lets be real, at that point we're going to hear outcry about tanks because no one is poking them down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSymbolÔfPeace","date":"2018-10-28T03:17:20.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never had a problem with Viktor top, I see it as a hit or miss.
