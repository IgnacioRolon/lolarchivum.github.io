[Repertoire already made a comment about it:](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4byi37/cassiopeia_update_news/d1dipoe)\n\n>Hi all,\n>Cassiopeia&#039;s update did go to the PBE today by accident, but what you see is representative of the direction for the mid season update. It will be gone from the PBE after this weekend, so if you want to check it out and play it until then, have a blast. Also, don&#039;t freak about numbers and stuff yet. She&#039;s still an unfinished product.\n\nI&#039;m not going to mark this as some massive change or some paradigm shift in League&#039;s design cycle because, as it&#039;s said, this was an accident. However, this COULD be the start of something fantastic.\n\nSmall, controlled weekend tests could give Riot some valuable info on directions and where things are going. In fact this playtest could actually tell people what works for a kit and what doesn&#039;t, saving valuable man-hours on remaking particles and ability icons simply by seeing if the new ability will feel nice. It gives mains/players a feeling on what champions are being aimed for and, overall, it&#039;s possibly an amazing tool to give Riot feedback without worrying about what is clearly not done.\n\nPart of the issue with champ reworks/updates is that we don&#039;t get to touch them until they&#039;re done and done. We couldn&#039;t give feedback on new Fiora until she was finished. We had to wait for Garen/Skarner/Morde/Darius to be out before we touched them. So on. This could be an amazing tool to solve feedback right away and give some better insight when it comes to developing a champ update.\n\nRiot certainly doesn&#039;t have to do this but I sincerely hope they&#039;re monitoring this weekend and the feedback Cass gets. If this all goes well, this could be beneficial to absolutely EVERYONE involved. Players, Riot and otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-03-25T22:38:42.919+0000","up_votes":104,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would certainly allow Riot to gather valuable information on how a champion \"feels\" and if they do live up to their champ identity.\n\nHopefully the forst of many of these \"accidental leaks\"","replies":[{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2016-03-26T04:28:52.380+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"I bet you wish they pushed the Morde rework a month earlier so you could start telling them about things they were doing wrong before they thought they were finished.","replies":[{"poster":"PeachsProperty","date":"2016-03-26T07:04:38.832+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 hit Q's were not fun. how it even made it live i will never know","replies":[{"poster":"ImmortalBloodCY","date":"2016-03-26T12:08:52.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It never was 1 hit , it was a 3 hit combo on his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2016-03-26T14:13:29.304+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a \"3 hit combo\", but with the ratios on release Morde could use the first two hits on minions then flash and 100-0 somebody with just the third hit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-03-26T05:15:45.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"typical","replies":[{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2016-03-26T06:32:37.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:33}} OK","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2016-03-26T14:13:27.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Metal, not related with your reply.. \n\nDid you know mord is sitting in last place for mid and top, with less than 0,1% play rate? \n\nJust want you to know..
