Imagine mana viper + brutilizer, an item that gives back mana for hitting people with spells. Or maybe mana viper and bilgewater cutlass, having an active that offers a temporary boost to mana and health instead of Bork's purely HP drain.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2014-09-16T21:23:23.879+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dig the idea in order to get Jayce something in-between.

There's inherently more counterplay and more skill involved in champions that both cast skills and autoattack, and if they can manage to correctly build and play well then they should be more powerful then a basic autoattack ADC when their skills are off cooldown.\n\n\nSkills themselves don't offer more counterplay by default. \"Don't get hit\" is a little different when you're facing a 1100 range skill like Mystic Shot compared to a 550 range auto-attack. Also, auto-attack steroids like Final Hour can easily be countered by not being next to a champion, which can be accomplished through mobility, positioning, and/or crowd-control.\n\nGenerally speaking - skills that front-load all the damage you could have done with auto-attacks in a single instance as well. Rather than needing to maintain solid positioning where you're close enough to deal constant damage but in a safe position for ~6 seconds, with burst you can just unload everything in an otherwise perilous location and then dodge out a second later. Even if you get wombo-comboed, unloading a bunch of front-loaded damage will often allow you to do your job in team-fights.\nWith nothing but auto-attacks alone, you get bursted immediately and your team's at a big dissadvantage. That's mostly the TLDR on why marksman are often focused before mages - mages AoE actually makes them stronger in team-fights, but they only need 1 second to pull their weight.\n\nDoing nothing but auto-attacking is actually pretty easy to play around. Focus fire, burst, CC - pretty much any aggressive action taken against an auto-attacker is the right decision. It's one of the reasons you basically never see AD Sion.\n\n--------------\n\nAlso - concerning seeing champions, caster marksman have been a dominant force for every season but the current one. In season 1, Tri-Force Corki was considered the best marksman. In season 2 it was Tri-Force Ezreal, fallowed shortly by Corki and Graves. In season 3 there were a lot of changes, but with a re-vamped Tri-Force right before worlds - Ezreal and Corki were the top picks again. For this season, Lucian, another caster-ADC, was shaping up to be the dominant pick.\n\nWhich is fairly awkward concerning \"marksman\", the most committed auto-attacking roll has been dominated by very caster-heavy champions.\n\nAnd it makes a certain degree of sense - if you can burst hard enough it's worth using over auto-attacks and then fallow that burst with some solid auto-attacks, champions like Vayne and Kog'Maw that are pretty much limited to auto-attacking alone are already chunked to 50% health before they can respond. \n\n\n> Mid Tier Item: Scythe of Mind Stealing\n\nMy main problem with Reaver having a mid tier item is this:\n\nJayce was the most broken champion in the game when he could stack a tear by stance-dancing. Making mana-dependant champions manaless with a minimal gold investment really throws balance off.\n\nMost of the mana-dependent champions are balanced around a limited ammo count early-on. And generally speaking - mana costs tend to correlate very strongly with how front-loaded skills are. The more mana, the more they tend to be akin to blasting a foe with a rocket launcher over machine-gunning them to death.\n\nAnyways - both Muramana and Reaver require mana costs are a real gate to a champion's power early-on, where they transition into an item that offsets mana sustains rapid diminishment in importance once the lanning phase ends by essentially offering all the mana-sustain for free upon the completed item.\n\nNobody wanted manamune when it had no upgrade as the mana costing gold set back the damage potential of auto-attackers, which can really feel that hit with their exponential scaling. You kind of need to offer the mana sustain for free at some point for the item to be worthwhile - but offer it to early and big mana costs don't serve as an ammo system at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kid Freljord","date":"2014-09-16T23:04:59.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then how about a trade-off of **Attack Damage** for physical spell damage. As I see it, Essense Reaver allows AD Casters to fulfill their fantasy as well as keep their auto attacks strong.

What if we toned down the **Attack Damage** and focused the item more on ad casting?\n\n***Please note all numbers are pure conjecture and quite possibly absurd.***\n\n**Theoretically!** let's take {{item:3508}} as it is, and strip out some ***Attack Damage***\n>~~+80~~ *+50* Attack Damage\n\n*Effect: Auto attacks and AD spells are less effective*\n\n-\n\nNow let's add in a passive to make up for the lost damage on the spells\n> UNIQUE Passive **Efficiency**:\nAttack Damage ratios increased by *35%*\nAbility Power ratios increased by *20%*\n\n*Effect: Improved ratios increase the power of abilities while leaving auto attacks unaffected*\n\nIn a vacuum this item gives less damage, but the improved ratios also means items like {{item:3078}} and {{item:3072}} are more cost efficient and more than make up for the damage lost.\n \n-\n\nWith the loss of raw **Attack Damage**, the life steal component would be less effective, so it might have to be buffed accordingly\n>~~+10%~~ *+12%* Life Steal\n\n*Effect: Life steal more or less unaffected, may need tweaking*\n-\n\nNow yes your autos will be less effective, but your abilities will end up being stronger, solidifying the AD Caster fantasy.

The reason why I can't back any of the suggestions where certain features of an item are \"traded in\" is because it's pretty much not done. In some form or another, abilities from the base items are part of the final item's ability suite.\n\nTo the best of my research (which was admittedly pretty light), there are no other items which restore mana on hit from basic auto-attacks, and if mana regen is added to this item, it would need to carry over to the final build along with the mana restore. This would likely result in an increase in cost for the item, which would damage its efficiency. So the challenge we face is not only what item should we make for this (because I really can't see any existing item being added in here without upping the total cost of the item), but after making that item, how it should be applied to other times in League.\n\nAlso, please check out my Energy-based ADC with Shadow Possession ability: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/BxIn84WU-champion-concept-valruk-the-jungles-revenge","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deflar","date":"2014-09-15T21:14:39.710+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a sound idea for the Essence Reaver.

I don't feel it should be a BF Sword item, and it can benefit from being an item like BotRK, Ghostblade, etc, a good early to mid game item that can allow one to harass without being gimped by saving up for a BF Sword, and it'll save those who DO buy the BF Sword to get the Infinity Edge or Bloodthirster. Only trade off is it can take away from the Manamune, but how many of us actually build that item anyways?","replies":[{"poster":"acepil0t","date":"2014-09-16T23:10:16.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A song suddenly hopped into my head....

Having to basically wait 3200 gold is too long to finally start getting mana returns. By then you are basically out of laning phase. Plenty of good suggestions already around; but it must give AD with the mana regen part if you want ADCs to pick it up. Any item that is straight mana/CDR/not dmg will never be picked up bot lane because you will then get run over in lane by champs that get AD. \n\n2) On the topic of \"If it's too good then xyz AD assassin will abuse it!\". If that's the case, you can always put most of it's stats as unique (the CDR, mana, lifesteal, whatever) to prevent stacking. Furthermore, if you want this to be focused on ADC caster's and not on melee/mid/top AD assassins then simply add AS into the recipe. AS is something that no AD assassin ever wants, and is something that all ADC want and need. Give it enough AS that it's not stat efficient for non-ADCs and the problem solves itself.\n\n3) The lifesteal of the item is so low; I'd honestly rather see the lifesteal go away and the stats go into AD.
