It&#039;s no secret that Riot wishes they could delete this guy from the game but I think there&#039;s more to it. Yorick was the concept of a minion master pushed out to capitalize on the desire for a semi-micro heavy champion that many people were clamoring for. However, the tech for minion control didn&#039;t exist at the time and as such it ended up  really leaving people disappointed about Yorick.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to discuss here are some possible ways to make Yorick&#039;s minion-mancer gameplay work a little better, using some ideas that haven&#039;t quite been suggested yet. I know Yorick is far off when it comes to updates but believe me, I think this guy has immense potential.\r\n\r\n#1.) Ditch the Passive.\r\n\r\nYou really have to try in a kit like Yorick&#039;s to make a boring skill, so props to going above and beyond. While effective, Yorick&#039;s &quot;Unholy Covenant&quot; is the very definition of invisible power. 5% Damage/Defense per minion up is even worse when they currently last so short. What I&#039;m going to propose are a few ideas about what can be done with his passive.\r\n\r\n* **New Passive- Keeper of Corpses:** When Yorick dies, he digs himself a grave and rests. Yorick may choose to respawn from this point or to return to the fountain. Yorick may bury allied corpses as well, although this effect has an eight second channel time. \r\n\r\nAs a zombie (?) and master of undeath, Yorick never really dies. Rather, he just sort of crawls into the ground for a relaxing snooze. This tool exchanges his invisible power for a quite visible marker of where Yorick could go/respawn from. He can also bury allies, although this takes quite a long time and is the perfect chance to kill Yorick, not to mention &quot;Should I bury this decaying Ezreal or just take a tower while I can?&quot; Right now, I don&#039;t know if enemies should be able to destroy it. Likely not, as it&#039;ll make this ability neigh useless, but have Yorick have a channel time crawling out of the ground and being open to attack (6/5/4 seconds spent digging himself up?)\r\n\r\n* **New Passive- Burial Master** When allies die, Yorick has the choice of burying them. After this short burial, they arise as a omen of death for (4-8) seconds. During this time they may use abilities and summoner spells. Yorick can opt to resurrect himself when he dies for half the duration. (240-ish second CD)\r\n\r\nStonewall put it best when he said that Yorick&#039;s ultimate has an infinite power to it. It&#039;s literally one of the strongest ultimates in the game because it massively extends the life span of your carry or teammate, in addition to giving you a duplicate of them for a short time. If Yorick ever wants to be even moderately good, something has to be done with his ult. Again, I go with the burying theme. For a guy who is all about gravedigging, Yorick himself does a fairly minimal amount of digging graves. (Not to mention prevent instant rez. You&#039;ll know who&#039;s he&#039;s bringing back).\r\n\r\n#2.) Do something with his ghouls.\r\n\r\n* **Option 1- The Code approach:** Straight up, fix/change/edit/revitalize the code and allow for minions to be controlled. I don&#039;t think this will happen but I imagine it&#039;d be the quickest way to improve Yorick&#039;s identity as a minion-mancer. Keep his skills somewhat like they are now  and make him somewhat more reliant on maneuvering them correctly to force enemies to deal with the ghouls or run.\r\n\r\n* **Option 2- The Azir approach:** AKA Bugmageddon. Make Yorick&#039;s summons focus on whoever he&#039;s auto-attacking. If they&#039;re at range, the ghouls swarm on the out-of-range target while Yorick lifts his shovel and commands his little ghoulies to chew at their ankles (or Kankles in gragas&#039;s case)\r\n\r\n* **Option 3- The Gangplank approach:** What is the most unique thing about Gangplank? The fact that he acts as a melee carry but is actually ranged due to his barrels and parlay. Borrowing from the book of plank, Yorick&#039;s ghouls now permanently exist but Yorick&#039;s base AD suffers. Now, Yorick uses his minions as a proxy-melee attacker. He attacks through them, the three different ghouls aiding him in different ways: War gives him on-hit effects and movement speed boost when you activate the skill while War is up. Pestilence has a slowing field around it and leaves a cloud of sickening filth and decay in a spot when you use the skill. Famine grants life steal and gores a target, opening a magical wound others can lifesteal from.\r\n\r\nThe ghouls can still be attacked and killed, although they&#039;d get some damage/defense boosts in all of these regards. In fact, I&#039;d even argue making them permanent parts of Yorick&#039;s arsenal unless killed. Make Yorick&#039;s mana pool small so he has to burn mana, the counter being to force Yorick to constantly resummon his posse. \r\n\r\n#3.) Change his Ultimate.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s WAY too much power currently in Yorick&#039;s ult to begin giving his other spells some love. Here are some ideas on how to better thematically approach Yorick:\r\n\r\n* **New R- Omen of Death:**\r\n* **Passive:** Neutral monsters and enemy minions that die in Yorick&#039;s range are reanimated as shambling corpses. These corpses slowly decay over time and deal reduced damage. Enemy champions who die reanimate as bone horrors, dealing  base damage plus (0/25/50%) of the target&#039;s AP/AD (Depending on which is higher) as that damage. (IE: If your AP is higher, the horror will deal AP damage).\r\n* **Active:** All minions under Yorick&#039;s control are healed for (25/50/75%) of their total HP. They decay at a faster rate but have increased attack speed. Minions who die under the active effect explode. While on cooldown,  Yorick cannot summon more corpses.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s the scariest thing about zombies? It&#039;s the hoard. The massive, shambling wave of flesh and bone that slowly overruns anyone who get in thier way. I think Yorick would be far more interesting. This ability, by itself, is slow to start up. Yorick has to slowly push a wave, amassing an army of the dead as the threat of the undead goes from a harmless &quot;It&#039;s just Yorick splitpushing&quot; to &quot;THERE ARE ZOMBOS EVERYWHERE&quot; This would also give Yorick a tool to heal up his ghouls while active.\r\n\r\n* **New R- Omen of Death:**\r\n* When activated, Yorick becomes an abomination of decaying flesh. Every second he spawns (3/6/9) ghouls with reduced HP. These gjhouls attack any nearby champion or minion but prioritize enemies that Yorick is attacking. During this time, Yorick has increased range and minions are dealt (50/75/100%) reduced AoE damage.\r\n\r\nOnce more playing into the hoard of dead that frighten people most when it comes to zombies. While the ghouls this time are weak enough to be taken out with auto-attacks, the reduced AoE damage means that these monsters can&#039;t just all fall from one ryze spellflux. Much like a horror movie, you either need to run or make a valiant stand, shooting away at the mob of zombies until you either stem the tide...or get overrun. (Trust me, with someone like Jinx this shouldn&#039;t be a problem)\r\n\r\n#TL;DR\r\n\r\nBack when Riot first talked about reworking Yorick, my main criticism was that he was false advertising. People wanted a minion master of the dead but instead got a very binary, simplistic kit with minions tacked onto it. I&#039;m not proposing these ideas as 100% solutions but, as always, I like to share ideas and try to get the ball rolling when it comes to what can be done with champions like Yorick. Most of all, he&#039;s such a fantastic and interesting concept that I don&#039;t want to see him die. Necromancers and spirits of death have been done before but someone as apathetic and finding his purpose as Yorick is truly fascinating.\r\n\r\nYorick&#039;s too interesting of a person and a concept to see buried and I hope something is one day done with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Moroguna","date":"2015-10-21T11:21:45.824+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I bought him yesterday!!

I honestly love jungling with him, but the build works relatively the same regardless. It's primary goal is sticking power; once you get caught one time, they can't outrun you.\n\nIn lane, you obviously want to start {{item:2041}}, and I acutally go {{item:2003}} {{item:2004}} {{item:2004}} , because your E gives you so much sustain you don't really need the extra health potions. \n\nRush a {{item:3070}}. If you can back with around 1100G so you can pick up a long sword as well, do that. Otherwise, just go home with 720 and grab a tear and run/TP back up.\n\nTake that long sword and make a {{item:3044}} . Great early item. Turn it into a {{item:3078}} .\n\nSome people like to upgrade the Tear into a Manamune ASAP so auto attacks charge the tear, but I don't like doing that because it puts you way back on any form of health or defense, and makes your mid game really hard if you start teamfighting early, since you'll probably get blown up. So I go {{item:3053}} . Base AD boosts Trinity Force passive, gives good HP, and it's overall just an amazing item with Yorick's in-your-face playstyle. \n\nThen it's up to you. Eventually you'll want {{item:3042}} , but base your decision of when to buy it off of how the game's going. Don't feel rushed to upgrade it if you need some defense.\n\nAs for defense, I usually prefer {{item:3742}} {{item:3065}} . Let's you minimize being kited and let's you sustain fights better. They just fit Yorick perfectly.\n\nYour late game will deal plenty of damage to squishies, and you can be tanky enough to survive fights. \n\nThat's my 2Â¢.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot shoes.\n\nAnything works. I like Swiftness or defensive shoes. If you have spare gold and want the Furor enchantment (the red one), once you catch them (which you will, if you have TF and DMP), they will never, ever, get away.","replies":[{"poster":"IsmokeOregano","date":"2015-10-22T19:07:06.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds good thanks for the reply! just a question though.

(at least HOPE you can)\n\nI think what he really needs is a more interactive engaging kit that isn't just ghoul spam. hell he doesn't even need to revolve around ghouls. It can be something entirely different. With gangplank we got barrels, with fiora, we got vitals and playing around that, yorick needs something along those lines. maybe minions he kills he can leave as zombies/ghouls to zone enemies in certain spots? who knows. I have no idea what you could or should do to yorick, but he def needs a more INTERESTING playstyle for sure. the current ghoul system just is never ever going to cut it even if you tweak it. it needs to be something entirely different where there are windows he can punish you and be punished in return. I mean Ryze for example when he doesnt have his stacks up on his passive is significantly weaker than when he has them so it gives you a window where you have to back off when you see him building up stacks and a window where you can fight him after his passive wears off. Same with Gnar on his passive. I'm not saying this is the direction they should go, but they need something on that same LEVEL. \n\nI have faith in riot. most of their kits besides mordekaiser have been really interesting and engaging lately, even if the numbers have been way overtuned (looking at YOU fiora)","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-10-21T15:39:37.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"this passive, \"death is my bitch\" should be yorick's quote","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2015-10-21T15:53:10.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wreith keng plz","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-10-21T15:54:53.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMÃ¥rvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6o5NxEUp,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2015-10-21T15:53:10.512+0000)\n>\n> wreith keng plz\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JsoW6_BaYE  you're served","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-10-22T06:04:42.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">An *Unnecessary* Thread About Yorick","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2015-10-22T06:25:52.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fail to see how this is unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-22T07:34:33.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because he's already being reworked. His entire kit is being changed from the ground up like Sion. His rework started around late season 2, early season 3 when they were toning his kit down after LCS and such abused the crap out of how stupidly toxic his kit is. Unlike most kits where you can remove some power here and add power there, his kit can't have that. If any part of his kit gets anymore power, even if parts of it are lost, it's not only TOO powerful, but it's the kind of toxicity that no one wants. He's been removed from the free week because of his kit and because they're reworking him. They're not going to do the things you said, trust me. It's ALL being changed COMPLETELY. He's keeping ghouls as a center part of his kit, but they're not making it the way they did before. \n\nHe'll get his time, but since the last one working on him threw him over to a different team to work on something else, he's not the highest on the priority list. We've got Poppy to come first and she was announced about a year or so ago and we haven't seen anything yet about her new kit, so Yorick, at BEST, will be seen MAYBE next year or Season 7.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2015-10-22T12:33:02.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm still failing to see how it's unnecessary. Even with cases like Sion, Karma or (What I assume will be) Poppy, you have holdovers from the original kit and important aesthetic changes.

It's the reason why I avoided things like talking about QWE changes. Those skills HAVE to be changed because of how binary and simplistic they are.\n\nJust because he's a ways off and won't come out for 1-2 seasons doesn't mean we can't talk about him or suggest ideas.
