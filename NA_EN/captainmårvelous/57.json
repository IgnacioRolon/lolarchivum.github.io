(Yeah, some ADC items are broken but that&#039;s not the point). Rather, ADCs are being picked left-and-right in all lanes because their specialization, item diversity and sheer choices are through the roof and more in line with where Riot wants to take league.\n\nTo further understand this, we have to go back to the ADC itemization/Mass ADC update. Now, yes, there are champions who are better and were broken on launch, but the real thing this did was give ADCs powerful niches and items to compensate for any shortcoming or to enhance their own abilities. As a quick example, let&#039;s say I&#039;m playing Caitlyn.\n\nWhat do I have that I can buy in terms of how I customize my way-of-play?\n\n* {{item:3031}} to increase my raw damage output.\n* {{item:3508}} to increase my ability strength.\n* {{item:3094}} to give me stronger sieging poke.\n* {{item:3046}} to benefit my dueling potential.\n* {{item:3036}} to deal with high HP and high armor units.\n\nYou get the idea. I have tons of options to edit and customize my playstyle. While there are some items that are better for some champions, one cannot deny that most, if not all, of these items have some level of usefulness. \n\nNow, let&#039;s say I&#039;m playing Malzahar. What options do I have?\n\n* {{item:3089}} for raw power.\n* {{item:3116}} for power and health.\n* {{item:3151}} for high HP (Although it doesn&#039;t work great and only excels when paired with rylais)\n* {{item:3157}} for power and defense.\n\nI could go on but I think the point is clear. If it isn&#039;t: When I play an AP character, my options are far more limited in scope. Customizing build usually only gives me one path. If I want to burn high HP targets, I generally have to grab Rylais AND Liandries when an ADC only need Dominiks. If I want ability spam, I generally need to invest 2-3 items in just CDR when an ADC can get that much through one item and maybe boots/runes. etc etc etc.\n\nNow, you&#039;ll likely go &quot;Wow so unfair nerf ADC items&quot; but hold the horses. This is where Riot WANTS the game to go. In a perfect world, every class would have itemization options like ADCs and every tank, fighter, mage and support would have the clearest cut of roles. Are ADCs a problem? Yes, because you&#039;re comparing a 2016 product to a 2013 product. Even the small item changes Riot does make to other roles, while good on paper, don&#039;t mend the problem as they should.\n\nI&#039;m not going to try and defend Riot&#039;s speed on implementing these changes. If anything, a speed like this will leave some classes far too much in the dust to justify what they actually need right now. However, I will say that complaining about ADCs right now isn&#039;t really the issue. You may disagree with me but what I think is that we need to bring OTHER classes to the level ADCs have, not blindly nerf ADCs so that they fall in line with the old and outdated products.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-04T05:34:00.117+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Yes, because you're comparing a 2016 product to a 2013 product.\n\nThat's a great line.

They are almost by definition right click bots. And so you need to be able to diversify how you right click.

As an example, most ADC itemization falls into crit or on-hit. Mage itemization, by comparison, should have more actives and passive abilities.

Chances are they have high MR if they have high HP, so you need void staff to actually make it work. As stated by the OP, its heavy synergy with Rylai's (and also DoTs) means it's not a complete item on its own.\n\nLich Bane does not work on its own, it needs a lot of AP to scale. Overall, while it does tend to try and fill a tower killing niche, its power level is not high enough to warrant buying it unless your kit has heavy synergy with it (see Ziggs). It's mostly a burst enhancer for assassins. If it's supposed to help kill towers, it should give you some incentive to use its damage against towers.\n\nMorellonomicon tries to do many different things and kinda fails at all of them. High AP? Not really, 80 is on the low side. High CDR? Yes, but you need mana to make that work and... it's mana regen alone is good, but not good enough. The grievous wound is very hard to trigger compared to Mortal Reminder. \n\nSeraph's is a very strong item, however you need to stack it to actually access the active, so the accessibility is heavily gated. It also fills 3 niches that don't quite go together. One is a heavy mana item, another is a high AP item and the third one is a survivability item. This, plus the fact that you need to be able to fill it up quickly means it's an EXTREMELY niche item.\n\nZhonya's active is good, but it's actually killing diversity AND the item's actual power.\n\nBanner is arguably not a mage item and more of an AP scaling support item.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"63536895_DEL","date":"2016-04-04T09:07:37.348+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree with you're post but a lot of ADC's really are huge problems that the update made stupidly overpowered with no chance of being balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2016-04-04T16:10:53.104+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":">a lot of adc are problems \n\nOh yeah you mean corki and graves?

In Vayne's case it's that she can proc the 3 hits far too easily with too much safety since she can just aa-q-e you as early as level 3, meaning you CAN'T contest that most of the times and even when you should be able to, in the best case scenario you are just damaging her back trading damage for damage and hoping you hurt her more or at least have more sustain, this makes vayne pretty much a stat check like Xin Zhao, WW, Udyr, Volibear, Irelia most of the game but you also scale as an hypercarry so later on your stat check will ALWAYS be in your favour.

More games end early now in season 6 with the increased death timers and how devastating a little bit of AD is to a tower.

To make it do much of anything, you need to have insane burst, which you usually get by being ahead. If you're ahead, you need sustain less than when you're behind. Most people need to build Zhonia's to not die before ever considering Will of the Ancients.\n\nYou want to talk about limited options? The one thing that everyone can recommend you build on mages is the fucking trinity of AP items, Luden's, Rabadon's, And Zhonia's. That's it. That's 3 things you can expect a mage to build every time, and they're probably going to. Without these items, they're mostly worthless.

ADC's ar epicking up these items because although the damage is around a mediocre 20-25 damage for most adcs, it gives them a nice health bonus, and in a fight when they're supposed to be squishy, not only does it prevent them from dying by making them gain a massive shield, but then it adds another base 25% bonus to make them have up to 50-60 (remember, steraks gives you +25% base damage, so when its unique passive activates, thats another 25% base on top of the buffed base you already have from its non-unique passive) bonus ad from that item, on top of still having the massive health upgrade that they can lifesteal back to (and the synergy between maw and steraks is MORONIC on ANY ADC).\n\nSo anyways, yeah, WRONG.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2016-04-05T19:02:05.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I would agree on Iceborn had they not removed the AP from it....but since the AP was removed from it I think it is safe to say that it is pretty much solely a tank item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"forresto","date":"2016-04-05T08:15:18.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it doesn't have ap anymore. they removed that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Respakt","date":"2016-04-05T02:09:12.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iceborn doesnt even give ap anymore, 500 mana doesnt really make it a mage item","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-04-05T06:51:30.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maw, Scimitar, Sterak's, PD - you just named the four defensive options ADCs have.\n\nRylai's, RoA, Abyssal, Zhonya's, Seraph's - I count 5 for APs.\n\nThe main difference, imo, is broad spectrum (AP have both resistances and HP, as well a powerful mage-pattern active - unload, golden mode for cooldowns or your team to bail you out.

So I doubt you should really call him out on it. And Malzahar is a bad example to bring up because, quite frankly, he is a rare exception amongst mages when it comes to builds. You can build almost any type of AP itemization on Malzahar because his kit allows it. His ratios, his % damage, DoTs, mana costs, etc. all aid in this.\n\nLet me give you some examples of poor itemization choices that AP mages have.\n\n1. {{item:3153}} and {{item:3151}} . Liandrys' gives health, AP, and magic pen. And a HP% damage DoT that requires another component not found in the item to be entirely useful, thus the emphasis on {{item:3116}} . That's two item slots in order to get the best effect from this item. Now look at BotRK; it gives AD, Attack Speed, Lifesteal, gives HP% on-hit that ALSO heals, and has an active effect that slows, deals HP% damage, and heals. Requires no other items to get the best use of this. It is a one-slot wonder.\n\n2. {{item:3156}} and {{item:3157}} . Both try to give the same thing; power with a mix of defensive stats. Hourglass gives flat AP and a small amount of armor, with a stasis active. The active in itself is a powerful tool, but also conditional. Other than that, it only gives two stats. Now let's look at {{item:3156}} . It gives AD, Magic Resist, _and_ a way to penetrate Hourglass' armor with its armor pen. As well as two passives, a shield and a steroid, which require no real pre-meditated usage, and are otherwise non-conditional boosts in power. If Hourglass had a MR-pen stat added to it, it may be more in line with Maw.\n\n3. {{item:3285}} and {{item:3087}} / {{item:3094}} . Both supply similar passive effects; you move and cast abilities/attack more, you get more charges to do more damage. They both provide movement speed to help build those stacks faster, but that's about all that Luden's has going for it. It has no CDR or mana regen to help an AP caster build it up faster in combat, while Statikk and Rapidfire both have Attack Speed added onto them to make the charges come up faster. Luden's, thus, requires another CDR/Mana Regen item to make it more effective. A 2 item-slot requirement. Again, ADC raw stats beat AP itemization.\n\nClear statistics don't go for bias, my friend.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-04-04T20:02:55.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem that many people have with riot and me as well is that they create a game that thrives on a clear imbalance/favor towards certain champs.\n\nadc have been allowed to be the top dog for years and they got even more tools then before\n\njuggernauts for example even if they were broken lasted like what? 1-2 month's before they got hammered down?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnart Even Close","date":"2016-04-04T19:45:10.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think part of the problem is that adcs have crit scaling, when no other group has 4 (or 5) multipliers.  mages have only AP and magic pen, when adc's have AD, AS, armor pen, crit chance, and IE's extra crit damage.  if for example, spells could critically strike or tanks could dodge, then they would be able to have as many scaling options.  not saying this is a good thing to implement, just that it should always be part of the picture when discussing adc's","replies":[]}]}
