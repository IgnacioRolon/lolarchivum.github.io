The Map layout.\r\n\r\nWith a river that flows off the edge, an &quot;outer area&quot; with lanes and an inner area with tight jungles and water, it&#039;s quite easy to envision this map as a Zaun sewer. In addition, the base gates near the jungle are the perfect place for some hextech automated turrets that blast you down if you get too close, as they would to any rat of unusual size. (Sorry twitch).  Story-wise, the map would be a confrontation of rival chem-barons trying to screw with the other&#039;s factory plant (The nexus) and employing champions to do so.\r\n\r\n#2.) Aesthetic Variety\r\n\r\nLeague has a variety of maps. The Crystal Scar of Shurima. Butcher&#039;s Bridge in Bilgewater, the frosty abyss of the Freljord, the treeline of the Shadow Isles and the general fantasy feel of Summoner&#039;s Rift with aspects similar to Noxus and Demacia. What we&#039;ve never had, in terms of maps, is something more high-tech and steampunk-ish. This would give Riot a chance to create something quite varied/unique compared to other maps and expand the world even more.\r\n\r\n#3.) Gameplay\r\n\r\nNexus Blitz is billed as a crazy, fast-paced game with unique events happening all the time. Zaun, as a region, is unpredictable and insane. Sewer grates will fall out from under you. Giant mutated monstrosities might sneak through the sewers. Maybe there&#039;s a powerful hexcore that drops into the muck of the sewer that you want to get? The nature of this mode fit&#039;s perfectly with Zaun&#039;s reckless experimentation.\r\n\r\n#4.) Contrabands galore.\r\n\r\nZaun isn&#039;t a very legal place...so you end up with quite a few illegal things. Wouldn&#039;t it make sense to see someone pawning off a wriggle&#039;s lantern? Freshly stolen from Riot Inc.&#039;s vaults? Maybe someone wiped force of nature and wants to pawn it off to would-be champions? These boots? Taken from a shop in Bilgewater, one-of-a-kind.\r\n\r\nOverall, Zaun is a place of Chaos. A place that would work perfectly with a mode such as Nexus Blitz.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Brightmoon","date":"2018-08-02T00:32:53.625+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is a really fun idea!
