The veteran&#039;s chest is unique because the rewards inside would _multiply based on how many seasons you played._ (Played being measured by having at least 2-3 games in that season). \n\nIncluding beta, the maximum would be a multiplier of x9 (Season 1-7 + Pre-season 1 + Beta), Because of this, new players _also_ don&#039;t feel left out because they get a veteran chest as well, even though their chest will only contain a handful of items. \n\nIn doing so:\n\n* Nobody is left out.\n* Veterans are rewarded for the time spent playing league.\n* Prevents alt accounts/inactive accounts from incuring massive bonuses.\n* BE can be used in lieu of rune refund to reward players, regardless of how much they spent on runes.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this blew the fuck up. I'm glad this is at least a massive, open discussion. Special thanks to Cactopus for coming out to chat with us and I really appreciate the time they're taking to address concerns.","replies":[]}
