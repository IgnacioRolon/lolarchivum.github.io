A crackling of incredible power accompanies the introduction of discordant strings.  A portal shimmers once, twice, and then EXPLODES open in the vacuum above the planet.  String crescendo!\n\nZoom into the hazy portal.  Interior - a bedroom (much like the one in the [Warriors 2014 music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmI_Ndrxy14)) illuminated by the 'Victory' screen.  A shadowy silhouette is backlit by the glowing monitor - we cannot tell details, but it is human.  Zoom to the screen.  The cursor, accompanied by the increasingly intense drum beat, moves with uncanny speed to the X button in the top right of the window.\n\nAnd _clicks_.\n\nThe music abruptly changes - the ominous strings have returned, quieter now and magical.  The lighting in the room is different - the screen is black (artistic license).  Birds tweet outside and we think dawn might be breaking.\n\nThe figure turns to us, slowly, confidently.  Too dark in the shadows to see, their eyes nonetheless glint as we fade to black.\n\n**Introducing: The Player.**  Without which, there is no game.

But myths, legends, and stories have been about seemingly weaker guys finding a way to beat those that should be way stronger than them from time immemorial.  From Herakles defeating the giants to save Olympus, David taking down Goliath, a random knight named George who takes down a dragon.  \n\nThat there are creatures that seem to have great power is not in itself a problem, so long as they can theoretically be beaten by a guy with a shotgun you're fine.  \n\nOf course, saying that a shotgun can take down a guy who is infused with power like say, Nasus, is fine.
