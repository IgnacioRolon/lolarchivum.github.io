Imagine more items like this, things you can buy that can help you. Imagine a statless, weaker version of Zzrots that lets you keep your wave pushed when you go TP bot for 1000g. ~~Imagine a one-time component for youmuu's that boosts your attack speed for one fight.~~ (TIL Ghostblade doesn't give AS anymore.

I'd very much like League's itemization to move away from raw stats, and in general I think the game could afford to have more tactical and strategic gameplay attached to it. Stopwatch is the perfect example of a meaningful strategic choice on purchase, and an equally meaningful tactical choice on activation, as its one-use nature means it forces the user to consider whether they are truly using it at the best time, and what they're giving up by consuming the item then (similarly, this also means their opponents can exploit this as well to fight more aggressively thereafter). In fact, I think it could be interesting to have an experimental RGM where the only items offered were consumables of the same sort, which could thereby force players to plan their future encounters in much more minute detail.\n\nIf there is one limitation I'd see in this, it's that implementing more actives as starter components would most likely require those components to fit into multiple end-tier items. Stopwatch is already inserted pretty weirdly into League's itemization, as Gargoyle Stoneplate in particular really doesn't function in the same way, despite having the item as its component. There might be potential for, say, a one-use item that boosts movement speed (which would fit into Youmuu's, Merc Scimitar and Righteous Glory, perhaps even BotRK and Protobelt), or another that provides a spell shield (which could then build into Banshee's Veil and Edge of Night), as well as adjustments to current build paths (Mikael's could build off of QSS, for example), but beyond that there are a lot of disparate actives that only really exist on one item, with many more passive items or even just stat sticks after that. I think there's tremendous potential for more items like Stopwatch to fit into the game, and I think they'd bring fantastic new gameplay, but I think we'd also be likely to cap out on that potential very quickly past only a few items, if itemization remains in its current state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"An Draoi","date":"2018-01-23T04:00:10.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Items like those, I think would bring a lot of fun to support playstyles, if they had more gold income.","replies":[{"poster":"press R now","date":"2018-01-24T01:13:46.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=An Draoi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MVpKzt2u,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-01-23T04:00:10.325+0000)\n>\n> Items like those, I think would bring a lot of fun to support playstyles, if they had more gold income.\n\nHonestly they get enough already from the support items which is why like every other role is abusing them and why they are getting changed in 8.2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"See Clearly","date":"2018-01-30T23:09:59.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think stopwatch has gotten too popular and needs some re-tuning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyahc","date":"2018-01-23T19:04:47.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It would be amazing to have items like this for AP Champions honestly.\n\nAD champs get hexdrinker for a clutch save in a 1v1 but mages have no early game item to make a clutch other then stopwatch which is used by ADs as well however.","replies":[]}]}
