Please note that \"I hate this format get rid of it 100%\" is not legitimate feedback and will be ignored entirely. \n\nMostly these are currently just things I would like. I will, however, be adding more to the list as people chime in. I'll probably also add italicized/bold markings to signify when something is \"Hot\" (Requested by a large portion of the community)\n\n**Requested Forum Features**\n\n * Better support for the roleplaying community.\n * Better support for the content creation community (See: Writers, Video Producers, Artists, etc.)\n * A private message system on this forum.\n * Profile editing and/or management.\n * Subscription/Blacklist options to track or remove people.\n * Moderation improvements.\n * Tracking a specific thread.\n * Random button?\n\n**Requested Format Options**\n \n* Underline would be nice.\n* Possibly colored text, albeit with limitations to help avoid spamming.\n* Headers (These were implemented a while ago but I don't think they work anymore)\n* Quick-format options for lists/block quotes\n* Possible support for attachment embedding\n\n**Requested Forum Edits**\n\n* ~~Remove upvote/downvote button until after you enter a thread~~ Implemented, apparently!\n* Alternatively, remove the vote views from the front page all-together\n\nFeel free to add your own. I'll try to keep the list up-to-date.

Since getting custom avatars is impossible and there's no way to differentiate yourself as a regular contributor otherwise, getting recognition in the form of forum titles or a post counter would be great.\n\nAlso I **really** support getting rid of voting before seeing a thread. There have been many times I've disagreed with someone but changed my mind after hearing their argument. I fear this may be lost with people just reading and voting based on forum titles, not actually reading any threads except in order to comment.","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2013-11-19T00:55:52.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Also I really support getting rid of voting before seeing a thread.

Pressing a button is easier than the hoops I have to jump through to quote someone here.\n\nReport post/user button. Not just blacklisting, the ability to report people spewing obscenities for no reason.\n\nBetter moderation so that we can actually imbed our own images without the forums being flooded with porn.
