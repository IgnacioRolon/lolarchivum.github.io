Bear in mind, I&#039;m measuring success based on when a large amount of players could run this comp and have it be considered a viable situation. Some of these might be based on feelings but bear in mind that there is precedence for these comps existing, as well as more information about them:\r\n\r\n#The Kill Lane\r\n\r\n**Example Lane Duo:** {{champion:89}} {{champion:80}} /{{champion:53}} {{champion:107}} /{{champion:12}} {{champion:59}} \r\n**Main Apperance:** Season 2/3, although you&#039;ll see them around time and again.\r\n**Goal:** Suppression of enemy ADC\r\n**Playstyle:** Kill lanes were all about smashing an ADC at their weakest. The thought process was that if the ADC couldn&#039;t come online, what was the danger of them? Kill lanes were hyper aggressive, often forsaking farm to a degree for a chance at that sweet 300g kill gold.\r\n**Strengths:** Unparalleled Kill Potential. Powerful early game. Snowball heavy.\r\n**Weaknesses:** Weak to poke. Could be mitigated by playing safe. No tower killing potential.\r\n**Why did it disappear?:** Too inconsistent to be a viable counter-lane to the ADC/Support.\r\n\r\n#The Reign of Mordekaiser\r\n\r\n**Example Lane Duo:** {{champion:82}} and anyone.\r\n**Main Appearance:** Season 5 Worlds.\r\n **Goal:** Get someone not an ADC in bot lane.\r\n**Playstyle:** Winning. No. Seriously. Mordekaiser had stupid advantages.\r\n**Strengths:** XP sharing, strong early game. Dragon control bonuses. Sustain. Damage. No, really, lots of damage.\r\n**Weaknesses:** Ban Phase.\r\n**Why did it disappear?:** Riot learned better.\r\n\r\n#Double Targons.\r\n\r\n**Example Lane Duo:** Two melee, it&#039;s open to anyone tbh.\r\n**Main Appearance:** Early Season 4.\r\n**Goal:** Double-farming and income sharing.\r\n**Playstyle:** The general premise was that both melees would take targons and share the wave, splitting gold. This would mean that two melees using targons could not only heal up in the face of poke comps but also get twice as much value from each lane. Unlike kill lanes, these were fine with farming.\r\n**Strengths:** Sustain, shared/double income, decent DPS, depends on your picked champions.\r\n**Weaknesses:** Low turret/objective damage, could be outfarmed if ADC got too far ahead, weaker late game.\r\n**Why did it disappear?:** Targon nerfs made the item less useful, as well as ADCs still being generally better.\r\n\r\n#Ziggs Bot\r\n\r\n**Example Lane Duo:** {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}} / {{champion:115}} {{champion:143}} \r\n**Main Appearance:** Early Season 7.\r\n**Goal:** Wave clear/hard push. \r\n**Playstyle:** Ziggs could take towers and, by virtue of existing, shaved around 25% HP off every tower. With storng wave clear, Ziggs could push the wave to the tower quite often while chunking it down with passive shots. Throw in some decent CSing and some strong ranged damage and Ziggs was a good fit.\r\n**Strengths:** Surpassing ADC tower damage. Decent DPS. Powerful waveclear/pushing.\r\n**Weaknesses:** Lower than an ADC in DPS. Objective damage outside of turrets was meh. Could be countered with engage lanes.\r\n**Why did it disappear?:** ADC resurgence and support items being better for ADCs than Ziggs. Also less reliable.\r\n\r\n#Takeaways\r\n\r\nWith Riot focusing on ranged ADCs being less required, we can see some core things here. ADCs are almost always:\r\n\r\n* Reliable.\r\n* Good Objective/Tower damage.\r\n* Can come back given the chance.\r\n* Side-buffed by support items. (More than APCs or otherwise)\r\n*  Can only be countered by &quot;breaking&quot; the game.\r\n\r\nSo to make non-ADC comps work. Riot can...\r\n\r\n* Increase reliability or make the reward for non-ADC comps even greater.\r\n* Give non-ranged better objective/tower taking.\r\n* Improve the disparity if a non-ADC falls behind.\r\n* Tailor certain support items to different builds. (Imagine an AP Ardent)\r\n* Give these lanes an advantage that traditional comps do not have without making Mordekaiser two.","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2018-01-21T18:26:13.149+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember when {{champion:23}} {{champion:11}} were considered late game hyper carries","replies":[{"poster":"Deathhawk888","date":"2018-01-21T22:32:53.986+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Wood 6, they still are.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-01-21T17:53:26.609+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd call BS on that Morde bit, seeing that he's still best in a duo lane, but I hue'd so you get a +1","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2018-01-21T19:25:24.114+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser and Yorick botlane when?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-01-22T01:50:22.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way Malicious, off topic, what Metal music do you like to listen to anyway?

That's the main issue of the matter.\n\nKill lanes relied on destroying the enemy enough to be able to nullify the XP difference with solo laners by getting enough gold and gimping the enemy enough to allow their team the victory. They generally were not viable on equal skill level.\n\nMordekaiser goes around the XP problem by having a special exception intrinsic in his kit. This is not a general solution, and as a result of misjudging the impact of the effect he was the abomination that got extra levels on his opponents and beat them to death with it.\n\nDouble Targons only worked in the specific situation back then - not only was the item extremely strong, but jungle sucked vacuum back then, making it less efficient to jungle than to share the Targons-amplified resource stream.\n\nZiggs Bot worked by being somewhat less XP-dependent (only spell he really needs to max is Q) and abusing the pronounced early weakness of ADCs back then to cash in on the first tower gold and snowballing his entire team ahead.\n\n----\n\nIn truth, I don't think there is much Riot can do to enable whole different classes bot lane without breaking the game in half in the process. But, what they definitely can do is to balance specific champions around being able to work in bot lane without being overly strong somewhere else (like current Mordekaiser). \n\nTo that end, a champion could use low level-scaling effects in his kit (non-scaling cooldowns, AP-scaling utility effects, low base damage increases with ability rank...), low base-stat increases and/or level-independent scaling effects that ideally work better with more enemy champions around (i.e. Veigar's AP stacking nowadays with its champion hit mechanic, first rework Cass's passive).\n\nOh, and range, either from abilities or general. A pure melee champion is pretty much the most unsuitable XP-sharer there is, given that these champions tend to take a lot of fire when moving into range, and thus are absolutely dependent on levels.","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2018-01-22T04:12:33.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree in that it seems that currently marksman are way too reliable in the late game but far too unreliable in the early game, hence why supports dictate bot lane.

Though Designing supports / readjusting some to help Melee / APC's bot could also be a suggestion.\n\nOne thing to note is that all those Kill lanes bot back in season 2/3 were HARD engage supports things that can dive and CC heavily so the melee has a chance to get in, a Lulu with a Jarvan might not be as effective in securing a kill as a Leo / J4 would. But also due to lots of Supports having VERY heavy Shields / Stuns on LOW CD's makes it very hard for a melee to do well bot regardless of the ADC poke range. This also a problem for APC's as they cannot poke because the shield would mitigate everything and then the APC would run outta mana while now losing out to the ADC autos.\n\n**TL;DR:** Maybe don't just look at Support ITEMS for helping new champs work bot lane, but also Support ABILITYS to compliment other types of Roles","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2018-01-21T23:37:03.896+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Lots of supports were buffed / nerfed and adjusted to compliment ADC's Take Jannas Shield for example, not only does it shield an ADC for a lot of health but it also gives AD, this isnt as useful for an APC it might be decent on a fighter though.\n\nTo be fair I am pretty sure Janna shield have always given AD though Lulu W used to give MS + AP but was later change to give MS + AS","replies":[{"poster":"ArdÃ¨nt","date":"2018-01-22T01:58:55.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"With all these new runes and {{champion:164}} the answer is simple.

His Q scaled off a lot of AD and had range, his W was pretty much vayne's W but with movement speed and magic damage, and his E not only allowed for engage/escape but also gave attack speed. The reason it may not always work is due to his mega form, which if you don't get a good initiation off of, will struggle to really assist in a fight.\n\nI'd honestly consider doing Gnar bot lane quite a bit more often if it weren't for the fact that I'm kind of terrible at marksmen and the general stigma that would happen if I tried to pick him for bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pinkaj","date":"2018-01-21T22:47:47.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've done {{champion:89}} {{champion:267}}  and {{champion:16}} {{champion:412}} and {{champion:76}} {{champion:432}} and {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} \nIt's fun to have some variety","replies":[]}]}
