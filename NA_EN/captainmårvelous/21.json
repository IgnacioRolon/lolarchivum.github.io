But oh no! League doesn&#039;t have a good measure of distance! Well, that&#039;s what I -did- say until I did some digging. Bear in mind, the upcoming post is gonna have some ugly, shoddy math so try not to get too mad at me.\n\n#The Key: The Medarda Heirloom and length-by-map.\n\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/piltover/medarda-heirloom\n\nThis is what started it off. But it&#039;s not the easiest to determine. So first, we need to determine distances and &quot;length&quot; of the area. Piltover was the easiest section for me because it has a real life comparison: The Panama City/Panama Canal. Both are port cities that bridge together two small continents and serve as an important hub. The two also look similar, albeit Panama is horizontal while Piltover is vertical.  See here:\n\nhttps://puu.sh/zbGhX/dc716b5369.jpg\nhttps://puu.sh/zbGii/c619a39215.jpg\n\nThis is where we get into rough estimates. Using google maps, I measured that the edge of this section of land from one end to the other (With panama in the middle) is roughly 190 miles or roughly 306 kilometers. \n\nhttps://puu.sh/zbGom/d8162e6c54.jpg\n\nWe&#039;ll use this as a measure. We&#039;ll call it one &quot;CM&quot; because ~~I&#039;m arrogant~~ ~~I&#039;m egotistical~~ ~~I need validation~~ so we have a rough key of distances.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ednYA8r.png\n\n\n#The Second Step: The Big Map\n\nFor this part, we lack an official league map. Luckily, an incredibly talented player named Killaburn made [his own examples of what the map is](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/cfOmlZyt-my-vision-of-the-runaterra-map-some-concepts) and what it&#039;d look like. I think this is a great example so we&#039;re going to be using it.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EAkP2la.png\n\nThat said, his map is so big that one CM wouldn&#039;t show up on it. So we&#039;re going to multiply it by 3. 3 CMs or, as well call it, One KB.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iS42LyD.png\n\nAdd a grid to with a key.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/hpEdq8C\n\nAnd add rough dots based on capitals Killaburn suggested!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VMueWVf.png\n\n#Part 3: Distances and Travel\n\nBut we&#039;re not done yet! According to the Medarda Heirloom, it takes one day (Roughly 24 hours) to travel from Piltover to Kumangra by boat. This is _roughly_ the length of one CM. A [Spanish Galleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(galleon)) has a speed of roughly 5 knots, or roughly 6 mph or 9 km/h. Considering that&#039;s 216 km or 144 miles, it can be inferred that Piltover uses ships that are either steam powered or are faster than old, standard ships. We&#039;ll assume a ship goes about 8 mph/12.75 km/h.\n\nTo make some rough estimates:\n\n* From Piltover to Demacia is roughly 26 days or so.\n* Piltover to the Freljord would be around 38 days. (Over a month!)\n* Noxus invading Ionia had a travel time of roughly 9 days.\n\nThe other thing to remember is that these are on a boat. If Runeterra was completely flat and you walked at a standard human walking rate (3 mph or about 5 km/h) which means you&#039;d cover 72 miles/120 km in a day, it would...\n\n* take you 2 and 2/3rds of a day to walk one CM without stopping/resting/eating.\n* take you roughly 8 days to walk one KB\n* take you roughly 32 days of walking to go from Piltover to Noxus.\n* take you 136 days of walking to go from Targon to the shores of Ionia.\n\nAgain, these are all rough measurements using a fan map and some speculation. That said, I hope this helps if you ever plan on writing a world-spanning adventure from one nation to another!\n\n-Cap","replies":[{"poster":"BestJhinUniverse","date":"2018-01-28T23:09:46.970+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically there is no traveling from noxus, because all lands are noxian lands. \n\n{{champion:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"Johnny El Rojo","date":"2018-01-28T23:10:30.926+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are noxian lands, and soon to be noxian lands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-01-28T23:39:26.968+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:240}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-01-28T23:10:57.048+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You stop that Swain","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2018-01-29T15:08:23.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"wrong; all lands will be claimed by the mist and their king Mordekaiser shall rise above them all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-01-29T05:12:10.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BestJhinUniverse,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UxQOEsrW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-28T23:09:46.970+0000)\n>\n> Technically there is no traveling from noxus, because all lands are noxian lands. \n> \n> {{champion:50}}\n\nSwain pls.\n\nhttps://memegenerator.net/img/images/600x600/12209172/velma-you-stop-that.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"V The Support V","date":"2018-01-29T04:16:36.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"INB4 Biolum let's us all know that this is _Her_ jam and provides insights.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-01-29T04:37:21.672+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=V The Support V,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UxQOEsrW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-29T04:16:36.986+0000)\n>\n> INB4 Biolum let&#x27;s us all know that this is his jam and provides insights.\n\n *Her jam ;)\n\nHere I was wondering if it was bait - but that was way to self centered of me.

My.  Gosh.  You have all _that_ figured out?  Woo!\n\nI have a question, then.  How long would Taliyah need to surf that same route from Nashramae to Shurima?\n\nIf you want to enter more detail, then...\n-Would it matter whether she surfed on her rock or rode her Weaver’s Wall?  We saw her ride both and use the latter to speed up during her trailer.\n-How does she handle drag and sand blast high-speed travel over dunes would cause?  Moving at high speed could make holding onto the rock difficult. Stoneweaving lets you move stone, but since sand is Azir’s theme, I wouldn’t expect her to be able to move it.\n-Are there terrain effects?  Can she move faster or more easily over bare rock than, say, dunes or earth?\n-How long can she surf without rest?  Is it just like surfing on a surfboard, or does she have to push herself along with magic?","replies":[{"poster":"efflam","date":"2018-01-30T01:39:04.332+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're gonna laugh, but at some point, Bio's document **did** contain Taliyah rock surfing speed estimates.\nBioluminescence is {{champion:74}} confirmed.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos von Faneli","date":"2018-01-30T11:04:41.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=efflam,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UxQOEsrW,comment-id=0001000000030001,timestamp=2018-01-30T01:39:04.332+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re gonna laugh, but at some point, Bio&#x27;s document **did** contain Taliyah rock surfing speed estimates.\n> Bioluminescence is {{champion:74}} confirmed.\n\nyou guys would... llol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-01-30T10:45:10.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=efflam,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UxQOEsrW,comment-id=0001000000030001,timestamp=2018-01-30T01:39:04.332+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re gonna laugh, but at some point, Bio&#x27;s document **did** contain Taliyah rock surfing speed estimates.\n> Bioluminescence is {{champion:74}} confirmed.\n\nLaugh?

Like you have the Mount Targon thats the ever changing magical mountain, but the mountains around it is the Great Barrier. It would fit for a Great Barrier being the barrier against the western rain shadows that prevent mosture to come to the dry deserts of Shurima.
