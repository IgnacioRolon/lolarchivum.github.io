This really is just a &quot;second life&quot; punishment for hitting him down. Why does a bear have a regeneration mechanic? Because &quot;A bruiser/tank needs some manner of sustain&quot;.\r\n* Q- MS boost plus a flip. There&#039;s no creativity to this skill, it was a sandwich between Garen Q but with a Singed flip. The animation is cool but it feels quite unsatisfying to just run up and flip one person. &quot;A bruiser/tank needs some kind of hard CC and gap closer&quot;\r\n* W- Bonus AS with an execute. The &quot;We want him to jungle&quot; skill. Slap them three times, bite, that&#039;s about the sum of it. &quot;A bruiser/tank needs the ability to jungle and have threat&quot;\r\n* E- AoE slow with a fear component. The fear is an interesting part that separates it from just another generic slow...but outside of that, it&#039;s still kind of bland. A short AoE slow where the minion fear doesn&#039;t really come into play. &quot;A bruiser needs sticking power&quot;\r\n* R- The actual interesting part of his kit. Volibear&#039;s thunder claws really make for some neat builds and splitpushing/teamfight potential. If there was one skill I&#039;d want preserved in some manner, be it an ultimate or turned into a basic, it&#039;s this.\r\n\r\nYes, you could apply my arguments to almost any champion but Volibear just feels unsatisfying. His kit doesn&#039;t feel particularly unique outside of his ultimate and he really doesn&#039;t bring much to the table in terms of meat shield or raw damage. With a concept like a thundering armored bear, Riot really let this guy fall into obscurity and didn&#039;t give him anything interesting. Hell, how many people actually KNOW Volibear exists? Sure he gets to the job done but he&#039;s so forgettable kit-wise that most just pick him for the sake of aesthetic if they really like bears.\r\n\r\nI hope Riot has some plan for Volibear because he needs a stronger gameplay identity. This mishmash tank bruiser thing is a really gross holdover from S2.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-30T21:30:19.018+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I hope Riot has some plan for Volibear because he needs a stronger gameplay identity.

Thanks for taking time to chit-chat! There were a few reasons I wanted to touch on Voli-\n\n* 1.) He's forgotten most of the time. Most people really don't know about Volibear or gloss over him. The simplistic kit really doesn't do anything in his favor either.\n\n\n* 2.) Volibear has IMMENSE potential. character-and-kit-wise Unlike other ursine characters (Ursa, Druids of the Claw, etc) who are often portrayed as hulking brutes but rather stupid outside of \"NATURE!\", Volibear is not only wise but an advisor to the Winter's claw. He's a warrior but he's patient, intelligent and probably the smartest in Sejuani's little clique.\n\n\n* 3.) I made this thread mostly because when people talk about champions in need of updates or reworks, you see the same problem cases brought up over-and-over. Taric has pizza feet. Poppy is a monster. Yorick is a pile of trash. Evelynn has no clear identity, etc. While, as you said, Volibear isn't an immediate pressing concern, he still has problems. IMO it's important to shine light on guys who may not be a direct problem but could still need some love.\n\n\n* 4.) He needs a real name. Someone gave up on naming this guy halfway through. \n\n\n* 5.) Juggernaut/Tanks are coming back in a major way. I feel it was important to bring up one of the less spoken-off Juggertank characters. You see stuff talked about for Shyvana, Olaf, Garen, Darius, etc but poor old Volibear is clawing at the windows hoping for someone to let him inside.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-31T01:34:21.650+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I feel it was important to bring up one of the less spoken-off Juggertank characters.\n\nI don't think we ever shared this, but when we started working on Juggernauts earlier this year (before we were even calling them that or anything), Volibear was in the group of characters we were considering, and we even got so far as to playtest some stuff for him.

I think we should totally change his kit.\"\n\nSometimes, he just can pan out to be the greatest pick, but do people really feel like he's \"lackluster\"??? Plenty of other factors go into the way he can perform in a game. Things/events that turn out in a single match itself, team comps or IDK how bout the god dang TENACITY NERFS. Mercury's treads nerfed, Elixir is nice... when I can afford to take over finishing an item. You pretty much gotta have the elixir and boots to get anything that actually feels like Tenacity. And why is it that I gotta take a Resolve Keystone to get 15% Tenacity? Why are the keystone Masteries called Keystone masteries but the five points i gotta spend above them aren't? Meanwhile I have to then choose between only taking one other mastery tree's % increases for my bite.\n\nahh.. I digress. Just saying a lot of factors add up to affect this champ besides his kit.  Voli gets away with a lot. He can do things no one else can. But he still has problems. Let's keep those problems, but decide how disastrous they have to be for him by nerfing fiora or the mages or something :)\n\nYou could buff his Q.

Yes, you still can't uses your W because you have to build up your stacks again but it be cool. Like at 3 stacks E it's a Bigger AoE and it fears champs and his Q either makes him do a dash because of how much power he's using or make him have a faster speed. \n\nFor his Ult I love that you made his range longer for the lighting and made it that the slow from {{item:3116}} would work. I will say I love the idea of him shooting out lighting when he does his animation for his Ult and this lighing shoots out of him. But it's only one. I think it be cooler if it was 4 that can also hit chain 4 champs, but it can only stack up 2 times per champ. So if 1 champ get's hit by 4 chains of lighting it would only be the damage of 2 (150/230/310(0.6AP)). This would make his ult seem more bad ass then he stats it up. Then the rest what he does normally does for his ult. I was thinking of giving him a passive for his ult but I think it be to much because of the idea of the idea for his activation for his ult. It seems to me what you guys were thinking of making Voli AP when you made him and I don't see people doing AP on him. so I was thinking of him converting AP into Armor because he's the armor bear.\n\nBut yeah I don't think he needs everything reworked but I thought he could be like updated and given some cool new tools. \n\nP.s. If would also be cool to have a %AP on his Q because of the tornado that's made when he flips a champion Please.

His attack speed is a bit slow to get his 3rd W charge, especially since you build him more tank than attack speed. You would build a Randuin on him before you ever get a Phantom Dancer on him. There's no tank item with attack speed to help him get his W up when he needs it in fights. That, and in fights, after you bite one person, you're kind of useless for 10-15 seconds. Even enemy has hard CC, you won't be able to get out of the fight in time for to use your bite again. Even if you were able to, it'd take too long to get another W charged up again. Your team can't wait 10+ seconds for you to be useful again and you're going to die before it's off CD if you stay in the fight instead of getting out after you use it once.\n\n2. When a champion has a tough laning phase, they can always wait it out to be useful later. Like Nasus, or a Riven after she gets her first few items and can then nuke ADCs. However, a behind Volibear is a horrible Volibear. Period. Late game?? Please. He won't last that long. When you get behind, it's easier for ADC to kite you with their faster attack speed and with their mechanics, which in higher ranks, people know how to kite very well and you won't have the items to be able to catch them. Even if you manage to get your items, enemy will be further ahead for you to kill them in time. Volibear needs to be ahead to be any good. Even or behind is kind of meh, and Volibear can't always snowball his lane.\n\nHmmm, I feel like I'm forgetting something on that. Well, I would like a little faster attack speed, maybe 2-3 sec less CD on W, and would really want a better quality skin for him like Runeguard but with white fur. Like 975-1350 quality with white fur. Kind of wish his Runeguard skin can just be changed to white. HE'S A POLAR BEAR, NOT A BROWN BEAR.\n\nOh. I remember something now. His Q. Man, there is no hope for that. Some champs can just kite that crap for days. It's not very reliable. Unless they manage to let you get 2 inches from them, then charge and get them. Mobile champs>Volibear, and there's just too many mobile ones that can easily escape his Q for anyone to bother playing him. You would basically need a champ or two like Jarvan or Vi to help him get his target. He has no mobility cause his very strong bite makes up for it, but neither is that reliable or much good, especially after one use.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-08-31T00:08:00.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gin Gomi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ElxUeEAn,comment-id=00040004,timestamp=2015-08-30T22:32:35.954+0000)\n>\n> Oh.

But I'm not sure making his Q more reliable is the answer...I mean, his kit basically leaves him the same as Garen, easily kited but terrifying if he catches you. Garen can remove slows, making it easier for him to get on you, but I'd argue that Voli is way scarier when he DOES get on you, since he can execute so much more often.\n\nI think they need to take the concept of Voli's chain lightning and run with that. Garen is scary one on one. Darius is scary if he can get into the middle of your team. I think Voli should be particularly scary in skirmishes, where he deals the maximum amount of damage when he has 2-3 champions to pound on at once. That would improve his ganks as a jungler, since if he gets on you, he can do some real damage, and it would make him one of those top laners that does really well turning and standing his ground against a gank, like Renekton or Aatrox.\n\n\nOkay, just to throw this out there: What if his W passive caused his autos to cleave and hit 2 additional targets, instead of ramping his attack speed up? And his autos and cleaves marked enemy champions? Then his active could be to launch a single blast of chain lightning that jumped between all marked targets (provided they were within \"chain\" range of one another) and also damaged anything in the lightning's path, consuming the marks in the process?\n\nAs for his Q, one thing I think that would help would be to make it so he runs through minions when he uses it, and either have it clear slows like Garen, or give it scaling slow resistance.\n\nE...what if Voli could tether himself to a champion with lightning? Say, give the move 600 range or something, and have Voli tether himself to a champion for 2 seconds. During that time, any time Volibear suffers crowd control, his tethered target suffers from the same crowd control. That wouldn't stop champions from running from him, but they couldn't just fire a slow/snare skillshot at him and spam laugh since they know he has to run in more or less a straight line at them. Vayne pushes him away? She gets shoved in the same direction and is no farther away from him than she was before. This would probably be a little too strong in teamfights though :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"corals","date":"2015-08-30T22:43:53.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a lot of him, till his kit got kind of stale. I love his ultimate, but beyond that its hard to pin down what I like about him.\n\nI have mixed feelings about his bite. I think it takes up a lot of his power budget, and its damage can be brought down in exchange for a cooldown reduction. With the power shifted else where. But then I feel like that would make him less unique, since then his W would be more like elises and other nukes. Just an ability with ok damage that gets a little better at lower health.

Awhile back, we started some early exploration on Volibear that unfortunately didn't really go anywhere promising. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but I figured the response was better than nothing. I'm sure we'll give him another look in the future, but there's nothing really concrete planned at the moment.\n> \n> Since you didn't seem to specifically mention it, is there a reason you're interested in Volibear? Is it that you like him and would like him updated/modernized? Or is it more just a general reminder to us that he's bland?\n\nI think Volibear should uses his frenzy as a niche, Like giving him the power to make his Q and E better when he has all 3 of his frenzy stacks. Like His Q makes him run faster and do more damage than his normal q and his E range is bigger and champs can be feared for 1.5 secs. Of course he can still not use his w without his stacks. So you have to make a choose. \n\nI was thinking for his Ult Sense it shoots out a chain of lighting when activated that is can shoot out more than just one. Like 2-4 but 2 chains lighting is the max a champ can be damaged by. He's also at full frenzy stacks after the activation. \n\nAlso for his Q I really like to add on some AP% on it and when he flips a champ when he has thunder claws activated. The damage from the thunder claws hits twice. \n\nTell me what you think. I think it's op but I'm trying to think of ways to scale this back something. I was mainly trying to think what would be a good niche for voli and a better ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-08-30T17:35:29.818+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be careful, you might get what you wish for.

I have had him for a while, but just recently played him a lot and powered to L5 mastery with him. He's great, but I will also agree that his kit is a bit boring and meh. I like his q, but I also agree that maybe making it more Champion specific would be cool, that he barrels minions out of his way in a direct line to a champ, as opposed to accidentally flipping a minion over his back. And yeah, his E is pretty lackluster. I love his W, and his R is great, but maybe some spicing up would be nice. Keep the passive the same, I love it.\n\nThe other thing I do feel is lacking is dmg output. I build him straight tank because I feel that is how he scales best. With jg item and all the items, at L18 I'll be getting close to 6k health, and when his passive its he heals for a big chunk of that. But unless I'm really carrying and it's an easy game, it's hard to build dmg items on him because I feel that it doesn't work as well.

Sunfire Cape and Thornmail only work as intended and only do so much. You gotta work out your combos and get a better feeling on his burst vs dps capabilities when playing towards a certain ends and building your items as the means towards those ends. I think Volibears damage is great. It's the challenge of creating the right circumstances for it be dealt. Just one damage oriented item and Volibear can kill any squishy in a matter of seconds. As long as he doesn't get his attacks interrupted to such a degree that his combo was ruined. Mid to late game Voliebar can have ~3.75k - 4.5k and ~175 - 225 Armor/Magic Resistance and STILL land a 2-3 second combo on an adc and make a fight 4v5 damn near instantly.

His W giving attack speed and his Ult having chain damage, AOE damage upon activation and an attack reset from his Q to help land successive hits.

You keep building full tank all his damage will end feeling out scaled ha ha. His is Q is AD, E magic damage. Both with decent utility. Flip is no joke and its incredibly unique. It's always going to be good and can carry a lot of nuance. His E has decent range and is just a simple click, and its AOE. \n\nHis ult lasts 12 seconds. How many people have you killed from hitting the chain strikes onto a minion wave? You know that the Ult increasing his model size gives him a greater auto attack range right?\n\nIf you're absolutely just not sure when to use his ult then I think it'd be a good start to think of it as Trundle's Ult. And use when you use your ult as Trundle. \n\nHis passive is straight up quality but even then it actually IMO becomes less important the farther into the game you go. \n\nAnyways, I could go on and on. But what I'm trying to say is that Volibear, for being a very mechanically simple seeming champion, can get really nuanced and that strategy is left being your key ally to using his kit. His kit is actually LOADED with stuff and there's nothing left to do.IMO it all adds up, working together to make a very balanced and unique champion. All of those things are already there Riot would have to straight up delete Volibear.","replies":[]}]}]}
