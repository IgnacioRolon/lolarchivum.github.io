You made it quite clear that GP and Trist got visual and minor kit updates (even though GP's E was completely changed, his R got bonuses, his Q lost its slow, his passive got completely changed, and his W got minor tweaks (as well as a completely new model; twice)) so they aren't on the same scale. Sion and Poppy went from Fighters to Tanks. Taric went from a Support/Fighter to a Support/Tank (why hasn't it been changed yet on the PBE? I don't care if his abilities are just tweaked versions of what they once where, his W and E are even more like a Tank's CC and his Q and R are basically support stuff. His Q still works off of bonus health. His passive, W and E do stuff with his armor.
