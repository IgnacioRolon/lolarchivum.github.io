Perhaps you never learn the more nuanced aspects of the game playing like this, but you certainly can, at the very least, become proficient at your champion.\n\nSurprisingly enough, I've seen counterexamples to this. I used to play the original CoD all the time, and eventually got _very_ good at it. Yet in that entire time, I saw some people pick the game up and reach a high skill level in a _very_ short time (read: maybe a year or 2 instead of the 4-5 it took me) and I saw others that improved some, and then seemed to 'flatline' and not get any better (I eventually surpassed those people), and I even saw a few people that played _all_ the time and yet never seemed to get any better.\n\nThe only explanation I can think of for these observations: A player's skill has an upper bound set by how they approach the game and learning it. Those who _bring their thinking caps_ and intend to learn things as they play will gradually improve but not in the smooth fashion that people imagine, rather, skill increases happen in fairly distinct steps contingent on the player mastering a new skill or technique and then learning how to apply it productively in game. Those who don't come as willing to learn, or feel that they have 'learned' the game will stop improving. They very best players are eternal students of the game, always learning. I myself had a pretty noticable and significant skill increase when I finally understood how to macro play effectively. I promptly went on a massive winning spree and increased my W-L diff by about over +20 in just 100 games. I noticed the caliber of play from the other players in my games increase over the course of that as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2017-05-07T20:18:51.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SteelMankind,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sEKxxTKg,comment-id=00010002000100000000,timestamp=2017-05-07T19:12:32.590+0000)\n\nWell there's a bunch of different things to address here, each about something entirely different, so let's start with this:\n\n> Sadly, I have pretty low self-esteem, so I actually do need to. \n\nThing is my posts(and well pretty much everything else here), talks about skill level, not about your visible elo, if you only play normals on a challenger skill level this applies to you the same as it applies to someone who only plays ranked on a challenger skill level(well actually playerbase is a bit thin on the challenger skill level, but you get the point), there's really no mention of the elo shown, elo and rank here are purely used to describe skill levels, not whatever your rank is.\n\nSo even if you feel the urge to argue with people who say that everyone who doesn't play rank is noob, this is just not relevant here, as it isn't something I've said or is actually relevant to the arguments made.\n\nAlso, if you have low self-esteem won't a higher rank possibly improve it?(I'm not gonna question why a video game rank would matter to one's self esteem, as it apparently matters quite a bit to a lot of people)\n\n>Objectively, I know I&#x27;m better than silver, because I am typically the only one without a Plat/Dia border in the loadscreen, but when people challenge the notion that a low elo player can know a thing or two about their main champ&#x27;s mechanics, I get defensive.\n\nWell I want to reply to it, but one thing I want to say first is that this has nothing to do with anything said so far, anyway there are two sides to this problem:\n1) You claim to be of diamond(or at least plat) skill level, yet also claim yourself(fine, heavily imply) to be a \"low elo player\", that makes no sense, there's an obvious contradiction here.\n2) You kinda need to understand the point of view of others talking(or writing, whatever) with you, if you're truly diamond material you can prove it, instead they need to analyze your match history, people here(and in general) are used to people having an inflated ego, it's sensible for them to doubt your claims that you are unranked with a diamond skill level, as many claim to be so, but very few actually are.\n\nI've tried my luck with seeing how good sites are at deriving your skill bracket from your performance and it his been a huge pain(They just throw you a number, which either it's not clear what it means, or its meaning doesn't seem feasible), so I've just opened your match history and tried to see what the average skill level in games is(which again was a huge pain) and seems to be mid-low plat(I mostly see stuff ranging from low diamond to low gold), granted we can start an argument that my sample size was small, but in a discussion where skill is important, and where everyone will naturally be expected to be inflating everything about themselves(it's the internet after all), is expecting them to go through your match history really sensible?\n \n> And for the record, I really struggle against people D3 or higher, and can only play one or two champions anywhere close to that level, so I&#x27;m not one of those delusional low elo players who thinks they can hit Master/Challenger.

For instance; if riot decided that all champs should only have 1 passive and that If any champ has more than 1 passive then all champs shall have more than 1 passive; a guideline like this could've have avoided BS like Vayne having an added passive like Silverbolts to her kit or take perhaps the much hated Yasuo with his overloaded kit. A lot of issues stem from Riot having a lack of discipline to character/item creation. I understand character diversity, but we've come to the point that where if a champion isn't somewhat offering some form of complicated form of gameplay, whether it's Lucian to Thresh, they'll eventually lag behind as their kit is too old to continue, hence, champs like Garen, Mundo, fall behind while Ryze hits an all new high in character reworks. Such Guidelines could've forced Riot to make sure all champs/items remain relevant or at least more balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-05-07T04:58:21.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My issue there is that it stifles design. Rules/Guidelines shouldn't be forever word-of-god-static-things because the game and players change. Especially in a game like League or DOTA. If you make a hard rule such as \"You can only have one passive\", it stifles design. The point here is that the design isn't what is at fault but the _balance_. (Just as a fun example, compare DOTA2's Sven or Wraith King to a hero like Ember Spirit or Earth Spirit. The difficulty scale is off the charts by comparison because the design evolved.)\n\nThe other issue is that when all gameplay is simple, you end up with even worse situations. Oh, sure, not for bronze-to-gold but for the highest echelon, you absolutely do. Why do you think pro play got to the point of \"Here are the ten best characters\"? Mostly due to how many champions are too close together. Hell, your argument doesn't even work all -that- well because there are some unreworked champs from incredibly early seasons which still see play. Alistar played exactly the same for years and yet he was still a terror. Gragas' only huge change was moving his W from a channeled buff to an empowered AA and yet he's still everywhere. \n\nAll this is just design arguments however. Which is fine if you want more simple champions. I'm of the mindset we need less of them and that we need even more complex champions. The problem goes back to the balance issue.

I do have experience at high levels in other PvP oriented games so I can hopefully offer something to contribute to this discussion. I see quiet a few people here advocating that balance should be centered around diamond and higher, and this way of thinking isn't new or unique to league.  When you visualize the player-base of any game like this, it becomes a pyramid, with the top of the pyramid only existing because of the base.  The top players are only on top because of the millions of people who log on every day and lose games, and the company only exists to provide this game because of those millions of players spending money.  According to league of graphs, bronze and silver players make up roughly 70% of the player-base.  Imagine if all of them left, do you know of any company that could survive a 70% lose of revenue?  Again if this happened, the top players now would become the below average players tomorrow.  Gold the new bronze, plat the new silver and so on.  Everyone would shift left.  So what about those diamond players today who would be gold tomorrow? they didn't suddenly lose game knowledge over night, nor did they actually get any worse mechanically. They just suddenly fall under the arbitrary \"you must be this good to have an opinion line\" that by definition can only exist because enough people are \"bad\" enough to be under it.  The top players will always adapt, they will always learn faster and play smarter than the lower ranks.  You cant balance around them because they are good enough to play around whatever balance changes are made.  But what is a minor annoyance for the top 10% can be absolutely game breaking for the bottom 70%, and that is a terrible way to run a business.\n\nIn the interest of fairness I will admit that in other games, when I was at at the top .5% level i also believed that only the opinion of the higher ranks mattered. \"Why should they listen to you about class balance, clearly you don't even know how to play your own class, let alone speak to larger issues of game-play\" .  But at what level of play do you magically decide that an opinion matters?","replies":[{"poster":"ThugWalrus","date":"2017-05-07T18:19:13.929+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you said \"what is a minor annoyance for the top 10% can be absolutely gamebreaking for the bottom 70%.\" I actually think the opposite is true. When it comes to champions at least, lower level play always has a higher level of diversity by default as lack of proper macro and micro play by your enemies allows champs that would normally be oppressed some breathing room, while lack of mechanical prowess can make \"oppressive\" champs seem fair. \n\nOn the other hand, top-tier and pro play is so finely tuned, as minor disparities in power can result in large advantages. This results in only a select number of champions being picked at these levels to begin with. If you stopped giving priority to top tier play, the staleness would set in very rapidly and be far more persistent than in lower levels of play.\n\nI also think that lower tiers adapt almost as easily as pro-players, just in different ways. Even somebody in Bronze 5 is capable of adapting to balance changes, it will look far different than what a diamond player does, but it doesn't mean it will less effective for their level of play. It's not like the 70% would just stop playing if Riot starting balancing exclusively for top-tier play anyway. Some would probably leave, but you would still have a huge playerbase with the \"pyramid\" in tact. I think you are overselling the impact that it would have. Balancing for pros probably wouldn't even be an official decision, but rather something Riot just started doing behind the scenes, so you wouldn't have the protest people exiting on principle, just the same grumbling and speculation about Riot only caring about pros.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2017-05-08T11:42:46.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not knowledgeable?\n\n**Bro, you just stated the contrary with that gold comment of yours.**\n\n_Feel free to comment anytime soon._","replies":[{"poster":"Exercise85","date":"2017-05-09T02:02:56.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saevum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sEKxxTKg,comment-id=00070003,timestamp=2017-05-08T11:42:46.877+0000)\n>\n> You are not knowledgeable?\n> \n> **Bro, you just stated the contrary with that gold comment of yours.**\n> \n> _Feel free to comment anytime soon._\n\nNot sure if you are being sarcastic or not, but I will choose to believe in your sincerity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreampod","date":"2017-05-07T17:25:38.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason that it makes more sense to balance towards high level play rather than low level is that skill variability and character familiarity are much more influential to outcome than character balance at that level.

While this is a competitive game, the money doesn't come from the high end competition.  I think much of this mentality can be blamed on the push for Esports to be recognized as a legitimate sport.  This may seem off topic, but lets compare the LCS to the NFL to illustrate why balance needs to be mostly centered around the largest player base.  The NFL has millions of viewers tune in each week that havnt touched a football in years, and a large majority of them have never played 1 full football game themselves.  Compared to the LCS, almost ever viewer is an actual player of the game.  The NFL does not rely on sales of footballs at the local sporting goods store to stay in business, because they dont gather viewers primarily from existing players.  Riot on the other hand, does get its revenue and viewers primarily from existing players.  In the NFL the spectacle of the game is the end product, that is what is being sold, but for riot the top level play is just the billboard for the game, the end product is a large player-base.  Is it fun to watch and talk about with other like minded players, absolutely.  We should not, however, kid ourselves into thinking that top level play is anything more than marketing.  Its something flashy to incentivize players to pay money for something.  Which would hurt the game more, the top 10% (diamond +) of players leaving, or the bottom 40% (unranked and bronze)?  I do realize that there is a difference between diamond level and the LCS, but really, with the LCS being a thing why should they listen to lowly diamond players when they have a pool of current and former pro players to talk too? it all depends on where you want to draw that line.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Fish Nami","date":"2017-05-08T05:16:53.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, thanks for replying!\n\nSecond of all, i think you are right.

I'd recommend watching [Ghostcrawler's talk about balancing League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii_Q4OCoHvU), because it explains their base idea and the reasoning behind their balancing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-07T18:53:17.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You see, they need to balance around lower tier play because if they don't they are essentailly telling something around 70% of the playerbase to go fuck themselves.\n\nKeep in mind that the top 25% still has silver in it.\n\nhonestly they should just not balance for pro play, in most games its pretty normal for top tier player to have very limited choices to make when it comes to character selection or strategies to employ.\n\nEDIT: Should have also mentioned that D+ (which is what everyone thinks we should balance around for some reason) is 2% of the playerbase, and is essentially too small for riot to properly balance with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vectros","date":"2017-05-08T02:25:48.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've thought this for a while...\n\nWhy can't Riot make 2 separate states of balance? One for ranked, one for unranked?\n\nI believe this is possible, just a lot of work. We know they can create different items and balances for different modes, which means they SHOULD be able to make 2 separate states of balance for ranked vs unranked.\n\nUnranked would cater to lower Elo. Pub stompers like Yi would see nerfs; the harder to use champs would see buffs.\n\nRanked would be the opposite. It'd be balanced around pros-a champion not seeing any play there will get buffed. One who is picked every game gets nerfed, etc.\n\nThere's only 2 issues I can think of with this system. The first being the time it'd take to make 2 separate patches. Then again, this is the most popular video game in the world. I imagine Riot has some extra cash lying around that could go towards hiring a second balance team.\n\nThe other issue would be getting used to having separate balance patches in ranked and normals-which arguably could make practicing for ranked difficult. However the kits would remain the same-no reworks between the two, simply number buffs/nerfs in each to fit the environment it's going for.\n\nI don't believe this would ever happen but I can't think of a good reason not to do it.

In fact it'd be highly advertised-probably the first time you click it, a huge ass banner would pop up saying it runs with different numbers for balance purposes, with a link showing who is buffed/nerfed. A permanent banner/warning would probably get placed when you're selecting ranked in red letters as a reminder.\n\nAlso you totally missed the entire idea of this. Garen should be balanced separately in each patch, so that he isn't weak nor strong regardless of where you are. If Garen is doing exceedingly well in ranked, he would see nerfs in the ranked patch. Likewise he shouldn't be trash in the norms patch-he's well off in ranked for high elo, and well off in unranked at low elo. Plus, there's plenty of players who do this exact thing right now anyways, with the exact same result; they suck at the new fotm champion. Were you around for MF becoming big in support? Probably, it wasn't too long ago.\n\nLow elo totally missed hte _why_ when she was picked, so they'd grab her in any random game and it'd go horribly. That's the scenario you just described.\n\nTheoretically if they did this and they did it right, Jimmy the bronze 5 will do just as well as Hauntzer with Garen due to the tweaks made in order for him to be good in pro play (because realistically right now, this scenario is actually backwards-Garen is bad at high levels but can perform well vs low elo who don't know how to fight him)-assuming Jimmy is playing unranked that is.\n\nAn idea I just thought up, in this scenario that will never actually happen but I feel would be a good idea: Practice Ranked mode. It is not actually ranked mode, but has the ranked patch, allowing for players to try out the ranked version of a champion and get good with them before putting Elo on the line. I realize this is all a bit convoluted, but to me that's fine if it means the majority of the roster is usable at high and low elo alike because of separate patches.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-05-08T05:26:21.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're getting a bit too hung-up on the example.\n\nThe point is that the things in the LCS should be imitateable in all games.

They can try, but they'll usually fail. Also, I'm not sure if you misunderstood me, or maybe I'm misunderstanding you. I'm not saying to rework any kits entirely; only number changes. Garen, as an example, tends to do poorly at higher elo. Increase his movespeed boost for ranked, maybe up his defensive steroid or his E's scaling. Something like that. Functionally identical,  but the level of power needed for him to be effective for a pro player is vastly different from bronze and silver. Therefore, change the numbers.\n\n> That&#x27;s not to say you&#x27;re going to be able to pick up Lee and suddenly pull of stupid crazy combos but you CAN do it if you have the skill. The goal, for people who play ranked, would be to get better to the point of being at a pro level.\n\nHow does having 2 different patches prevent this? If you can play Lee in unranked, you can also play him in ranked; his numbers might be different (most likely lower), so you may need to get used to doing less damage-but if you're a smart player who can hit high elo of his own skill then this damage nerf isn't going to stop that.\n\n> \n> As another example, imagine if after you pass Gold rank, the game says &quot;Hey guess what you&#x27;re now playing on the platinum+ version of league best of luck&quot;.

I'm asking for numerical changes to balance at high/low elo in ranked/unranked respectively. You're completely blowing out of proportion what I'm asking for. I asked for a car, you're giving me a train. Like, what?\n\n> \n> But I&#x27;m just arguing the philosophical side of things and the feelings. Business-wise, you&#x27;re asking to balance two separate games for two drastically different sets of people. \n\nTrue, which is why I said it's probably never going to happen.\n\n>I can&#x27;t think of a single game in history that has balanced differently for pros vs. pub play beyond mods and editions (Such as SSBB vs. Project: Melee).\n\nI can't either, but I'd also argue most games don't have nearly the issues of League-in that it has over 130 champions, but only 30 or so get consistent pro play/banned, with maybe another 30 as niche picks/comfort picks. Which gets pretty boring being able to predict every damn game who's going to be picked and banned-it gets held back because of low elo, they don't want to ruin the balance for the masses.\n\n> It&#x27;s not cost-effective, it requires balancing between two different teams\n\nWouldn't disagree.\n\n> and it makes balance messier and messier with each patch.\n\nMaybe. It's hard to say I think. Theoretically though-just run with this thought for a minute-Riot actually does this, makes 2 balance patches. They're able to fine tune it to the point where every champion is considered viable in unranked for the masses, and LCS sees fairly equal usage of every champion, as well as a large variety of bans on the roster.\n\nIf they've hit this point, when a new item comes out that throws off the balance of high elo, you really only have 1 patch to balance. You don't have to worry about low elo since they aren't making good use of the item, so now you just determine how to best make it balanced for the pros. Unlike now, where they try to fix it for the high elo, but still keep in mind low elo, which often ends up in a big mess. If they could actually manage to get things fairly balanced for ONE of the elos, future balancing for that elo would become significantly easier.\n\nAlso, as far as money goes according to Wikipedia, they _earned_ 1.6 billion in 2015. That's not the net worth, that is the excess revenue they put in the bank. You're telling me they can't afford to higher another 5 man team alongside the current one to start working on balance? Again, that is the money after the bills are all paid, not before.\n\nLet's just do a quick mock payment for these guys. Let's say they are paid 50 an hour. Assuming all 5 work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year...that will cost them 520,000 . Out of 1,600,000,000. That's .0325% of what they banked. 50 an hour is probably high payment for a team like this (though I'm also not a major in this or anything, so I could be completely wrong)-I gave a high number to account for other costs that may come with having a new employee that I did not consider.\n\nI already stated this would be somewhat of a hassle for them to do, and would cost them some money-but given how much they're worth, how many players this would, in my opinion, be good for-I think it'd be well worth it being done, though I don't believe Riot would ever go for this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
