The tank is doing its job well and protecting its squishies.  You don't *have* to use any abilities on the tank.  Rammus's taunt doesn't make you push Q, W, E, or R.  Essentially, you are getting outplayed by the tank.  \n\nB.)  You're intentionally wasting your abilities on the tank which means that you want them to be gone more than the squishy target that you yourself admit should be the focus of your abilities.  In other words, you are playing poorly, and deserve to be punished for it.  \n\nC.)  The tank and you were fighting alone, probably in a 1v1 situation.  You both wanted the other dead, but while you have the damage to deal with the tank, the tank probably doesn't have enough damage to do much to you before it dies.  This scenario has a lot of unknown variables, but let's say you're both even in build (though different items) and health percentages.  The tank can conceivably run to safety before dying, but since most tanks are slow and most assassins/ADCasters are not (either due to gap-closers or base speed), the tank doesn't have very much time.  \n\nWith the implementation of such an item, it will make the assassins/ADCasters need to play as intelligently as their opponents.

But then again you're also account for spell damage (AD or not) in addition to the actual ratio. So a spell that deals 200 damage + 0.7 AD or something is gonna hit like a truck whereas the itemization is still geared toward dealing with auto-attacks. \n\n> As for why the optimal anti-AD Caster itemization is a little sparse, tactics.\n> \n> A bruiser like Shyvana is supposed to be tanky enough to survive long enough to do her job.

Dealing with Shyvana isn't about mitigating her damage with tank stats. That's how bruisers deal with you. There win condition for surviving long enough to do their job is durability, out-tanking.\n\nExcept it actually is possible to counterbuild shyvana, considering her magic is pretty laughably small and she has zero penetration, meaning even one MR item will likely reduce her magical damage to a great extent. Shyvana, in addition, will primarily build AS items and maybe a little AD. Except even then, her only dangerous AD spell is her Q. Otherwise, she's basically reduced to some mediocre spells and a little big of damage. \n\nNow you argue that a bruiser's job is durability, but the fact is that they're not really durable anymore. Unless you have some obscene steroid against damage (Braum/Alistar/etc.) you're basically going to be slaughtered because your one armor item is countered thanks to the easy penetration choices. Now again we look at the AD Abilities. Not only are they doing auto-damage, they're also doing immense physical damage. Sometimes at range, sometimes in melee. \"But what about the fact that crit-\" Except some spells CAN crit and that's not a valid excuse, not to mention how quickly some of these champions can throw out a painful, ranged nuke.\n\n> When it comes to mages and marksman - you can't easily position around them to negate their damage like you can a melee. Their reach and effective radius of pain is just so great you need committed items like Ninja Tabi, Thornmail, Banshee's Veil, and QSS to be available.\n> There win condition is out-ranging opponents and potentially using CC or mobility to never get hit in the first place.\n\nAgain, this would be the case if some ADs still used autos. However, a good chunk of recent ADC marksmen have moved toward casting spells. Lucian doesn't auto-attack, he fires off spells that happen to also make his autos better. Ezreal, Jinx, Sivir, even Twitch and Tristana to an extent. Tabi and Thornmail are piss-awful choices to counter these guys, meaning that your purchase amounts to little more than extra armor and barely used effects. Did I also mention that they got another penetration item so that armor's kinda pointless?\n\nThe \"CC/Mobility to not get hit\" argument doesn't fair that well with tanks, however. A tank/brusier should be able to wade into a fight and get past the CC/Mobility, or alternatively you blew all your spells keeping Nautilus away so you're not in any danger. Except now, tanks don't have the durability to do that. Grats on the thornmail, but Vayne doesn't care about the minor damage return, she's proccing true silver. Jinx fired off a zap that chunks your health because it's an AD nid spear. Etc. We're not even getting into AD casters who just shred for the sake of shredding.\n\n> AD casters are more often than not assassins, which is somewhere in-between those 2 groups. They're fast and agile in a burst through their kit which improves their zone of influence to a certain extent, but they're still melee and subjugated to a lot of disadvantages being melee brings.\n> Which, in turn, doesn't merit the same kind of durability counters you have avalible against marksman and mages.\n>\n> Being melee is a significant disadvantage, melee champions need something to offset that in LoL. Riot's generally chosen \"more damage when you actually get the opportunity to deal damage\" as their common theme for melee champions.\n\n{{champion:238}} - Instant reposition that doubles as an initiation/escape. Very short cooldown, ranged harassment tool that can be doubled.\n{{champion:91}} - Instant reposition. Ranged attacks/waveclear. Enormous area burst ultimate. \n{{champion:157}} - Incredibly powerful repositioning skill, can avoid the \"Melee disadvantage\" with windwall, ranged knock-up with a short cooldown.\n\nFor these assassins (Yasuo is basically an assassin at this point from the routine kit guttings), they certainly have a lot of skills that avoid the trope of \"He's melee so he's weak!\" And the argument that a lot of assassins aren't AD is just plain false. A good chunk are AD and as many are AP, so it's a balanced argument.\n\nFinally, you argue that melee is a disadvantage, but some of these casters are not only melee but have ranged AD so not only is it suicide to get close, they can poke out at range. This is the problem with AD casters: Not only are they dangerous up close, they're dangerous from afar. You can't itemize against them as a way of avoiding or neglecting damage, the only counter is 'build enough HP/Armor that it doesn't hurt enough'. \n\nCompare this to, say, AP. You have a banshees, blocking magic resistance. You have abyssal, lowering the enemy's MR if they get close to try and maximize their AP burst. The Aegis line. Malmortius essentially being a \"Oh you bursted me but now I have a chance\". AD casters don't  have this crutch, this select itemization for a variety of situations. It's thoughtless stat-gains to make it hurt a little less and nothing more. And that, my friend, should not be the case.","replies":[{"poster":"ccseancc143","date":"2015-01-24T21:08:41.193+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assasins are burst. the problem with people are that they dont engaeg even after they use their combo.

Impressive considering Shyvana's tendency to build Kingblade, Omen, Visage, Sunfire, and Tabi.\nWhere Zed's stat-tracking is showing him going full glass with Kingblade, Ghostblade, Whisper, and Merc Treads.\n\nRiot did design tanky DPS champions to deal DPS when they build tank after all. It's not like they need the same offensive requirements as mages, marksman, and assassins to reach similar damage values. \n\nEspecially seeing as tanky DPS tend to be the hybrid damage class, and:\nMagic damage has 100% armor penetration.\nPhysical damage has 100% magic penetration.\nThey just tend to run with non-AD/AP sources for physical damage like TriForce, Sunfire Cape, Wit's End, Kingblade, and general crazy stuff on jungler items.\n\nOn penetrations:\n> Except it actually is possible to counterbuild shyvana, considering her magic is pretty laughably small and she has zero penetration, meaning even one MR item will likely reduce her magical damage to a great extent. \n\nFor needing penetrations - MR and Armor simply do not function in a way that requires penetrations to deal with them. \n\nJust as starting with 1000 HP and grabbing 1000+1000+1000 HP will offer 4 times the defense, starting with 0 MR and grabbing 100+100+100 will offer 4 times the magical resistance.\n\nThere's no wonky power-curve or hurdle you need to overcome concerning physical or magical damage within LoL. Which means reasonable damage inputs will result in reasonable damage outputs.\n\nOn needing magic penetration more particularly on champions like Shyvana, Udyr, Mundo, Wariwkc, Nasus: when you consider MR is approximately 35% lower than armor in most cases, that point makes no sense.\n\nThrough base stats alone champions either have 30 or 52.25 MR at level 18, and anywhere from 60 to 90 armor, 75 being pretty average.\nWhich means at least 100% more armor on ranged champions, and around 43% more to 72% more on melee.\n\nArmor is also notably more available in higher amounts through itemization in an item-per-item comparison, often leading tanks to have ~50% more armor, or ~33% less MR, in most situations. Especially considering HP alone is pretty solid against most forms on magic damage, leading to ~150 MR being the maximum you'd ever realistically need.\n\nIf you think something like Last Whisper is a problem, why make the case having greater %penetrations bonus than Last Whisper offers is so weak it needs penetrations to function?\n\n------------------\n\nAnyways - the reason I've spent so much time on the Shyvana point is because it seems to hit at the heart of both penetrations being to high by going into how they compare to other sources, as well as durability items being to weak by really focusing on how 1 of the 2 main defense rolls (bruisers) really operates compared to armor penetrating ADs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-01-25T20:28:45.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"\"Ermahgerd, mer sperls AD scerling!\"\n\nErmahgerd, Armor still reduces Physical damage significantly, and most of them still deal more damage through basic attacks than spells.\n\ninb4 obligatory \"But Armor Pen\" reply.
