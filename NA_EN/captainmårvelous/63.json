Hurrah for that I guess. As of late, I'm almost done with this novel-sized league...novel? Fan fiction? Fuck I don't know what to call it anymore. It's gonna be subpar as all hell.\r\n\r\n#Ok so what exactly here is the question?\r\n\r\nA friend of mine is doing a cover for it, which is cool! It will, however, take months due to situations neither of us have control over. I'm almost done though so I'm curious if GD wants the whole thing before the cover is done or wants a package deal and to wait until the whole thing is done, writing and art.\r\n\r\n#Well you need to tell us what the hell it's about for us to actually be interested in it, you dingus.\r\n\r\n* League-based\r\n* 100-120k words (Might change I don't fuckin' know.)\r\n* Main focus: {{champion:51}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:61}}\r\n* Shitty original characters (Do not steal plz)\r\n* Various cameos from Zaun and Piltover champions (Plus some more I don't want to spoil.)\r\n* Mystery/Action/Romance/Suspense crap. \r\n\r\n#How bad are the original-\r\n\r\n*The worst*.\r\n\r\n#Fuck it, I wanna read it.\r\n\r\nThen just tell me if you want it now or with art.\r\n\r\n#That sounds really dumb.\r\n\r\nYeah I know but-\r\n\r\n#Like really fucking dumb.\r\n\r\nXin. Sssh.\r\n\r\nAnyways, let me know if you guys want it ASAP or would rather wait for the art to be done. I'm only asking because I know ya'll are more visual oriented people group and I'm unsure if I should bother polishing/finishing it up. If done ASAP? I'd probably have it around two weeks from now.","replies":[]}
