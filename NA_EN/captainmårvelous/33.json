(Naut's Riptide. Sejuani's flail.

It has a set range away from Sejuani's centre, if you have an Elixir of Iron you actually  need to be a little closer to enemies to deal damage to them. It matters less by the time you get EoI because you're typically level 18 and have ranks in Q and E, so you can stick ontop of a target better but if you were to buy it before you get your sticking tools it would hinder you.\n\nThat's not to say size wouldn't help Sejuani in any way, you would gain a little bit of range on the W hit but I doubt it would be worth what you'd lose on W ticks from being too large to apply them properly.\n\nAs it stands though, I'd avoid large size increases from items. I can play around EoI since it's so late and the other choices aren't great but I wouldn't actually want to be pumping up my size too much, the smaller I am the more W range I actually have to work with. If this was changed to work the way you thought it did, sure but as it stands I'd stick to whatever doesn't make me bigger, or something that makes me smaller if possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eunson","date":"2017-01-29T02:10:29.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}}{{champion:154}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unlucky47","date":"2017-01-30T02:58:51.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't like this idea.
