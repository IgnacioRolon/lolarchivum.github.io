When the effect ends, Xerath gains 35% increased movement speed for 2 seconds.\n\nIt was a very cool ability and made Xerath one of a kind, even if it wasn&#039;t the most useful. So, for my proposal...why not give Urgot a similar ability? Here&#039;s a super rough example of what I imagine it&#039;d be.\n\n>#Noxian Siege Machine\n>Active: Urgot slows himself by 100/90/80/70/60% and greatly increases his range on autos, Q and E. He also gains a portion of his AD as bonus armor pen.\n>This ability is a toggle and has a 20/15/10/5/0 second lockout.\n\nSome reasoning behind it:\n\n* It fits the Urgot fantasy of &quot;mobile weapons platform&quot; that rains ~~justice~~ destruction from ~~above~~ a grotesque flabby monster.\n* Removes part of Urgot&#039;s tankiness and replaces it with something more befitting of his core identity.\n* Reinforces Urgot&#039;s strategic identity more than this half-ranged kiter half-brusing monster identity.\n* Allows for a more interesting playstyle as well as a larger window of weakness.\n* Can be created in conjunction with a new ult that expands his playstyle to something more interesting, such as a massive bomb or &quot;full auto mode&quot;.\n\nLemme know what ya&#039;ll think.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-13T03:35:39.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Increased auto range seems a bit much.  Also, there's already so much armor pen in the game, that giving a champ even more free armor pen would result in true damage.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2016-07-13T03:39:37.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rough idea more than \"PUT THIS IN THE GAME\".
