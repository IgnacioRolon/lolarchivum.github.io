I think this is a great idea, but I also think it could be vastly improved. So here's my suggestion on the recolor concept. The main inspiration I want to make mention of is Borderlands' style of recoloring/customization when it comes to champions. Now, what do I mean by that?\r\n\r\nIn Borderlands (and Borderlands 2) you could customize the model of your character with color swap options. While these became pre-picked in BL2, Borderlands 1 had them modifiy distinct parts of the costume. It was very easy, very cheap and still provided a good sense of customization without going overboard. In my opinion, this would be the perfect thing to implement on champions. Let me start with an example:\r\n\r\nHere's Garen as he is in his base model. Thanks to LoL King for the smooth picture I could get:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MufpkNr.jpg\r\n\r\nNow here is the proposal. Garen's 1 would be the primary color change, mostly sticking to the silvers and \"metal\" of his armor.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kEFySf0.jpg\r\n\r\nGaren's 2 would be the gems, tabard, scarf and otherwise \"blue\" parts of his armor. \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3AtfJz8.jpg\r\n\r\nGaren's 3, finally, would comprise the shiny gold color of his gear. \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gkAqFa3.jpg\r\n\r\nWhat we now have is Garen's color scheme divided into three changeable parts: The Primary, The Secondary and the Accessory/Tertiary. We can divide a lot of champions up this way or even consider adding a 4th part for champions with large color pallets. But how would the actual color/recolor work with this champion?\r\n\r\nSimply put, each part is linked to a sort of color wheel. It can be as complex as having every color under the sun in a massive color panel or, less expensively, have the colors regulated to large primary colors. Red/Blue/Yellow/Green/Purple/Orange/White/Black and so on. Each 1/2/3 is linked to the color you choose, so you could have a Garen with a bright gold sword/armor, a red tabard/gems and finally a white outline for the whole set.\r\n\r\nThe downside to this and the possible cost is that you'd need to make a champion's model have a sort of rotating color pallet that can be mixed or matched in a variety of ways. I can imagine for some champions this wouldn't be feasible (Hello Udyr) while other champions could encounter problems when it comes to body color (Hello Kha'zix). However, I feel that for certain champions with strong primary colors and looks, this would be an amazing option for people to use.\r\n\r\nFor price, however, I'm going to suggest a few options:\r\n\r\n* 1.) 260 RP Max **OR** offer the recolor tool for 7800 IP per champion. As time goes on and more champions are unlocked, many people are sitting on massive mounds of IP with nothing to spend it on. Something like this might help alleviate massive IP pools while also serving to help poorer summoners who always wanted a way to customize their favorite champion's look but didn't have the cash to buy a skin.\r\n\r\n* 2.) Make this an unlockable. Maybe games won, games played, whatever. Offer it as a reward for those who have proven their dedication to this champion and can now modify their outfit as they see fit.\r\n\r\n* 3.) Just RP. My least favorite option but at least it's cheaper than another skin.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2014-07-30T22:00:39.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if I can get them with IP.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-07-30T22:23:59.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I'd like.","replies":[{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2014-08-06T23:10:24.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I prefer something like unlocking it with something like 50/100 games played. Heck, if it's just bitmapping the texture file, at that point it could be X games played with that specific skin, and all skins would be technically recolorable.\n\nThe bad part of this is that you'd have to either shade dynamically skins, on top or bitmapping the color to all 9 other players every single games, or shade the skins dynamically in the \"modeler\" making it the game take hits performance wise (since it's run individually for each champion played).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-09T10:16:30.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I got this, every single champion I played would have a Blue/Teal/Cyan and Silver palette.
