Oh, good, there's a chair here...\"- Frostblade Irelia*\n\nChair Sin was a normal chair, devoid of thought and being for the longest time. That is, until DJ Sona and Frostblade Irelia walked into a bar and were arguing over a place to sit. As the two women tried their hardest to push each other off the stool by ramming their backsides, the chair sprung to life with divine purpose. No longer would he be a mere chair. No, he would travel the globe and find the only person worthy of sitting upon him.\n\nAfter years of training in the mountains in solitude, Chair Sin became a true force of nature. Able to cleave mountains with his legs and be slammed into stone without breaking, he journeyed ~~to the Institute of War to find his purpose.~~ to LCS to make the biggest plays imaginable.\n\n**Passive: Sturdy**\nChair Sin cannot be affected by knock-up or knockback skills.\n\n**Q: Flying Chair Press.**\nChair Sin flings himself at the enemy, dealing 60/80/100/120/140 (+1.0 Bonus AD). If the enemy isn't facing him, they're stunned by a stool to the back of the head.\n\n**W: Folding Fury.**\nPassively, Chair Sin gains 10/15/20/25/30% Movement speed\nActively, Chair Sin folds himself. He gains triple movement speed but cannot use his E. Q's movement speed is pentupled in this stance.\n\n**E: \"Take a seat.\"**\nPassively, Chair Sin gains 5/10/15/20/25% Tenacity\nActivated. Chair Sin places himself down in a most alluring fashion. Enemies nearby are charmed and the first one to touch him is forced to sit down. Chair Sin regains 50% HP if the champion is female.\n\n**R: #ChairSinMVP**\nChair Sin strikes his opponent in such a way that they're sent careening to the next closest champion regardless of distance. Hitting multiple champions causes enemy speakers to be blown out as casters begin screeching about the big play they just saw. Chair Sin then gains 200/400/600g from eSports revenue.","replies":[]}
