It stuck with the community for a whole season despite some fairly severe backlash. It tainted the whole season for many people and the problem was that Riot was slow on the draw. They tried to make it work as hard as possible, despite many people saying it wouldn&#039;t, and it made the game crappy for those people. \r\n\r\nNow, we have plants. The initial feedback and one of the major problems people have with it is that it&#039;s too much RNG added. It adds too much variance in an attempt to spice things up. If you go on the dev thread, you&#039;ll find many high ranking players speaking out against it.  Now, if you wanna try it out? Sure, fine, go ahead. Your game, I can&#039;t tell you no.\r\n\r\nBut **PLEASE give us your word that if the changes flop in the preseason, you&#039;ll pull them.**\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not even saying scrap them entirely. Pull them and go back to the drawing board. Get pro junglers in your office and talk to them about it. Improve on the idea before your ship it. However, don&#039;t put an idea that clearly has a lot of flaws out and force players to stick with it for an entire season. Tone down the RNG aspects, try different plants, make them spawn in specific locations, whatever you gotta try to make them work.\r\n\r\nJust please don&#039;t make the same mistake of Season 6 and force a change that clearly needs more time to gestate and evolve into the beginning of the season.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-13T07:03:55.594+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":9,"body":"If plants flop and we can't find a way to make them work we'll pull them. \n\nCan understand the concerns about them so far, would really like to talk a bunch more about them as well once you folks have had a chance to see them in action on the PBE. There's quite a bit of stuff to them we think makes a lot more sense once you've seen it in game than it does when first reading about it on paper.\n\nThe randomness to them for example is pretty heavily controlled:\n\n* They spawn on one of a few pre-determined possible spawn points for their type of plant, each picked to avoid abuse cases and make it fairly intuitive where you'll find them.\n* Their spawning timing's similarly controlled (every 90-110s sort of thing, not full random). They also won't spawn at all in some circumstances (e.g. before/during first clears for example) \n* There are some strict fairness controls on them to ensure they don't meaningfully favor one side of the map over the other (should get generally equal plant spawns across the two sides of the map over a period of time)\n\n\nThey're also nowhere near as frequent, or obtrusive, as some people have worried they'll be. As a jungler you'll probably consider personally interact with a plant every minute or so. This isn't a system that'll be constantly demanding your attention, or dictating your major choices, more one you'll take advantage of occasionally. \n\nFor what it's worth we've had a bunch of people visit the offices to playtest pre-season changes here over the past month or so, some of them regular players, some of them Pros. Feedback on plants has generally been pretty good, with some good suggestions for improvement as well that we've either incorporated or are working on. It's certainly a system though that we're expecting will, at a minimum, need some follow up tuning and support, and one that could need more significant changes if it doesn't work as hoped. Talking about all that should get a lot easier as well once stuff's on the PBE next week too as above. In the meantime though if there are details you'd like to know please do ask though, would love to talk about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2016-10-13T07:33:23.772+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will plants appear on the minimap or in the fog of war when they spawn?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-13T07:57:59.553+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"They will not.

These are supposed to be objectives which have \"pre-determined possible spawn points\" but you guys aren't going to put them on the mini-map? Things which have supposedly non RNG elements to them, but are to be reacted to when you encounter them? \n\nHere's the problem I'm having. It seems as though you're saying here that these mini objectives are not supposed to be random enough to dramatically influence the outcome of impactful situations in a negative way that would preclude skillful forethought. However, you are also saying that you do not want to have them be things to  \"constantly track across the map as a whole.\" If the latter is the case, it would suggest that either a) these plants really DO have a random aspect to them which can most definitely factor into a gameplay element which cannot be controlled in a meaningful sense and thus are not necessary to include on the map because you don't have the information to plan accordingly, or b) the plan is to incorporate a pattern of plant spawning which is trackable, but lacks clarity in a way not unlike when buffs and camps did not show up on the minimap or as timers. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, if you are discouraging the idea that these plants are random interactions, why make them entirely reactionary and discourage skillful forethought into how they might be incorporated into gameplay by way of tracking them across the map? You're basically recreating a lack of clarity on objectives which was present for an extraordinarily long time in this game before very recent improvements.\n\nThe argument could be made, similar to the one made /against/ buff timers, that players would incorporate the pathing and spawns of the plants in their decision making, but I thought that the dev team's stance on this was to provide as much clarity to the gameplay as possible--which was the entire reason for even implementing global timers.\n\nPlease correct me if I have misunderstood the implications of what you're saying here.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2016-10-13T19:59:18.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you understood and failed to let the words steep until you truly understood what he said.\n\nFor example, he said that plants would have a random element to them.

He also said that wouldn't be something he wants you to attempt to track on the minimap due to the changing time and place.\n\nbut let me ask, if we had only 1 red bramble back instead of two bramble backs in game, but he only spawned in one of his two pits every time he spawned, would that _really_ be all the pain in the ass everyone is making this out to be? no one cares about the small camps having a timer tracker because the cooldown is low as well as the impact. everyone knows where they spawn even if they dont know _exactly when_ and thats fine.\n\nIf the bramble back showed up in one of two places, in roughly 2 minutes after every spawn, then if he's not in one spot after a certain amount of time he's probably in the other. that is literally _all_ of the difficulty and decision making of this RNG plant system.\n\n1. is it up from the last time you saw it picked up? no? dont worry about it. probably? move to step 2.\n2.

Firstly from what it looks like plants can have a significant impact on how the game is played and the outcome of situations, otherwise it would be pointless to include them into the game. As a result, now you will have to balance champions around potential interaction with plants. Take for example if I'm playing Nidalee, and the fundamental purpose of my champion is to invade frequently throughout the game. If I play it properly and make tactical invades but get screwed over because of a fortunate plant spawn for the other team, I'm going to feel cheated by the game. So now all junglers are either going to have to be relatively the same play style, or RNG will rear it's ugly head and determine how the game plays out which is ridiculous. One of the nice things about League is there isn't random BS that comes out of nowhere and punishes people who are making the correct strategic play. \n\nAlso it seems like they're being sold as controlled elements that will not ruin the game, but then to say they will not be revealed on the minimap contradicts this and makes it sound like you have no real effective way of playing around them. Picture if elemental dragons was being released, and part of your reasoning why it isn't unfair is you can strategically play around it, but there was no feature which told players what dragon was spawning next. It would defeat the idea of strategically playing around it because it would effectively be a surprise element every time. \n\nI would really like it if these were tested in a separate \"normals\" queue for a few months before they are added to ranked play.

It was just the extremely vocal minority that led to this recent change.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkSunSovereign","date":"2016-10-13T15:35:00.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zQQXbIzx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-13T07:03:55.594+0000)\n>\n> If plants flop and we can&#x27;t find a way to make them work we&#x27;ll pull them. \n> \n\n\n\nI'm quoting you on that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draqone","date":"2016-10-13T14:38:22.055+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the addition of Elemental dragons and now plants the Jungle is becoming increasingly more random.

I agree it is more reactive and more flashy, and i also agree that if you manage to survive a duel and to get to a berry you need to be rewarded, but would not a delay on blast make it more intesting and fair too?
