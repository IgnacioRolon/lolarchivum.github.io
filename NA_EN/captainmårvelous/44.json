(Everyone said it&#039;d be killed by DQ but basically every single game has DQ now. Overwatch was the first of many. Now everyone complains other companies for copying RIot.)\n\nI load up a game of Summoners Rift. There are 133 champions now. After the last two Riot kinda hit a slump. It also doesn&#039;t help that new ideas have to run a lore gauntlet. Nine out of ten potential characters die in lore before they get to release. Number ten ends up being alive but a vegetable. They make good ward skins though. \n\nOpen the items menu. Riot&#039;s been reworking every class. Everyone has new items. All the old ones are gone. By level 18 I&#039;m able to get my Infinity Force made out of the reworked Nashors tooth, the reworked black cleaver and the reworked lich bane. My finger slips and I hit the wrong tab. \n\nAll the items have changed....except for one.\n\n{{item:3056}} \n\nIt&#039;s been decades.\n\nEvery month someone asks about it. (And the Yorick rework. He got delayed.) \n\n&quot;We&#039;re working on it,&quot; Riot says.\n\nI tremble as I stare at it.\n\nIt&#039;s survived entire class updates.\n\nIts outlived rabbadons. Its outlived infinity edge. Its outlived the twenty hextech items Riot tried to implement. The last one made your opponants have to complete a game of DoTA2 as a CC mechanic. Valve cross-promotions are a thing now. (The HotS variant is stronger because nobody plays it anymore.)\n\nYet still. Ohmwrecker lives on.\n\nTears in my eyes I stare at it. I grab the screen, shaking it, shouting to any god who would listen. By the toupe of high overlord president Trump may his reign be eternal and his wall be limitless...\n\nWHY\nWONT\nYOU\nDIE!?!?","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-07-01T12:24:40.713+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Mecf666acc89d9a4b4a7c9737b45d723eo0&w=300&h=300&p=0&pid=1.7","replies":[{"poster":"Arkatra","date":"2016-07-01T16:40:59.199+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"The more people mention this little easter egg, the higher chance a Red designer see it and get replaced.\n\"it's not hextech themed!\". - Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheekynorth","date":"2016-07-01T17:09:30.595+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confused as to what the easter egg is","replies":[{"poster":"Arkatra","date":"2016-07-01T20:12:02.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Little suprise/secret/fact.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheekynorth","date":"2016-07-01T20:22:51.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what an easter egg is in games.
