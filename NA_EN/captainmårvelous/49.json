Only instead of bending the rules, it teleports you back several seasons of league ~~so you can stop complaining about missing Season 2/3~~ to give you an edge when things were ~~less balanced~~ just right.\n\nThe Timewarped tree is composed of four paths: A major keystone and three runes. In addition, the bonus for Timewarped is an MMR gain per win. But it&#039;s invisible so you can&#039;t see it trust me it&#039;s there though.\n\n##Keystones.\n\n* **Regression**: Reverts your champion to the point where their win rate was the highest.\n* **Black Market**: You can buy removed items. Except wards. No wards for you.\n* **Fuck it.**: You close off the tree right now and instead get 10% stat buff because fuck it just give me a rune page.\n\n##Tree One: Nostalgia Goggles\n\n* **&quot;Champs were more unique back then.&quot;:** Gain a 10% bonus against champions, multiplied by the season when they came out. \n* **&quot;Warding was more cerebral back then.&quot;:** You lose your trinket and sightstone. However, you can buy/place as many wards as you like.\n* **&quot;Items were more interesting back then.&quot;:** Active items are turned off. Stats on them are increased by 20%.\n\n##Tree Two: Rose-tinted Goggles.\n\n* **&quot;CC was more thoughtful back then.&quot;:** Non-displacement CCs are increased by 1-3 second(s). \n* **\"Defense meant more back then.\":** 5% of your armor is converted to dodge chance.\n* **&quot;Neutral objectives were more important back then.&quot;:** Buffs last 30 seconds longer on you and you gain 150 bonus gold for killing baron/dragon.\n\n##Tree Three: ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ\n\n* **&quot;I miss old champions.&quot;:** All champions are reverted to their original model.\n* **&quot;I miss old maps.&quot;:** All maps are reverted to their original model.\n* **&quot;I miss old art.&quot;:** All icons are reverted to their original art, icons and splash arts included.\n\nI feel this tree will give players exactly what they want and solve the issue of everyone who wants League Classic.","replies":[]}
