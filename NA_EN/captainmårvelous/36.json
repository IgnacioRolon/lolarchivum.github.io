Still, after ages of delays and waiting…WE HAVE WINNERS. But first…\n\n#What the hell happened?\n\nAs many (likely frustrated) entrants would say, the goal was to have the results out in a month or so. Considering it’s March, it doesn’t take a scientist to know that it didn’t happen. In this case, well-known judges were both a blessing and a curse. A lot of the judge panel was often busy with their own work and I couldn’t exactly tell these people to ignore their paying jobs for something I asked them to do on the side for free.\n\nTo that end: I personally apologize for any frustration, annoyance or otherwise that I have caused from the aloof nature of the contest. I tried to be as forthcoming as possible but from the responses and comments I received, it’s clear I wasn’t as forthcoming as people wished me to be. I’ll be creating a feedback post for this contest similar to the one we had before.\n\n[The Postmortem Thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/0EEgsOAb-grand-archives-of-piltover-post-mortem)\n\nIn addition, in lieu of further waiting, I decided not to have judges give further feedback on their choices for winners. With taking so long, I decided that saying WHO WON is much more important than why those people won. Still, if anyone is curious, I’ll be sure to have judges check out this thread if they’d like to provide more context here or elsewhere, be it twitter, discord or otherwise. \n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that it was never my intention to make others frustrated or annoyed with how long this took. I greatly appreciate everyone’s patience and am incredibly thankful for how understanding you guys have been during this.\n\n#Full Entry List\n\n[Check out the Archives HERE!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B79EBd06KLOJfmY1dHFNV3lNcHg1a19iYVlXWTFiYTFRM2NKNWV1cE02ZllQSm1WbjNhWmc?usp=sharing)\n\nFor everyone who wanted to see the entries, I’ve linked all the entries with summoner names added. Some of you listed your real-life names so for the sake of privacy, they’ve been changed so that there’s no fear of personal information leaking. That said if you’d want another handle and/or name added, please feel free to ping me here, on twitter or discord so that I can correct your name.\n\nIt was a kind of a tough call but in the end, I decided _not_ to directly put winners in the OP. Rather, I'd implore everyone here to check out the entries. Everyone here put their time and effort and while not everyone followed the rules to a T, the fact that you made something still stands out. So please: Check out everyone. Don't just make a beeline for the winners.\n\nAs a final note: Some creators wished to have their updated story, art or creation included instead of the original version. For clarity’s sake, I’ve decided to leave the entries as they are so there’s no mistaking or confusion about one entry winning over another. You are, however, free to post your updated version in this thread or elsewhere.\n\n#The Winners!\n\nWith that bit of explanation and PR out of the way, let me announce those who won. Narrative and 2D art ended p needing a tiebreaker as there were several entries that had extremely close runs!\n\n**Narrative**\n•\t**GRAND PRIZE: “Gates of Light” by Golem Vol**\n•\tRunner up: “A Killer Performance” by SaruHachiHachi\n•\tRunner up: “LOL Essay” by Aadion\n\n**2D Art**\n•\t**GRAND PRIZE: “Jinx Room Final” by The Ordinal**\n•\tRunner up: “Lazy Twitch” by Bardwurst\n•\tRunner up: “ContestZaun Twitch” by TheR4ilRat\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n•\t**GRAND PRIZE: “Bionicle Urgot” by Alzon**\n•\tRunner up: “The Birth of Warwick, The Wrath of Zaun” by jirkam01\n•\tRunner up: “Piltover - The City of Progress Custom Music Theme” by Tzankotz\n\n#“I won!

Riot will be reaching out to you via the email provided for things like shipping your prize as well as any summoner account things that need to be handled. \n\nIn terms of entries, you may recall there was an evolving prize pool for every 25 entries added.

My apologies for being late with the reply, I forgot to log in to Boards!\n\nYou have a nice style of writing which is both understandable and descriptive in a moderate amount. It gives us a bit of flavour while reading about Orianna's travel history, but perhaps this flavour is misplaced in a 1000 word story only because the length constraint is so short. For example, you could have signified that Orianna was unaware what her heart wanted before she returned home. She forgot what it wanted, and started feeling the pull while in other cities. As time went on, became unable to put it aside and decided to follow it.\n\nOther than this which is really just a minor remark, the piece is very nice. Good depictions of emotions and thought processes.

You carry the story mostly with dialogue, mixed with just enough descriptions and actions that allows us to form the full picture.\n\nPerhaps Ava's relationship with Emma was not emphasized enough. Emma is too quick to guess she was a target for an assassination, and the plot resolves without much struggle even though Ava in-world experienced a severe injury. The story tells me it is meant to be focusing on the relationship between these two characters and its mutual exclusivity with the Piltovian mission; while the writing itself focuses almost exclusively on Ava's mental struggle and conflict with her Piltovian contact. If you wanted to place the emphasis on the mental struggle, picking an action with less weight could have made the story more cohesive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skaarl H Marx","date":"2019-04-01T00:28:01.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=333lom,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=RiVNswBT,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-03-13T13:01:25.103+0000)\n>\n> Hello everyone!

It was Caitlyn's discovery of Noxus' impending invasion/they've been infiltrated for a long time. I should've cut a bunch of random crap out of the the thief-search but it felt more complete doing it. It's a 1000 word story after all. I should cut some things and focus more on the Harrowing. It would have been much better(and perhaps I would have won).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Irokaiser","date":"2019-03-16T22:02:03.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, comments on my Ekko sword would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2019-03-17T20:39:18.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I personally really liked it, and suggested it as one of the possible winners.

It is atmospheric, and has an authentic Zaunite feel. The gentle light you placed is also fitting due to the smog in Zaun. The colours are calming to look at, and I think the composition is interesting because it clearly tells us the architecture is in the focus. The mossy elements contribute to the feel.\n\nI would suggest upping the contrast, so that you would give the whole piece firmer texture. Adding sharper as opposed to watery edges to metal and stone elements would also make it feel more realistic, communicating how each material differs from one another. Construction lines and vanishing points are also very useful in cases when you're not sure how to place an element approximately in a setting, but I'd encourage you to always use them, even though they might seem a bit confusing at times!","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2019-03-13T17:32:55.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! \n\nThanks for the criticism!

If she were not there to protect you …” \n\t“Shut up!” Kaldur yelled. \n\tThe image before him shattered, and Kaldur awoke to a sweat drenched bed. Sitting straight up he looked around to remember that he was within a small hotel on the edge of Sidereal Avenue, all within the big city of Piltover. \n\tHe had finally made it, the city where he could finally find his answers, and hell was the road it took to reach it. \n\tTaking in a deep breath, Kaldur got out of the silk sheets he was absorbed in and began to gather his clothing when he realized it had been replaced with something entirely new. Shrugging, Kaldur placed upon himself a well fitted loose panting and a small button-down shirt where it was covered with a golden black jacket. His only regret was that they took his shoes, which he found far more comfortable than the blocks of polished black wood he wore currently.\n\tMaking a sigh, he wandered outside of the room and into what he presumed to be the lobby. \n\t“Good morning to you, sir.” \n\tKaldur looked around to find the source of the greeting to be from an older gentleman behind the reception desk. Nodding his head in response, Kaldur made his way through the double doors, each embroidered with what seemed like gears lining the innerworkings, and came to the busy street of Sidereal.\n\tIt was clearly mid-morning and the roads were filled with people walking back and forth, Kaldur couldn’t help but be reminded of a scene from industrial England as he observed the scene. Shaking his head, Kaldur began down the street. Unlike what he had been told, Kaldur was slightly disappointed to find that the streets were not made of solid gold. Quite unpractical in his mind, but never the less he was still interested as it was the supposed wealthiest street in all of the major city. \n\tIt took a good fifteen minutes to find the nearest trolley where Kaldur then boarded and followed it to the lower grounds just below the mansions of the BlueWind Court. Ever since he was here, Kaldur was always amazed by how modern the city felt. While he wasn’t entirely enthused by the pompous personalities of the upper echelon of society, the strives this city had made in the name of science and personal progress was something he felt all too comfortable with. \n\tIt took nearly a half an hour to reach his destination, and when he finally exited his transportation, he found himself starring at the gates surrounding the house of Ezreal the prodigal explorer. \n\t   Opening the gates and wandering through the magnanimous courtyard, Kaldur came face to face with the massive household that stood before him. Blended with metal and stone the house was a creation of diamond shapes put together in a splash of salmon and grey hues. The windows alight with blue hextech lamps, made the house even more ominous than before; but it was where he needed to go. \n\tOpening the tall chrome doors, Kaldur wandered into the immaculate hall where he saw the impressive array of artifacts that lined the walls, and the center, in clear glass casings. \n\t“Kaldur!” came a loud voice from the forefront of the room.\n\tKaldur looked up to see a tall messy haired blond standing at the hem of the stairs. With his brilliant blue eyes and goofy smile, the only oddities were the blue triangles of his face, the goggles he wore atop his head, and the golden gauntlet that covered his left hand.\n\t“Ezreal.” Kaldur greeted with a small smile.\n\tEzreal stepped down from the stairs and grasped Kaldurs hand in welcome, it was odd seeing him in a lab coat.\n\t“Ready to get started?” He asked expectantly. \n\t“That’s why I am here. Is Ahri around?”\n\tEzreal moved over to one of the side doors that lingered under the stairs and beckoned for Kaldur to follow. \n\t“No, I haven’t seen her since the two of you came in yesterday.”\n\tKaldur followed Ezreal through the door and down a set of stairs that led to the undercarriage of the mansion. In here contained the oddest laboratory Kaldur had ever seen. In normal cases he expected organs in jars and maybe some odd pet that eyed him from the corner, but Ezreal seemed to surpass that. With a lone chair in the center, connected to a multitude of hextech, the lab consisted of artifacts that were bound together in a horrific mismatch of patterns. \n\t“You redecorated… fun.” Kaldur remarked nervously.\n\t“Oh, come on!” Ezreal reassured with an exuberant grin on his face. “It’s not every day that I get to mess with a World Rune. Particularly one that is bound to a human. I mean, that just doesn’t happen.”\n\tKaldur sat in the chair, his heart was racing. “I think I know why Ahri isn’t here today.”\n\tEzreal laughed. “Look, I’m not like Heimerdinger or Viktor. Personally, I prefer not to be in the lab, but I owe you and this is the best way to receive answers.”\n\tKaldur took a long breath before he answered. “Alright, let’s do this.”\n\tEzreal moved over to a few of the devices strewn about the lab and began to adjust some of their dials. As he did so, the small hum of the room began to accelerate. Coming over to Kaldur, Ezreal strapped him into the chair.\n\t“Remember,” Ezreal began. “Only one question: who changed the stone.”\n\tKaldur nodded his head. With that Ezreal moved over to a large lever and pulled. \n\tEverything for Kaldur faded to white, and in front of him stood three figures.\n\t“Who was it?” Kaldur asked.\n\tInside he could feel the center figure smile.\n\t“The Void.”","replies":[]},{"poster":"Golem Vol","date":"2019-03-17T05:05:06.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh...
