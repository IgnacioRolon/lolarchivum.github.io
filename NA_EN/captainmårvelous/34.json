Each champion has 5 skills- 4 abilities and one passive. That&#039;s roughly 695 abilities for these champions. (This doesn&#039;t count champions like Jayce or Elise who have 6+ abilities)\r\n\r\nWe have roughly 110-ish items in the game, counting consumeables. These items range from basic items {{item:1029}} that serve one purpose to actives {{item:3152}} with unique scaling, effects and more.\r\n\r\nRunes and masteries are quite numerous, having to set-up and min-max a page or two of 30 slots. Masteries have 45 effects, coupled with certain masteries that are above others (Keystone and major runes). \r\n\r\n10 summoner spells. 12-ish if you count ARAM and some RGMs.\r\n\r\nMap specific stuff complicates this even more. Jungle spawns, unique aspects of maps (Alters on TT vs. Red/Blue buff on SR vs. Ascension Markers/Dominion points), etc.\r\n\r\nAnd the weirdest part is that we all subconsciously know this stuff. If I see a Lee sin with Thunderlords, I know he probably took certain runes/masteries. I have a vague idea of what he&#039;s doing. I know the ins and outs of his kit and sometimes (while it varies by person) I can even get a good estimation on how much damage he&#039;ll do. (Hint: Fuckload).\r\n\r\nEither way, I just think it&#039;s surprising how much League tells us to hold onto info-wise and how we tend to do it subconsciously. ~~And then the preseason comes and destroys everything oops~~","replies":[]}
