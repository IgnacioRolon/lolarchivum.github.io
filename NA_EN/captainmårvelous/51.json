Unlikely.\n\nTaric shatter was the one ability I don't want touched. The armor aura and the armor shred were great to have and unique. I could do without the removing the armor bonus on casting shatter but to be honest its probably better off that way since it created balance.\n\nTaric's passive of gemcraft needs higher numbers on damage or needs to slow targets or lower their resistances or something. It just felt weak to get a minorly empowered auto attack with only a 2 second cooldown reduction. Great for free farming but horrendous for team fighting. \nImbue needs more oomph because without items like spirit visage or warmogs it lacked the impact of all other healers in the game as well as extra utility since all the other heals in the game grant utility through speed boosts, increased resistances, etc. It always seemed weak to me, although healing minions was a neat trick since he's the only one besides Kayle who can do that now. \nDazzle has way too long a cool down, a super slow travel speed and low damage. And it only hits one target and lasts only 1 second. Dazzle is the ability I want changed the most. \nAnd radiance is a nice steroid but on a highly immobile champion it just doesn't mesh well since 5 seconds is way too short. It needs a shortened cooldown or something.\n\nBut I have a feeling that a majority of his kit is getting replaced. RiotRepertoir hinted that Taric's new kit will possess \"arguably the strongest ability in the game in certain situations\" so the hype is there. I think he may be overselling it but that's just me. And while I love the new look, the fact that Taric has lost most of his armor worries me that he may have been moved from being a tank to being a mage. Or at minimum an AP Bruiser. The one redeeming fact is that Taric's title is being changed from \"The Gem Knight\" to \"The Shield of Valoran\" and yet I see no shield. So its a curve ball they are throwing us right now. I still hope that his new kit has better, more reliable AOE CC (or atleast shorter cooldowns) and some form of mobility booster even if its only a 0.5 second speed boost just something to mediate his slow and immobile frame. And I hope that his in game model is a bit bigger to reflect his size.\n\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/ulaopd785ed.png","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2016-04-05T04:51:48.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":26,"body":"i had to login to downvote this but it was worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Forn ala creme","date":"2016-04-05T08:51:22.980+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to login to downvote this but it was worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2016-04-16T12:58:56.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"hey look im a retarded murican and i like le memers XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD","replies":[{"poster":"Forn ala creme","date":"2016-04-18T17:58:41.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go to bed.","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2016-04-18T22:09:04.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"aNOTHR MEME RIGHT THERA!

Invisible stat auras are really, really bad from a game health perspective because (as Morello has talked about, especially before the Sona rework) there's a diffference between perceived strength and actual strength that is usually pretty distinct (something can seem really weak but be incredibly gold efficient from a statistical point of view... but flat stats do a really poor job of FEELING powerful, meaning it has to be overtuned to be impactful.) So while I think shatter was definitely iconic to Taric, I'd love to see it go in favor of a better kit.\n\nI'm really excited for the prospect of an entirely new kit for Taric because I have hopes that he will become a support that has build options that aren't \"stack 400 armor\" - while still maintaining his melee bruiser/tank support status. And while his kit now definitely has some strong points, I'm glad to see the power budget shift in ways that might open up more interesting, thematically awesome abilities for Taric.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2016-04-05T15:19:42.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I really don't care to see more AoE CC.
