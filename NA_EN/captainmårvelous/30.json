Sure, I understand that he's a fun character that's kinda like Jinx, but in game mundo and lore mundo are VERY different. In game, he's a playful little psycho who chucks cleavers. In lore (( which I'm not even sure if it holds any solid ground anymore )) he was a Zaunite driven mad kinda like Singed but with ten times less poison and one hundred times more painful experiments to create the perfect killer - with \"mysteriously\" missing parents, pets, and the occasional stander-by.

When I first read his lore, I really liked the idea of a mad doctor/serial killer as a champion. But when I first played him in a match, I mistook him for a dumb purple jock with a cleaver (no offence to those who like his comedic look). I think the best way to do this (in my opinion) is to make his model look like a (slightly less buff) smiling doctor wearing a big lad coat covered in blood holding a big (and I mean big as it looks in his splash art) cleaver. But with a SPLIT PERSONALITY DISORDER. One side of him being a big silly and comedic fellow, while his other side being a mad doctor/killer (something like a Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde sort a thing). This would explain why Mundo is friends with himself and how he gets away with all these crimes (like even though cops have evident of him being the killer, everyone looks and see a harmless silly fellow playing with himself).

First, simply due to keeping it simple for the reader to progress through it all without getting confused, and second, due to the fact that I don't want him to go from cheery fellow to dark and scary. Even Gnar's rage gene keeps a somewhat cute appearance for what he COULD turn into (( think Gremlins who turn from cute and cuddly to down right terrifying in comparison to what they started as )). The idea in theory and speculation is okay because it's left up to interpretation about whether or not he really does have a split personality which adds a lot of depth to him as a character. If it were to somehow be execute though, I'd really rather keep it either a happy masochist with a happy sadist or a dark masochist with a dark sadist - i.e. Mundo being happy and goofy making jokes about hurting himself and others versus Mundo bringing up how his blood will be the last thing someone tastes.\n\nAlso another side note: Circumstantial bias and evidence such as a split personality can only reduce a sentence, not remove one.

However, as a writer I don't see how it would be so difficult to change Mundo to more accurately depict his lore or vice versa.\n\nPersonally, I'd like his lore to more accurately depict his personality. So in order to do this, we don't really need to retcon or edit all that much which might create a little bit of a stir at first but won't leave a lasting impression of dislike or controversy. What I see Mundo as is a super intelligent scientist who acts like a little kid. After all, with his lore and in game personality combined, it sure seems like that's exactly what he is - at the very least, after he O.D'd on the drugs required to suppress his pain and amplify it on others (( %HP cleavers OP )). So how do we do this? Easy, we just add that little bit of information to his lore or edit it to mention how his drugs have caused him to act the way he does to clarify why he's so childlike in game but so morbid in the rest of his lore. That way, Mundo has a pseudo \"Halo effect\" where we pay attention to the fact that he's naive or a man who is no longer in control that we WANT to ignore all that awful stuff he does. It's a happy medium where we get to have both the dark, scary mundo and the funny, playful mundo that goes where he pleases!\n\nSide note: Correct me if I'm wrong, but after looking at his lore and quotes a second glance, is the, \"Mundo will go where he pleases\" quote a reference to the fact that he works as a Noxian scientist but is still a Zaunite resident - therefore giving him dual faction status like Poppy?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-12-04T03:40:52.448+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> But as of now, nobody even acknowledges the state he is in and I think that's a sour note.\n\nrekt.\n\nAnyway.. we were just talking about this yesterday. One of our 3D artists is a big fan of making crazy brute characters and was wondering where he was at on the list. Right now we don't have him hard slotted, but I do have a concept for him hanging around. \n\nOne of the current challenges with him is that we would have to do an entire teardown of his old character art if we wanted to do what we'd LIKE to do. Which is probably along the lines of less of a grape flavored Hulk, with the ripped shirt, pants and all. I think the big semi-grotesque upper body would stay similar with his legs being more or less.. not \"normal\".. but less deformed. Putting him solidly in the \"freak\" category and not the \"hulk\" category which is where we've put Sion. He very much needs a new rig to execute at the level we'd want to. There's even a thought of him model-swapping to a larger, more brutal version of himself when he's ulting. This is all talk though, don't take it as a feature promise.\n\nSomething I'd like to play around with is figuring out something different to do with his clothing rather than literally a ripped white shirt and brown pants. I was talking with the guys and we were thinking maybe he has what's left of whatever he used to harness himself up to an experimental injection device, or something that feels a little more in line with Zaun.. which isn't exactly well defined right now either.. There's some references like final-boss Fontaine from Bioshock or when Shwarzenegger is restrained in Total Recall when they're trying to wipe his brain, and he pulls off an arm restraint and stabs a guy through the head. I dunno, something that's pieces of wreckage, hard material or \"clothing\" that tells some sort of story.\n\nLet me know if that's an interesting idea and we'll play around.","replies":[{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2014-12-04T04:17:09.058+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Add, Improve, don't remove.\n\nThat's your mantra.

Give him a big flowing lab coat that reflects his status as a doctor, while also making him feel disturbing through the contrast between his clothing and his slurred speech/purple skin.

I'm about as certain that Narrative will completely erase and rewrite Zaun as I am certain that this will be an unnecessary and destructive act.\n\nhttp://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/zaun_frame.png\n*Research over regulations. Results over rules. Revolution over revisions.*\n*(Motto of the Zaun Techmaturgic Institute.)*\n\nI like Zaun's X-Men/Shadowrun theme, and its identity as Piltover's crazy twin sister, with modern/cyberpunk themes in place of the quaint Victorian/steampunk ambiance Piltover's got going. Mutants, techmaturgy, drugs, parties, megacorporate governance, fun, danger, gas masks, robots, explosions, neon lights, trenchcoats, toxic waste…\n\nhttp://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/pkii-black-e1400304484598.png\n*A syringe of Pharmakon II, the serum that created Zaun's psi-mages. PKII is a distilled and \"weaponized\" form of \"NoxiToxis\", so named for their use of substances gathered from Void-contaminated Noxian land.*\n\nI would respectfully disagree and say Zaun's got a lot of good definition. You should open up a case of **[ThaumaKola](http://leaguefactions.net/vol-i-issue-1-notable-events/)** with Narrative sometime and try to convince them not to do yet another blank-slate destructive rewrite that'll turn Zaun into a cave-city populated by mole-people.\n\nhttp://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/hexkorps-icon-gray-bg-small.png\n*\"THEY ARE NOW OBSOLETE!\"*\n*(Viktor at the creation of the HexKorps, when warned that its unveiling would provoke Demacia.)*\n\nI'm quite fond of the Zaun that's emerged in the Factions community so far: a schizophrenic corporate state less interested in an epic clash of good and evil than they are in having a really good (and generally unhealthy) time. Piltover's all, \"Indeed! The Velocitronic Rail will allow overnight travel to Demacia at a fraction of the cost of conventional freight. But further testing is required.\" while Zaun is all, \"JUST SWITCH IT ON AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\" And also lots of KamelKase KompoundWords with Ks in place of hard Cs, for some reason.\n\nhttps://leaguefactions.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/against-the-apocalypse-1.jpg\n*Viktor and a Zaunite Summoner, 333LOM, one of his machine acolytes.*\n*( From* ***[the Battle of Shurima.](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-8-shield-of-light/)*** *)*\n\nI'm deciding whether I really want to go spend more hours of my life, hours that I'll never get back, making a bunch of preemptive \"Narrative pls\" threads for each faction. Honestly, though, that sort of thing just makes me feel like a chump. I'm pretty certain that if you stroll over to Narrative's side of the building you'll see someone who's already finished rewriting Zaun as some crazy land of talking dragons who use the power of make-believe to summon The Crystal Guardians of Chaos to this realm.

Hiya Stylus! I was looking at Mundo's lore, and two things occured to me.\n\n1. He ties in ridiculously well with the theme of Zaun. As someone pointed out here, his whole objective is to more or less feel that 'rush' of the kill, the predatory instinct of causing pain to another and joy from it... much like how Zaunites seem to all live for that next 'rush'! (Looking at you, Jinx) Now the real thing is, looking at Viktor you have an interesting style which seems to relate to the scientists, an odd combination of style and function. Pinstripe pants that are easy to move around in? Check. Cool gelled back hair? Check. Cool boots and odd cloak that looks spiffy? Super check. On the other hand, you look at Jinx who's wearing the Zaun street clothes, which as I said before with Viktor; cool and adds a good bit of flare, yet still reasonable. To me it seems Zaun IS tied together by how un-together it is. Everything is more-or-less just so oddly chaotic and clashing that it works together. Jinx's right-part of the bra is striped, light pink darker pink, whereas the left side is black and padded. It's certainly odd, yet causing that asymmetrical design is pretty cool in terms of games.\n\n2. Now moving forwards, Mundo does seem odd to me thematically. I get he's a 'butcher' but he's also the 'MADMAN OF ZAUN'. What ties him in further with Zaun? Why is it his whole point in lore is to make himself more 'primitive', fight harder, and focus less on his survival instinct, yet his kit makes him do little damage, take near none, and become one of the most slippery champs in the game?\n\n3. Not only that, but Mundo is also, according to his lore, tied in with Noxus. Now we're getting somewhere cooler! How's he tied in with Noxus, to what extent, is there more to it than just them liking his research?! Furthermore, adding on to that extent, does he have things from Noxus? Does he wear heavy battle armor like Darius? Does he go for flare like Draven? Or does he go mostly practical, like Katarina? Or does he have almost zero relation with Noxus beyond his research? \n\nI personally think that a freak of nature wearing an odd combination of asymmetrical yet stylish clothes combined with war-like armor could lead to a super cool design for Mundo. I couldn't give you a good example off the top of my head, but these are all just directions from Mundo's and others lore and design that piques my curiosity. Anyways, if you could answer some of these questions of what you plan on doing with him, or if you plan on aligning him more with one state over the other, that would be so kewl. Well, that's it for my spiel. Thanks for reading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-12-04T05:20:16.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always a pleasure to see ya' Stylus.\n\nIn my opinion, I think taking away some of his clothing would greatly remove the \"Mad scientist\" aspect of him, which is kind of what Mundo was. The cautionary tale of \"Madman turns the needle on himself\". I think the best way to approach it is a combination of what you suggested and the original model: Make it seem like the Scientist Mundo strapped himself down, injected this experimental serum into his body and then literally tore from both the apparatus keeping himself in the chair as well as his clothing. Maybe exchange the syringe for something of that lines.\n\nI agree with the model swapping, but if I could make a suggestion? Perhaps have Mundo have a \"battle damage\" meter about him that shows physical damage. Depending on how far you want to go you could have missing limbs, arms, whatever. Something along the lines of Udyr's stance swapping but tied to HP ala Zac's size. Then his ult would rapidly begin regrowing limbs, replacing body parts, etc. Maybe too far but I think it'd be cool.\n\nAll in all, I think the most important thing is to preserve the terrifying aspect of the madman under the monster vs. the doofy goofball who only knows his own name. Losing that would be the worst thing that could happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-04T03:59:36.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds promising.\n\nBut uh...something a little more dignified than final boss Fontaine please.

But one of his many many mutations.\n--------------------\nAlso, in how does having a cleaver suck on his meat sound? That way it'd look \"slightly\" better than him throwing a cleaver and having it appear out of nowhere again.
