However, as of recently, you can now vote on a thread without opening it or at least I can.\n\nJust a heads up.\n\n**[EDIT]:** According to Bear Hat Alice (as you can see below), this is NOT a bug and rather a change.

I actually liked the idea of forcing viewing to vote. I'm worried access to voting via the front age simply increases the chances of downvote/upvote sprees which don't allow votes to accurately represent acceptance/rejection of a discussion.\n\nEdit: Slightly off-topic, I updated my welcome thread to reflect this change.","replies":[{"poster":"Pendragon","date":"2014-05-09T19:54:48.218+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are going to be times where you can view the content without having to be on the discussion page. A great example is if something is a link to an external website.\n\nWe also think lots of the other problems (like single downvotes killing new threads, and people not reading discussions that they vote on) can be largely mitigated by other technical means & more sophisticated modeling of data. \n\nGenerally the change impacted perception a lot more than it impacted reality, and created a lot of confusion.

I thought it was a good feature; it prevents totally arbitrary downvotes that can easily kill a thread before it gets a fair chance.\n\nWhat about a compromise feature? For example: until a thread has received at least five votes, readers must actually open the thread to upvote or downvote.\n\nOn a tangentially related matter, I'd once again like to say that I think it would be good to consider how these forums' visibility rules should differ from Reddit's. Reddit is a news site, rather than a discussion site, and no matter how many votes a thread gets, it can't possibly stay visible for more than a few days. GD has lots of problems, but one nice thing about it is that you can have long-running discussion threads, or \"petition\" threads for skins like Beekeeper Singed or Surprise Party Fiddlesticks. I think it would be good to make the visibility curve less clifflike; maybe keep the 2-3 day novelty fade in place, but have a baseline vote quantity that doesn't fall off, and factor number of comments into a thread's visibility score. (Perhaps put in a limit per user, such that only a user's first three comments on a thread give it a boost.)","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-09T02:35:20.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this system can still incorporate long lasting threads with one simple additon: Best of \"x\" sorting. Best of today, best of the week, best of the month, etc. A good skin idea comes up and it can keep accruing upvotes and visibility of it's deemed popular enough. That's just me brainstorming though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-05-09T01:07:22.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, ok.
