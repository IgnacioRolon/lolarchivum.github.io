Namely, this part:\n\n> And speaking of her thematic, we&rsquo;ll be extending her current lore and looking at what her life looks like a couple years down the road when she strikes out on her own, ready to show the world her skill as a ninja.\n\nSo this is major for a few reasons:\n\n* It&#039;s the first time we&#039;ve had large, canonical progression of a single character since Yasuo training Taliyah or Burning Tides \n* It&#039;s the first time a character is being aged upwards to reflect the change in story and lore.\n* It could very well be the first time that a character loses parts of their kit _not_ just because gameplay reasons but more so because Akali has grown up and gotten rid of her old kit in favor of more complex tricks.\n\nThis, to me, is one of the most fascinating developments in League lore and in any champion VGU. Old Akali is not going away, she&#039;s growing up. Her changed relationships won&#039;t be because of a retcon but rather because she&#039;s changed as a person and feels differently about Shen, Kennen, Zed and more. _This is the first time Riot can show us how they age a champion on a large scale from where they were to what they are now._\n\nThere are concerns as well, of course, as Riot has to be careful of having Akali grow up and not have a personality 180 because reasons. It is, however, the first time we&#039;re going to see how Riot handles a character&#039;s evolution on a large scale. A scale even beyond Bilgewater. Could they fail? Sure, but this is Riot&#039;s chance to show us that they can handle aging, changing ideals and a complex character who doesn&#039;t sit in a static state forever.\n\nGood luck guys.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-04-19T20:34:54.483+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the thing is that Akali right now has barely any character or backstory.\nThey could retcon her completely and barely anyone would notice that the old iteration became noncanon.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-04-19T20:57:35.756+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well not entirely.

I think it's a great concept and Kai'Sa brings something unique with her kit and looks. Void doesn't just create Voidborn. That would be one dimensional way of thinking. Demacia isn't just a place where honor and aristocracy makes its home. Vayne is a hard contrast to their lifestyle, if that's the case. And so is Lux.\n\nI never actually seen Riot apologize for that Kai'Sa deep neckline, they only explained how and why they came to that conclusion and why they went with it. They also specifically left people an actual option to toggle on or off her full suit, if someone found a reason to complain. So we got the best of both worlds and people still complained for no reason, when both parties were satisfied in the end.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2018-04-21T00:49:06.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because coexistence between the reality that encompasses Runeterra and the Void is repeatedly defined to the audience as not only something to be abhorred, but literally impossible. The Void mutates everything it comes into contact with. It is so inherently hostile that Riot has stated even the Voidborn don't live within the Void. The area around intersecting points of Runeterra and the Void is a nightmare landscape where everything is out for blood and there exists very little to actually survive on besides the hyper-aggressive predators that call it home.\n\nDemacia is faulty comparison; Vayne exemplifies an ideological conflict with the uncompromising ideals of her country. Lux exemplifies the same concept, but frames it as drama given she had no choice being sensitive to the presence of magic or the potential to manipulate it. There is nothing that says they cannot _exist_.\n\nEverything we know about the Void, both old lore and new, explicitly tells us that Kai'Sa, as an entity, _cannot_ exist. This further complicates the execution of her as a concept when she is presented in a manner that takes the conflicts surrounding her clashing design and exacerbates them. Kai'Sa is healthy, not just surviving, but in peak physical condition, despite having nothing to eat besides Voidborn or mutated creatures in addition to society explicitly rejecting her out of fear, which is the entire narrative of her comic. She is articulate, also despite being lost to the convoluted environment surrounding a Void breach at approximately the age of nine, and with no means of being given a formal education. She exhibits no trauma, despite what lore has informed us as living in an extremely stressful environment _for years_, and I would concede that discrepancy since a snarling, feral human isn't the most pleasant to hear, but she doesn't even express the slightest acknowledgement of just how terrible her day-to-day existence is hunting down creatures related to the Void.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-04-21T15:14:23.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Void does mutate people, Voidborn DO NOT mutate people.\nKai'Sa wasn't even in the Void, she was near a Void doorway.\n\nAnd i see that people are still ignoring the fact that Kai'Sa coexists with a Void creature, she isn't influenced by the Void energy due to its inherent protection. She literally has a Voidborn suit and its made to survive in such a harsh environment. That's the same as an astronaut surviving in space with a space suit. They are protected from extremely low temperatures, vacuum of space and solar radiation.\n\n>Kai'Sa is healthy, not just surviving, but in peak physical condition, despite having nothing to eat besides Voidborn or mutated creatures\n\nKai'Sa doesn't eat Voidborn.\nShe kills them and takes their energy which feeds her suit and in turn, it feeds her if she needs it. It's a symbiote, not a parasite. She doesn't like it one bit but if it's about survival, she has to do what was necessary. Once she found a way out from the caverns into the desert, she enjoyed the normal food (especially peaches).\n\nOf course that she's in physical condition, she's had to become the predator and not prey. That's how her days were in those caverns. Her suit wasn't some magic thing that saved her life, it's also something that's likely dangerous to her if she doesn't keep it sated. And she can't take it off.\n\n>Everything we know about the Void, both old lore and new, explicitly tells us that Kai'Sa, as an entity, cannot exist.\n\nWhat we know about the Void are hand-me-downs and personal experiences from encountering the Voidborn. We do not know what's in the Void nor how it looks like, how inhospitable it is nor what's inside. So we don't know the whole story. What we know about The Watchers are its masters but they aren't the ones who created it. Not even in Aurelion Sol's lore we get any more insight into what it actually is, given that Sol would most certainly know what it is as it wasn't his first time dealing with them.\n\nWhat we do know for sure about the Void is that there is highly intelligent being in there that's pulling the strings. Who and what it is, is unknown.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2018-04-22T12:43:39.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD","replies":[{"poster":"Rune Ocarina","date":"2018-04-25T20:06:24.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, I want sideboobs to stay.
