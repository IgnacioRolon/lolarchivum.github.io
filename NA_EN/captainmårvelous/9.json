With League&#039;s client update coming soon and open-alpha being available to almost everyone, I wanted to compile a small list of tricks, tips and otherwise to help people who haven&#039;t beta tested before or are interested in being a generally better tester. If you&#039;re a vet, these are all probably &quot;No duh&quot; questions but they still have some value for anyone who hasn&#039;t ever considered being a tester! \n\n#1.) If you have PBE experience, this will be a familiar thing for you!\n\nAs with the PBE, this is a place less about free content and more about testing new things and providing feedback on them. So, for those who do or don&#039;t use the PBE, here&#039;s a quick rundown of what NOT to do:\n\n* Assume this is a final product. (&quot;Ugh this client is awful&quot;)\n* Use the client only to show off. (&quot;My youtube channel will get hella subs if I show off the new client!&quot;)\n* Avoid providing any feedback. (&quot;Eh, someone else will cover for me.&quot;)\n\nWhat you SHOULD do for the client update:\n\n* Provide feedback to improve client readability, information and general cleanliness. (&quot;XYZ isn&#039;t clear enough, you guys should alter it.&quot;)\n* Don&#039;t be afraid to call out on problematic things. (&quot;I know you guys like this font but it&#039;s hard for me to read.&quot;)\n* Take into account ALL feedback. (&quot;I may not find many bugs but let me give you some opinions from a graphical point&quot;)\n\n#2.) Be familiar with reporting bugs!\n\nWhile not all of us are super testers, let&#039;s go over a cliff-notes-version of reporting a bug!\n\n* **The Bug**: Just title your post whatever the bug is. (Using Heimer crashes the client)\n* **Steps to reproduce**: What you have to do to make the bug happen. (I click Heimerdinger and my client crashes)\n* **Reproduction chance**: How often doing this causes the bug to happen. (It happens about 50% of the time after 10 tries)\n* **PC Specs**: In case this is related to your hardware. (I&#039;m playing League on an Ouya i know it&#039;s crazy)\n* **Severity of Bug**: I&#039;ll go over this next.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, testers usually list the severity of a bug on a scale of 1-to-5. Sometimes 1-to-3 depending on the place. Quick rundown:\n\n* **1**: A priority bug. Easy to reproduce, happens a lot and has major consequences such as client crash or stealing your bank account.\n* **2**: A priority bug. More difficult to reproduce and maybe happens less but is still major in terms of consequence.\n* **3**: A minority bug. Easy to do and happens often but doesn&#039;t have any incredibly major backlash. (Heimer changes color if I right-click him)\n* **4**: A minority bug. Harder to do, happens less frequently and only has a minor effect. (Holding R and doing the konami code makes Vi dance.)\n* **5**: The tiniest bug. Hard to do, happens rarely and the result is almost impossible to notice.\n\nRiot&#039;s likely looking for bugs ranked 1-3, but if you do find a 4-5 bug, don&#039;t hesitate to include those.\n\n#3.) Be open to doing new things.\n\nAs a tester, try to break the client. Go out of your way to do things nobody would expect. Now, I&#039;m not saying try to find a bug where clicking play 50 times in a row causes the client to make a silly noise but try new things. Try swapping champions quickly to see the result. Try changing the settings rapidly and see if the client can keep up. The more bugs you find in testing this client, the less the client will launch with.\n\n#4.) BE HONEST.\n\nThis is a big one and I mean on both ends of the spectrum. Don&#039;t blindly go:\n\n&quot;OMG RIOT THIS IS THE BEST CLIENT EVER IT CURED ALL MY CANCER I LOVE IT AND ALSO MAYBE I CAN WORK AT RIOT FOR DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB YAS?&quot;\n\nBlind praise does nothing. If you&#039;re happy with the client, great! Don&#039;t just lavish the client with nothing but love. Chances are there&#039;s something good you can mention or contribute to. By the same extent:\n\n&quot;OMG RIOT THIS CLIENT IS GARBAGE YOU RUINED MY GAME UNINSTALLING THIS CLIENT AND THE OTHER CLIENT AND IM SWITCHING TO HEROES OF NEWERTH&quot;\n\nBlind criticism does just as much as blind praise. If you have problems with the client, be constructive. Explain why you have these problems and what could be done to fix them. By the same extent, if you love the client, explain why you love the client and what Riot did right with it. \n\n#5.) Be frequent but not TOO frequent.\n\nNow, you don&#039;t need a quota. That&#039;s just silly. However, try to aim for frequent and well-written feedback. Submitting one rating of 1-5 for the entire alpha isn&#039;t really helpful. However, by the same extent, writing two sentences five times a day about how you love or hate features isn&#039;t really helpful either. Aim for a happy medium of covering your bases but not harping on them. If Riot changes the client in a way you like or hate? Great! Just don&#039;t spam their inbox with the same praise/criticism/etc over and over.\n\nAnd that covers my five point rundown of being an awesome tester. If you have more to contribute, feel free to add in and help other people who want to help test so we ALL get a better client!\n\n#EDITS FROM OTHERS CONTRIBUTING:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RiotSomeOtherGuy,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=RRiUPh6v,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-04-27T20:07:19.473+0000)\n>\n> This is awesome!
