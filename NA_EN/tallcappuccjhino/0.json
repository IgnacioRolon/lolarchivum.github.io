I've been a player on League for a long time, (I don't mean 1st season long, but starting around 3-4) and during those last years, I joined the PBE. Now, with games like League, Minecraft, or just any game in general,  I have these  really long hiatusus where I just don't play for a long time, then BAM! I feel like playing it again. I really missed playing as a Nidalee main with almost all of her skins, and Ahri, along with even Tristiana! Pretty inconsistent, I know. To get straight to the point, is there anyway to re-activate my PBE account? Tried downloading it on my up-to-date Mac, but the message \"PBE quit unexpectedly\" kept popping up, so I assumed the worse that my account hasn't been used for over a year. I haven't tried to access the NA version, but as of now, any help will do! Thanks so much!\n\nEdit: LoL NA does the same thing when I try to launch it! ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T21:49:44.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, PBE was recently re-hauled so you'll want to make a new account [here](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/pbe).   This steps will get you set up with an updated PBE install with the updated client, so you may want to uninstall the version you have now.  Thanks for your interest in helping out!","replies":[{"poster":"TallCappuccJhino","date":"2017-12-16T22:36:10.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a ton! The only problem I'm facing now is that I still can't get into NA... I've tried restarting my computer and uninstalling/reinstalling, but the same message appears. I'm on OS X Version 10.7.5. Any clues on what might be the problem? ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T22:37:52.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might still be trying to login through the PBE client.
