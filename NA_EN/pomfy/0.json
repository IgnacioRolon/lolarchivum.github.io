The ping is not spiking, no packets are being lost. Nothing I have been able to do on my end has brought down the ping whatsoever. My internet provider is AT&amp;T and I have never had issues with this in the past and have been playing League well before the server change.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anybody else in the Midwest region is running into issues like this. If this is not a problem on my end or Riot's end then I can only guess that my isp has lost the normal route it connects to the servers by.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T00:10:38.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This currently an issue with ATT that's causing some higher ping for players.
