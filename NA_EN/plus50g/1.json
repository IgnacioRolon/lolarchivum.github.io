In the short run, it causes weirdness.\n\nThe problem is, where do you draw the line of \"you're now where you belong\"? What if it takes roughly 6 years to properly even out the 8/10 times getting a leaver/afker to get you where you belong, but nobody knows that.. 3 years down the road everyones telling this silver he belongs there when in reality he belongs in high gold or better? \n\nHow about those very good players who, just get horrendous teams all the time but don't have the time to sink hundreds of hours a week into league? They'll realistically never get close to seeing the rank they deserve. \n\nObviously the above with the 6yrs is an inflated example, but the point remains. Not everyone gets the same amount of afkers/trolls. Not everyone can carry, but just because you can carry doesn't mean you're a good player either (this is actually true, as just being able to gobble up a crap ton of cs and run everyone through with an OP champ doesn't mean you're good when it comes to real things that matter such as Teamfights, and knowing when/where to be when things get tough). \n\nI've seen alot of high tier players who sped past Bronze and silver into high gold who honestly.. are worse than some bronze IV's I've seen. THey know how to farm fast with an OP champ and just force the game to end in a win, but when it comes to getting put up against players who can do the same, they fail miserably at knowing when/where and how to properly team fight, and be productive. Do these people still deserve that tier? I don't believe they do because they fail at all the skills that truly matter. \n\nIt reminds me of games where I have poor cs and a person who has 4x the amount as me keeps bitching, whining and complaining and over all flaming me that I suck because of it, but when push comes to shove, I'm 3x more worthwhile in a team fight than they were/are because I know where to be, what to do, how and when to focus, and consider high priority targets, and any of the other 100 things that could potentially need to be calculated in a team fight. \n\nHowever, since that said person me as an example (not saying its how I am) can't carry or master 10000000 cs a game, have a much harder, if not nearly impossible time climbing the ranks. \n\nOver all the rank system is broken, and really doesn't truly show where anyone 'deserves\" to be. It gets close.. but at the same time, still so wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2014-12-15T07:40:57.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xMistressAthenax,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=M3TAHwua,comment-id=000b00040000,timestamp=2014-12-15T00:30:36.641+0000)\n> The problem is, where do you draw the line of \"you're now where you belong\"?

They'll realistically never get close to seeing the rank they deserve. \n\nI disagree. I think you're drastically overestimating the amount of time it takes for that normalization to occur, at least in the average case. There may always be outliers, but over time enough the odds of a player *being* an outlier become vanishingly small. After long enough, it becomes statistically impossible (as the odds of it happening exceed the number of unique players). Saw someone do some math on it once, and I think you'd be surprised at how quickly that time approaches.\n \n> Obviously the above with the 6yrs is an inflated example, but the point remains. Not everyone gets the same amount of afkers/trolls. Not everyone can carry, but just because you can carry doesn't mean you're a good player either (this is actually true, as just being able to gobble up a crap ton of cs and run everyone through with an OP champ doesn't mean you're good when it comes to real things that matter such as Teamfights, and knowing when/where to be when things get tough). \n\nThere's a lot of various skills required to be \"good\" at League. Map awareness, mechanical skill, coordination, organization, positioning, farming, and tactical decision-making, to name a handful off the top of my head.\n\nGenerally speaking, as players progress up the ranks, they become better and better at more and more of those. But the ranking system views them in aggregate, not individually. A player who's got masterful mechanics and farming skill may not have the wide array of general skills that another player has, but that doesn't mean he deserves his ranking any less. His *overall* skill may be high because of the ridiculous strengths of those two skills.\n\nThere's simply no fair way to measure all of those skills that doesn't warp gameplay. I've been watching people propose all kinds of ideas for adjusting LP/MMR gains, for a couple years now, and I have yet to see anything that comes remotely close to accounting for all of the various skills that lead to wins. Except, y'know, measuring win ratio.\n\nIt's true that trolls, afks, ragers, and the like tend to warp rankings. But honestly? It really isn't much. And I strongly believe that it's mostly a function of *time*. Like I said, trolls might keep you down a division or two, but they won't keep you there forever, if your actual skill indicates you should be ranked higher.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jv21blU7oD","date":"2014-12-14T12:41:03.440+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dateline NBC,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=M3TAHwua,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2014-12-14T12:26:52.609+0000)\n> My problem is I know someone who is absolutely awful in league.

If someone dies more times than they have in kills, they are not feeding. The only way they are feeding is if they are intentionally dying.

Don't question another's logic, when you have none.\n\nBack on topic, this is not as much of an issue as you would want us to believe. I guarantee you...for the most part... no one would allow their friend, who has never played before, to play a ranked match on their account. That is literally asking for a ban, because I guarantee you everyone would report you.

I have school, a job, and a social life. I do not play this game all day, nor do I play it every day. However, I believe that I am probably better than you at this game in terms of communicating and cooperating with my teammates, along with understanding that there are always things that I can improve on. I know I am not the best player, but I still an open to learning how to become better. It seems that your problem is that you have the normal ADC attitude, or a superiority complex. You think you are better than everyone. You are the AD carry, you are supposed to carry. Stop acting like you are god's gift to the world. Your support is not supposed to carry you, stop acting like every role is supposed to have the same KDR as you in game. If you cannot play with other people, play customs.

You were being a grammar nazi towards the OP so this entire comment makes you a huge hypocrite. If you cannot type, speak, write, or whatever else with at least decent grammar, don't judge someone else's. Which is what you did. Refer to my above post where I quoted your own words. You're just mad because I caught you being hypocritical, so you're throwing out random insults at me that mean nothing. This not only shows, but proves your immaturity. \n\n>just because I'm bronze doesn't mean that I deserve to be in it\n\nIf you are in bronze, you deserve to be in it. If I were in bronze, I would deserve to be in it. I'm not saying it to be a dick. There aren't as many \"outside forces\" that keep you in bronze as people try and say. It's this attitude that leads to toxicity in the community. It's the \"it's not my fault that I got caught out, my teammates just suck\" attitude that leads to toxicity. This should not ever be tolerated. I don't care if your teammates are bad. Everyone gets teammates who need work. This does not give you a reason to shit on their life just because they are bad at the game. I must also remind you that everyone has bad days. You can't be perfect every single game. Everyone makes mistakes. Ease off. I'm not implying that it is necessarily bad to be in bronze at all. It's that your attitude on it is putting the blame on others, when you and I both know it is your own problem. If you want to get better at the game, you have to take responsibility for your mistakes, and learn from them.\n\n>I don't know what high horse YOU are on\n\nI don't know where the hell that came from. I specifically told you that I was not the best at the game, and I'm mature enough to admit that. If you think me admitting my flaws, and knowing that I can improve, makes me think \"higher\" of myself than everyone else, I think you need to sit down and reread, and rethink what I was saying to you. Putting the blame on others for your mistakes is pointless. All that does is cause toxicity. I wrote my post, not necessarily to bitch at you, as you have proclaimed to the world, but to make you realize why your argument is invalid. The only way to improve yourself is to accept that you are not perfect, and that there is always room for improvement. \n\nAnd in response to your other comment:\n\n>so your saying that by the rant you had before me that your about 8 yourself... because that's what you just told me, that job you have must be a sweat shop your parents force you to work at, poor baby.\n\nFirst of all, I could barely understand what you were trying to imply about me. I know you said earlier that you \"don't care about grammar\", trust me, I can see that, everyone can. But writing clearly is something that any intelligent person would aspire to do. Not only do you not sound like a complete imbecile when you learn how to write like an adult, but people will stop treating you like a child, which is probably why you are angry with me in the first place. If you act like a child I will treat you like one. Based on how you respond to criticism in not only your writing, but also your comments towards the initial topic, people will respond to you based on the fact that they assume that you are not mature enough to understand the difference between your rank, and who you actually are. You can be a decent, maybe even good player and be in bronze. I'm not saying that you are necessarily bad at the game. I'm saying you are not open to improving as you are still in that stage of blaming other players. Even if they did fuck something up, you don't have to call them out on it. I guarantee you they know that they fucked up. If people make a mistake, all you have to say is \"it's okay, shit happens\" you don't have to anger your teammates, or anyone else in the community just because of a simple mistake.\n\nNow I know there are people in this community that only have fun by trolling in games, and making it impossible to win. I understand the frustration. But fighting fire with fire will never help. Screaming at them, and whatever else won't help your situation. All you have to do is ignore them. The reason they troll in games is because they can get a rise out of people. So don't give them that opportunity. If they start talking to you in chat, and it annoys you, mute them. Simple. There will always be trolls, it's something that cannot ever be fixed. Some people are just assholes. The more people that ignore the trolls and make them lose at their own game, the less trolls there will be in the long run. If they don't have any fun doing it, they will stop. \n\nI said the things I said in my initial post because of what you wrote. You portrayed yourself in a way, that made me think of you in that particular way. Your initial response made you sound like you thought you were better than everyone else. It made you sound like an imbecile in the way you wrote it. It also made you look like not only a hypocrite, but also a complete asshole as you tried bashing the OP's logic, with flaws in your own. And finally it made you look immature, because instead of taking the blame and understanding that there are ways that you could improve to rank up, you instead placed the blame on everyone else. If you don't want people responding to your comments in the way that I did, I would suggest first learning how to write clearly, and second growing up. Sometimes it's better to realize that you were stupid, or that you made a mistake, and it's time to stop talking. This is where you differentiate between adults, and children.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2014-12-16T00:08:35.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh no, rage harder...that'll make you sound a lot better.

You can only carry so hard.  I managed to climb to silver by the 2nd week of preseason, but I had one of my friends in silver play in order to offset the possibility of someone feeding.  Certain champions can do well, but cannot carry.  Even if I'm going legendary on jungle amumu (pre jungle change) I still couldn't carry because our azir fed 0/11 before it was even 15 minutes","replies":[{"poster":"giraffiti0","date":"2014-12-16T15:59:54.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I just won my hardest series ever (gold 4). My first game my support sifaka was 0/6/1 by 15 minutes.

Do I deserve to be plat? Probably not. But I earned that win. My next game my fried decided to support me as jarvan (duo Q). Our mid DC'd before the game started so I told him to take mid I'll solo against vayne/lulu. By the 12 minute mark I was 0/1/2 and 20 some farm behind vayne. I manned up, and ended the game with 10 plus kills, 8 assists an somethig like 4 deaths (sorry at work can't check exact stats). Anyway, there is no Elo hell. Don't rage when people afk, just zip up your man suite as do what you can.
