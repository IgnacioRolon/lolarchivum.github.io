That would be the best first step, but there could be other factors for frames dropping.

I reinstalled my graphics card drivers, set VSync off in-game&Nvidia Control Panel and FPS is still capped at 60. An input lag is also present since the update.\n\nUPDATE: It seems like this problem occurred before. I did some research and managed to fix it.\n1. Go to start menu\n2. Search for Xbox app\n3. Log in\n4. After logging in, on the left side of the app window there should be a vertical taskbar-like menu; click the cogwheel icon(Settings)\n5. Go to Game DVR tab and switch it off\nThis worked for me, other ppl stated that it didn't help.\nIf you \"mistakenly\" uninstalled the app, do the following(simply installing it from the store didn't work for me, i couldn't log in)\n1. Run PowerShell as administrator(start, search power shell, rclick->run as administrator)\n2. Run the following commands:\n       Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage\n       Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxPackage\n3. Restart your PC\n4. When it boots back up, reopen PowerShell in the same way and run the following command:\n       Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\\AppXManifest.xml”} \n5. Now you should be able to sign in into Xbox and disable that option\nThat option is a recording tool from Xbox which will cap your FPS at 60 and will introduce a slight input lag(which is pretty annoying tbh)\nHope this helped,\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"February 4","date":"2016-09-03T09:14:31.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xdemkaas,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=WFZwhONW,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-20T18:03:57.390+0000)\n>\n> Same here.
