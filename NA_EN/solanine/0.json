Above, please find a link to a twitch clip where the bug is shown.\r\n\r\nThere doesn&#039;t seem to be a specific thing to trigger it in gameplay, but occasionally, when plants are active, they will ignore all nearby targets (champions or minions) and do nothing. Don&#039;t know what steps to use to reproduce it. This has only been happening since 8.16 went live, and I&#039;ve still been able to win games as Zyra, so the champ isn&#039;t unplayable, and it&#039;s clearly not every time that plants are activated, but it is noticeable enough to make you {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Game Of Thorns","date":"2018-08-22T18:53:13.330+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I uploaded a compilation of in-game (not spectating) footage where you can clearly see the plants targeting poros and the orianna's ball.\nAlso in the first clip (the one under turret) you see the plant targeting the poro while orianna is right next to it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz4kN95XfZg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Game Of Thorns","date":"2018-08-18T07:55:39.346+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that now plants seems to target other \"objects\" (xayah feathers, poros in ARAM etc..)\nor no attacks at all: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AId1HIfsZZs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpIvvtSR-xQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadrowne","date":"2018-08-17T22:22:13.013+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed it in my ARAM game.
