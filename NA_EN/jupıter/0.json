His E is where I take most issue. I feel like it could be rolled into his passive, gaining increased range at regular intervals, like Level 1 E is the same as the would-be level 1 passive, and level 3 E would be at level 13, and level 5 E would be at Level 18 (or something, I don&#039;t think these are very good numbers, but you get the idea).\r\n\r\nIs there anything that you know of on Warwick in coming patches?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T06:47:22.164+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware, there isn't a big update planned for him at the moment.
