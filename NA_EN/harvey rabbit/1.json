All that does is mean that anyone who wants to know has to  spend a slight amount of time looking up our match history to see it if they want to, it&#039;s not like the information of which players were in the game is hidden or confidential in some way....\r\n\r\nContext: I posted a gameplay rant with a recent game as an example, and linked to the game in my match history. Riot deleted the post and sent me a very polite and reasonable notice informing me that it had been deleted and why (because of the included link to the particular game in my match history).\r\n\r\nSorry that I didn&#039;t notice this rule before!

I didn't use any summoner's names in the post, although I now understand how it can fall under the \"name and shame\" rule.
