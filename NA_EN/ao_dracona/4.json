I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the correlation between unpopular and non-human is rather indirect and is in fact much more due to Riot using non-humans mostly to represent unusual or niche gameplay, often making such champions rather unfriendly to new players.\n\nRiot rarely supports these non-human champions well in the lore and skin departments as well. And of course there's the sexiness factor. Lots of people prefer champions that they find sexually attractive. Non-humans can be sexy too, though admittedly it's not as easy to make happen, but Riot doesn't seem to make any effort in this regard, further handicapping non-human champions when it comes to popularity. This part also basically applies to cuteness just the same.\n\nAnd to top it all off, non-humans can absolutely be highly relatable. Yet again, Riot doesn't seem to try to make this happen at all either. I get that it's asking for more and/or better work to make a non-human champion that's likely to be popular, but I think Riot should be aiming to do it anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2019-01-11T23:18:52.275+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"How much of any of that actually has to do with whether the champion is human or humanoid or non-human/humanoid? Most of the champions in the unpopular quadrant are either really old or niche champions that Riot gimped because they became meta.\n\nChampion loyalty isn't really a thing anymore. Lore/archetype and gameplay/champion popularity aren't nearly as connected as they used to be. Some of my favorite champions haven't been viable for 6-12 months. You can't use champion popularity to inform decisions pertaining to what champions you rework or create because it's so incredibly warped by balance.\n\nCamille, for example, would have been sitting in the Niche/Unpopular quadrant for probably 6 months but now I can almost guarantee that she's center-right or top-right. I can guarantee that Skarner shot up a fair bit for a decent chunk of the first half of Season 8.\n\nEDIT: Typical of Riot to give me an old table so that I'm stuck trying to remember what the state of the meta was back then while the Rioter gets to draw from internal data.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2019-01-11T23:37:51.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/6c678d4553180d8fc8bca241c7faa014.png\n\nBreaking that down into just Junglers (my main role and the one I can recall the most information about) it's painfully obvious how much a lot of that has shifted over the course of 2 seasons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2019-01-12T00:15:16.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give us a Poro champ and watch that shit change overnight.\n\n{{item:2052}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"loli nukes","date":"2019-01-11T23:08:01.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does interact with skins in some way at least.
