I think it really worth raising this topic. Imagine if nobody actually likes him, but invite him just because....well we always invite him..\nNot as ethical but possible solution: Find members of the group who don't like him and keep reporting him together after each game (not sure if systems will accept it though) or just put it \"us or him\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Binding Eclipse","date":"2018-10-20T23:21:43.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to deal: don't","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokiller5","date":"2018-10-21T01:01:13.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bro its like a game of basketball. if someone is constantly hounding on you or your teammates, then regardless of the relationship with that person you have the choice to just not play with them. \n\nApply the same logic, play with your friends but if he is invited (and trash talks his own teammates) then don't play with him. If your friends ask why you wont play tell them the truth that the other guy is toxic, if they really your friends they will have acceptance of your choice.\n\nI used to be a lot like that guy you mentioned (would always harass my own friends when they invited me to games), but majority of the time I didn't realize I was so toxic/overbearing to my own teammates and friends until one of them refused to play with me. It kinda opened my eyes. So give the benefit of the doubt to the guy you mentioned, maybe he really just doesn't know that he's being toxic. Either way you refusing to play and telling them the truth about why you wont play can only help the situation not harm it.","replies":[]}]}
