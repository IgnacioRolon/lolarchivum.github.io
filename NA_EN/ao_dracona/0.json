It doesn't say how much is reasonable, though, which is fundamental to OP's point. OP believes they should be able to have some down time without being at their parents' beck and call all day, communicating to establish boundaries. Do you disagree?\n\nI think that providing for a dependent (such as a child) is a gift that should be reciprocated, not a business investment propped up by threats or emotional blackmail.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2019-06-24T08:14:33.076+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually the post is pretty detailed.\nWhat a child/dependent should contribute and at what age is dependent upon a number of factors and unique to each family.

Respect is something a lot of people need to earn through their actions and decisions, parents aswell - I would rather say being grateful is adviced. Saying thank you and wishing to support other members and creating a peaceful atmosphere often results in helping out and doing some chores.\n\n> but you are talking about \"respect\" when your parents are probably are probably also tired from going to work to provide all of this and when they ask you to do some tasks to return the favor, you yell at them to leave you alone and call them \"disrespectful\" and \"lazy\" for interrupting you while you kick back and entertain yourself on their dime.\n\nI understood the situation like they demand his time for minor things which could be easily done by themselves or some and then cases which could be solved later (e.g. water is important for the dog because it's really hot right now, but as long as it isn't hungry the food could be refilled also later). \n\nLiving in a household is complicated but one of the most important things is *respecting the time of other members and value them*. Come on, OP even tells their parents that he/she starts playing now - meaning, that open chores could be brought up now or new ones could be given.\nIt's rude when a person even tells you that they now wanna have some free time and you kick this wish over and over again - no, because they pay stuff for them doesn't justify it. It would be also considered rude when OP disturbs his parents while they are trying to take a break.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-23T04:10:35.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you new to having parents?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-06-26T17:21:41.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Parents need to learn that children are not slaves, that school is work and that they are entitled to the same benefits of relaxing they should have.
