I was diamond 3 this season on ranked and just fell like over the past month and half, back to plat 4.... currently I cant even get out of plat 4, and i work my ass off by watching film and knowing my role (support main) and just every game has fallen to the point of where I am doing good but my team is just feeding and losing the game. Like honestly, some games I do bad and its on me, but a vast vast majority have been because of bad teammates.... I just do not know what to do. \r\n\r\nI feel like quitting. This community is good in my heart but idk. I&#039;m writing this on a late night loss session, and just don&#039;t know what to do. If there is anyone out there, that can offer advice... please.. I just want to be my potential rank again and prove I can do this because I can. I&#039;m way better than this but it doesn&#039;t seem like it... do I switch roles? do I like stop ranked? do i quit? help me..","replies":[]}
