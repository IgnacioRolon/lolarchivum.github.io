Between lvl's 1,2,3,4 there-after he has to back off or else he will get ganked; or his oppenent will destroy him 1v1. \n\nThis new Camo-stealth ability will help his pre-six a lot; as we get ganked we can hop bushes and get away. The attack speed bonus is nice.\n\nThe con is we are dependent on bushes to re-stealth as it is a 40 second CD; also why wouldn't riot add a numbered duration and not move \"7 Teemos' \". They also added the ability to use your W in stealth but how does this benefit anything to do with your camo? You can only move 7 teemos. Thank god they removed the slow effect though! WHEW!\n\nSolution: Give us back our stand still invisibility with element of surprise attack speed bonus. Give us a active stealth with a decent duration and remove the ticking CDR in bush on the camo. Give it a base CD thats below 25 please ...\n\nBlinding Dart Nerf:  I can't believe they are nerfing my blind dart AP ratio! From 80 to 60 % that is so unfair! That literally is the only thing I can do in Team fights other than throwing mushrooms inside the fight. I just don't understand! You want a squishy, 500 Range Marksman-mage to walk up to a team of poke mages and bruisers and expect me not to get one shotted??? just to AUTO then Q or Mushroom and Q. Like my 1v1 potential is increased but I was hoping for TEAM FIGHT POTENTIAL.\n\nDONT NERF MY Q AP RATIO PLEASE.\n\nW Move Quick? No speed increase? kinda bummed jhin, Miss fortune, Garen, Kaisa, Riven ... jesus list can go on can all out run me with their movement utility I was expecting a buff.\n\nR Noxious Traps\n\nI didn't see the mushrooms have 6 / 8 / 10 life bar I'm okay with the AP nerf since I can make more just please ensure the life bar is added so a team with {{item:3364}} {{item:3147}}  Can't clear an entire mushroomed jungle in 5 seconds. Which took me 2 minutes to achieve.","replies":[{"poster":"Arashi NA","date":"2019-05-31T00:57:25.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted on the part 1 and part 2 threads to regarding the teemo rework on multiple occasions and I still have not received word from anyone affiliated with Riot. Is this rework going to be cancelled, or will there actually be a teemo rework happening? The past two weeks I have tried to see the teemo rework changes and the PBE, and it has been reverted (again) to the normal teemo skills. I'm starting to wonder if this is even going to happen because it has been over 3 months, and there does not seem to be any input from Riot.\n\nAnyone know what's going on?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosmonaut Teemo","date":"2019-04-18T09:04:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I like the rework's direction, The new stealth skill is extremely good, the fact it has a distance based duration rather than a timed one is both unique and effective at allowing Teemo to do what he can on live (with his stealth passive) and likewise have the freedom and agency to move in stealth and make plays. I would prefer this easily over a time based duration. The CD is long because its not meant to be a in-combat stealth, like say Vayne or Kha'zix. Even though the duration is long, the bush effect at lowering the cd is very effective and it isn't bad at all with some CDR.\n\nBlind Dart nerfs are entirely warranted, considering Toxic shot was moved to passive. If it didn't receive base damage and scaling nerfs, it would be outright op in lane. The Damage amplification on passive makes up for  the damage loss, and having access to both blind and toxic shot at earlier levels benefits Teemo's trading pretty well. \n\nNo changes to W, true, though I can only assume its because his new E makes him safe enough mobility wise they don't want to make it excessive. Shrooms  are weaker overall, but they still have great utility, and with the poison synergy it makes his split-pushing and assassination power much stronger. I think something important to note is that Teemo has always sort of been less of a mage and more of a dps/assassin like champion. He is a great duelist, and this rework enhances that, likewise it enhances his split-pushing and assassin capabilities.\n\nI think the rework is going to be fine. It gives Teemo new utility and enhances his strengths while also keeping his identity, which is what I want from a rework.  If anything, it address some health problems Teemo has had in the past and modernizes his kit in a healthy way.","replies":[{"poster":"NaikWonderweiss","date":"2019-04-27T13:14:46.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cosmonaut Teemo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Kd7qBlEo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-04-18T09:04:45.257+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I like the rework's direction, The new stealth skill is extremely good, the fact it has a distance based duration rather than a timed one is both unique and effective at allowing Teemo to do what he can on live (with his stealth passive) and likewise have the freedom and agency to move in stealth and make plays.

The new toxin passive sounds like it does more dmg, but theres no ap ratio in sight. The q nerfs don’t suit him as he is no marksman and never will be. I rarely used W, but now it’ll be the 2nd max since the new E looks awful. Before i rarely used the stealth passive, now its simply a gimmick pushed into the kit. However the shroom change is the worst as the dmg got gutted. More shrooms isn’t necessary and doesnt justify the nerf of the dmg. What annoys me is that they wanna kill of his trapper playstyle, going full ap and seeing a shroom eat a third of the hp of an adc. All in all I think the nuke-shroom playstyle will suffer and that the new E is a waste of space.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmonaut Teemo","date":"2019-04-28T04:45:46.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NaikWonderweiss,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Kd7qBlEo,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-04-27T13:14:46.697+0000)\n>\n> I detest the rework on paper, but havent played it yet.

The Toxic Shot passive keeps the same ratio as live on the DoT and has a 20% ap ratio on hit, both of these are increased by 50% when in conjunction with Shroom or Blind. The Q Nerfs are warranted, as 80% ap scaling on a non-skillshot that we will be maxing first that is likewise a disable that amplifies his damage just makes him way way too oppressive with Toxic shot as a passive. Teemo's passive on live is one of his stronger abilities, and the ability to move in  stealth is an insanely powerful boost, especially as a true invisibility. This, combined with E being an on-demand attack speed buff is a large damage bump. Its far from a gimmick, as few champions have access to real stealth skills and when used appropriately they offer a large amount of options to the player to both engage, disengage, and assassinate and duel. Shrooms are likely over-nerfed, but saying they are gutted is wrong. Their value as vision, zoning tools, and the ability to control objectives in conjunction with your team is where shrooms get their highest value, not just their damage.\n\nYou can still go full ap, you can still play teemo as he is on live, his playstyle hasn't radically changed, Shrooms do less damage on their own, they simply want you to be putting input with them rather than just placing traps without thought. The poison buff on autos with shrooms will guarantee high damage against anyone. A trap shouldn't be encouraged to half-health a squishy champ on its own. Iv' mained this champion for 4 years, and im willing to admit that, because its one of the hardest things to balance in his kit, and its easily the most frustrating. I don't want them nerfed that strongly either, but if its too weak, they may end up being buffed again, we can't say, its only testing.\n\nThough I promise, the New E is probably one of the better stealths in the game, and it fits easily into Teemo's playstyle. The amount of flexibility and agency it gives you both in and out of lane is phenomenal, since he is now a mostly immobile champion, and keeping up with modern champions is hard on him, allowing him to have a safety net in lane against ganks, as well as a method to engage, duel, and splitpush, is something Teemo could very well use. While I don't think the rework is perfect, and there is room for improvement, I fully believe that the gameplay changes are healthy for him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"that dough dœ","date":"2019-04-23T12:55:50.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahanwkwbwiebg","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-18T09:44:05.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unsurprising that a champion's main isn't happy with its rework. The point of a rework is to change a champion's playstyle. If you like Teemo because he is specifically exactly what he currently is (which sounds like the case here, given the criticism of even small details like nerfing Q's AP ratio from 0.8 to 0.6), no possible rework will appease you. He will simply acquire a different set of mains, as what is functionally a different champion.","replies":[]}]}
