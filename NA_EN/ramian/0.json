But my problem is that Zac doesn't need to be like that. I've been thinking about a way to buff him without turning him into a monster, and I think he needs only one of two things:\r\n\r\n(1) for enemies to be unable to squish his bloblets, OR\r\n\r\n(2) for there to be a better system for where the blobs land when he uses his abilities. In other words, based on his current health, have the bloblet land either in front of Zac or behind him. If he's at nearly full health, it would be more likely to land in front of him, to encourage players to go on the offensive to pick it up, but the less health he has, the more likely the bloblets are to land behind him, so he can safely retreat and heal up.\r\n\r\nAs is, there is a better-than-good chance that a bloblet that you *need* to pick up, will land roughly one step in front of your lane opponent, where they can indirectly deal 4% of your current health without laying a finger on you just by stepping on the blob. I think ONE of these two solutions could put Zac into a healthy place in the meta right now. But like I said, maybe I just like Zac more than a healthy summoner should.\r\n\r\nHe also needs a suit skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T12:02:46.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think you need to not be able to smite his blobs. If you pick up the purple smite against a Zac, you can just let them get almost to coming back up and then just smite one blob and it'll kill the rest because of the AOE it does. Kiiiiiiiind of annoying. It was funny back in the day to KS your partner who was killing the blobs by smiting the last one, but now that you can smite all of his blobs at the same time? Well, may as well not have a passive.\n\nAlso. If he gets a skin, it better be an Earth Worm Jim skin.","replies":[]}]}
