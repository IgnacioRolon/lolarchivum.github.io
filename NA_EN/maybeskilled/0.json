It sounds like you might be having problems with your password due to someone else having access to your account. Sometimes when people 'hack' other accounts, they might change the password/email to try and keep the original owner from getting it back. \n\nWe can help get your account back if you reach out to us through our [**Account Recovery Form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).
