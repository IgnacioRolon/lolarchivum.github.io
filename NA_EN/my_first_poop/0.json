Nothing else loads. After a while a pop up opens saying, \"Another instance of the program is running. Do you want to terminate it?\" If I click ok, the logo dissappears and nothing happens, nothing opens up (I've waited 20+ minutes). If i just x out of the pop up, the same things happen or  i get a new pop up after a few minutes saying that PVP.net have stopped working and I have to close the program. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. My LOL was working earlier today, so it's likely not any patch (however, I was experiencing heavy lag in the games I played today). Any advice is appreciated.
