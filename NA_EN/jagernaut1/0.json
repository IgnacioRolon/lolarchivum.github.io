Years later, me and my old roommate re-download the game and I find out that my account was phished and my log-in had changed. After submitting a ticket, I recover my account to find out that it was banned for trying to phish other accounts. I emailed support asking if it could be unbanned since it had been phished, but they said no.\n\nIs there anything else I can do? I've spent a lot of time and money on this account and have several skins which aren't available anymore. Should i try submitting another ticket specifically for this issue?\n\nThanks, Jagernaut1","replies":[{"poster":"BirbMan530","date":"2017-08-06T00:47:09.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account was permaed cause I had 2 teams in a row flame and report me.

Ultimately, as the creator you and I are still responsible for the security and behavior of the accounts we made. You can still [**make a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to speak with them again, either to appeal the ban or to get more information.\n\nI can't guarantee that they'll lift it, but I also don't want to leave you hanging with any questions regarding why they came to the decision they did either. Besides those questions though, let me know if you have anymore or if I can help you out with anything else!","replies":[{"poster":"Jagernaut1","date":"2017-08-06T04:58:51.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely did put a damper on my excitement to come back :(\n\nThanks a lot for your advice.
