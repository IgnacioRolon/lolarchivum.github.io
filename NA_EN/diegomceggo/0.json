I have tried to turn off vertical sync, but this them makes it so my game jumps frames every few seconds. I have tried restoring my original video settings, but that didn't help either. Lastly, I uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem is still there. As you can imagine this is very frustrating, can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T22:36:52.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have some outdated drivers that could be causing problems rendering content in the game.

I don't know which cause the problem, but if I turn off the v-sync, it solves the problem. @VoletWolf, @DiegoMcEggo, you guys have geForce or Radeon? My monitor is 60hz btw. Before this some days, there was no problem like this.\nRioters should ask this thing from the nvidia, I think ('cause it seems to be the new driver's fault). Driver version: 375.95\nPS: Today came out a new driver, going to install it, then I will give feedback. Btw, this update is mostly for new games like Watch Dogs 2, so this don't realy contains bug fixes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StainedViolett","date":"2016-11-27T22:05:27.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this issue too and so have a few others i know.
