Your MMR is hidden and isn't displayed on the client (third party websites can't reliably calculate this) so I'm not sure exactly what you're seeing. \n\nIf your LP went down after a win, it could have happened if you were marked as AFK during that match. AFK's in ranked games will count as a loss regardless of whether your team pulls through without you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-17T15:30:34.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this were to happen, I would probably assume that your win rate is under 50%, either that or you were afk in that game long enough to lose eligibility to receive credit for that game, and it then would have been marked as a loss for you regardless of the outcome of the match.","replies":[]}]}
