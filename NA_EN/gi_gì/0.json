Riot doesn't reward for negative players i get it. So i got chat banned and after i finish chat ban i had honor level locked and put to 0 which is weird because u start at 2. So i play a few matches and it says i unlocked honor rewards back after that i thought i could get keys again. about 4 months later i still haven't got a key to this day last skin i got was in august besides the one i purchased from my cash. Is this really right to not be able to get any rewards?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T23:05:59.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Behavioral incidents will set your honor level to 0, preventing you from obtaining keys and rewards.  Playing consistently will level you up again, much faster if playing honorably.  Unfortunately, it looks like a recent occurrence on the 11th dropped your level to 0.  You'll need to continue playing to get your level up and restore eligibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Gi Gì","date":"2017-12-01T20:18:42.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like i said again i spend a lot of time playing league and almost every game i get honored so kills the whole playing and honorably.\nIve played for like 4 months im almost 47 and ive played just as much before the level rework","replies":[]}]}]}
