Second off, I was aware of the current amount on Spotify, it just doesn't contain some of the later tracks (namely login themes of 2015-2016), those being the ones I'd like to see there.\n\nOverall you're right though, it's just me being lazy more than anything else, and not taking the time to go and download something off of SoundCloud. Thanks for allowing me to realize that more easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2016-11-29T00:12:56.112+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be ideal to get everything on Spotify!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-11-29T04:50:15.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the fact my DoTA 2 friend takes 20 minutes in the login screen because they don't make new music often in DoTA 2 tilts me rito pls","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-11-28T04:54:38.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the Universe recently launched...
