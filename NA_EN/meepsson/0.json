Both sides matter a lot believe it or not as they are both useful in different aspects. When 90% of the playerbase shows low satisfaction rates towards something but the best player of the world doesn't. both sides have to be heard.

That makes absolutely no sense.\n\nIt's not hard to understand, and i'm not saying they should change every champion to what the populace demand.

My point may seem very extreme but I would like to make clear that I agree with you to an extent, I agree that people should get rewarded as they get better at the game, that can be seen with champions like Akali, that despite her losing a lot in lower elos because people aren't good enough to use her kit, in high elos she is still considered overpowered and is even getting nerfed for it. Now let's turn towards the opposite side of the spectrum with the infamous Right Clicker himself, {{champion:11}} . He is considered in low elos as one of the most broken champions. In both cases Riot has to compromise the interests of the other parties and work the extra mile so both sides can be happy with the result. The problem comes when a champion like Yasuo is introduced, He has always been infamous for having way too many tools for himself and leaving the counterplay up to the skill of the one facing him. And it's hard to decide what changes may be best since his playerbase is massive. But that's honestly up to riot in the end.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-05-14T22:12:42.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO, yasuo ban rates are so high because of the sheer amount of Yasuo OTPs.

In team play, the W is almost inconsequential since pro players have the coordination to force it from him and drag him away from it.\nIn solo queue, where there's nowhere near that level of coordination, The adc or mage will *attempt* to do that, and then their team will hard engage right on top of the wall where the adc and mage literally can not contribute, then rage for them not dealing damage.\n\nIn addition to that, there's the part where Yasuo gets a much earlier power spike from items than most other laners, and will legit just get to the point of walling you off your cs and daring you to contest it.

Even though it can be cast from off the other person's screen.\nhis W is just utter bs against any projectile based champ, since he can stand in it.\n\nHe wins lane more than 50% of the time in literally every lane, something no other champ can claim.  This is despite his weakness supposedly being his early game.\n\nI know how to fight him, I know how to bait his wall.  I also know it's damn near impossible to hit him with a skill shot windwall or not, since he can also dash, which gets faster with his movement speed.\n\nI know his kit, and the few times I've ever played him it's generally been something along the lines of, blah blah blah I fucked up, R, double,triple, quadra kill.  Even if Im not doing well at all the entire game.\n\n\nI know how he works, I know how to fight him, I know how to counter him.\n\nI also know he has a ton of tacked on bull shit, the game is literally coded to help him for no reason, I know he is unbelievably frutrating to play against and is overall a stupidly designed, overloaded and bullshit creation that is unhealthy.  I know that he has had above 50% banrate since his inception over 5(?) years ago now.\n\nHe is a hated and unhealthy champ who has no place in a PvP game.  He deserves a rework and quite frankly deserves to be disabled until it happens.  \n\nNo one, even Teemo who is memed to be Satan him fucking self, is as near universally hated as Yasuo.\n\nNo one, even Ezreal who is played far more often and broken far more often, has reached that kind of consistent banrate since LoL actually was LoL and not having true stealthed Eve and op Kassadin.\n\n\nI know how to fight a Yasuo.  I can hold my own in lane against him even when he hard counters me.  i can easily kill him if I counter him.\n\nI hate doing it.\n\nI hate wining lane against him, I hate losing lane against him.  I hate dodging his tornados I hate getting hit by them.  I hate having him dodge every skill shot with E I hate using his E to dodge skill shots as if it required any effort.  I hate watching people get snared by his ult, I hate getting snared by his ult, and I hate using his ult.\n\nI hate how his passive is always up and everything in his kit helps his passive come up.\n\nI hate how he can delete projectiles but Akali isn't allowed to heal and Irelia can't break shields.\n\nI hate that Riot will delete things everyone considers iconic from other champs but leave things no one considers iconic on Yas because \"they're iconic!\".\n\nI hate that Riot announced a rework for him, then went silent for 3 months and said never mind.\n\nI actually love the character, I love his art and design and I love his lore.  \n\nHis kit never should've existed and needs a complete overhaul to even begin to be balanced for a PvP game.\n\nI hate how people say \"he takes some skill to play!\", but nowhere near as much attributed.  He is literally an inverted Kat in that regard.  Kat is deceptively hard to play because she has no actual survival skills.  Yasuo is deceptively easy to play because he has a shit ton of survival skills and also the game is coded to make him live even though he should be turret diving.\n\nIt is not a matter of \"hes strong!\", \"hes weak\", \"hes busted!\" or \"hes been gutted\".  His strength as a champ doesn't factor in in any manner.\n\nI couldn't care less if he was gutted to make his Q only do 1 damage.  I'd still hate him.\n\nHe isn't a strong champion.\n\nHe's a bad design.  He is the incarnation of every possible design flaw in a character's kit put together into a single kit.\n\nHe has over bearing skill shots, he has the game giving him it's aid, he has far to much mobility, he literally has 2 passives that don't interact in any way, one passive is to literally double a stat, the other is to literally give a free shield with no actual cooldown and it comes up faster with his abilities.  His ult is literally a \"pause the fight and give him damage and a shield that has no actual interaction\".  He's near impossible to properly interact with.  He's designed in such a way to turn off the parts of other champs that make them fun.  He is able to use single target healing with his aoe damage, he is able to completely delete damage instead of simply reducing it.  His Q has been bugged to allow him to cast it while moving for years.\n\nHe is a terible design.\n\nIt's not whether he's strong or weak.\n\nIt's that his kit shouldn't exist.\n\nThe only reason he is allowed to exist is because a top dog on the balance team mains the champ.\n\nThe same way Karma was allowed to be busted for the exact same reason.  Karma balance team member got fired.\n\nYasuo's team member should be held to the same standard.","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2019-05-14T13:12:53.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to interrupt but what iconic things were removed?
