If they want to use old stats they should at least not use incomplete stats that are many months old.\n\nIn the previous season they did not recycle old stats every time a new split began.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-01-27T21:34:33.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In an effort to be more like OGN (pre-LCK --- I HATE THIS MONIKER) Riot thought they should show stats like them as well.\n\nWelcome to the future...where everything is a cheap imitation of what Korean eSports did first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
