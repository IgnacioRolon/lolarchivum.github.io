Any time a discussion gets going, it gets buried under the \"show more\" buttons, which are way too common and reveal too little each time they are clicked. New posts in a long thread never make it to front when sorted by the default \"Best\" selection because they don't have enough upvotes. Selecting \"Recent\" makes following discussions difficult because posts don't remain recent for long and posts in reply to other posts do not show up it seems.\n\nSelecting \"Show as flat\" fails to show who replied to who unless you specifically click \"show parent\" on every post, making it a mess and nearly impossible to follow.\n\nThe Patch Forecasts are an excellent example as to why this format does not scale well for serious discussions. They don't even feel worth posting in unless you are one of the first 50 people to post. I think the environment here is much better than GD, but this format is incapable of replacing the traditional thread format.\n\nI see a couple ways of fixing this. One possibility is to allow a \"do not hide anything\" selection so every post in a thread is displayed. And in doing so, widen the area where posts are actually displayed or allow side scorlling. There is a ton of wasted space on both sides that could be used for displaying longer nested discussions. This would be heavier on the resources, which is why it would have to be optional.\n\nOr, turn the flat view into a more traditional forum format, that shows all parents automatically and can be selected as a default preferred way to view threads.\n\nJust my take on Community Beta over the last few months.","replies":[{"poster":"Sweet","date":"2014-06-05T19:36:06.346+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Penguin, appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. I like your suggestions for solutions, particularly re-evaluating the current handling of \"flat\" discussion. \n\nThe team recognizes that the current format for discussion is a pain point for many of our players. It is definitely something that we are looking into and experimenting with. Although I don't have more concrete details to relay at this moment, I hope to continue fielding feedback while we work towards improving the overall experience in the community.\n\nKeep the feedback coming.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-06-05T19:36:41.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there going to be a timeframe for increasing the amount of replies a comment can have?
