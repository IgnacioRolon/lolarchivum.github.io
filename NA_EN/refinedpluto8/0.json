I get accused of scripting all the time. A lot of the time the whole other team will curse me out and report me. Or relentlessly harass me for losing even though I scripted.\r\n\r\nI don't script.

I played a lot of Xerath at the start of the season, havn't been playing him much recently. One of my favorite champions, and if you're good at him you're going to be called a scripter by someone. I find some joy in it as they thought I played that good and they just can't handle that someone is better than them. So many people just can't handle playing video games with others.\nBeing reported for something you didn't do won't do anything. Riot's system is actually pretty good and if you do end up getting some sort of punishment (because not everything is perfect) then you would be able to submit a support ticket and it should be figured out quickly.\n\nGoodness I love myself some good Xerath plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T04:50:02.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow! Seems like someone was a little jealous of yo skills! AFAIK, getting reported for scripting shouldn't get you punished. We have a system that scans for scripts running in the background that, despite its infamy, seems to work rather well and would have caught any Xerath scripts.\n\nLemme be the one to say, Good Jorb Summoner!\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]}]}
