Taric: the hardest rework","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":42,"down_votes":4,"body":"OK, maybe first about myself:\nAm I Korean Chellenger Taric main? Nope, im not into rankeds (was gold 5 in season 4).\nIm just a guy who enjoy playing tanky dudes (juggernauts, tanks, supports) and utility mages.\nIm a simple man who prefers simple kits without minigames.\nIm not even sure if I can call myself a true Taric main (although I own the only true skin for him). \nI just really likes his playstyle, personality and he is my go to support.\nSome time ago i even posted [who he is imo and some rework idea](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/rk2ORkAg-taric-rework-my-idea-and-thoughts) for him.\n\n___________\nSo, to the point: as we all know Taric&#039;s rework is next big step on Riot&#039;s rework list.\nAnd thats great but there is one little thing that bothers me:\n\n**Right now we got almost none 100% info about this rework.**\n\nI uderstand that Riot wants this big &quot;suprise mothafuka&quot; moments but imo its not the best idea for reworks.\nWe play this champions, we love them, we hate them, we fight with them, we lose with them and we win with them.\nI know that this is their game, but I think that in case of champion relaunch a communication between the mind (Riot) and the hearth (players) of this game is necessery. \nLosing a main due to rework is the worst thing that can happen to a player in this game, its like losing a good friend irl.\n\n_________________________________________\nAnd here we are back to Taric again.\nUnlike Sion or Poppy - Taric&#039;s theme and personality is really strong. \nSo strong that he become one of fan favourites. That why I call him &quot;the hardest rework&quot;.\nThere is so many things that Riot need to keep in his rework that im afraid it is almost impossible.\nImpossible... without communication.\n\n_____________________\n**So here are my questions about Taric&#039;s rework:**\n- Is he as viable support/top/jungle as Tahm Kench?\n- Can you point a champion with similar skill floor to his reworked version?\n- What is the most core thing in current Taric for Riot?\n- If his reworked kit is not successful or is not liked by players will Riot be willing to revert him to his old kit with new visuals and retry balance it?\n(we dont want to be left with next cassio or ryze)\n\nI really hope that someone at Riot will be willing to answer them.\n{{champion:44}} May the Gems be with you, friends.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-02-11T06:40:00.834+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"I actually don't really think it's fair to say we're entirely holding out for a big grand reveal moment on everything as far as Taric is concerned.

One of the things that I think the rest of the champion update designers and I are constantly trying to get better at is balancing what data we have with respect to the existing character on Live. When it comes to full revamps like Taric, which the community pretty unanimously agrees needs the update, one of the biggest challenges (which I hope we've managed well in Taric's case) is trying to extract the essence of the existing champion that some players attach to and instill those things into the update.","replies":[{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2016-02-11T19:13:27.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does that work with champions who aren't as popular {{champion:83}} {{champion:6}}  and whose character types don't seem as popular?
