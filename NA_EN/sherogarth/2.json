We have created this ADC META by doing everything to keep ADC alive. Riot then used this and started to enforce te META untill it all became crap. Riot gave us power creeped tools to **bold** ADCs importance even more than before.\n\nMy very first post in the thread was about weapons being power creeped, right? It's because everything Riot does is making sure ADC is always #1 in team. That's why they deal most damage. Because they have tools (PC'ed weapons) to do shitton of damage and reduce about half of anyones armor. Unfair like all hells.\n\n> You'd have to substantially change league to change that. \n\nI have to disagree sadly.. Because it's impossible.. ADCs will always be most important. Still, we could remove/balance power creep though, which would work with me ;)\n\n> but would be outclassed by mages.\n\nAt this point mages are utility, secondary supports. They are picked either for:\na) high burst (to kill anything that could kill ADC)\nb) supporting ADC (to save ADC from death)\n\nThat's kinda fking lame if you ask me.. It's fantasy game after all..
