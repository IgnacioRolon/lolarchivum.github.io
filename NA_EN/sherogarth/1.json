I hope someone will answer me :D.\nLove, peace and Gems everyone {{champion:44}} .","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-14T15:42:53.502+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"> What from this list you gonna keep in his rework?\n\nI think most or all of it.","replies":[{"poster":"NightstalkerX7","date":"2015-08-14T16:58:41.523+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will he remain, Outrageous ?
