I was Gold 3 like a week ago, now I&#039;m about to demote from gold. I&#039;m sad because I guess I really am just THAT bad. Every game I get ( I main adc, jinx if you can&#039;t tell ), I get a supp who would rather be a carry instead of being supports. Like I don&#039;t understand why every other enemy team&#039;s support sticks with their adc but mine NEVER does lolllllll . Or I someone gets autofilled and they can&#039;t play their role, but decide to mention it after they&#039;re like 3/16 . oh jesus save me lol.\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=KemiKat","replies":[]}
