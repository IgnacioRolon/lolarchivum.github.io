Just because a champion is annoying, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re actually powerful, but there is always the possibility of that. Even if a champion isn&#039;t overpowered or anything, being unfun to fight is just as big a problem. People play this game for fun, right? It&#039;s hard to have fun when fighting an annoying champion, like for me I have to say that {{champion:157}}, {{champion:51}}, and {{champion:67}} are all very annoying champions to fight. And while I tend not to think of the champions as overpowered, I think they should have changes to be less annoying for those fighting them. Even if it&#039;s fun or flashy or $LCSBIGPLAYS$ for one person, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s fun for the other.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m trying to get at is that the community should know when a champion is actually broken, or if they&#039;re just annoying. And for Riot too, so they know that they don&#039;t necessarily have to nerf a champion that&#039;s annoying, but change their kit to be less annoying through mini-reworks like {{champion:102}} and {{champion:12}}. (OK, maybe Shyv was a bad example of being less annoying, but the point still stands)","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-02-04T17:02:32.656+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"actually annoying = broken.\n\nbroken isn't overpowered, don't confuse them.\nBroken is however, a designation for a kit issue that causes problems for game health.\nBeing incredibly annoying to face and removing agency is a health issue for the game. \nif I can't either counterbuild or counterplay you, without being much much better than you, then there is a a kit issue.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2017-02-04T18:10:27.073+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is actually a difference between broken, OP, and annoying.\n\nSinged is Annoying.
