His ult pretty much can kill his teammates, his heal shrines can be stomped and they exist in the first place making enemies aware of where low health teammates are going to go, his q can just not stun or hit targets correctly, his e can put your team in a bad spot or the enemy team in a better one.\n2. With Bard's theme of a roamer, that style would better suit a jungler(he can't clear) or a mid(not enough damage in kit) champ, not a bot lane support pretty much we get reported if we're not babysitting the adc 95% of the game.\n3. Bard has so many bugs with his e. There's no indicator where the **actually** exit ends, sometimes the portal is off where your cursor directs it to so it goes in the wrong direction ends at the wrong point and can sometimes just spit you at the side of the wall, and his q will have wonkey miss fortune style interactions where it doesn't hit in an intended line or to directed targets it can go all wanted style and curve 30 degrees to hit a target off to the side. If you guys doubt me just spend 10 mins in practice tool and you'll see every instance of what I'm talking about.\n4. Look I've owned bard since his release, he was freaking released on  my birthday lol, in essence he's what Kayle support should've functioned as but he falls flat as a **dependable** support because his abilities affect his team as much as they do the enemy. \n\nI'm not saying buffs are bad for Bard, I'm just saying they have had to buff him extensively to make up for qol issues he's had since release. Give us an auto ping like Ryze and Panth ults to give teammates a better heads up, make our portal outhole the same size as the inhole so it's more clear where we get spit out and allow bard and team to go through the portal by clicking on it and not through it, do something with his e so it gets a reduced cooldown on getting chimes so you can get back to lane quicker.","replies":[{"poster":"BIG DADDY BARD","date":"2017-04-10T18:19:39.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I'm sorry but everything you said there, if you're experienced with bard, is just wrong.
