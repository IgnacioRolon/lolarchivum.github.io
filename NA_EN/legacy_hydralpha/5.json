They tend to feel annoying and unfun to have to fight. What exactly do these characters have that makes them so annoying and hated? Is it their mobility, damage, outplay potential, CC, or just having a toxic kit for the game? What makes y&#039;all annoyed by these champs? For me it&#039;s just how much they have to offer, or being overloaded. It&#039;s easy to make a champion sound OP or overloaded, but look at what these champs tend to have.\r\n\r\n* Mobility (Situational or not)\r\n* Damage (In the form of either burst or DPS)\r\n* Some sort of HARD crowd control (stuns, knockups, displacements, etc.)\r\n* Useful in teamfights (Asides from probably Camille, who&#039;s a bit more duelist-oriented)\r\n\r\nThe real question is what truly makes these champions so unliked and hated, and what can be done to fix it besides QQing about &quot;nerf/delete so-and-so&quot; or Riot (sometimes) taking sides on champions? (I won&#039;t bother quoting what they said about Lee Sin cause it does make sense: have a flashy champion make money, it&#039;s business.

Games will often be decided based on the champion's performance since they can single-handedly win or lose a game based on their performance.\n------------------\nWhile I'm not going to say that such champions aren't balanced, I dislike having them in the game for either team.

If you can't lock her down, you lose.  Period.  Her one weakness outside laning phase is cc, but with qss, her ult, and her q, only champs like Malphite and Gnar can lock her down with huge aoe cc, and that's if they have teammates with more cc to follow up.  Yeah she takes skill and reflexes to play right when she's dodging skills, but unless her enemy has all the right tools to take her down, she wins.\n{{champion:157}} I love how flashy he is, and his outplay potential, but his problem is just that.  Basically, you're a boss ath the end of an old videogame.  A bad yas will just run headlong at you and get demolished, but a good yas WILL win.  Powergamers don't lose boss fights, and powergamers play him.  He has all the right tools to win and unless he messes up, he can never die.  Plus once he gets 2 items it doesn't matter how hard you shut him down, he can win the whole game.\n{{champion:64}} He doesn't have quite the outplay potential or the skillcap as Yas or Vayne, but his combos are insane.  His full combo (wardhop, e, ult, q,q) has a 380% bonus AD ratio, high base damage, plus it ends with a missing health scaling and plants him in front of you with 40% bonus attack speed.  He builds ad, period.  So many other champs have to give up one thing in their build to have another, but there is no reason not to build straight ad in the early game on Lee.  I just want wardhopping removed so that he has counterplay.  It's outdated and it's bs to play against.\n{{champion:92}} Same as lee, but replace wardhopping with animation cancelling.  If she wants to weave in AA's, go ahead, but make her have to take more time to do so.  The skill with Riven should be with reflexes, desisionmaking, and knowing your limits, not pressing buttons really fast.

Even trading 1 to 1 ratio of kills just makes her get closer to her late game. I am guessing 2nd reason is that people try to duel her and most people expect ADCs/bot marksmen to be able to easily duel and don't like the fact that she can duel them. I am guessing 3rd reason is that they don't like how vayne is stronger as game goes on because they don't end the game quickly or its the fact she points a time limit on the game to end it quickly. 4th I am guessing is because they hate vayne's ability to kite divers and bruisers and deal high dps within her limited auto range of 550. I am guessing 6th reason would be her stealth makes her hard to lock down and it frustrates people trying to hit stuff on her. I am guessing 7th reason is people playing squishes try to duel her without any burst but dps or use mainly autos in which is vayne's best situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grift98","date":"2017-04-08T02:00:29.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you forgot to include {{champion:114}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2017-04-08T01:50:01.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much all of those champions have built in mobility and cc, as a {{champion:223}} main I get salty whenever I see a riven who still out runs me and my team when i manage to land my skillshot and cc her....because her q spam basically makes her immune or resistant to movement impairment.

However these duelists and some others like Fiora have not only overloaded kits but huge safety nets. If two players of equal skill are facing each other and one of them picks one of these champions, the other has to counter pick them or else they lose. Worse off if you the first player picks a champion that doesn't counter pick them, and the other one of them picks one of those champions, gg. You don't out play them, you can only counter pick them. Possibly with the exception of Lee since he is mostly dependant on his teammates ending the game fast. That and being the jungler is more than counter picking.\n\nThe reason is all the safety nets and on top of the denial those safety nets have, this leads to even more hate. Take Camille for instance. Her R makes her untargetable on top of what it does, stops unstoppable forces, knocks opponents away, AND you can't flash out of it. Denial of summoner spells is always considered a cheat regardless of how hard it is to use. Like Fiora's parry for instance, regardless of having to time it perfectly, it cheats because it denies summoner spells. These spells cheat because of ... reasons.\n\nThese champions have the tools to especially remove other champions from the game entirely. On top of that the champions removed have harder skill shots to land. Or champions whom sacrificed a lot in their kits for their role, and get replaced by same overloaded champions. Got an UNSTOPPABLE Sion charging at you with basically THE HARDEST SKILL SHOT IN THE GAME TO LAND? It's kay just Camille ult or Fiora parry. Got a Nami ult incoming? from a the support WHOM ARE SUPPOSE TO HAVE NOPE BUTTONS AND PLAYMAKING ABILITIES BECAUSE THEY DO NO DAMAGE. Just windwall it, oh and Yasuo does do damage. Tahm Kench was even hated because he dealt single target damage and had a NOPE button regardless of being a support. You can smell the favouritism.\n\nSo that's why these champions are hated. They turn the game into champion select of counter picks. Have tools and safety nets that removes other champions from the game. Same safety net that steal other roles' job and denies them theirs. Are always useful regardless how bad they are because of overloaded kits. Deal undeniable damage on top of what they have in their kits. Seem to draw favouritism from Riot even if Riot may or may not favour them.","replies":[]}]}
