.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you can't fight grief/troll behaviour , you step to make it legal , so idk at least tell your players that you can't provide a fair gameplay ,and that you don't encourage people who troll/grief to stop... , i one feel like you encourage normal players to step into breaking rules and grief/troll , as long as this become from day to day a common practice among the community who plays this game! .\r\n\r\nIf you still share some respect for your projects ,game history , and the length of this game been in e-sports, show yourself over here ,or at least share the fact you care , share the fact you are open to receive ideas , or make a contest idk , if you don't like to feel like players have to tell you what to do into stopping this ,with your company income , i am sure there can be an idea you can pay and add it to this game , in order to fight grief/troll much more efficient , without necesary copy the other games overwatch system , if that bother you.\r\n\r\nThe players find easy to break rules which you don't follow to fix or to work on , and right now , if someone see that he can grief/troll without to be banned , that sends him the message is safe for him to do it!!!! , even when someone troll/grief intentionally you don't take action.\r\n\r\nWhich in teory express the fact that if you don't apply rules and don't pursuit to punish those grief/troll players ,another player angry behind the fact you ignore his report and the fact someone else troll/grief into his game , probably will pursuit to do break rules next time he get's angry because of something.\r\n\r\nThe current system doesn't evolvee , i don't think you as developers are happy of this current state of the punishment system ,where troll/grief almost most of the cases doesn't get detected or analys ... , so this means neither the community is going to be happy about this... ,and you still not taking any action to do something about that as developers , you wait the whole community to be angry because of you Riot team.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-11-29T23:03:41.273+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> RayleighTT\n\n**sigh**","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-30T03:26:46.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YNnIiT5z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-29T23:03:41.273+0000)\n>\n> **sigh**\n\n/thread","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RayleighTT","date":"2019-11-29T23:04:27.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"I seen hundreds of guys who pass your punishment system , and there is absolutly not mistakes... , you just don't apply rules , i seen someone who run towers into enemy intentionally , got 4 15 score , we manage to win somehow,  and you forget that he troll/grief intentionally and flame me ... , time of 1 ,almost 2 weeks he just been forgot... , is a very positive message for me ... , i must handle myself to don't be angry on them , and to don't be angry on you , and to don't break rules , because i can loss my accounts as soon as i use chat wrong ... , but if someone manage to be angry and troll/grief , doesn't happen nothing to him , so who ever grief/troll ,what should he be afraid of??? , if there is nothing that they have to manage... , if you do everything to even cover him as a normal player ,when players report such players.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-11-29T23:11:18.805+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replying to yourself is a bad look.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinful Succubus","date":"2019-11-29T23:25:44.628+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"the echo chamber needs more than one voice to work. he's doing his best in that regard","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sinful Succubus","date":"2019-11-29T23:26:18.025+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"can i suggest posting here from now on?\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/rant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-11-30T03:13:29.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still pretty sure you have a poor definition of what a troll is.","replies":[]}]}
