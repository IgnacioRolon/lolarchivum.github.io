case of mine , i had 14 days ban like 1 year 3 months ago ... , then i stayed 3 months out of any toxic behaviour ,seeing daily ,and fighting daily with toxic behaviour around , in the sense i had to ignore , everyone who were toxic against me , everyone who was troll/grief , to refrain from giving advices to people who play bad , to refrain on stressing myself cause i loss ranked games for no reasons .\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that after the 14 days ban i lossed likely 3 months to do my best to be a better behaving player ,i did a huge progress in the sense i refrain from using past behaviour , but the thingh i got banned for \"threats\" cause is my fault that Riot places autofill toxic players in support role , who flame me , who grief, then who troll , cause obvious to grief wasn't enought , so do i feel that fair no , across the fact i not even did anything to that guy.... , i \"threat\" him with the fact ,that i talked about a past case , that singed support grief/troll in diamond , and then i only sayd that i will submit the replay to support ... , so how does that makes me so much toxic to be permanent banned is beyond any words.... , after i had honor lv 1 , Riot not even bother to listen to me , or to offer me the chat logs they considered toxic , so i lost 3 months of playing for nothing , and on top of that i was shit treat when i acces support assistance , so what's the point then to reform into this game , if everything you do , dosn't mather , if you do progress and do your best to reform and Riot laughts of you , giving you every 3 months a punishment upper , even if you stayed more much positive than doing negative thinghs.\r\n\r\nThere is not just 3 months i stayed chill  , every time after a punishment i stayed long amounts of time positive , and did my best to reform , but do you think RIOT actually cared about that , or that they cared of my time i been positive , noooo , let's forget this guy had long amounts of time being positive and doing his best to refrain from being negative in any ways , let's punish him with stronger punishments , and forget about his qualitys , about the fact he is a good player , plays of long time this game , and that he does not pushing himself to be toxic ... .\r\n\r\nI don't know if you really understand what's the point of this topic , is not to complain on my case , is to show you ,how much Riot cares about being fair to the players they ban ... , they just don't care about you , they don't care at all about your good qualityes , they just punish you for few games you can be toxic , out of hundreds of games played positive ,neutral , that's the point , is not about encourage toxic behaviour , is about that, throught them severity , they literally ignore your qualityes and refuse to care about your positivity  ,and the days you haven't been breaking rules ,because they can't share a fair judgment , because they not want people to feel like flame dosn't mean anything , but in the same time , people get banned even if they literally not deserve ,because of them actions and how much they stayed positive and did something good into this game.\r\n\r\nSo i do care about being treat exactly for our behaviour , i want our good parts ,and good behaviour to mather... , not only our negative actions , because we have the right on that , you shouldn't allow Riot to label people as toxic , and raise punishments , even if they have been on long times positive/neutral , beside the fact there are games with much toxicity random across a day , that's the point , if you have to deal all the time with people who break rules and you chose to don't break rules ,that says something about you , 2-3 months mean something , it can't be ignored ,because Riot cares to keep them severity... , is our accounts into this mather of problems , accounts who can get banned for unfair reasons... , unfair from the view that ,your positivity actions , your neutral behaviour across multiple games played you meet toxic behaviour ,affecting you in the sense , maked you more angry  , broke your fun and calm , been insults across your person , been people who affected your game intentionally ,does not mather for Riot as much... , because i do play this game , i get insult and i don't win anything back ,cause someone else is toxic into my games , i not even win Riot respect , because they just push ban button and yeah i have to suffer again , on top of the fact i have to suffer from others toxic behaviour , and to refrain on breaking rules , Riot feelings for me are still 0.... , they really don't care on the fact that hundreds of people broke rules against you, before you be banned , but they care for few negative words you can say ,not exactly that negative , regarding hundreds of cases of toxicity you seen , and when you see your reform card ,and see yourself punished for not even swearing , neither for being extremly negative or having a normal negative behaviour , this is just not helping you ... , it just makes you ask yourself , how you are considered toxic ,across the fact that hundreds of players been more negative and aggresive towards you , and you haven't answer to them back..","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-10-10T12:17:49.854+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> how much Riot cares about being fair to the

.There are people who troll/grief not just 2-3 games and never got banned , so what about them , they haven't broke the rules only 2-3 times ,they broke it hundreds of times... , and they still able to play this game and have them accounts , how that makes me confortable to know that i can get for slight negativity ,from Riot opinnion to be permanent banned and when i see troll/griefers ruining games to just watch how they don't even get banned , is that makes me feel better , like i am definetly a huge problem ,because i can refrain from being toxic long amounts of times , and get permanent banned for \"slightest negative behaviour\" ,and then if i see troll/grief happening and not even getting banned ,is more than accept and normal ... , not even suffer punishments , and hey that's okey , but the fact someone is \"slightly negative\" into chat , is not anymore okey , yeah ... , there is no doubt that someone who is negative into chat is faster banned than most of the trollers/griefers who break rules without consequences on long terms of time.

I have all the reasons to believe this is an abuse from Riot because they literally ignore the previous punishment and already push a stronger punishment , that over the facts you have to suffer daily toxic behaviour inside your games , which affects your capacity to be totally calm and chill playing to have fun and win games... , so basically is no one guilty that this game have players who raise toxicity towards you , and  as long as most of us will not start toxic behaviour , if we do our best to ignore others toxic behaviour against us , and we have moments of weakness after long amounts of time , that dosn't mean is right to be harder punished , cause you do say some negative stuffs , even if you ain't aggresive towards someone real person , or even if you don't swear and do much in terms of toxicity , you still get punished  ,and if you take a stronger punishment even for that ,that does mean Riot literally lossed them purpose , and they no longer understand what means to punish and to analys a player.\n\nThis will never be alright , never will be something normal , never will be something that motivates people to be better , i honestly take this as an abuse , because as i sayd your qualityes as good player are ignored , you can be most good person over an extend period of time ,and have higher honor level , you get lv 1 honor ... , let's be serious ... , that amount of time you been positive makes you to deserve lv 1 honor ??? , is just created like that , because Riot really hates his honorable players , otherwise  ,i will never understand how they can punish a honor lv 3-4-5 with honor lv1 , is non sense action , to punish someone who been extended time honorable ... , punished as someone who was never upper than honor lv 2 . Further more the ranked is full of toxicity , even if the ranked game mode ,gives rewards only to lv 2 honor players ,the lvl requested to play ranked isn't lv 2 + honor , as Riot loves to have toxicity among a competitve game mode , where people tends to be toxic and lower your chances to win ,and stress you more much than if it would be a normal game/aram/tft/any other event game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-10T17:23:48.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're wrong.\n\nRiot does not want you to play League.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nI'm happy to hear that your behavior has improved, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have demonstrated in the past.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExcaliburX","date":"2019-10-10T12:26:33.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Bro, MUTE ALL.
