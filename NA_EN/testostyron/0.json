I sent in a ticket to riot support and they told me that they are aware of the problem and are trying to work out a fix. However, its been a few months and I still can't access my club (which I own). My friends still see my name on the club roster, however I cannot access that club or use the club tag. I was just wondering if anyone knows how to fix this. \r\n\r\nClub name: †The Breakfast Club†   _(the † is an alt code \"alt 0134\")_\r\nClub tag: .m./\r\nMy username: tbkicker","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-07T16:58:00.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back around the time of your ticket, we were still investigating issues resulting from a [club outage](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/nMisJPK8-clubs-outage-oct-2016).
