Usually, this means new content releases grow successively more powerful while older content becomes regressively outdated or relatively underpowered.\n\nThis term is used outside games as well.[2][3]\n\nThere's a reason riot refers to the current mobility spam as \"mobiltiy creep\",because it's a specific case of power creep where power is creeping through mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Caezium","date":"2015-02-11T08:59:08.511+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually.

This is called power creep.  The power of champions is slowly creeping up higher and higher and higher which pushes out other champions from viability.  For example, if power creep in this game was very low you would see a ton of Anivia, Malz, Urgot, etc. in pro play but power creep has completely pushed them out of the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Learnding","date":"2015-02-12T20:05:58.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarthSpectrum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=94MzObJr,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-11T04:23:22.810+0000)\n>\n> The problem isn't so much with the concept of nerfing champions to balance them, but rather that Riot doesn't execute it properly.\n> Champions ends up in an OP - UP - Underplayed - OP cycle.

It's because they nerf champions based on the professional scene.  Where Professionals know how to abuse the targeted champions strengths it gives that champion a blanket called \"OP\".  The system for balancing in this game is completely flawed because it's just a cycle of nerfs and buffs to who ever fits in the meta slot the easiest and the best possible way.  You'd see Urgot in the professional play because of his range and what the meta calls for.  It doesn't mean said champion is OP, but just abusable by professionals who seek that attribute when playing a champion; AKA \"Tristana\".  Tristan is a clear example of this, and how this system is completely convoluted in every way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-11T05:29:37.278+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Poor video as it overtly over generalize his theory by the extreme. He assumes that we want everybody to be OP like Azir, which is literally not the case. We want champions to get buffed IN COMPENSATION for their lack of utility and mobility. By nerfing everyone, you are letting champions that have superior utilities prevail in every way shape and form. By buffing them, you are letting champions be on equal footing but having a certain characteristic or abilities that stands from the rest. Having that said ability desirable. \n\nThere is a reason why that around 30% of the champion pool gets selected **consistently** in the pro scene. \n\nThe result of nerfing becomes this: Why would I pick X  champion (Shen, Ashe, Xin, Taric, Lux) when Y champion (Sion, Jinx, J4, Leona, Xereth) does his job but better?","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-02-11T22:11:08.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say they buff another champion like you say. Now that could push out 10 other champions. Causing more to need to get buffed. This is where the power creep comes from. \n\nShen is still balanced around S3. When he could push one lane, let an inhib lane push another and the other 4 of his team pushes another. Since split pushing was nerfed mechanically in S4 his niche got much smaller. \n\nAshe is a team ADC. She's strong with communication. Since the supports that augmented her(and Varus) were nerfed/pushed out she sees less play. But what she does is still strong. She just can't handle Braum/Thresh/Leona/Annie being able to dive her so well. Riot's goal this season is to make more ways to win viable. Ashe/Varus + Zyra/Nami could see a return if they make it happen. \n\nXin needs a mini-rework. His kit front loads too much too fast. It gives very little counterplay unless you have mobility. In which you can completely counter him. Since everything he does is overall AA based with one gap closer. He's just outdated ATM.\n\nTaric is stronger than he seems. He works better with communication as he needs teams to follow up on his stun ASAP. I think he should get a rework as well. Something that pushes him out of support and into other lanes. Just because a champion can heal others doesn't mean they should be forced into support. It would make a very interesting jungler setup. Being able to walk into lane and possibly gank. If not heal your allies before returning. \n\nLux isn't really weak. As long as we don't bring up mana-less champions anyway. She needs tweaks to help her mana costs. But overall that's mostly it. \n\n30% of the champion pool sees play in pro games because they tend to play only a few kind of metas. Which those 30 champions excel in. It's not about one champion being stronger. It's about one champion being stronger at a type of gameplay. Lux vs Xerath, Lux bring more reliable CC and a shield. If you wanted that from your mid lane for some reason you would pick Lux. She's also better at picking off enemies with a QER combo. If we could make Lux as good as Xerath at what Xerath does, why take Xearth when Lux can be Xerath with better CC and a team-wide shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobila2000","date":"2015-02-12T07:39:14.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cindikle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=94MzObJr,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-02-11T22:11:08.058+0000)\n> Lux isn't really weak.

But overall that's mostly it. \n> \n\nBalancing mana champions around manaless champions should just not be done, otherwise they start outperforming their fellow mana champions. There are only a few manaless midlaners (and really only Kata, Yasuo and Zed are played currently) while all the rest are mana users. Buffing mana costs to compete with champions who don't use mana is an indication of manaless champions not paying for being manaless.\n\n> Lux vs Xerath, Lux bring more reliable CC and a shield.

If we could make Lux as good as Xerath at what Xerath does, why take Xearth when Lux can be Xerath with better CC and a team-wide shield.\n\nLux has a root, Xerath has a stun. Both have aoe spells with slows. Xerath, like Lux, has a way of picking off running targets. But what Xerath also has is spammable mini Lux ults while Lux really only has 2 damaging spells on high cd aside from her ult. He simply outclasses her, but not because she's weak, but because he's currently broken. They're both ridiculously safe, except Xerath is a ridiculously safe dps mage, which is preferable.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-02-12T22:10:03.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balancing mana can mean more than just buffs to the cost. It could mean she gets a way to restore mana with abilities. I think a 5% max mana return on procing her passive(once per spell cast) would be perfect. It is much weaker than Xerath's for comparison. And it requires her to spend mana as well as use AA's(thus cannot be passive). It would also allow building mana as a form of mana return instead of mana regeneration an option. If you don't plan on stacking CDR for some reason you can get a tear and do quite well. Or just have other options(Twin Shadows for example). \n\nFar as comparing their kits. Lux has a shield that hits the whole team. Her slow is much more effective and harder to dodge. And doesn't require hitting them in the center to be mostly effective. Her snare can hit two targets(although weaker for the second). And Xerath's Q can be very easy to side step. Not saying Lux's R is hard to step out of, but it is harder to do so. \n\nI wouldn't really call Xerath a dps mage. He's a poke mage. A lot of what he does is easily readable. It has plenty of counterplay. Lux gives up some stuff that Xerath has because she has more utility and her CC is more reliable.","replies":[{"poster":"Kobila2000","date":"2015-02-13T13:46:48.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, no.

Every spell of hers has 1000> range. Passive is hardly necessary for her to use. If you want buffs to her, then nerf her ridiculous safety so she actually has a reason to come closer than 1000 units.\nMana got nerfed all across the board.

There are also nerfs. Say something is a 11 and other heroes are say a 8, icefrog turns the 11 a 10 by either making weakness WAY more apparent or toning strengths down. and the 8 into a 9 or 10. For example, take Faceless Void. He used to be NEVER played and received nothing but buffs and buffs. Then he started seeing play in 6.82 in the offlane. (Traditionally he was only played as one of the hardest carries in the safelane with a support). \n\nHe hadn't been nerfed in forever (unless you count the rescaling cd BUT increased slow per level of his Q in 6.66 as a nerf) and still wasn't played. THEN when he did finally get play he wasn't nerfed in his offlaning ways. He only had his weaknesses made more glaring. He was a bit mana starved when it came to His ult, Q, and using Mask of Madness so how does he get nerfed? First round of nerfs, ult no longer stopped passives (meaning you could counter with evasion), still strong but now he had to buy an item to counter evasion instead of having his ult do it for him. Next nerfs were minor cd increase, (however his agh's ((which most pros got at the time) was untouched), a nerf to some combo potential, a nerf to dueling potential with his Q, and finally, a mana cost increase which hurt. \n\n\nRiot balancing this? I could see something along the lines of nerf strength and weaknesses, and go overboard massivly so he wouldn't see play until everybody was nerfed to his level say, ult reduction at all levels, cooldown increase, AND nerf his core items. Like personally, I do see the advantages in nerf nerf nerf (even though I HEAVILY criticize it), but then it's just kinda depressing that everything gets brought down only for another champ to take its place because they haven;t been nerfed yet.

His bombs are also hitting quite a bit less than before, where Zileans strength was to aoe wreck your opponents team with double bombs and send your lane opponent back constantly by dropping bombs on their head.\n\n60 second Ult is actually longer than the old ult was due to it no longer being affected by rewind. With max CDR Zilean you could easily drop his ult cooldown enough to use twice in a fight, not exactly easy to balance.\n\nIt should be interesting to see the return of Zilean for protect comps, there are not a lot of strong middle mages that can perform a protect the kog strategy properly right now. As well as, more diversity in the support role (anyone else sick of thresh/leona/janna and nothing else?).","replies":[{"poster":"Scuttler Slayer","date":"2015-02-11T23:34:19.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't think of it that way; nor did I realize you could use it twice in one fight. \n\nThanks for clearing that up. \n\nThat said, I still feel like the AoE range of the stun is too big.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Learn 2 Swim","date":"2015-02-11T09:20:49.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are bringing back the protect the ADC comps intentionally","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lShocks","date":"2015-02-12T03:03:26.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malz is my main champ,he does need buff he is useless with his r,but i learned to work with him:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-02-11T22:38:39.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The major problem people have with Riot's balance philosophy is not that OP picks are nerfed, it's that they are overnerfed and forgotten about.\n\nRemember Diana being picked in competitive games?\n\nRiot does not balance well.\n\nEven worse, they are content leaving clearly underwhelming champions in such a state.
