If you're negative and cursing (especially against someone who doesn't deserve it—and no matter how dumb he may be, that 0/4/2 Mundo botlane is not feeding so much as sucking), you work to destroy the potential teamwork later on that actually matters. (Both of my last games, actually, have been completely stupid, like, behind 20 kills, and we came back and won, only to find out post-game that the enemy team was super toxic to each other.)\n\nCursing at teammates isn't a guaranteed loss, but it definitely helps nothing and arguably hurts your chances.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptanKrushnKill","date":"2015-01-21T04:26:23.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope; AFKs, non-connectors, DCs, non english-speakers, grievously underskilled mofos, and ofc feeders.

If you're AFK, DC'd, underskilled, or feeding, you're failing at teamwork. If you can't speak the same language as your teammates, that doesn't help either.
