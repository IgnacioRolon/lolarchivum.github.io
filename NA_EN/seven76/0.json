Cause when I get told that bot lane threw, while I have an Aurelion Sol support who doesn't use any of their abilities. I'm probably already tilted as any bot laner would be. So i'm gonna defend myself by telling my team mates how tilting it is to play with a character that's not a support character, and with an individual that is literally throwing the lane, and feeding my opponents. No one wants to play that game, and there is no escape from indefinite tilt. Which then leads to Riot reprimanding the tilted laner instead of offering them a way to disable chat to eliminate them from talking. Honestly listen to your players or i'll just flame you every update for not adding this feature, A LOT of people will say this is a great idea. I don't care if you eliminate information. Cause in low ELO you either have to carry your games or you don't win anyway. If your carrying a game you know everything because your the only one doing anything. Please I don't want to deal with teammate, opponents or the chat in general. If you don't add an option to remove the chat then I'll try to mod it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2019-08-19T21:34:03.919+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea! there is a setting you can disable. You can choose to disable all chat, team chat, or both. You can also use /fullmute all but this resets every match so you'd have to do it every time. However, the one advantage of /fullmute is that it mutes pings too :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2019-08-20T19:11:49.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Related question that I’m hopeful you can help with since I just get ignored everywhere else.\n\nCan you please pass on an ask to have an option to disable all emotes, not just enemy emotes?

I'm pretty far from the core dev teams on League  and the decision making process that happens over there :X","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2019-08-20T20:51:41.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries at all - just appreciate someone responding to the request! Not sure if there is any internal Riot boards for these type of things or what, but it would be a meaningful improvement to truly every single one of my games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Seven76","date":"2019-08-19T21:36:47.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just not good enough though, I don't want to see the chat, I did this in TF2 when I played competetively, I just used a script to shut it down completely, I don't even want to be able to type to anyone.

I think Neace has a youtube video showing how to make chat so small its obsolete. Either that or he just straight up removed it, idr.\n\nEither way, self control is a great thing to work on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2019-08-20T02:57:18.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to interface: Turn show ally chat off (Yellow box is now clear.) then turn off matchmade something aka /all chat (box has yellow thing in it if i recall this time.)\n\nThat gets rid of chat all together (You also can't type so no toxicity form you :) )\n\nI wouldn't recommend turning off pings till after lane stage though... That has to be done manually most likely. Though most people are telling you BACK OFF. Due to vision showing things coming to slay you. And pings after are because you made a terrible choice.","replies":[]}]}
