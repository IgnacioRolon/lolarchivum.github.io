Nami completely counter Braum and I abused it by making them pay for each CS they were trying to secure. My Lucian was really good and was following up on my trades. What happened? The Jungler came when the enemy bot lane was half health and we were full with a ward covering the river. The result? Triple kill + double buff for Lucian because their bot lane didn't set up the gank properly (Being half health and Braum jumping to a minion, leaving Kalista too far to engage, and placing himself in a 1v2 until Kalista could catch up), didn't create any opportunity (By baiting us, clearing our ward or engaging as the jungler walk thru our ward instead of engaging too soon) and the jungler came even though he didn't have an opportunity to capitalize on (We were well covered, in a position of vast superiority against his bot lane and it was a very dangerous match up to commit against). To make matter worse he tried to salvage after his bot lane got murdered instead of disengaging, making a snowball lane into a snowball game. 20 minutes later we killed their Nexus at a score of 28 to 7 with a 10-1-5 Lucian and 1-0-17 Nami. Lucian and I didn't waste our snowball. At 13 minutes, we killed the T1 bot tower and brought our snowball to every other lanes and at that point, the window of opportunities was gone for the enemy team. They could only hope for a throw that never came.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2016-04-11T23:36:51.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's nor the laner, nor the jungler decision which lane should be ganked.
