The top two teams from each group then get drawn to the Play-in Knockout stage. The third place teams are eliminated from the competition.\n* Stage 2 (Knockout): The remaining 8 teams from Stage 1 are randomly drawn against each other (each bracket consist of one(1) 1st Seed Team and one(1) 2nd Seed Team), into Bo5 matches. The 4 winners of these matches each then are drawn into one of 4 Groups for the Regular round.","replies":[]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-09-25T06:42:10.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's where the IWC teams and the 3rd seeded teams from the top regions(NA/EU/LPL/LMS) play and have their 15 mins of fame before getting dunked by Korea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wr√°thful","date":"2017-09-25T06:28:53.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kinda giving a chance to the \"wild card\" teams to join the group stage so 4 groups 3 teams playing best of ones with each other in each group the first two in each group do best of fives to qualify for the group stage also sending the 3rd seeded teams from na eu & china  to this play in. overall pretty good idea from riot to give chance to the smaller regions to show off. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1ryBmeqLIQ watch this video to get a better idea of what i've written.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-09-26T12:59:49.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I think it is more of an attempt to draw interest from people who watch the bigger regions then to give the wild card teams a chance.\n\nNow instead of having a tournament where they can prove they are the best team from a smaller region they have to RNG roll and hope they don't get put up against one of the better teams.\n\nJust for example Lyon definitely looked pretty solid vs WE in their first game which is saying something because people are expecting WE to be one of the top teams in the tournament but now in order to get into the actual tournament they have to beat C9?\n\nIt is do-able but just rolling into the same group as WE probably meant they were getting 2nd already so they basically only have 1 shot vs C9 to prove that they belong even though they could very well be the best wildcard team in the tournament.
