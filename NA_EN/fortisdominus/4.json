A huge part of winning lane is getting not pushed in too heavily. If the enemy laner pushes for years your turrets will be low and it's easy to dive you cause he will have closed to full mana while you used a lot on last hitting under the turret. This is setting ups ganks and when you die, getting pushed in permanently and aren't even trading you will lose the lane and the turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-03-30T03:28:39.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a team game and saying that is sort of true, but also sort of arrogant.

I'm a support main, typically have 10 - 20 more wards then the enemy team, even if they're completely destroying us...it's just too essential to NOT do. Two things in my eyes are key components towards having the best possible chance of winning, 1.) Vision control for map  awareness and understanding the enemy team's movements and priorities, and 2.) Team communication. Yes it sucks if you're being neglected in ANY lane, it's possible, even for bot to be continuously dove by 3, 4, 5 people, only to lose turret and dragon control, then when they rotate to top and mid the infamous \"wow bot what are you doing, your laners are pushing mid and top, you know..the only two objectives left!' remarks. \n\nFact of the matter is, Riot failed miserably with the warding and vision control changes. If you're behind, even if ONE teammate refuses to help with vision, it puts you at an almost insurmountable disadvantage. They failed, but that doesn't excuse you of not trying.

You can't stand near the exp by the tower, if they just let minions push it down they deny you for a really long time.\n\nHell, sometimes you don't even feed a kill and are equal in CS and they just dive you anyway. Especially with something like malphite and kindred who are both ridiculously good at diving top lane. Once you miss a minion wave or two while dead (or even if you just go b and live through the gank) you're pretty much screwed for the rest of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Masterkerfuffle","date":"2016-03-29T15:59:26.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but the OP is playing Hecarim wrong if they ever die from a gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twiggles","date":"2016-03-29T15:55:10.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted because Scrubs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-03-29T06:42:56.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite has enough armor to tank the turret and Kindred can just ult while she walks out of turret range.
