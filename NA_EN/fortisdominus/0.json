League of legends is reacting slowly to my commands. For examples, I play on unlocked screen so when I move my cursor to the corner of my screen there is this small delay before my screen will actually move in the direction I played my cursor on. When I use an ability there is also a small delay\n\nWhen I say small delay, its like a 0.2 second delay. It might not be much, however, it is very noticable. I only started having there problems after the new windows 10 update and I was wondering if anyone has heard of this problem before and if there is a fix. \n\nI also already play on the lowest settings to reduce lag.\n\nWhether I use abilities or AA I have this annoying delay. Even when I try to scroll through the options menu in game there is a delay","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T21:09:33.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a windows 10 update recently that's been causing issues for some players when it auto enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).
