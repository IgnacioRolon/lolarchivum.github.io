In the end it doesnt matter as im over trying to discuss it with you.\n\nIf you are facing them after they have played together for months/years it means they are at your ELO, heck it would even mean they are worse individual players than you since they are given an higher MMR by the matchmaking system AND their win rate is (should be?) boosted by their synergy\n\nIt means your team should be able to CRUSH them in lane if you got a somewhat decent teamwork since your team has the superior individual players\n\nOr is this wrong?\n\n> Thats the theory...but it isnt always true, at least from what i can gather from just asking the enemy and my team if they are grouped more than half my games are one sided as far as premades go one way or the other and its obnoxious being on either side of it.\n\nBut still you have not said how often this is happening, the playing with 3+ premade people if you are not in a premade yourself\nI don't even question these games could end up being one sided, but that isn't even the question. \nThe question is if the system allow people to play on equal ground. If people play on equal ground, that the result does not even matter. if people can't play on equal ground, the system MUST be changed\nThe problem is that you talk about game results rather than the equity of the system, which, again is the core question","replies":[{"poster":"StealthWarden","date":"2016-04-13T16:16:54.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the actual problem is the original post....high ranked players on smurf accounts getting with their other high ranked buddies on their smurfs smashing people trying to learn the game.\n\nThe system allows and encourages this.\n\nSo what do you think..should it be changed or do you have a smurf account and are making some sweet bank so you have to argue?","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-04-13T22:57:57.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StealthWarden,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s6AM9Nbk,comment-id=001e00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-13T16:16:54.693+0000)\n>\n> the actual problem is the original post....high ranked players on smurf accounts getting with their other high ranked buddies on their smurfs smashing people trying to learn the game.\n> \n> The system allows and encourages this.\n> \n> So what do you think..should it be changed or do you have a smurf account and are making some sweet bank so you have to argue?\n\nAs long as you can queue with at least 1 person, and in the old system there was the option to go duo queue, smurfing will be possible \n\nIn the original post the guy assumed that it was because of DQ, and nope, even on old queue you could do the same by going duo queue - and in the original post the guy made also accusation that is not really proving as someone else was posting the streamer account match history and pointed out like the guy was playing max 2-3 game with the same people, which can be barely considered boosting since the max you can get from 3 game is win a promotion series to go 1 division up? -\n\nAnd I actually doubt that if multiple high ranked player play together they are not going to rank up so fast that the problem becomes negligible in the way you are painting it...\n\nThe real problem are the guys paying other guy to play with them to really get boosted (and it takes more than 3 games, really), which are fairly difficult to catch because it requires a lot of time to do the proper investigation to ban them and it seems clear that Riot doesn't have or isn't putting enough resources in to catch most of them","replies":[{"poster":"StealthWarden","date":"2016-04-14T15:15:43.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure\n\n\n\nbut if i have one one person say in all chat \" dont feel bad im plat/diamond smurf\" from the enemy team dynamic Queuing with 2-3 of their lower elo buddies im done with this game.\n\nDynamic Q is a clown fiesta","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-04-16T13:41:32.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StealthWarden,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s6AM9Nbk,comment-id=001e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-14T15:15:43.167+0000)\n>\n> sure\n> \n> \n> \n> but if i have one one person say in all chat &quot; dont feel bad im plat/diamond smurf&quot; from the enemy team dynamic Queuing with 2-3 of their lower elo buddies im done with this game.\n> \n> Dynamic Q is a clown fiesta\n\nsure\n\nAnd how this is exactly different from old duo Q system?\n\nFollowing your reasoning, basically everything that isn't pure Solo Q is a clown fiesta...except that\n\n- I didn't saw the complains on the old system using these argumentations\n\n- LoL is still supposed to be a team game, so play alone shouldn't be defined as the only true option that is not \"a clown fiesta\"","replies":[{"poster":"StealthWarden","date":"2016-04-18T11:53:31.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My answer to pretty much everything you just said is this.\n\n\nTHERE IS NOW MORE THAN ONE SMURF ON THEIR TEAM\n\n\nanything else i can help you with?","replies":[{"poster":"StealthWarden","date":"2016-04-19T12:12:05.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i think were done here...i cant take one more argument from you based on the word \n\n\"SHOULD\"\n\nWhat is supposed to happen, and what happens are very different.\n\nAnd even if the account has worse statistics...that under no circumstances means the original owner is behind the wheel....or that those statistics are accurate.
