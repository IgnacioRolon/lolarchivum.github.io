Like a Cait+Soraka/Janna vs a Vayne+Leona for example. But in that case, do yourself a favor and make sure the enemy doesn't have TP wards in your bushes.\nAnd \"overly aggressive\" = you chase for kills beyond the minions line. Meaning that the enemy minions are now behind you and the mid/top laner can TP there.\n\nSo, its possible to avoid double tp bot even if the enemy team is running that. I usually run TP on both both and mid. But if I see you are about to get killed for over extending by a tp.

The ADC and the Top Laner will always leave their lane no matter what state it is in to join fights in mid or irrational fights in the jungle.\n\nWhen this happens I want to start crying because in most cases, the minions are pushing against us and if the wave is left unintended, your turrets are going down. Your only hope to stay in the game longer is to zzrot portal one of the lanes then go to the other lane and protect the turret with no wave clear abilities while your team accuses you of \"farming\". It is like people have no understanding how much map control they are losing when just one turret goes down.\n\n\nSolution for the non-supports:\nIf you are an ADC or a Top Laner and there are minion waves about to take down your turret, I don't care what the team says. Don't go with your team and fight a completely random fight that accomplishes nothing. Do something meaningful and protect your turrets. The farm you get from protecting your turrets will be a safe and added bonus.\n\n\nADC's:\nYour job is to stay bot if the enemy wave is pushing too close to the turret. The support's job is to roam where ever help is needed once the support has properly warded for you so you know if you are in danger or not. If the enemy team groups up 5 mid 12 minutes in, then you don't need 5 people to protect mid. On top of that, the support will usually have more tools to defend vs an EARLY siege than an ADC will. Stay bot until the wave is pushing in your favor if you want to join mid OR just keep pushing until you take the free turrets.\n\n\nTop Laners:\n Same as ADC's except you should have some support from the jungler and you should partially be your own support. Buy pinks and use your trinkets as you start pushing the waves further into the enemy's side of the map. If you want to play TDM style then rush a zz'rot, set it down next to your turret, and join the team right after.\n\n\nSummary:\nIf the side lanes do their job, you will have forced the support into being more likely to do their own job more efficiently. For the newbies who complain about supports \"farming\"................ DON'T LET THEM. You go back to your lane, defend the turret, and take your farm back. This will force the support to leave you alone. If all the enemy knows how to do is go 5 mid, they will be clueless on how to respond to their side lanes being taken. Eventually they will send 5 top or 5 bot. That is the rest of the team's time to push mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsCalledALance","date":"2016-02-28T22:30:30.163+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"nobody wants to sit by and be some assholes bitch the entire game.
