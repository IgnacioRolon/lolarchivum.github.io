If someone from bronze has an opinion that differs from a diamond 1's, the bronzie should NOT try to reason with the high elo. He shouldn't ask why either. He should take what the diamond says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I've seen a bronzie backtalk a diamond 1, and it's disgusting, because the bronzie is wrong most of the time. The only time a bronzie is right is when 500,000 bronzies are talking back to a single diamond 1. There's a reason why you're stuck in bronze. It's because you think differently than the diamonds. Start thinking like a diamond.\"\n\nRackier the god, never forget","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-30T01:08:51.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because people that got boosted, lucky, or (so rarely) are actually any good tend to be massive elitists, but they do have a point.\n\nMost bronze players need to just shut the hell up and listen to better players (actually better players, not some ragebaby a couple ranks higher).","replies":[{"poster":"Focusss","date":"2016-09-30T01:12:25.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=E2ZJYRJI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-30T01:08:51.004+0000)\n>\n> Because people that got boosted, lucky, or (so rarely) are actually any good tend to be massive elitists, but they do have a point.\n> \n> Most bronze players need to just shut the hell up and listen to better players (actually better players, not some ragebaby a couple ranks higher).\n\nThis was just a famous quote on the old boards by rackier and I just remembered it so I looked up the quote and copy pastaed it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-30T01:14:40.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and no ones opinion is invalid...","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-30T00:58:32.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"why are you saying anything at all being lvl 14 then? \n\nshhhh only when spoken to newb","replies":[{"poster":"FortisDominus","date":"2016-09-30T01:05:51.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=E2ZJYRJI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-30T00:58:32.351+0000)\n>\n> why are you saying anything at all being lvl 14 then? \n> \n> shhhh only when spoken to newb\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=focusss\n\nYou didnt even play this game long enough to understand how old this quote is lol\n\nshhh only when spoken to silver player","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-30T01:07:36.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FortisDominus,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=E2ZJYRJI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-30T01:05:51.253+0000)\n>\n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=focusss\n> \n> You didnt even play this game long enough to understand how old this quote is lol\n\nooh you posted a link to a plat account but how do i know its yours... \n\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=s+diana+2","replies":[{"poster":"Focusss","date":"2016-09-30T01:09:29.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=E2ZJYRJI,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-30T01:07:36.404+0000)\n>\n> ooh you posted a link to a plat account but how do i know its yours... \n> \n> \n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=s+diana+2\n\n...","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-30T01:10:00.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Focusss,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=E2ZJYRJI,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-30T01:09:29.301+0000)\n>\n> ...\n\nspeechless?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
