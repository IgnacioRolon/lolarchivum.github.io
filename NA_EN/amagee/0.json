It&#039;s also not every game (4/7 games since we first had the problem)\r\nOnce happening to me, three times to the people I was playing with.\r\nThe time it happened to me, it started around the 25 minute mark.\r\nWas wave clearing mid, one bouncing bomb was visible.\r\nThe next wasn&#039;t and after that everything became invisible.\r\nStarted March 21st.\r\nHaven&#039;t had the issue before then (and I&#039;ve played a lot of Snow Day Ziggs this patch/season)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-23T17:18:15.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Amagee - \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nWe've seen this issue before, but we're not able to pinpoint the exact cause here.

At least between me and my friends, I know there's an Intel integrated graphics on Windows 10 and myself on a desktop with Windows 7 and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 Ti.
