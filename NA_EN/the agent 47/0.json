I recommend completing a reset of this file using the steps below:\n\nFirst, **log into the game** then hop into your install directory:\n\n>  **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the **Config** folder, then hop back into the League client to start a custom match. Reconfigure your key bindings and test to see if they work. Let me know if this helped! ^.^","replies":[]}]}
