You straight up can't reliably build against him when he's doing all 3 types of damage all at once. \n\nFervor felt overall more healthy to play against imo. You couldn't use minions to stack Fervor. It promoted a drawn out fight, it rewarded you for interacting with the laner, not auto a minion and have Fervor fully stacked before you even touch the enemy champ lmao.\n\nWith Conqueror in the game, tanks are practically nonexistent until high elo. But even then most of them are terrible outside of support.","replies":[]}]}
