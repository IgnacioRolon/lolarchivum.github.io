Seriously, if I have to watch one more game of Kog Lulu vs. Tristana Janna, both dolled up with relic shield, barrier, and ardent, Im going to want to hang myself.\n\nIt&#039;s almost like when you introduce an incredible amount of heal/shield items, lessen the gold price of crit items, add in things like knights vow, and give supports a higher income, that things like this are bound to happen.\n\nNow I&#039;m never going to stop playing this game because I&#039;m a hopeless degenerate but come on man this is just ridiculous at this point.\n\nNerf ADC\nNo to Ardent ","replies":[{"poster":"MeSaSC2","date":"2017-10-22T16:41:51.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the balance team completely screwed this world championship. There is practically no diversity in games. Worlds is the biggest LOL event of the year and I don't understand how recklessly they planned for it. Just look at the pick/ban stats:\nhttp://www.gamesoflegends.com/champion/picksandbans.php?tournament=World%20Championship%202017\n\nin jungle: J4 100% pick/ban, Sejuani 99% and grag 68%. Next jungler is ezrael with 31% pick/ban.\nin ADC: kalista 100% BAN. It feels all the games are xayah/trist and sometimes a kog or twitch.\nSupport is perhaps the worst. Janna and lulu 94% pick/ban with 68% WINRATE for janna. rakan is 65% pick/ban and the next is taric with only 20% pick/ban. \nardent completely ruined support picks. Even trundle supp builds ardent. wtf!\n\nTop and mid are a bit better but personally I think they are also far from a diverse pool of champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-10-22T16:13:29.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And tanks who are near immortal from non-ADC damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2017-10-23T00:25:23.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance team too busy cashing in their paychecks","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-10-22T18:14:58.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously I love it when aggressive supports are played. I know for some reason the community hates their guts (especially blitz's) but it's so much more interactive than janna and lulu being more aggressive than the aggressive supports themselves after an ardent scenser.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2017-10-22T22:24:09.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who hates aggressive supps, blitz, thresh, leona, Ali. Are you kidding me all of them take more skills then point click shields, ppl need to understand that just because it don't do dmg doesnt mean it isnt op. Shields and heals should not get increased strength with runes and items it isnt fair their is grievous for heals but nothing for shields which is why janna was so op for a while. Point click heals and shields literally dont have real counterplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2017-10-22T17:21:18.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah...The tank meta from I think season 5 had the best worlds diversity ever....just shows that a slower, more tactical game actually allows ALL strategies to function.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-22T14:48:49.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ardent and Janna have both been needed already since the patch world's is on, and ardent is getting another harsher nerd soon.\n\nI will admit that team fights are more fun to watch when you are sure someone one each side is going to die, but I honestly believe that locket is the biggest offender here.","replies":[]}]}
