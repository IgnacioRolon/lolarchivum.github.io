The cleanse on it is garbage to anyone that can apply a constant slow (hello anyone with Rylai's in their item set). He also has low base movement and gets dumpstered on by anyone with even a small semblance of mobility, since the Q movespeed bonus doesn't actually last that long. Out of all the Juggernauts, Garen doesn't even arguably have the worst kit, he straight up does. There's too much power shunted into a pseudo-rng mechanic for him to actually have a decent chance of going toe to toe with more mechanically challenging juggernauts like Illaoi.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-07-13T01:52:44.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, you could, not?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2017-07-12T15:19:24.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell else is new?
