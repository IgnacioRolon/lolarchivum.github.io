When Jhin is killed inside of the game is falls to his knees and reaches for his mask that is rising up and up until is pops out of existence and Jhin slumps over. I believe that the mask is the only thing keeping Jhin alive, he freaks out when the mask starts to float up and then he slumps over and dies when it pops out, either his mask is magical or maybe he has some sort of infused scientry inside the maks that keeps him alive. I personally think that jhin may of peen a stage hand and then found the mask and went insane, it made him become a serial killer and since he was into the arts the mask to that to the extreme and he became Jhin. The mask might&#039;ve deformed him or maybe it forced him to hide his body and to never take the mask off. That is my theory and I hope you guys can give good feedback if not that&#039;s fine too.\r\n\r\nCya on the rift{{champion:202}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-08-25T07:00:40.049+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"((**Game isn't canon.**))\n\nMy mask is a lot of things. Sometimes, it is that enchanted piece, held on by magic and will. Sometimes, it is my own face. I do not feel and express emotions like most do, so I contort my face into, say, a mask of concern. Happiness. Sadness. It is part of being a brilliant actor, after all. Sometimes, if I find my mask is not genuine enough, I will find a more suitable one. For example, that smile you wear so often looks much more genuine than my own.\n\nYou see, my dear, it would be impossible for the mask to have such an effect on me. It is part of my outfit given to me by the Cabal for my performances. It by no means drove me to madness. I have been creating works of art long before I was captured and released. You also appear to be under the impression that I am deformed in some way. This is not so. I am an ordinary man, my self loathing coming from the fact that my appearance, despite my best efforts, is not perfect. I can melt away into a crowd with ease. A deformity would make that much harder, wouldn't you agree?\n\nSimply put, my mask is but a mask. It may not keep me alive, but I can not live without it. It is a part of my identity as an artist.\n\n((Downvotes inc because I posted in character.))","replies":[{"poster":"MintyMario","date":"2018-08-25T17:56:01.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for commenting and good job on the jhin roleplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aaaustindestroy1","date":"2018-08-26T00:25:35.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"INB4 JHIN IS A SECRET DARKIN!!!!!11!1\n\n\n\n\n\nJhin's my favorite character in the game and I legitimately hope that Riot does something cool with him.\n\nAlso, one of his quotes:\n\"Which is the lie?

He is the scariest thing to walk the earth. He is no Darkin. He is no Demon. He is no monster. He is but an artist, an insane man with a gun. The mask was most likely created by the Armories that supplied the rest of Jhin's gear. Hell it was probably custom made for him.\nAlso, you're forgetting the fact that we already have an Ionian Darkin in the form of Varus, so I'm not sure why they would have another.\nTo be honest, the only cool thing Riot will do with Jhin is the finale between him, Zed, and Shen, and even then they probably won't do that.","replies":[{"poster":"aaaustindestroy1","date":"2018-08-26T04:29:14.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is the best champion in the game and if Riot doesn't do an event between him, Zed, and Shen, I'm gonna throw 4 dollars at them.\n\nWait..
