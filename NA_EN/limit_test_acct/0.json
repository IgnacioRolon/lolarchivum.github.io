Nah, but I do\r\n\r\nI legit just want my chat turned off when I'm on banned, you legit can't say anything to this community or else you get banned. Yeah I understand that I already got restricted twice which lead to me getting 2 week banned, but those were the same thing as the stuff above, it's actually frustrating when you're trying to win games, get frustrated because of ACTUAL TROLLS, and you're the one who gets banned for being passive aggressive.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-06-09T18:45:18.030+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">I got two week banned for this\n\n No, you received a two-week suspension for repeatedly disregarding your previous punishments.\n\n You were told on your 25-game chat restriction reform card that continued negativity would lead to more severe consequences, this is one of them. Your next punishment will be a permanent ban if you don't change your behavior.\n\n>it's actually frustrating when you're trying to win games, get frustrated because of ACTUAL TROLLS, and you're the one who gets banned for being passive aggressive.\n\n There's a colossal difference between someone trolling and someone not playing up to your expectations. Not everyone you come across is a troll, griefer, or feeder. \n\nEveryone has bad games and saying things like this _never_ helps the situation:\n\n>G1:\ndark cIoud: im down to open\ndark cIoud: you have actual\ndark cIoud: fucking issues\ndark cIoud: i legit dont want to win\n\n>G2:\ndark cIoud: what a fun game\ndark cIoud: jungle difference\ndark cIoud: its open top\ndark cIoud: Just end\ndark cIoud: nami, you're the embodiment of a hardstuck 1k game d4\ndark cIoud: same thing\ndark cIoud: SDTOP RUINING GAMES\n\n>G3:\ndark cIoud: are you for real\ndark cIoud: fuck off\ndark cIoud: the game is obviously done\n\n When you're behind or tilted, mute all, don't give up, and focus on how _you_ can improve the situation instead of harping on other people for their performance. You can come back from any situation with careful planning, stop treating every game as if it's over by the 10 minute mark.\n\nYou'll see much better results and have a much more enjoyable experience if you stay optimistic. \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-09T18:51:05.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You repeatedly acknowledge _in your games_ that you know you'll get punished for your behavior.
