Last time I tried to confirm with Riot that I&#039;m the account holder, they couldn&#039;t say if I was or not. I&#039;m thinking that they could find and punish whoever it was that hacked my account by tracing any IP addresses linked to my account that aren&#039;t in my area. I know that Steam can do this as it happened to me once and told me the IP address that tried to login to my account. If you see this Riot, please let me know why you can&#039;t or if you will be able to in the future.\r\n\r\nBtw, I have no clue why I&#039;m allowed to post on boards when my account&#039;s been permabanned.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-19T01:47:47.698+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because: \nA; your account was not hacked, you just gave away the password to some disreputable person/site.

You really should if you didn't.\n\nAlso run regular sweeps with your antivirus or something, in case fishy things are in your computer.\n\nAnd, visit less dodgy sites. And when you do because for whatever research reasons, always do sweeps and other protection methods. Or better yet, just stop visiting them.\n\nAnd never give or mention your password to anybody else, ever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2017-01-19T13:01:19.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MagicFlyingLlama said it better than anyway I could.
