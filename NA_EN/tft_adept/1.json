Based on your role and game mode, other bards seems to have performed just a bit better.  Was your game a rather long one?  I don't really have tips to offer beyond what you already know or in our [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide.

I'm a little confused and frustrated since I placed 48 wards, bought a control ward, and have had far worse games where I got a better score.  What am I missing?  I had the highest kill partipation on my team, highest vision score, and this is far better than games where I have gotten an S- or S prior.","replies":[]}]}]}
