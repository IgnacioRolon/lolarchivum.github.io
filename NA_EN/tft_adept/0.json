Riot has also done a great job in the past explaining why they want to prioritize producing new skins of higher quality then simply updating new ones.\r\n\r\nHowever, would it be possible to do more skin splash art only updates like you did for Karma? They were beautiful and there are a ton of older champions where just a splash art update would look great.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-06-27T05:30:13.497+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is working on Miss Fortune's splashes and Urgot's splashes right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LegendLarry","date":"2017-06-27T18:04:25.231+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ What they said.\n\nThe illustrators feel the same way about those older splashes as you do, @sorceroroverlord. However, we've found that the amount of splash releases that were going out, on top of the new content they were being asked to make, was causing some major burn out. For now you'll see a slow down in the amount of splash updates that are going out but during that time the team is figuring out how we can fit in more updates while not killing the artists.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2017-06-27T18:19:33.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The artists were being overwhelmed?
