Show honor in your games to unlock levels and rewards.\"\n\nHello, this is my first time posting on the boards. Glad to meet you all.\n\nI recently finished a 10 game chat restriction but my honor level remains locked and cannot progress. Which begs the question, when exactly will a honor level unlock after serving a disciplinary action by the report system? This was the first form of behavioral warning I've since first playing but since honor levels are new concept none of my friend had experience with it yet. If anyone was curious on how I got a chat restriction I flamed an enemy team who were all in the same clan. I think some on my own team reported me too for the lolz. \n\nAnyways my guess is that my honor won't unlock until the start of the new season. Otherwise I hypothesize it requires a certain amount of games to be played without incident. Should that be the case then receiving honors after the game would likely speed up the process. If anyone has experience with the new honor system I'd love it if you shared with the rest of us. \n\np.s Please do not bother posting short quips about \"just stop being toxic\" with nothing else to add. I did my time already. I believe true contempt for the enemy is shown through valorous deeds on the rift and not through all chat. I personally turn off all chat for most games but this was a moment of weakness where I wasn't thinking.\n\nThanks for reading,\n**\nUPDATE: Sorry for the delay I meant to do this sooner. My Honor system has been unlocked . Here is a timeline of events: **\n\n1/19/2018 - Chat restricted. Honor System locked.\n1/27/2018 - Chat unrestricted. Honor System locked.\n2/13/2018 - Honor System unlocked. Honor System starts at level one. \n\nFrom 1/19/2018 to 2/13/2018 I played close to 35 games over the course of 25 days. May everyone learn from my lesson. So remember, if you want to flame the enemy team in pre-made 5v5's be prepared to get massed reported and be prepared to lose your Honor loot for almost a month!\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T05:04:39.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a certain amount of time or a certain amount of games that you need to play to unlock your Honor.

You have to consistently be on your best behavior. Any negative behavior will keep the punishment going longer. Since it's all based on how you act in game, nobody can give you an exact time frame for getting unlocked. Some people take weeks, others take months. Keep a good attitude in game, and you should be unlocked soon enough. It shouldn't be too long, assuming you're trying to improve. You can't just wait out the punishment, you have to actively earn it. Playing more often with good behavior will likely result in being unlocked sooner. Good luck.","replies":[]}]}
