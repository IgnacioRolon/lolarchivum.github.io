What I am really mad about is the fact that I am not able to create a PBE account because of this. My level 23 friend has honor lvl 5 yet I am lvl 2. This doesnt make sense and Im hoping if a mod could go over my account and tell me if its a glitch or how long I have to get to lvl 3.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T21:01:39.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far there have been no bugs with getting honor.  I looked into this for you, and see that your honor gain might not necessarily be at a rapid rate as a result of less than honorable behavior.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our PB team can get you more context so you can ramp up your honor gains again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tisla","date":"2017-10-17T08:01:08.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]}]}
