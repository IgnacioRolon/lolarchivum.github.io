Riot said over a month ago that there would be no Urf. Also the people saying &quot;Oh we will only have four days of Urf this year with each weekend of it being two days&quot; are false. Here is what L4T3NCY said when asked &quot;What times exactly is the queue going to be active?&quot;:\nWe&rsquo;re aiming to have the queue available every weekend starting around Friday afternoon and switching off sometime early on Monday morning. This will be in the local time for each region. The goal is to have it up once the weekend starts (that&rsquo;s Friday night right?! :P) so we should get three evenings of fast game mode funtimes. This is just a first implementation, if the queue proves to be exceedingly popular, we can always lengthen the window.\n\nSo this means that Urf could be here from Friday afternoon until the next gamemode is put live. This means 7 days of Urf and it would happen twice, resulting in 14 days total of Urf, which is the same as last year.\n\nEdit: I sick of the Rengar killing Draven gifs too.","replies":[{"poster":"1000angrybees","date":"2016-04-01T17:08:07.840+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":14,"body":"Urf is extremely overhyped.
