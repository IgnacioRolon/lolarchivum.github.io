The FPS is stuck at 30 and won't move. I actually had one game where it was stuck at 48 fps for some reason. I got a new laptop for christmas that I would be able to use at school and game with while traveling. It's a Dell Inspiron 15 7000. It has a gtx 960m, an intel core I7 6700HQ, 16 gb of DDR 3 ram. Simply put, I should be able to run League at over 100 fps easy. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-08T22:19:26.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's likely that your laptop is running Windows 10, this may be caused by the Windows Game Bar that ships with Windows 10. A while ago, there was a Windows 10 anniversary update that enabled a feature called *Game DVR* inside the Windows Game Bar. This feature has caused low fps for some players while causing complete system freezes for others. I strongly recommend you disable this feature using [**this guide**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html), in case this was part of the problem.\n\nPlease let me know if those steps caused any change for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Bolwinkel","date":"2017-01-09T01:55:49.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not just low fps.
