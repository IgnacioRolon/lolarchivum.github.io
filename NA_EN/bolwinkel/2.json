One of the duos were playing {{champion:8}} and {{champion:18}} and the Other were playing {{champion:75}} and {{champion:45}} . All of these champs had some form of infinite scaling on them. {{champion:75}} and {{champion:45}} on their q's, {{champion:8}} had Grasp to stack health, and {{champion:18}} had dark harvest. The fact that they were duo's allowed them to prevent either team from surrendering. Since both duo's had inf scaling and the rest of the players didn't, this allowed them to take control of the game and prevent anyone progressing. By the 1.5 hour mark 5/6 non premades had quit. The {{champion:12}} who made the reddit post stuck out the entirety of the game because he was afraid of being punished for leaving a game. The fact that this game doesn't have some form of protection like this yet is just sad.\n\n**Edit:** \nI just read through all of the comments as of 1/1/18 and I'm going to answer some questions that some people had.\n*The point of this thread was that there is no form of leaver protection yet, not that there isn't anything preventing friends from playing on opposite teams.\n\n*By the time the other 6 people had realized what was going on, it was too late and their stats couldn't compete with infinitely stacking abilities.\n\n*While yes it does feel like a one in a million chance of happening, this has been gaining more attention, hell it has 25k upvotes on the reddit post last time I checked. It might get even more common. So my question for you is, would you still have the same mentality if this happened in one of your ranked games?","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-12-31T10:09:07.520+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":2,"body":"This really feels like once in a million chance of happening.

That's 6 people per game who may need to file a support ticket.  So you send in 300 support tickets.  Do you really think that's an efficient use of the support ticket system?  Have you even used the support ticket system?  Crank that up to 100 games, that's 600 tickets.  This can keep going.\n\nAgain, I'm harking on your point because you're being the most stubborn.  You don't want to accept the fact that sometimes you have to make a change to prevent even just a few people from going through such a thing.  It would take longer to keep the support ticket as the official solution than it would to change the way the forfeit voting system works after a predetermined period of time.  \n\nI don't even have to provide you a direct comparison to another software platform.  You have to realize that 1) the user experience is horrible for those involved, 2) more people WILL do this hostage-taking because human nature, and 3) this will discourage people from playing on these smaller servers, and thus be a net-negative for Riot Games as their smaller regions suffer loss of player numbers due to an issue they refuse to address (if they take your approach).  Less people playing means those that do continue playing have a higher chance of falling into this hostage situation, leading to more tickets, and leading to more bad PR and public outcry that Riot is refusing to address a situation that is horrible for those few that do get involved.  It will lead to more Reddit posts, more bad PR, more forums getting flooded, etc etc etc.  And all this crap could be fixed with one small tweak to how the surrender vote system works after 90 min or so.  Hmm, which honestly seems like a bigger waste of time?  A literal couple of lines of code or all of the above?\n\nSometimes, you have to fix a problem even if it only affects a statistical minority.  It's called PR.  It's called being a reasonable company.  Submitting a support ticket for issues like this takes time away from more pressing matters.  And the problem itself can literally be fixed more quickly than 1 support ticket process from beginning to end.  Seeing as how you have to deal with an automated response on your first ticket submission, then you have to have a conversation explaining to a Riot support agent, and then the support agent has to watch the replay, which in this case would be in the 3-5 hour range, depending on how far along this gets.\n\nStop being stubborn and realize that simply implementing a small fix is far more efficient and far better PR for Riot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LOSINGISMYPRIDE","date":"2017-12-31T17:34:15.858+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but still you cant play league for 4 hours because the game need to be finished .

Sure, it happens for a statistical minutiae, but for those who go through it, it's a nightmare.  And those who go through this risk getting a 14-day ban for leaving a game that was being held hostage.  It's a situation that is setup to severely punish the innocents while letting the guilt parties go.\n\nAnd you have to remember the copycat concept - now that this has been proven to work, you will inevitably start seeing more and more people in these lower-populated regions start trying to one-up each other.  These 4 guys made a 5-hour game happen?  Better shoot for a 6-hour game.  Etc. \n\nThe solution doesn't even have to be a difficult one to implement.  My proposal is to only require a simple majority after 1 hour 30 min.  The vast majority of games are done by this time, so this implementation would address the very problem of games being held hostage.  Sure, there are some outliers that are legitimate games that go on for 90 min or so, but most games in this time range are the result of some sort of trolling, inting, or intentionally dragging the game out.\n\nBeing a statistical minutiae doesn't mean a problem shouldn't be addressed.  Did you know most Windows security updates are fixed because they were exploited only a handful of times?  Out of billions of PCs?  Because it's true.  And the rationale is simple - if word of the exploit gets out, it's almost guaranteed to be copied over and over and over again.  Not to mention that life is made miserable for those unlucky few who suffer through said exploits - either through losing their bank account information, money, or just their documents and pictures.  Same as this games-held-hostage idea.\n\nIf major software companies took this approach to patching exploits in their systems, just imagine how quickly things would spiral out of control.  You always address a major issue before it becomes widespread.  You always quash a bug before the masses figure it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-01-01T01:15:39.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> And those who go through this risk getting a 14-day ban for leaving a game that was being held hostage.

If they're in good standing, leaving a game isn't going to get you a 2 week ban. If you're truly innocent, you might suffer at worse, a que timer, but my occasional left game doesn't net me a punishment. You throw a support ticket declaring what happened, and you go about your life.\n\n> Not to mention that life is made miserable for those unlucky few who suffer through said exploits - either through losing their bank account information, money, or just their documents and pictures.
