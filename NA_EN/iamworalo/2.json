Why is it so bad for people to be able to get out of a bad game every once in a while? Why be forced to play troll games? \r\nOkay maybe this idea isn&#039;t polished off yet, but with some input from the community there might be something to think of.\r\n\r\nAt least let people dodge 1 promo game without penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"Liquid Sloth","date":"2016-09-15T19:25:52.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin jungle.
