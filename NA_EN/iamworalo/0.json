It would be like an hourglass/thornmail item but you can still move, it could impliment a self-silence so that the user cannot cast abilities while the active is being used and if you wanted to prevent ADC and APC's from using it you could use your champion classifications to dictate which champs can and cannot purchase it.

Furthermore there are only 3 cases of where the division is arbitrary (Jayce/Kayle/Gnar). So unless Riot reworks a few of the champions to have both ranged and melee auto attacks hiding items in the store for one group of champions is not a big deal but more of a QOL buff as there is a few less items to look through.\n\nI can understand putting Kayle ult on an item seems frustrating, but I never did specify how long it would last, how much damage it would return, or how long the CD of the item would be once used.
