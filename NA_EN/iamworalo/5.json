I&#039;ve had too many support games where my ADC died and there are 3 enemies just boxing me in under my turret, ready to kill me and all I can do is pray for a quick death. It would be nice if turrets at least for the first 10 minutes gave allied players some kind of buff, like the inner turrets used to do. Maybe not something as simple as an armor/mr boost, but thinking more towards slowing enemy attackers so they are pretty sure that their 3 man dive will at least cost one of them their lives or maybe a really short stun or snare with a 4 second cooldown, an added DOT spell or what the hell an AOE so it&#039;s not just the Nautilus tanking the turret while Jinx tears you to shreds. \r\n\r\nThen again, this might be how Riot intends turrets to be at the moment, because they want a fast pace game that ends after 20 - 30 minutes, reducing the amount of games that last 40+ minutes. Or maybe they just want to action pack the game. The downside is variability, the game is very volatile right now, with damages going through the roof and having so many &quot;Where the fuck did that damage come from&quot; moments it&#039;s becoming an unpredictable clown fiesta. \r\n\r\nTurrets are just one issue I am having right now, but I think it&#039;s the most pressing one at the moment. This season seems so toxic.\r\nI&#039;ve never seen such toxic behaviour (and I admit I have never been this toxic in previous seasons as well).","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-04-19T20:36:19.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turrets are terrible.\n\nEarly game sure there are problems. If they dive without a single death (unless a very good dive plan) then the turret just sucks.\nBut I am more concerned with mid/late sieges. Like a 25% Darius (not full tank) getting stunned under turret twice and then walking up further getting two kills and getting out alive (wasn't that fed). I mean maybe he used hit his heal, idk. But when you are under turret you should at least feel a little protected. And if played well should be able to fend off an attack or break even. But you just can't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-04-20T01:53:58.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever play Karthus, you'll see how useless turrets are.\n\nGetting dived at 6 is fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2017-04-19T23:58:54.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot didn't like season 5 latter half being possibly the most balanced league ever was also the most fun. games allowing for late games making it fair ground for every champion. no divesity existed like then. they fucked up in season 6 wit massive gold and tower changes. towers used to give shields and were much stronger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-19T20:06:43.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Is there a reason why turrets are so weak right now?\n\nLCS","replies":[]}]}
