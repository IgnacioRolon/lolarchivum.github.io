I mean not even 20/0/0 Katarina could do that in previous seasons, not in a blink of an eye, you could at least see her shunpo in before bashing her head on her R. \r\n\r\n{{champion:141}} &lt;- Fix\r\n\r\nA fed champ should be able to kill anyone and maybe even a quick kill, but not so quick that if you sneeze you might have missed his pentakill. Riot you said players should be able to respond to assasins, but right now the opposite is true. \r\n\r\nThere are more champions that have this potential but not as much as Kayn has right now.\r\nAlso 2 seasons ago people predicted this was happening to the game, that damage would become more and more abundant and exactly that seems to be happening. These are sad developments.\r\n\r\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/GS1o07Ps1B7tS/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-12-02T07:29:30.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"specifically blue kayne. dont forget he is 2 champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-12-02T04:58:08.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted for the Blink reference","replies":[]}]}
