Don&#039;t ask me why but I think I just look past the honor icons in the new client.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t even remember when I have seen someone with an honor crest in the loading screen, so I think the honor system should be revamped and a perfect example for it is the Overwatch end of match screen where you can commend people on their plays.\r\n\r\nIn Overwatch when the game ends you see stats of several players who have done exceptionally well that game. It shows these players and the field they excelled in for example, damage done, healing done, objective time etc.\r\n\r\nIn league this could be so many things.\r\nDragons/Barons slain, Turrets taken down, Kills, Assists, KDA, Damage dealt or taken, Creep score, Kills with ultimates, wards placed, wards removed.. the list continues.\r\n\r\nNot only does this inspire people and give them a sense of accomplishment it also reduces flaming because people would like to be commended at the end of the game and if you&#039;re a jerk you&#039;re not going to get that MVP status. Even if you&#039;re losing you can be on the list. It also stimulates positive behaviour and creates a feeling of teambonding. Maybe you could even add rewards to it or hand out crests for people that have been commended for certain types of traits. Something in the manners of &#039;all seeing warden&#039; if a support is very good at his job or &#039;master assasin&#039; when an assasin has a long and good kill count for several games.\r\n\r\nI think this would really make people think twice about just trolling a game when things don&#039;t go their way.\r\n\r\nYou could even give a white flag crest to people who love to surrender at 20 minutes {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \r\n\r\nBut seriously this is something the game could benefit from greatly.","replies":[{"poster":"CodyBear ","date":"2017-02-24T20:44:52.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GamblerOfLives","date":"2017-02-23T05:30:12.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"wow, you are so smart..you should run for the presidency..you would win it..vote iamworalo","replies":[{"poster":"IAmWoralo","date":"2017-02-23T15:00:04.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for you input it is so helpful, you must be so good for your environment, people have to love you so much, I bet they built statues for you.
