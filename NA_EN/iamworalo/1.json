Shen's rework did something really smart, and increased his energy costs, balancing him quite well imho.  Zed doesn't particularly have that issue, and between that, an AD steroid on his W, an AA steroid for his passive that makes Safely turret farming easier, and the Duskblade giving him even more burst potential...well.  And that's not even mentioning the current offenders, Maw/Mercurial, who offer REALLY great stats on top of their passive, ensuring that Zed can survive the enemy mage's burst, and come back with one of his own.\n\n\nTurrets are feeling pretty weak this season too, but that's an afterthought, considering that if Zed wants to dive you and get the kill, he will, and if you're lucky, he might take ONE turret shot, so long as he has some idea of WTF he's doing.","replies":[{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2016-04-05T13:13:43.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Various Felonies,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ek1TYEty,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-04-04T16:54:54.449+0000)Shen's rework did something really smart, and increased his energy costs, balancing him quite well imho. \n\nWhat the fuck.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-04-04T14:10:26.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny that you only put the icon for morde","replies":[{"poster":"Brimaz The King","date":"2016-04-04T14:13:53.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mhihnj,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ek1TYEty,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-04-04T14:10:26.820+0000)\n>\n> funny that you only put the icon for morde\n\nI didn't know how to spell his name properly.
