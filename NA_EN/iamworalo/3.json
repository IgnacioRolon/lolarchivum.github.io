I mean it&#039;s not as if it would have a negative impact on the game, as a matter of fact it would stop ruining games where someone forgets to pick smite. No harm done whatsoever. \r\n\r\nBtw, this was a a plat elo game, so this still happens in higher elo.\r\nI&#039;ve made this post over and over again and it get&#039;s upvoted and downvoted, but seriously after so much retard proofing to league why can&#039;t this be added? We can nearly ping the microwave timer on my hot chocolate, but I can&#039;t get a no smite warning.","replies":[{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-12-26T01:34:53.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ping your smite cooldown itself?  you can ping the cooldowns of summoners","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyNeedle","date":"2016-12-26T17:25:43.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chamuel85,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wLbvfjla,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-26T01:34:53.405+0000)\n>\n> Ping your smite cooldown itself?  you can ping the cooldowns of summoners\n\nRead the post","replies":[{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-12-26T22:08:33.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Read the other response to my post, and then my response to that.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2016-12-26T23:50:05.687+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chamuel85,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wLbvfjla,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-12-26T22:08:33.834+0000)\n>\n> Its you fault for not writing what I thought you were gonna write.\n\nFTFY","replies":[{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-12-27T03:18:26.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My intent was never to blame him.
