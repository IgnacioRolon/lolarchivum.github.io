(Increased AP and Movement Speed)\r\nQ: Hirudo's next basic attack takes a bite out of a target enemy, and heals himself for the amount of damage dealt.\r\nW: Slows surrounding enemies in a pool of blood.\r\nE: Hirudo dashes to an enemy target, and it bleeds for a short period of time.\r\nR: Hirudo latches himself onto an allied champion or an enemy champion and becomes untargetable.  If he latches himself onto an ally, he grants them extra health and movement speed.  If the allied champion dies while Hirudo is latched on, he dies instead, leaving the ally with half of their original health.  If he latches onto an enemy, he slows them and deals percent damage over time.\r\n\r\nSynergy:\r\n{{champion:122}}\r\n{{champion:91}}\r\n{{champion:21}}\r\n\r\nHirudo could play in the jungle, as a support bot, or as a top laner.
