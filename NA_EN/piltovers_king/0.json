Any bigger, walking out of it becomes difficult and any longer range would kind of ruin the range sync with her E.\n\nthree, second change is just bad, the skill itself isn't designed to detonate on its own for damage rather it's supposed to be used in conjunction with her W to actually deal its damage. Also it is a nerf and not a buff, nerf because it is a great zoning tool because dashing on it hurts, the longer it remains on the battlefield, the longer it zones enemies from dashing into it. Also, having an ability not designed to actually blow up twice for its damage, is just bad champion design.\n\nfourth, fuck no, just no, the last time Taliyah's Q was strong she became a roaming monster because it was a ridiculous form of wave clear. Her Q still has great base damage, a single rock still hurts regardless and true damage just doesn't fit at all. If you don't try to hit all of your Q rocks, you're stupid, considering she takes thunderlords most of the time, you WILL want to hit three Qs at least and with some AP, and every rock after the first still stings.\n\nfifth, no? you aren't even supposed to hit it, it's supposed to block enemy movement and cut there escape options normally resulting in a flash. Also, it's already a great roaming ultimate because you can ride it. \n\nsixth, knock back and knock ups are arguably the *strongest* forms of cc, it is quite literally 'super hard cc' since you can neither cleanse or counter it with tenacity. She's a mage, you can literally say that any mage is squishy.(with exceptions since they are designed in such a fashion)","replies":[{"poster":"Piltovers King","date":"2017-06-15T16:54:42.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is how she's played and yes your right on that as how shes supposed to be used and situational yes she can be broken but NOTHING  is going to stop {{champion:103}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:45}}   from one shoting u by A *juking your only cc* B *flashing it* then one shoting you i just want a more reliable lane rather then being countered by every mid laner with even a shred of mobility in lane","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2017-06-15T21:03:15.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Piltovers King,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1EEBltnN,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-06-15T16:54:42.654+0000)\n>\n> I know this is how she&#x27;s played and yes your right on that as how shes supposed to be used and situational yes she can be broken but NOTHING  is going to stop {{champion:103}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:45}}   from one shoting u by A *juking your only cc* B *flashing it* then one shoting you i just want a more reliable lane rather then being countered by every mid laner with even a shred of mobility in lane\n\nFirst of all you mentioned MULTIPLE assassins and I could say the same about a lot of other mages where you simply just 'flash' to dodge\n\nand if they flash because she's about to do a combo is a good sign, it means that they actually don't want ti get hit by E because it's actually fucking dangerous as hell","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-13T13:52:40.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her W zone is fine (if they made it bigger it would have to take from her cd's or damage), and the point of your E isn't to have it blow up while they are on it.

Old Zyra had that problem, they replaced it with plant health and you still hit 40% every game with her. I can understand wanting some sort of passive on it since it offers no damage, but cdr isn't the answer if anything is. Her ult doesn't need to do damage, it is a roaming spell. You use it to go from your lane to other lanes.\n\nPersonally, I think that she just needs some sort of passive tweak.
