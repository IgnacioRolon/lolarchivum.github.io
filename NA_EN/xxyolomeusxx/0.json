I understand to 100% that I have made big mistakes which finally caused this ban. The reason why I open this thread is because I'm hoping to get fairly a last chance. I've been playing this game for years now and I had a lot of fun in it, learning new champions, winning games and making new friends. Sadly, I was acting like a fool in my last few games. I didn't play well and blamed my teammates, and I did not just tell them they're bad - I was spamming bad words like all the time and I'm not proud of it at all. I really regret my behaviour. All the great people I have in my riends list and the fact that I've already spent a lot money on the game (some people may say it's not that much but for me it really is) are making this ban really hard for me. I want to ask the riot team to unban me and keep an eye on me so you can give me a penalty if this should happen again. I would even accept a permanent chat ban because this may be the best opinion to avoid situations where I abuse the chat / get mad too fast. I really appreciate the work of Riot and I swear I will completely change my mind If you guys give me a last chance and unban my account.\r\n\r\n> I DON'T EXPECT AN UNBAN, I JUST HOPE FOR IT! \r\n> I PROMISE TO CHANGE AND FOCUS ON MYSELF IF I GET A FINAL CHANCE!\r\n\r\noh and sorry for my bad english I hope you get what I meant to tell you &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-01-27T00:01:39.347+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, Riot isn't overturning any permanently banned accounts at this time.

Why suggest to someone interested in reforming something that breaks the rules? And you do realize that just about 100% of those 3rd party sites are scams right?\n\n1. They bot leveled the account and are selling you crap as it will certainly be banned with the next ban wave.\n2. They sell you the account and after your payment clears they recall/recover the account.\n3. They take your money and give you invalid login information.\n4. They download malware on your computer when you visit the site that will compromise all of your online accounts used on that computer, gaming, banking, and otherwise.\n\nThe above is just some of the way they can scam you, please for the love of fucking god stop encouraging people to do business with these scammers!","replies":[{"poster":"II1III1III1II1II","date":"2019-01-27T04:16:39.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mahrix10","date":"2019-01-27T04:25:29.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, sure if you believe that I have some swampland in Florida I'd like to sell you and I hear the Brooklyn Bridge is for sale again...","replies":[{"poster":"II1III1III1II1II","date":"2019-01-27T04:30:59.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mahrix10","date":"2019-01-27T05:02:29.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I would add is that account sellers are the reason that there is so many feeder bots rampaging about in the low levels ruining the experience for new players.\n\nSupporting account sellers also supports this type of malicious gameplay as well.
