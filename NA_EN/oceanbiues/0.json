No?\nThen what's the problem?\n\n> Recently since my account has been banned, I've been playing on a smurf, muting all from the beginning so that I won't be \"toxic\". Ironically, what I've found is, I get griefed significantly MORE often for muting other players and not talking to them. \n> \n\nBanned smurf plays with and against banned smurfs. Again, they would grief regardless.\n\n> Finally, I think the logic that someone should get banned for addressing a griefer or troll is fundamentally wrong. If I'm driving my car, and someone runs a red light at double the speed limit, that driver loses their license, gets a ticket, etc. My driving privileges are not affected if I flip him the bird, or say something inflammatory because of what they did.\n\nYes and no. While there is no point in pointing out the obvious (some1 trolling) I agree that shouldn't be punishable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-04-26T02:37:14.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't announce muting at the start, makes people know you've got a toxic history","replies":[]}]}
