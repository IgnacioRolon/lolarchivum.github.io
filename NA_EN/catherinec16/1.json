Please re-install League alpha client to try again.\"\r\n\r\nHas anyone even had this problem? Please let me know if you can help, thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T03:22:30.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, this error is quite heckin' annoying! This happens when something went wrong with the first upgrade attempt. Luckily, it's fairly easy to resolve with the following steps. First, you'll want to temporarily disable any Firewall/Antivirus you have running. Next, you'll want to hop into your League install folder (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and delete the file named **LeagueClient.exe**. After you've done that, launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** shortcut as admin (r-click, *run as administrator*) and try the upgrade again.\n\nLet me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"catherinec16","date":"2017-03-03T19:50:43.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked well, ty :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"31606096_DEL","date":"2017-02-16T19:31:29.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same problem and your fix worked thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remorobot","date":"2017-07-02T21:36:19.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, the problem is that i took a break from league right?

I clicked launch after the patch and it didn't work. It just said \"were updating your client\" PLZ HELP!! PS: in my league folder there are no \"LeagueClient.exe\" file.
