I cannot buy any of his other skins. They say &quot;requires champion&quot; while Battlecast Alpha does not. For Darius, Dunkmaster also says that I can buy it despite not having the champ.\nOn the champ specific skin screens, these skins still prompt me to buy the champion first. But on the Skins store screen I can get to checkout with them.\n\nI will only try actually buying it (to see if it&#039;s just a visual bug) if I get substantial free RP ;&gt;\n\nLegendaries like Blackfrost Anivia and Gatekeeper Galio are properly locked to me.\n\n\n(In case it matters, my account used to own Darius and Dunkmaster Darius more than a year ago)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-10T18:37:30.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey glkz! Happy Snowdown! \n\nIn order to purchase a skin, you'll need to own the champion.
