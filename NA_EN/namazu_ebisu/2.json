Guess I'll need to turn off voices when I play Sona now. But I love it as is, plz don't fix.\n\nIf we had an option to mute the voice of the champion we are playing, that would be neat. That way I won't miss out on audio queues if I turn off all voices.\n\nPlz don't fix. Whatever is wrong, it's it's actually right.
