I seriously hope this is just placeholder because many people complained about Dark Form being too subtle and i think it might just be &#039;till @Riot_iZac works on it (he has been promoting effects on twitter but avoiding Dark Form so...fingers crossed) :\n\n**Some mild differences only because i couldn't capture at the same exact split second, but you see the stuff. See at the bottom of the post for proof comparison with other forms.**\n\nHere is the E where you can see, despite the middle projectile, that the ambiant effects are exactly the same (and that&#039;s no coincidence, other forms have it WAY MORE differently) :\n\nhttp://puu.sh/sd1yl/960ee2c135.jpg   &amp;   http://puu.sh/sd1AR/df13b70c16.jpg\n\nhttp://puu.sh/sd1Ht/39016ce048.jpg  &amp;  http://puu.sh/sd1Ls/df7f993a6f.jpg\n\n\nSame thing for R, you can clearly see the trail particles around the laser that are unique to those 2 forms :\n\n\nhttp://puu.sh/sd1Sz/8c68f12303.jpg  &amp;  http://puu.sh/sd1Vw/aa85372041.jpg\n\n\nHere is Q, exactly the same trail :\n\nhttp://puu.sh/sd2Cr/08a7c0791a.jpg  &amp;  http://puu.sh/sd2Fn/274a6ed349.jpg\n\nhttp://puu.sh/sd22Y/44e80c7c72.jpg  &amp;  http://puu.sh/sd24e/a4958f51c0.jpg\n\n\n\nAnd W...which is basically the same for all forms with added details so not much here :\n\n\nhttps://puu.sh/sd28m/a1cf53e1c5.jpg  &amp;  http://puu.sh/sd26s/059a2a1b24.jpg\n\n\n\n\nAll other forms have really different effect, water being the most obvious because of the E splash. So i really doubt this is a coincidence.\n\n**Here are some other forms below fire & dark for you to see that this is really just the Dark form having the same particles than Fire form, in purple.**\n\n\nhttp://puu.sh/sd54p/9bd8aae3d7.jpg\n\n\nAs you can see, Water and Magma have their unique particles by FAR. Only Dark Form has this issue being the same as Fire.\n\n\n**Problem :** E is too subtle, needs more particles more \"shroud\" like. It could be the opposite of the light E for the best, but right now it doesn't really appeal as Darkness... For the rest, i don't know tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSingularity","date":"2016-11-10T02:27:15.479+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Dark Lux is in its final form yet ... there's a note on the PBE saying there are possibly a few more changes to some of the forms.

Anything is possible, but I'd be surprised at this point if our next ultimate tried to raise the bar with just \"omg moar forms!\" Ten is a lot, and we had a lot of challenges on elementalist Lux that we learned from.
