This isn't toxic and that word is thrown around too lightly now in my opinion, people know what toxicity really is because they've experienced it and this isn't it. This is just someone playing the game. The claims for the ban were:\n\n\"That he was being passive aggressive\", I geuss this might be slightly true? \n\n\"He told someone to uninstall.\" Not true and taken out of context completely, he told someone who was playing that he was a toxic influence and he hopes not to see him in another game. Everyone has said something around these lines.\n\n\"Asking for reports\". I cant even find any readon that someone would think this is bannable.\n\nI check this board pretty much everyday and this is the first post I have ever agreed with. If he was super toxic for his 14 day suspension, then I could kinda understand this. But he claims the 14 day suspension were around the same points as this one, and in that case I frankly can't see him worthy of never playing on his account again just for that. Would I ever say something like this? Of course not, I hardly type as it is, but having a teamate say this would'nt lesson my experience at all.

You would have to establish a pattern of this happening and do it consistently in order to first even break into chat restrictions.\n\nHowever, OP had just come off of a 14 day ban. They explicitly state that it is your final warning, and that the next punishment is a permanent ban. Once you are on that last step, all it takes is one validated instance of toxicity to get you banned. In this case, it normally wouldn't have caused anything, but given the behavior history, there was no leniency.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aatrox Mid 1v5","date":"2017-09-20T15:10:13.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were being really passive aggressive in that chat.
