The Demacians were the &quot;good guys&quot; the Noxians were the &quot;bad guys&quot; everything was so clear cut and lacked any depth, making it near impossible to create an original character without them being the most boring one dimensional character ever written. This has changed a thousand times over, thanks to Riot&#039;s incredible writing and worldbuilding teams. \n\nNow, we&#039;re given an in-depth, interactive map of Runeterra, with the names of the most famous capitols, to even the lowliest villages, as well as perfect descriptions of the cultures and people of each faction. We can now get a better idea of the average, every day life of a person from each faction. We&#039;re given entire stories worth of history, and multiple short stories that help even further to describe life on Runeterra.  \n\nI&#039;ve created multiple characters already. A Demacian peasant boy, who, after discovering his magical talent, moves to Noxus after being promised safe haven and acceptance, while struggling to accept the brutality of the nation. A Zaunite girl who despises the technology that makes the city after witnessing her parents become little else but mindless machines due to the constant augmentations that they needed to in order to work, and now wishes only to sail across the seas. There are so many others that I&#039;ve created, and it&#039;s all thanks to the wonderful writing of Riot. Without their worldbuilding, none of my creations would have been possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-11-08T16:25:31.079+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This makes me happy.\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \nWhat sort of things would help you even more, do you think?  \nNo promises, just checking for unexpected ideas that we've not considered yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-11-08T16:49:55.738+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"More depth into the religions or belief systems would be a start. We have some folklore that’s universally shared (Kindred) and we have Illaoi’s religion, but we don’t know much about major religions in factions like Demacia. \n\nWe know of philosophies, and stories that support them, but those stories feel more historical to outsiders than tales you’d see in a religious book (though I know religious books can touch on real world events).","replies":[{"poster":"Dan Squared","date":"2018-11-10T14:29:27.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the very least we know Noxus has, if not outright worship, at least a spiritual connection with the wolf-aspect of kindred.  Matches with the Noxian mentality of never just laying down to die.  We have seen it twice now, once in the Pillars of Strenght short story, and more recently with Vlads.\n\nConsidering how Noxus is not only meant to be highly inclusive, but also at this point has absorbed various cultures, I feel like Noxus probably has no official state religion, instead everyone practices their spirituality however they feel/prefer.  Reverence to the Wolf is probably the closest they come, and I doubt its mandated\n\nDemacia, having an official state religion and possibly an accompanying rigid church structure would not surprise me.  Depending on how far Riot takes the \"anti-magic\" dogma...we could even be looking at full on witch trials.

More in-depth explanations on societal and governmental structures would be helpful, too. We know very little about how Demacia’s government, military, and castes are structured, for example. Fiora’s lore hints at some degree of patriarchalism, but how deep does that go?

I love studying theology, and that's one of the few things that are missing from the lore, the religious beliefs of the nations. So far, we only have Illaoi's god, not even going to attempt to type their name, who is worshipped by the people of the Blue Flame Isles, and most of Bilgewater, Kindred, who's present everywhere, and that's about it. I'd love more info about the cult in Zaun that worships Victor and the \"Glorious Evolution\" , more about the people who worship and believe in Janna, as well as more info on the \"Great Spirit of Ionia\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-11-08T17:34:51.851+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Details!\n\n1) Description of economies, political systems, and militaries.

Call it nature, the universe, gods—all you need to know is that it follows rules and gives data.\n\nThrough science, we discover models that apply principles to data collected from such a system to predict how it behaves, and develop theories that satisfy our desire for an intuition about its behavior.  Any supernatural meddling with an otherwise natural system would merely be a change to its initial conditions—everything afterward would be entirely predicted by the model.\n\nShould the divine intervention be pervasive and consistent enough, it could even be used to characterize a regime in which an adjusted model would be needed.
