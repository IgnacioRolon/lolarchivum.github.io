While, yes, as a redhead, Katarina would most likely have fairer skin than Cassiopeia, that doesn&#039;t explain why Cass has one of the best tans in the game. Did she stay in Shurima for a weeks after getting cursed for that sweet complexion? Which brings me to my second point.  \r\n\r\nWhile she was getting that oh so perfect tan, because you know, beauty goals, did she decide to immerse herself in Shuriman culture? That would explain all the gold she&#039;s wearing, and that headdress. She&#039;s supposed to be a Noxian champion, and currently in Universe, is back in Noxus, but you wouldn&#039;t know that unless you read her lore.  \r\n\r\nThirdly, wasn&#039;t she cursed, and had her beauty taken away or something? Part of her character is the loss of her beauty, yet she looks better than half the people I know. All that happened was she got a tail, slit pupils, and decided to start wearing green eye liner. Instead of having her wear claw jewelry, give her actual claws like in her Siren skin. Give her a forked tongue, or hair that&#039;s been withered or something. You don&#039;t have to make her look like Freddy Krueger, but at least something so she isn&#039;t just &quot;girl with a snake tail&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Speak or Die","date":"2018-12-11T04:11:39.682+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"I hate the \"she's not ugly\" argument.

That souls can somehow be stored in blood.\n\nWell Vlad can turn his entire body into blood and it still retains his soul. At this point, he is essentially a walking sack of blood in the shape of a human. His mortal body died a long time ago. He even landed the killing blow on Cebotaur, the Darkin who taught him blood magic. Although, you're probably going to say \"we don't know it was Cebotaur.\" I will just say that Vlad's Darkin teacher was a warmonger, and the Twilight of the Gods story clearly says that Cebotaur was currently waging wars in the north... But I know that isn't enough for you. \n\n> 2. That said soul can be stored in the blood *without* the one actually possessing the soul having died first.\n\nIt could have only been a fraction of her soul. It's not out of the question that blood magic is capable of doing just that. Like if you fill a cup of Vlad, does that cup still have a piece of Vlad's soul in it? Does it become inanimate? Can it act independently? Is Vlad aware of the cup at all times? \n\n> 3. That Naganeka, of all the people she could choose to be her new host, chooses the one that would free Xerath from his prison.\n\nWell the prophecy she knew does say the crossblade will be used, so it would make sense that eventually that the crossblade would be used in the lock inevitably.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-12-15T09:26:21.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SSmotzer,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Blsvmd7F,comment-id=00040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-12-14T23:20:40.899+0000)\n>\n> Well of course they can. Possessing someone&#x27;s body and flesh weaving is not something that happens from being trapped in a weapon. It&#x27;s from blood magic. So long as Naganeka knows blood magic, she is just as capable of possessing people and transforming flesh as any other Darkin.\n\nHow do you know this is the case?\n\nThe only Darkin we've seen that can take over new hosts are the Darkin that've been imprisoned in weapons (as in, all the Darkin that've lost their original physical form).\n\nIf the only thing you truly needed was Blood Magic, what was stopping Ta'anari from just taking over a new host to fix the wound on his back?\n\n> \n> If it were any other Darkin, I would agree, but it&#x27;s Naganeka, a Darkin who spent hundreds of years in silence.\n\nEven if she's predominately silent, Cassiopeia should still *feel* something trying to take over her.\n\n> Besides, Cass still needs new voice lines, so can&#x27;t say Naganeka isn&#x27;t whispering into Cass&#x27;s ear.\n\nShe doesn't need new voice lines?\n\nHer quotes have already been updated once.\n\n> \n> Now wait a second, I thought you said that a Darkin dying means they are dead. How could a dead Darkin be imprisoned in a weapon?\n\nThis is the one thing that's kinda ruining it, because the lore literally states that Vladimir killed his master.\n\nThen again, Darkin are incredibly hard to kill and the only thing we've seen that actually did in a Darkin for good was Moon Magic, so Vladimir might only have \"killed\" his master, and not **killed** his master.\n\nPoint is, I'm just saying there are way more parallels that can be drawn to Rhaast than Cebotaur.\n\n> If Vlad killed Rhaast and then had his soul bound to the scythe, what is stopping Ta&#x27;anari from getting his soul bound to the crossblade after he died?\n\nThere's a key difference here.\n\nRhaast was never turned back into a human, meaning he's still very much a Darkin.\n\nTa'anari was, meaning he's no longer a Darkin.\n\n>  \n> But his soul is bound to his bones, every one of his bones, and they were all separated and are being guarded by his loyal lichs. \n\nHis soul isn't \"bound\" to his bones, because that would mean the soul is within the bones at all times, which it isn't because the soul is within his armor when he's animating it.\n\nIt's more appropriate to call his bones an anchor for his soul when it leaves his armor.\n\nThis is the reviving process:\n\n1. Mordekaiser dies on the battlefield.\n\n2. His soul leaves his armor and is anchored back to his complete skeleton.\n\n3.

That a Darkin can slowly take over the host&#x27;s body without the host having to wield the weapon the Darkin is imprisoned within (or even that a Darkin can possess someone without having to have been sealed within a weapon to begin with).\n\nWell of course they can. Possessing someone's body and flesh weaving is not something that happens from being trapped in a weapon. It's from blood magic. So long as Naganeka knows blood magic, she is just as capable of possessing people and transforming flesh as any other Darkin.\n\n> 2. That a Darkin can slowly take over the host&#x27;s body without the host neither hearing nor feeling that the Darkin is there.\n\nIf it were any other Darkin, I would agree, but it's Naganeka, a Darkin who spent hundreds of years in silence. Besides, Cass still needs new voice lines, so can't say Naganeka isn't whispering into Cass's ear.\n\n\n> Vlad&#x27;s master&#x27;s banner had a scythe on it, and Rhaast was also a Darkin that resided (or at least was imprisoned) in the north.\n>\n> It makes way more sense for Vlad&#x27;s master to be Rhaast than for him to be Cebotaur.\n\nNow wait a second, I thought you said that a Darkin dying means they are dead. How could a dead Darkin be imprisoned in a weapon? If Vlad killed Rhaast and then had his soul bound to the scythe, what is stopping Ta'anari from getting his soul bound to the crossblade after he died?\n\n \n> Implying that souls can be split.\n> \n> No, Mordekaiser never had his soul split.\n \nBut his soul is bound to his bones, every one of his bones, and they were all separated and are being guarded by his loyal lichs. \n\n> What, based on the fact that Vlad can turn his body into blood, that means blood magic is somehow capable of not only splitting your soul, but also storing the fractions of your soul for several millenia without the blood drying out?\n> \n> This is assuming you *can* even fill a cup of Vlad, assuming that a piece of him can be separated from the greater whole.\n> \n> When he turns into a pool of blood, the entire pool moves as one, meaning you probably can&#x27;t separate it.\n\nBut he throws blood around and can pull it back to him. \n\n> First off, how do you know that she knew about the prophecy?\n\nBecause she was standing next to the rest of the Darkin when they spoke about the prophecy.\n\n>Ta’anari reached back over his shoulder and unslung the Chalicar.

Brought from beyond the mountain and raised aloft at Shurima’s birth. It is the blade that will one day be borne by Sivunas Alahair, the Bringer of Rains. In their hands it will be a weapon of great destruction, or a symbol of unity.”\n>\n>He held out the Chalicar for his fellows to see. Its edges glittered gold, shaped by cosmic forces beyond this world by powers not even the wisest of Shurima understood. Ta’anari saw their reverence, their awe and pride.\n\nSee, he told all of the Darkin who were there, including Naganeka.\n\n> Second off, even if she did, it&#x27;s still kind of faulty, because Nageneka (clearly based on the fact that Cassiopeia is still in control of her own body) doesn&#x27;t assume immediate control over the person her statue bites down on.\n\nOf course not, she isn't as skilled at bloodmagic as someone like Aatrox, who spent hundreds of years breaking down flesh into his body.

When the video was made, it was assumed that the Darkin come from another realm, like the angels. There was no way for the art team to assume that the Darkin would be involved in any way in making the video.\n\nThe only thing that could possibly have changed within the video is who the statue of the snake is supposed to represent.\n\nThe rest is still canon as far as I'm concerned.\n\n> \n> Like Naganeka.\n\nSure, if she really is the only snake Ascended there is.\n\n> \n> Well, Cass isn&#x27;t quite a Darkin herself, it&#x27;s just parts of her body are being transformed into Naganeka, like how Kayn&#x27;s arm and eye are turning into Rhaast.\n\nThis is again going into the realm of assumptions.\n\n1. That a Darkin can slowly take over the host's body without the host having to wield the weapon the Darkin is imprisoned within (or even that a Darkin can possess someone without having to have been sealed within a weapon to begin with).\n\n2. That a Darkin can slowly take over the host's body without the host neither hearing nor feeling that the Darkin is there.\n\n> \n> Well Vlad can turn his entire body into blood and it still retains his soul.\n\nYes, but the key thing here is that Vlad's turning his *entire* body into blood, and the whole body is still connected together and not separated at any point.\n\nWhat you're suggesting is that Naganeka can do the same thing with only a *small* portion of her blood, as well as the blood not being connected to her anymore.\n\n> At this point, he is essentially a walking sack of blood in the shape of a human. His mortal body died a long time ago. \n\nHe's not a walking sack of blood and his mortal body didn't die, he's just immortal.\n\n> He even landed the killing blow on Cebotaur, the Darkin who taught him blood magic. Although, you&#x27;re probably going to say &quot;we don&#x27;t know it was Cebotaur.&quot; I will just say that Vlad&#x27;s Darkin teacher was a warmonger, and the Twilight of the Gods story clearly says that Cebotaur was currently waging wars in the north... But I know that isn&#x27;t enough for you. \n\nUhh, yes? Of course this isn't enough for me?\n\nYou can't just assume that Vladimir's Darkin master was Cebotaur just because Vlad and Cebotaur were both in the north.\n\nAll Darkin were warmongerer so that's not an exucse.\n\nVlad's master's banner had a scythe on it, and Rhaast was also a Darkin that resided (or at least was imprisoned) in the north.\n\nPlus, Rhaast is one of the more lighthearted and amusement driven Darkin. It'd make sense for him to teach his servants Blood Magic to amuse him.\n\nIt makes way more sense for Vlad's master to be Rhaast than for him to be Cebotaur.\n\n> \n> It could have only been a fraction of her soul.\n\nImplying that souls can be split.\n\nNo, Mordekaiser never had his soul split.\n\nNo, Kindred does not work in the same way as living beings does.\n\n> It&#x27;s not out of the question that blood magic is capable of doing just that.\n\nWhat, based on the fact that Vlad can turn his body into blood, that means blood magic is somehow capable of not only splitting your soul, but also storing the fractions of your soul for several millenia without the blood drying out?\n\n> Like if you fill a cup of Vlad, does that cup still have a piece of Vlad&#x27;s soul in it? Does it become inanimate? Can it act independently? Is Vlad aware of the cup at all times? \n\nThis is assuming you *can* even fill a cup of Vlad, assuming that a piece of him can be separated from the greater whole.\n\nWhen he turns into a pool of blood, the entire pool moves as one, meaning you probably can't separate it.\n\n> \n> Well the prophecy she knew does say the crossblade will be used, so it would make sense that eventually that the crossblade would be used in the lock inevitably.\n\nFirst off, how do you know that she knew about the prophecy?\n\nSecond off, even if she did, it's still kind of faulty, because Nageneka (clearly based on the fact that Cassiopeia is still in control of her own body) doesn't assume immediate control over the person her statue bites down on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dan Squared","date":"2018-12-11T18:08:20.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well for one thing she probably did get a really good tan in shurima, and her snake features definitely take away the beauty aspect\n\nWhile yeah, her costume doesn't match noxian primary aesthetics, you could at least make the argument that Noxus, being the inclusive place it is, would also make sense for fashions of the regions they conquer to have some influence throughout the empire.

After all, she could just be wearing the headdress because she's bald from the curse - and even if she's Noxian, she may wear Shuriman inspired costumes to play up to her general look, and try to use the Shuriman baubles and jewelry to try to reclaim and capture any beauty she believes she can find with her new form.\nAdditionally, given that she's a snake now, she's likely gone cold blooded to a degree.
