Don't be super aggressive, but force trades or loss of cs for them continually.\nEventually you should be able to force them under tower with very little health.\nIf they recall, you don't recall, just stay and outlevel them.\nIf they don't recall, ask jungle to set up a dive and kill them.\n\n**Get good at cleaver harassment.**\n\nGet good at proper warding timing so you don't get a surprise jungle gank. (Mundo doesn't care too much if he gets ganked, or even camped, just as long as they don't catch you out, and off guard.)\n\nBy proper ward timing. I mean, if you see the enemy jungler bot lane, don't waste a ward at that time.\nIf you're close to your tower, don't ward.\nIf you get enemy under their tower and are either trying to set up dive or make them recall.\nWARD THAT BITCH.\nAnd watch it. You want to be ready to cleaver the jungler in the face the second he shows up in your lane, otherwise you're a dead mundo.\nDead mundos are sad, cause usually mundos don't please to go to fountain.\n\nBut don't necessarily back off as soon as the enemy jungler shows his face. Mundo can 2v1 fairly well. And by that I don't mean try to go ham and get a double kill alone.\nJust hold him up, waste his time. Let your jungler get ahead.\n\nMundo can 1v1 fairly well though. But patience is the key. Harass the hell out of them, every time they make a misstep, cleaver them in the face.\nEvery time they want a tank minion, cleaver in the face.\nEvery time they flash their mastery emote, cleaver in the face.\nEven when you think they are low enough to kill. Don't go in for the kill immediately. Just moar cleaver in the face.\nThen, just when they think you're not going to do anything except annoy the fk out of them with cleavers, then you kill them.\n\nMundo can roam well, but can't waveclear great. So you'll have to watch the timing on waves pretty carefully when you want to go out.\nHe can waveclear pretty fast if enemy laner recalls though. Just turn w on and run into middle of the pack. But if enemy laner/jungler is anywhere near, that's generally a bad idea. It'll cost you a lot of hp, and a decent chance you'll get creep blocked, and you can't cleaver whoever is coming up to hit you right away till you get out of the pack of minions. Just consider yourself very vulnerable while you are waveclearing. Only do it when you know you're perfectly safe.\n\nAs far as builds, it's pretty boring. Pretty much always want a {{item:3211}} into {{item:3065}} pretty early, regardless of enemy team.\n{{item:3111}} or {{item:3047}} depending on who's the most annoying on enemy team.\nLots of hp.\n{{item:3751}} {{item:3068}} is still pretty good on him I believe. Makes the waveclear faster/safer. Double AoE burn for team fights is nice (though they cut that back a bit).","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-24T10:05:00.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so pretty mech harrass like would with old vlad but slower (and with a skillshot)?  seems doable","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2017-06-24T11:31:01.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Tup5lGEA,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-06-24T10:05:00.662+0000)\n>\n> so pretty mech harrass like would with old vlad but slower (and with a skillshot)?  seems doable\n\nYeh, something like that.\nExcept you lack the trollpool 'woops i wasn't watching for jungler, get out of gank free card'\n(I know it's not that simple, I play a decent amount of old and new vlad, but, still, it is a pretty good 'save your stupid ass' button.)\n\nWith Mundo, if jungler ganks, you're basically required to land a max range cleaver to not die, or at least be forced to burn flash and then lose all lane bully powers you had.\nBut, land 1 good cleaver, then just calmly walk back and you should be good for another round.\n\nOr if jungler wants to be an ass and camp after the failed gank, you should be able to just sit under tower 2v1'ing all day and hope your team can win game 4v3.\n(Usually better to not call for jungler help if you're under tower 2v1. I mean it's situational. If they're being REALLY stupid agro, your jungler could prolly get a doublekill out of it. But if they're just passive cockblocking your lane, prolly best to just weather it out.)\n\nJust hope your team recognizes your sacrifice of a very dull, tedious lane for the greater good.\n\nBut if their jungler isn't an ass, and mostly leaves you alone, it can be a pretty amusing lane phase. And might just tilt enemy top laner. Cleavers can be really frustrating, lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-24T09:02:30.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whatever works, prefer top tho","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2017-06-24T11:31:06.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Tup5lGEA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-06-24T09:02:30.827+0000)\n>\n> whatever works, prefer top tho\n\nSolo lane you can just go Grasp with typical AS+AD runes. I mostly Jungle him for both SR and TT. I don't have any recent TT games in my match history as Mundo though.\nRunes/Masteries: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2529221819/31948940?tab=builds\nTT build even for today: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1997424598/31948940?tab=overview\n\nGeneral things to keep in mind:\n-Last hitting with Q will heal you, as the refund when you last hit is increased by the mastery and visage\n-Using E is an auto attack reset\n-With Q he is good at taking jungle objectives, on SR he can solo all dragons at level 4/after a single jungle clear with just refil and red smite or refil+red smite+ruby crystal. Just smite after taking some damage and use both potions then smite again if you need to.\n-On SR he can do rift herald pretty quickly especially with E being an AA reset to quickly hit the eye and Qs damage\n-He can easily duo Baron with someone and same for spider last I did it a while ago, unless it changed he can solo the spider\n\nHe's a pretty good 1v1er as well, even against champions early on like Lee, and he can invade well too on SR right after 1st 2 buffs against junglers that get low like Kha. For the SR match you'll see I first blooded the Kha @ 2:43","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-06-24T09:27:00.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer to play him with 18/0/12 using deathfire touch.  I use hybrid pen red, armor yellow, scaling mr blue, and attack speed quints.\n\nStart and max Q first, max w second if against someone with CC and E second if against someone lacking CC.  Play really passively until you get your ult just last hitting with your Q which will actually heal you with the 8% bonus healing from runic armor.  Mundo isn't much of a team fighter unless he is fed so you should mostly just focus on pushing lanes and trying to draw attention to yourself in a similar way as Singed.\n\nFor items, mostly just get tank items.  Some items you can get to do insane amounts of damage with your Q are Liandry's and sorc boots though.  My typical build on him is {{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3512}}  and one of {{item:3020}} {{item:3047}}  depending on what is needed more that game.\n\nSomething to remember is that while his W drains his health, it also provides him with tenacity.

Sunfire and Spirit Visage are core. After that you generally build tank items depending on what you need.
