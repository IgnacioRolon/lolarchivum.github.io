It basically comes down to whichever team has the most bots on their side. Though, I did literally play a game with all bots but me and had a bit of fun with Malzahar. Still, it's stupid. Can we also just take a second to appreciate how depreciated and unappriciated TT is? It makes me sad.\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-15T08:19:16.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just dont want it to become the next dominion.  its the only thing my roomates and i play together","replies":[]}]}]}
