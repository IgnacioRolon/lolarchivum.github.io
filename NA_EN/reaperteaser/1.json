Take kalista, for example, she had wards that roamed the map about 8 times, she got her own personal smite that she can use on the whole enemy team, greatest kiting you can get in the game, she can peel for herself as long as her support is near her, she can reposition the support saving them or initiating a teamfight, and she also had damage when she was strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForFoxSakes","date":"2016-12-29T22:56:09.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldnt put Elise in there. Having a lot of abilities doesnt necessarily mean it's overloaded. Overloaded is when their abilities overcome a huge amount of weaknesses that a champ should have so there's little counterplay\n\nIE Yasuo's weakness would be a non tanky melee. Normally at a deficit against ranged and skillshots to poke, but overcome by windwall and nonstop dashes to gapclose and dodge shots. Normally being non tanky, most melee cant stand their own against bruisers or tanks, but he has natural armor pen and his passive amplifies his lifesteal to huge amounts. Against other high damage carries, he outscales them with 100% crit or outlasts them with double lifesteal. Doesnt leave much counterplay left. He also has an engage/disengage with Q knockup\n\nCamille is the same. Has truedamage, lifesteal, slow, gapcloser, wall hop, stun and makes an impassible zone. AKA can take on anything and anyone\n\nChamps should more be like rock paper scissors where some champs are weak to some and strong over others so a good team comp covers as many weaknesses as possible. You get overloaded shit when you have a shotgun that solo blows away everything in a rock paper scissors game","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-30T00:22:31.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wasn't necessarily saying elise is overloaded, she was just an example of a champ who has more than just 4 castable spells and a passive, which is what i consider to be on par when it comes to champ kits.  think, the difference between morgana (4 castable abilities and a passive) and nid (6 castable abilities, a form change and a passive).  i was just including the champs who have more things they can do as compared to the rest of roster.\n\nand with that deffinition of overloaded, is it that the champs in question are strong against the current meta? or that their inherent weakness is is too difficult to exploit?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2016-12-29T22:44:54.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"depends on the kit, there is no set example","replies":[]}]}
