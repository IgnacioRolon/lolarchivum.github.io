Since he enjoys this so much i decided to make it his passive.  Introducing ghe first ever champ who can cut the grass (kinda like a reverse ivern). Another bit of that passive is ~~stealing~~ picking up and keeping whatever was in those pots or in that shrub, such as arrows, bombs, extra rupees ect, so im going to give him an ammo system.  As for his auto attacks, he likes to slash at stuff with the master sword and shoot stuff with arrows, he will switch back and forth between melee and ranged.  His kit will be very reminiscent of the smash bros games, with a (mostly) complete arsenal at his disposal, using all of his most iconic tools.\n\n**Abilities:**\npassive:  enemie minions will periodically spawn holding pots over their heads, whenever link last hits one of these minions or slashes the grass, they will drop loot at random.  the loot includes bombs, arrows and extra rupees, additionally the lower links ammo is, the higher the drop chance is for that particular ammo type.\n\n-Melee form-\nQ:  &quot;Shield&quot;  no cost.  20/18/16/14/12 second CD.  range: personal.  effect lasts for as long as the key is held down.  link crouches down and holds up his shield in the direction of the cursor blocking 25/30/35/40/45% of incoming damage.  does not block cc and CD starts when the ability ends.\n\nW:  &quot;Whirlwind Slash&quot; no cost to 100 mana.  13 CD at all levels.  range 100 to 175 units.  link charges the mastersword with mana then unleashes a deadly spin attack dealing 100/120/130/140/150 + up to 100% of bonus AD as physical damage.  link can move while charging at 40% move speed.\n  Additionally this ability can chop down tall grass and drop loot for link to pick up.  the grass will regrow after 2 minutes.\n\nE:  \"Combat Roll\"  no cost.  7/6/5/4/3 second CD.  link rolls a short distance\n\nR:  &quot;Archery Training&quot;  link starts with one point in this ability.  no cost.  arrow capacity 10/30/50.  link will change his auto attack to ranged ,which will use up his ammo, and his Q, W, and E abilities. once link is out of arrows he will not be able to auto attack until he either gains more or switches back to melee.\n\n-Ranged form-\nQ:  &quot;Boomerang&quot;  skillshot.  20/25/30/35/40 mana.  10/9/8/7/6 second CD.  range 800 units.  link throws his boomerang stunning enemies for .1/.2/.3/.4/.5 seconds and dealing 30/45/60/75/90 + 20% of total AD as physical danage, then returning to link after reaching max range dealing the same damage and applying the same cc on the way back (enemy champions can be stunned twice by this ability)\n\nW: &quot;Bomb Toss&quot;  1/2/3/4/5 ammo capacity.  40 mana at all levels.  24/21/18/15/12 CD.  700 range.  100 unit radius aoe.  link pulls out a bomb from his bomb bag and throws it.  the bomb takes 3.5 seconds to explode dealing 180 + 60% of bonus AD physical damage and can be auto attacked within that time to move it in the direction it was hit.\n\nE:  \"Hookshot\" cost 120 mana. 25/22/19/16/13 second CD. range 1000 units. link fires his hookshot and pulls himself to any turrain or enemy champion hit. if this hits an enemy champion they are rooted for .5 seconds.\n\nR: (switch back to melee)","replies":[{"poster":"Vanic998","date":"2017-04-28T03:55:39.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive seems like it involves some RNG.
