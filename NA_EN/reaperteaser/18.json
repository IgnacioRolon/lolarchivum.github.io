But Ignite and exhaust don't give any options for improvements.","replies":[{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2016-12-26T01:57:48.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could allow Exhaust to carry a second charge.  They could make Exhaust even more severe for the same duration.\n\nThey could make heal work like Redemption's Active.  They could make heal also give back some Mana like Clarity for ARAM.  They could make heal also break a CC.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to supercharge an item.  Being viable and not totally broken would become the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-26T02:35:40.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"theres plenty ways to make viable options for those, and really makes you have to think about your summoners.  giving a support/dmg/tanky/other mode for each would be nice. i just get tired of champs always rotating through the same eight items depending on whats more powerfull atm","replies":[]}]}]}]}
