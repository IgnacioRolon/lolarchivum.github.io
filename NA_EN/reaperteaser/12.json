Allies heal when attacking enemies you&rsquo;ve marked with movement-impairing effects will.\r\n\r\nBond of Stone feels pretty underwhelming at the moment. It&rsquo;s not incredibly weak per se, but its strength is pretty invisible. Keystone Masteries are supposed to impact your playstyle, and to do that, they need more clear success - and failure - cases. The new Stoneborn Pact still delivers on the promise of &ldquo;make allies harder to kill&rdquo;, but in a way that offers more for players to actually do.\r\n\r\nNEW STONE SKIN Gain 5% maximum health\r\n\r\nNEW HEY, LISTEN Your movement impairing effects effects mark enemy champions with an earthen rune that heals other allied champions who basic-attack them for 5 (+2.5% of your maximum health) over 2 seconds.

I made a Leona ragequit a game once simply by nullifying every ult she used. Granted it was that teams fault for only have one engage option","replies":[]}]}]}]}
