It just seems like the file that makes it show up in champ select is missing or something, hopefully, that'll be fixed up in the next patch!\n\nWhich other wards were you missing though? It doesn't look like anything is missing right now other than that BE ward not showing up in the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Yeti987","date":"2017-12-15T01:18:39.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It must just be the BE ward haha. Thanks for the feedback! Just wanted to know if others were having the same issue and it wasn't something I did haha.","replies":[]}]}]}
