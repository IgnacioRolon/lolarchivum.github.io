When Nasus, activate your Q. (around at least two minions/jungle. I used jungle)\r\n2. As you are about to Q a minion (before damage is dealt), quickly switch your target. \r\n3. Your Q animation should now be slow.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-09-04T00:03:55.584+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this report, I looked at this issue before it went live and we thought we squashed it.
