(It will also be in the same direction that this skill was used.)\n\nQ: Burning Hammer- Merin smashes the ground in front of him, doing damage, and slowing all opponent's hit for 2 seconds. After using Burning Hammer, Merin's auto attacks are melee, and apply a burn effect, doing damage over time.\nMana Cost:50/65/80/95/110 Damage:75/95/115/135/155 (+0.3 AD) Slow:10%/20%/30%/40%/50% DoT: 5/15/25/35/45 (per second, over 3 seconds) CD: 9/8/7/6/5\n\nW: Righteous Blade- Merin dashes in the direction that his cursor is facing, doing damage to all targets, but losing 5% of his damage for every enemy hit, up to 25% lost. After using Righteous Blade, Merin's auto attacks are melee, and deal extra true damage.\nMana: 60/65/70/75/80 Damage: 80/85/90/95/100(+0.6 AD) Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 True Damage: 8/16/24/32/40\n\nE: Crushing Cannon- Merin fires a quick traveling, narrow skillshot (think 'Nidalee spear') that does damage to the first target it hits, and reduces their armor by a flat percent. After using Crushing Cannon, Merin's auto attacks are melee, and have a 25% chance to deal double damage per auto.\nMana: 100(all levels) Damage: 30/70/110/150/190 (+1.0 AD) CD: 10(all levels) Armor Reduction: 40%\n\nR: Burst of Perfection- Merin fires a skill shot that flies across the map. Upon reaching a certain point, Merin can reactivate the ability to jump to the skill shot, and, upon landing, does damage in a circle around him.\nMana: 100/90/80 Damage: 100/150/200 (+0.5 AD) CD: 150/130/110\n\nOnce again, I need a suggestion for the lore, and artwork. All reviews are appreciated. Thank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T18:21:34.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope that all makes sense to me!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-15T01:11:07.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pros- Love, love LOVE that Ultimate.  Incredibly cool and fun to fire yourself like a rocket and then teleport to your own skillshot.  His passive is also interesting and unique.  I see it working like Zyra's passive, but all of his abilities turn into his Q/W/E as he stands there for a few seconds before actually dying.  The damage dampening through targets on W is smart and shows you understand some deeper level mechanics of abilities in League.\n\nCons- There is a lot of information missing from this concept.  Intended role, style, themes, etc.  It wasn't clear to me that he was a ranged champion until he uses one of his abilities, and it's even more unclear how long his attacks are melee range before reverting back to long range.","replies":[{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2015-03-16T13:41:31.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I was looking at it, and I realized that I had indeed screwed up quite a bit. His range is 150 in all forms BUT his E, where it is 200. His basic auto attack range is 550(same as Ahri's). Also, each transformation last for 8 seconds. So, in theory, you can stay in a form forever, but it's very mana intensive. I felt that he would be a top lane/mid laner, similar to Jayce. Also, he would probably be played as a kind of bruiser. A build that I thought up would be something like PD, IE, Randuin's, Frozen Heart, Banshee's, and whatever boots are needed. Sorry about that being unclear. Anything else you need to know?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2015-03-14T15:43:30.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lore:\n\nMerin is a mystery to all beings of Runterra, having randomly appeared in Piltover one day, with only the memory of his name with himself. Upon being found by Caitlyn, he was set to work on the police force. Not long after he was admitted to the force, it was discovered that Merin, was, well... perfect. Everything that he did seemed to work out for the best.\n\nAfter one specific raid of a gang that had been growing, Merin found an item that seemed incredibly powerful. A cube shape, it seemed to be a puzzle. For many hours, Merin worked on the puzzle, attempting to discover it's secrets. After a series of attempts, Merin managed to open the cube, and was filled with a magical energy that allowed him to conjure weapons with effects that had yet to be found. Upon mastering the use of  his weapons, Merin set off to join the League of Legends, in an attempt to find out about his past.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthsteele","date":"2015-03-14T08:37:49.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the lore consider something around the topic of him being an ancient being from beyond runeterra kind of like bard.","replies":[]}]}
