I made a mistake with Nexevis, the Hydranic Service. Prepare to be amazed :P\n\nPassive: Earth Power- Every time Domhan is hit, he gains a buff, reducing damage from that target by 50% on the next attack. This effect cannot activate against the same target in the same 30 seconds.\n\nQ: Shard of the Ground- Domhan makes a small area on the ground erupt, summoning an earth shard from the ground, doing damage and slowing all targets hit.\n\nW: Earth Rush- Domhan dashes under the ground, coming up and slowing all targets hit(This is his main escape). If no champions are hit, half of the mana cost is refunded.\n\nE: Dunia Break- Domhan rips the ground apart, creating a small passage with no room at the end to escape. (It's difficult to describe this ability. It's supposed to be a good skill to bring him into the support role, but it works well with his kit as well. Think of it like a walkway with no end. That's basically all it is. No damage, no slows, just a way to prevent movement.)\n\nR: Ulciscere De Terra-  Domhan drags his target into the ground, preventing both targets from being hit, and placing them into a 1v1 situation (Think of it like setting up the Magma Chamber underground.) This effect lasts until one target is dead. The winner pops out of the ground, knocking up any target above him, and doing damage. \n\n\nHis ult is supposed to be the most unique ability in the game, but it's not as strong as it looks. If Domhan loses the 1v1, the trade goes horribly wrong for him and his team. Hehe, Try to find a way to balance that ult RITO.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-24T16:52:32.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely some really cool ideas here!  I like the E a lot.  I think of it more like a hallway-shaped Jarvan Ultimate.  It might be a little too strong for a basic ability, though, depending on the range and size of the box, as well as how long it lasts.\n\nThe ult is also a really neat idea and similar to Jarvan's Cataclysm, but I fear that an instant, on command \"removal\" of an enemy champion is too powerful.  Champions aren't valued on a 1:1 ratio across the game.  Typically the ADC is the most valuable \"target\" so for a support/tanky style champ to be able to nullify the existence of a target of their choice with no counterplay seems too powerful and very un-fun for the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2015-03-24T20:01:06.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the champion's ult has the chance to backfire. It can go wrong. The E is basically the range of half of a Vayne auto. 225 range. The R can hurt your team just as much as the enemies. Also, I could have it be an AoE that throws him and all targets hit into the ground. Maybe have it be a 3v2, or such.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-24T20:17:45.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cilllller,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=KuE6Q1pE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-24T20:01:06.861+0000)\n>\n> Well, the champion's ult has the chance to backfire.

Maybe it could even just be an AoE from around Domhan instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Ciller","date":"2015-03-25T13:23:53.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take that into account.
