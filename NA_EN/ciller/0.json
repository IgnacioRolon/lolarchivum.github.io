However, while actually playing, my ping chills around 150-300 ms.

This could also be due to how your ISP is routing to the game server.  Meaning, even though you can use the net just fine there can still be an issue specifically connecting to us.  \n\nI recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and make sure everything is setup without issue.
