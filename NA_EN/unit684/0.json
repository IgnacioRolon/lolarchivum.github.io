Years ago.  He was never a main of mine, only something I played when I was in the mood, but I still quite enjoyed playing him.  So, I decided to buy a skin for him.  After looking through the available options, I really liked the concept of Hextech Galio, where he was a silver robot with cloth wings.  Kind of a Renaissance Tech feel to him, like a Da Vinci robot or something.  I really dug it.  So I bought that skin and used it on Galio for years.\n\nThen the rework happened.  I actually didn&#039;t mind the gameplay side of it, it looked solid and mostly kept the same feel.  As for the visual aspect, it completely alienated me from Galio and the &quot;gargoyleness&quot; that got me interested in the champ in the first place was gone.  But that&#039;s fine, that&#039;s what skins are for, right?  Except Hextech Galio is now an entirely different skin.  It&#039;s basically just new Galio&#039;s model with a slightly more metallic look, but he&#039;s red for some reason and his wings are blue and electrical now?  It&#039;s a concept that&#039;s entirely separate from what the concept was before.  Not only that, but now it&#039;s barely above a boring recolor.\n\nI bring this up now because I actually just played reworked Galio for the first time and I really missed the old Hextech Galio skin.  So, I&#039;m really curious as to why the skin changed concept so much during the rework.  It&#039;s not like it resembles other Hextech skins now, at least not that I can tell.  Not only did I lose my fav smiting gargoyle, but I lost one of my favorite skins.\n\nEdit:  Added pictures for reference:\n[Old Hextech Galio](http://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Galio_2.jpg)\n[New Hextech Galio](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wYgS20pTWd8/WL79v6rY-xI/AAAAAAAAfWI/rpTsva61n0kL_irODexvSv_VzW-VeqejQCLcB/s640/wp-galio-hextech.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-06-23T12:45:46.705+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"See hextech skin line is getting reworked ever since hextech Annie.  Old hextech had lots of potential, but was badly modeled and had no particles.  With Annie's release, they decided to move away from Renaissance era design to what hextech represents in the world of runeterra.  Ie the electric blue energy, courtesy of skarner's brackern brothers, and bronze/copper parts.  It's essentially supposed to be Piltover galio","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-06-23T13:40:49.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"^This.\n\nIt actually falls in line a lot more with the newer hextech designs and honestly makes more sense to me. Why would something using hextech technology then have cloth wings? Like they could afford a hextech crystal but not better material for cloth?\n\nSorry you dont like new Galio","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wrathof300","date":"2017-06-23T16:54:57.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course with exception of Sion, his hextech skin is more a representation of, if he was brought back with machinery opposed to black magic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot LegendLarry","date":"2017-06-24T01:00:25.769+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Unit684!\n\nRedesigning the skin to be more aligned with the new Hextech theme and shape language was a big factor in the decision. However, one of the goals the team tries to deliver on with skin updates like this is to provide a powerful, aspirational, and compelling alternate fantasy for the champion. The team tried to really drill down and figure out what were the elements of the original skin that would make people want to play with that alternate fantasy. With the update to Galio's personality and story the team felt that this new design best represented what the core elements of the original skin were.\n\nAll that being said that's the intention but I'm interested to hear your thoughts. Was it just the aesthetic design of the original skin that drew you to it or was there something more to it that struck chord for you? Where do you feel we missed the mark? What makes this concept feel like a recolor instead of the intended alternate fantasy?\n\nPersonally, this was one of my favorite skins out of the rework because I'm a fan of the Iron Giant movie and this just sorta fits my fantasy of being able to say, \"I'm Superman\" when I ult to a teammate.\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-06-24T11:04:01.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also love it post rework. I really like how it looks and every aspect of it. It have a nostalgic feel of iron giant and is one of my favorite skins for Galio. Though I see what op means, it is really a big change and it would be awesome to have more of a vintage, Da Vinci, steampunkish feel. But I don't think that would work too great for new Galio. \n\nI com by this to you since I think it is a great concept for a skin for some one like Anivia, instead of Galio.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-06-24T03:43:31.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel you on the shift; it made me very sad too.\nIt was simple yet beautiful before, and had a grace that went with the flight animations.\nUnfortunately for us, ever since Piltover's reboot and Hextech Annie she has become the model around which every single hextech skin shall be molded.\nWhen hextech Anivia goes through the same eventually it'll make me very sad :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-06-24T04:27:19.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still feels renansianinciananincineace like to me because of the robotic parts and stuff.
