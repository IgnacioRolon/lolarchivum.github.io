I get an error as soon as the champion loading screen would normally start before a game. I hit retry, nothing. I hit cancel and it takes me back to the client, urging me to reconnect, I do that and get the same error. I force quit and restart the client and I still get the same error. It's frustrating because I get punished for being afk, when in all reality I'm sitting here doing everything I can to connect. This issue started about a week ago, give or take, and I had just been playing a week before that with no issues at all. If there's something that can be done to fix this, I'd really like to know. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-27T22:10:10.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like your network was having some weird troubles getting a good signal from our game servers for some reason.
