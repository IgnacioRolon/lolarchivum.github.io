Buff a little bit please.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:76}} \r\nEveryone knows that Nidalee is not very strong right now. She has to get first blood or a couple early kills to be useful at all. If she gets counter jungled by Yi, WW, Xin, Kha, Rengar, Camile, Graves, or even a Tryn at lvl 2 (at red buff or scuddle) she cannot fight them and gets far behind. \r\nYes, I know that if she is buffed to much she is abused in higher elo. That is why she is not getting buffed. Like Azir, Ryze, Kalista, Syndra etc.\r\n\r\nHere is my proposal. In her champion description is says that she is very territorial. &quot;She viciously defends her territory.&quot;\r\nLets give her buff similar to Skarner&#039;s buff if he is near his crystals. If Nidalee takes a camp there would be a circle a little smaller than Skarner&#039;s where Nidalee would get a movement speed and an adaptive damage buff. These circles would be slightly bigger for bigger buffs like red, blue, baron, dragon, and would not include scuddle because there&#039;s already a move speed buff on it. \r\nThis would help her counter jg and make it more scary for people to counter jg her, because she will be stronger in her own jg most of the time.\r\nAlso maybe a slight buff on her heal on other allies. It really does not do much at all. Maybe buff up the ratio for allies to 25% more than it does now. Nidalee players should not feel like it is just a waste of mana to heal a teammate. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"WindLord7070","date":"2018-06-25T20:18:48.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's supposed to be getting a mini rework soon to help her lane again.

This is another champion that needs a complete Rework. Season 8 just isnt AD friendly. Trap placment reduced to only one with a extreamly uncalled for CD on it . \n\nIt provided vision and the new runes allow over 20 wards/ghost wards and Poro wards to on the board at one time, to still sit there and agree that her traps shouldnt be brought back or rework shouldnt happen is unbelievable, to know they were making changes that have single handly taken ADC's out of the game AND still havnt reversed the changes or thinking about it.\n\nReminds me of when Relic Sheild {{item:3302}} {{item:3302}}  Double bot lane or any lane for that matter Sigle Handely eliminated junglers for 2 straight weeks _!!!_\n\nWas that looked into? Was that reversed or nerfed YES, now what the hell is going on in this game and Nidalee is just another casualty of bad game mechanics for 3 seasons straight now, ever since the nerf .....\n\nMY2cents. \n\nIf you want changes to happen to Nadilee , they have to fix ADC's first!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alex Luu","date":"2018-06-25T17:58:37.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the literal skarner skill copy would be abusive in higher elo, it’s funny you say you know but then ask for a buff that’d obviously be abused? the healing buff in’t that needed since nidalees who heal teammates usually go Athene’s. Just ask for them to re-implement the root into her traps. since the game is starting to re-implement champion skills anyways,like rengar. We could even halve the old root time from when it used to root and add a decaying slow after the root... or even forget the root altogether and have it just be a decaying slow with a small DoT effect like fizz’s passive. But that’d mean buffing nidalee’s mark as well, which would mean riot will have to really work on this...which they probably dont want to do until a future rework probably....see the issue?","replies":[{"poster":"webstar1995","date":"2018-06-25T18:20:35.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The root is what made her clear too good. Koreans would be lvl 11 while mid and top would be lvl9 or 10.\n\nHow would the Skarner copy be op? It's without the attack speed too. In every elo she can easily be countered. That is her problem. Why play Nidalee when she is not only harder to play, but not as strong as Eve. Same goes for Elise (she is not strong either)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2018-06-25T19:12:04.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shes in an okay spot right now.
