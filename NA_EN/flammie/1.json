I'm wondering if there's any way to get this off my account? I'm not sure if i got reported because of it but i find it kind of unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T21:25:38.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a player disconnects from a match, it will negatively impact all players in the match, even if the disconnection was not intentional. This is one of the reasons why the Leaverbuster system treats all leaves equally and why penalties cannot be modified. The only way to work off the queue timers is to play games consistently without disconnecting.
