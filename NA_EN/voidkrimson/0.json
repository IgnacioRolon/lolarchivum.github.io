I got bugsplated. Is this supposed to happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T02:08:23.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Remake system penalizes whoever caused the remake, and in this instance, it sounds like that was you. Essentially what happens is if anyone in the match is marked as *inactive* for 90+ seconds within the first 3 minutes, it will prompt a remake. If that remake vote passes, when it becomes available at 3:00, the player who caused the remake will receive a loss penalty (if ranked) and can move them up the Leaverbuster penalty track.\n\nIn this situation, it looks like your bugsplat caused your inability to connect to the match, which triggered a Remake and due to a recent trend of disconnections on your account, you received a 5-game penalty. Regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts *everyone in the match*. This is why all disconnections are treated equally and why we cannot remove or modify penalties.\n\nI'd recommend working through our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to ensure your system drivers and hardware are in good standing, since these issues are often caused by those factors. If you still encounter bugsplats after through those steps, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
