The content of the code, however, can sometimes become available to be purchased in the store.\n>\n>    **Note:** *While some websites or individuals sell Riot code cards on the Internet, they are almost always doing so with fraudulent intent (i.e. those codes are usually redeemed, expired or stolen). As we do not support 3rd party re-sellers, please avoid buying stuff from Internet Strangers!

Some of our older code cards did not have expiration dates, however in order to prevent fraud, we have retired all codes created before **April 2014**. If you have a code card that you got before **April 2014**, you will not be able to redeem it in the store.\n>\n> Recent code cards (e.g. Arctic Ops Varus, Riot Fist Bump Ward Skin) have a distinct expiration date and must be redeemed by that date.\n>\n> If you have an older code card (from before April 2014) and can provide us with [the information that we normally request in these situations](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202801810-Code-Cards-FAQ#h1q4), we should be able to help you out, provided that you can submit all the required information to us before **July 23rd 2014**.\n\n---\n\nRelated: PAX Sivir and TF aren't the same skin, but are handled the same way.\n\n---\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=xEAwLHAb,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-02T17:25:24.217+0000)\n>\n> This is correct. \n> \n> There is currently no way to obtain the PAX Sivir skin.\n\n---\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=xEAwLHAb,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-03-02T22:23:23.511+0000)\n>\n> Unfortunately, we don't hand PAX Sivir out at conventions anymore either.

I've never actually seen an official comment on this, but I wouldn't doubt it.  The skins are specific references to Penny Arcade intellectual property, and they are named after the expo.","replies":[]}]}]}
