Well I did, in fact a lot of times, but then i tried checking out if something was wrong with the server so i checked the server status but nothing seemed to be going wrong with that.Then i swapped to the EUW server to try logging into another account of mine and i successfully did. It seems like i cant find a way to connect to my EUNE account for 2 days now , not knowing what else to do. I've typed my password and username too many times , restarted my pc too, but it is fairly obvious that the message will never leave :( .
