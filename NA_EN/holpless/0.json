I got stuck with teemo support (Guy intentionally came in the game trying to troll) I gave him a chance thinking it wasn&#039;t going to be bad. He then watched me die. &lt;Keep this in mind. I will repeat later because I know you league of legends players like to change subject alot. He watched me die. He was trolling. We were both in lane and he watched me die. He was trolling. Then I proceeded to tell the enemy ADC that my support is trolling. Do you know what the enemy adc responds with? &quot;You&#039;re just bad&quot;. I started to rage. This troll teemo turned my entire team against me. And then I was perma banned for it? Should I start doing this? Should I just troll all my life on league making people waste their time but make sure I don&#039;t type at all? Because there&#039;s no trolling option for reporting someone. I think I will do that...","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-08-11T22:17:29.663+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"You weren't banned for a troll teemo.\n\n3 games were given in your reform card. In addition to this, you have had 2x 10-game chat restrictions, a 25-game chat restriction and a 14-day ban before this ban. They were all in a short period of time. Many things were considered in your penalty, and you were given many chances.\n\nTeemo was not trolling you.

You raged on your team and the enemy team then went AFK. You can try to lie but its pretty obviously, also the teemo has a much better score than you and didn't take your cs. From what I can tell you BOTH died(he didn't just watch he died too, also before you did) and then you went back into lane and died not even 2 minutes later. After that, you went AFK and lost your team the game. I'm not saying he wasn't a troll, but you did rage and then went AFK which is why you got banned and deserved to get banned","replies":[{"poster":"HolpLess","date":"2016-08-11T20:44:16.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"u cannot tell me he didnt troll. you were not in the game. he definately trolled. how come i never see a teemo support in high elo? oh right because its considered a troll pick. now hmu in game if u want some tips on how to have a good KDA","replies":[{"poster":"ntbcool","date":"2016-08-11T21:02:17.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"? also can't tell he did troll and why should I believe you on it?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wonderlands","date":"2016-08-10T17:06:28.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:17}} \"You're just bad.\"","replies":[{"poster":"HolpLess","date":"2016-08-11T20:45:06.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=HolpLess this says otherwise","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-11T22:51:38.138+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you hope to achieve?

I will repeat later because I know you league of legends players like to change subject alot\"\nThanks for giving us credit, man I really sympathi.... Yasuo has too much mobility...... Yeah no, you've lost whatever sympathy I might have had. Now it's time to dissect your little post.\n\n\"He was trolling\" \"He was trolling\" again... Yeah we get it, you think he's trolling. Then you proceed to ask the _enemy_ (not exactly your friend) if he is indeed seeing what you are seeing. He offers no sympathy as he's just got a free lane and possibly a free win, yet you proceed to flip your lid. That was mistake number 1 and 2 in all honesty.\n\n\"This troll teemo turned my entire team against me. And then I was perma banned for it?\" You also didn't get perma-banned from one offence unless you went all out. I expect nothing but suicide challenges and racial slurs out the butt no doubt right? Hahaha no... You knew very well that your ban was coming yet you refused to change how you compose yourself in games. Sounds like you deserved it man, not to be rude but yea, I can't put it any nicer way. (More or less mistakes 3-5 here)\n\nBut hey, let's just take a look at the whole picture here cause why not. You're likely where you're supposed to be ranked wise coming in at a 49% winrate over 400ish games, so getting crazy upset about one loss is really childish and unnecessary. You are still in the silver elo range so trolls/unskilled players are all over the place, but getting incredibly upset at them is pretty much the worst thing you can do. This is, if you want to win... or climb. \n\nSo it sounds like you got two or possibly three options here. Hope to god that riot will accept a ban repeal and either clean your act up and start fresh so to speak. You could also go make a new account and try again, if you show some more respect to others not only will you climb easier, but you also won't get so messed up if you lose a game to a troll or a feeder. Or finally you could just leave league. You could move on to COD, WOW, Smite, Dota, etc, etc. But keep one thing in mind. Outside of COD they have much more serious punishments and much less tolerant banning systems. \n\nWhatever you decide to do is up to you, but I do wish you the best. It's obvious you have some little demons to work out, but once you do everything will be easier and more enjoyable.
