And the longer the game progressed, the greater the opportunity cost of wasting an inv slot on the offchance they'd need it. \n\nNow instead of pink wards she's soft countered by any AOE or DoT ability, which makes her flicker and vulnerable to skillshots, and outright countered by tether abilities like Karma's E (?) or Kled's Q, which make her straight out targetable in shroud. Which ones do you think are more common, wards or AOE/DoT/tethers? \n\nThat's why I hate it when people act like the pink ward thing was a buff to her.
