I posted here earlier about [Riot punishing me for defending an enemy who was being bullied](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/81jphEp1-punished-for-defending-an-enemy-who-was-being-bullied-by-his-team-riot-advises-to-not-defend-him) (contains the full chat logs), and I&#039;ve since received an update from the support. They found the punishment correct and didn&#039;t lift it or restore my honor level:\n\n&gt; Hey there,\n&gt; \n&gt; After the investigation we have concluded the fact that you were continuously spamming the chat throughout the game which can create a very disruptive game experience for the players witnessing the chat.\n&gt; \n&gt; For future reference, please do bear in mind that we only take into account what you say, as all players are responsible for their own behavior. You don&#039;t have to retaliate as you can just mute the toxic players and report them in the post game lobby where they will be audited by the system and punished. I can&#039;t comment on other players accounts as I can only discuss each account with its owner, but if you report toxic players they will be audited and issued a punishment if found guilty.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the future instead of getting into arguments with players even if you want to defend others its better to mute those players and report them in the post game lobby.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have any other concerns don&#039;t hesitate to let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Player Support Specialist\n&gt; &quot;Surprise! I&#039;m back&quot;\n\nLuckily for me this was just a chat restriction, but what makes it worrying is the fact that knowing how the 4-step punishment system works, this could&#039;ve just as well been a permanent ban. The way I see it, **talking too much can result into a permanent ban**. Not only that, but their policies are what I wouldn't hesitate to call inhumane. They are encouraging me not to defend those who are being bullied, even after a further review from them.\n\nHonestly, I have no words left, the system is legit broken. If they can punish anyone for whatever reason they want and just claim it was &quot;spamming too much&quot;, what&#039;s the point anymore? And it saddens me that in no way did they acknowledge the fact that I did my best trying to help someone who was being bullied.\n\nJust wanted to let you guys know that this wasn&#039;t a mistake, and the chat logs weren&#039;t the wrong ones like a few people assumed. Honestly, compared to this, I now wish the logs had been wrong.\n\n**Edit:** Someone was kind enough to find the game from my history: https://i.imgur.com/h6f38fv.png\n\nA lot of people were saying that it's because I was typing more than playing, but I believe the picture proves that I was doing quite a lot of playing. Most of my typing was done during me running from my own base to their side of the map, since that's where all the action was happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2018-03-12T23:18:49.816+0000","up_votes":140,"down_votes":97,"body":"I'd have given you a chat restriction if I was hand reviewing this case (which is what the system gave you).\n\nThe enemy top laner said 'open top' and gave you kills, which is not ok.

I was a fed trynd and I could dive him in two seconds, it would be stupid of him to stay top all the time since he got zero help from his team. So he visited mid and tried to farm top as much as he could. He still probably shouldn't have said it, you're right, but I do understand his frustration.\n\n> Then they say to report top for giving up.

How about his team never ganking or helping him, or his jungler giving me early double buff, by your logic does that not justify him being tilted and say \"open top\"?

Using it, not using it, sacrificing small animals to it under the light of the full moon, none of these things change the nature of your behavior. We encourage them to _**MUTE, REPORT, MOVE ON**_ because that's the healthiest thing for _them_.\n\nI've been scratching my head trying to come up with a good way to explain what went sideways here. I believe you when you say you had good intentions and I will support anyone who chooses to defend against toxicity, _**as long as they do so in a way that does not also add to toxicity**_. I think what Tantram is trying to say is that all that chat - _all that arguing_ - can be seen as harassment. In this case, it clearly was, given that you were reported by others in the match. They carried through on the REPORT part of the mantra just as they were supposed to when faced with something they didn't like. \n\nYeah, it was \"only\" a 10-game chat restriction, but my experience is that people who ignore the underlying problem that got them that restriction generally end up having more problems. The other players in that match didn't like what you were doing and expressed themselves with the best voice they have. You might want to think about that.","replies":[{"poster":"mah1foo","date":"2018-03-13T01:17:16.019+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":">  as long as they do so in a way that does not also add to toxicity.

By the same guys who flamed Darius.\n\n>  The other players in that match didn't like what you were doing and expressed themselves with the best voice they have.

Again, this means absolutely nothing. It's hard to take the reports seriously when they come in the form of \"you fucking idiot are reported for trolling with this noob darius\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-03-13T01:58:19.934+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":19,"body":">You surely aren't suggesting that the deciding factor in whether I'm toxic or not is whether people reported me or not?\n\nNope.

Why do you think you're being mostly downvoted? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying your opinion is a lot less popular and surely people shouldn't be punished for not breaking the rules, but doing things against your opinion.\n\n> A 10-game chat restriction is the gentlest reminder that you should contemplate your behavior and the ways in which it was inconsistent with the community.

At the end of the day, _you_ could have muted instead of responding - it doesn't matter if anyone else could or did.

To pull from Wikipedia, flaming is defined as:\n\n> [Flaming is **a hostile and insulting interaction between persons over the Internet**, often involving the use of profanity. It can also be the swapping of insults back and forth or with many people teaming up on a single victim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet))\n\nAnd I don't think that calling people morons or wishing for them to be banned is exactly benevolent, so I'd personally say that, yes, you were flaming.\n\nEspecially considering that you even admit:\n\n> Not only was this _in the post game lobby after only the flamers remained to discuss with me_, so it's irrelevant for my method of defending the victim earlier on in-game, but I also find it normal to wish that flamers get banned.\n\nYou lingered around in the post-game lobby to fight with them even further. Unfortunately for you, that qualifies as flaming. You could have just as easily reported each of them for harassment, not said a word, and been on your way, but you took the extra step and went out of your way to insult and attack them after the match was over and you were the only ones left.\n\nI can get coming to a person's defense (within reason), but really, what you did was just plain low.","replies":[{"poster":"mah1foo","date":"2018-03-13T01:00:06.734+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm on mobile so I'll just answer the things I completely disagree on.\n\n> At the end of the day, you could have muted instead of responding\n\nAs I've explained elsewhere, me muting the flamers does nothing for the victim.

I didn't stay to fight or flame anyone, I stayed to explain to people why I believed Darius wasn't trolling, and what really happened on the toplane. Yes, I may have called someone a moron after they went all-in on me, and that was a mistake. But I didn't \"take an extra step to insult and attack them\", I slipped a bad word in between. I'm sure you would change your mind if the Rioter showed the whole discussion, including what the other guys were saying of me and Darius. Moron is still a relatively nice word :)\n\n> I can get coming to a person's defense (within reason), but really, what you did was just plain low.\n\nYeah, calling someone a moron is extremely low after they wish cancer on you. Well no, honestly I don't remember any exact words, but trust me when I say that \"moron\" was a mild word. And again, I did the best I could in that situation.

Let a few bad apples just mess everything up, meanwhile the rest of us are to sit quietly, report, and ignore the problem and HOPE a punishment comes through. People who aren't doing shit get irritated too. We don't like constantly dealing with shit heads who get to do and say ridiculous crap on the possibility that they'll get banned. We can outcast these guys all we want ingame, but they're still on the team; its not like we can just remove them completely out of any game.  I'm sure there are plenty of Rioters who aren't so even keel, and they'd get as defensive as some of us who are attacked by the initiation caused by someone else.\n\nRestricting this guy is completely unfair. You guys completely ignore the fact that he was initially the victim. The cause of his frustration was triggered by a teammate who purposely went out of their way to ruin the experience of 4, no 9 other players. Imagine you're playing 5v5 basketball. Your teammate keeps missing shots, so he says fuck it, and proceeds to take the only ball and stand out of bounds with the ball. What ya gonna do, go tell somebody, or maybe youre irritated and decide youre gonna take care of that shit yourself. While in League, we can still play 4v5, but the point is that the player completely disrupted the entire flow of the game. 4v5 is for people who think they have shit to prove, when I start this game up, I expect 5v5 start to finish. sometimes tensions get high and we just can't hold it on. I'm lucky not to be restricted yet, but theres been a few times where a teammate would verbally abuse me first, and I've retorted. 95% of the time I can mute, that last 5% I snap out is because I've had to be verbally abused multiple  times in back to back games and it comes to a boiling point. \n\nI try to believe that Riot have some sense on behavioral matters in League, but this post just shows me you guys expect us to just sit and get fucked over by other players and wait for you guys to come in like were children or something.

A ban for this, communication, light argument, discussion, whatever you can logically label it as. The guy had a 7kda so he was not negatively impacting gameplay in any way that could not be dealt with at any time, by anyone in game(mute). And his words are not bad enough to be labeled as toxic. He legit was defending someone from some actual toxic people. \n\nAnd last, I know I used the word ban when it is a chat restriction. What happens if he gets a few more? Yep, ban.

If you wanted to really further nail it down, you could have just outwardly called out the mf and said \"just stop trying to bully them.

It&#x27;s just a game, to me that&#x27;s nothing compared to legit bullying and calling people by some of the worst slurs available.\n> \n\nIt doesn't look like you stood up for someone who got called \"some of the worst slurs available\" it only looks like you were addressing inting so what you say now doesn't match what your chat log reflects.\n\n> You interpret this wrong, it was the enemy jungler who asked something along the lines of &quot;if you were in a game where your teammate went 0/3 and then changed lane and refused to go top, wouldn&#x27;t you report him for trolling?&quot;, to which I answered in this very hypothetical scenario that I would rather report my jungler who flames. I don&#x27;t think it breaks any rules to say that I would report a jungler who flames his teammates for dying, right? So even here I&#x27;m still defending the darius against his teammates arguments.\n\nFair enough on the jungling hypothetical.\n\nHowever, the rest of the game you were still arguing with MF. What was the point of that? If you have a constructive conversation like we are having in trying to figure out what the problem is and how to best address it, then it's going to have a point.\n\nYou addressed that you didn't think the enemy was inting. You stood up to the bully. You don't need to change the bully's mind on what happened. Remember, bullying is HOW they express themselves to others, not what they think. If that MF just thought to herself \"ugh, that enemy is feeding\" but never typed anything, that's not bullying and you wouldn't have had to type anything.\n\nYou are trying to do a good thing and partake in collectively getting rid of anti-social behavior in the LOL community. I'm not saying stop doing it, I'm saying adjust how you do it because the best way is that you do just enough work to get a positive result. Even if your response isn't that one golden moment where the toxic person realizes they shouldn't be toxic, just contribute to it and stay a positive force in the LOL community.\n\nYour heart is in the right place, we just have to help you refine your method. My advice is to be short and sweet and not waste your time and energy into someone who doesn't want to change at that specific time and moment. Eventually, the sum of their experiences will be what changes them, especially online.","replies":[{"poster":"mah1foo","date":"2018-03-12T20:28:12.104+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do 100% agree that my method wasn't the best available even if my intentions were, and I've already learned in the previous thread how to act next time :) Thanks for your words still.\n\n> So if your MF was flaming the enemy, why was it necessary to go in all chat for that long?\n\nBecause she wasn't the only one, enemies were flaming too. If MF and enemies are gang flaming him in the all chat, that's where I feel like I should defend him. This would've been much cleaner if it was one guy flaming him, but it was literally three enemies and MF from my team.\n\n> It doesn't look like you stood up for someone who got called \"some of the worst slurs available\" it only looks like you were addressing inting so what you say now doesn't match what your chat log reflects.\n\nYeah but he was being called a retard and whatnot _because_ they said he's trolling and inting. Which he wasn't. If they say \"wow report this retard inter\", I say that they got it wrong and he's not inting. The only reason they call him by slurs is because they think he's inting.\n\n> However, the rest of the game you were still arguing with MF. What was the point of that? If you have a constructive conversation like we are having in trying to figure out what the problem is and how to best address it, then it's going to have a point.\n\nI wanted to teach him that not everyone who dies is an evil inter. Maybe she'll remember it next game and maybe she'll be the next guy to stand between the bully and the victim. Unlikely, but I can dream.\n\nBut yeah again, I agree that my method wasn't perfect. I still don't agree with Riot's punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"DummyTroll","date":"2018-03-13T12:44:45.300+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Toxicity is the degree to which a chemical substance or a particular mixture of substances can damage an organism\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity#Etymology\n\nAt some point, a Rioter decided to use that word (the adjective) for another purpose.
