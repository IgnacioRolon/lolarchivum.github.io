Same exact thing happened to my friend a few times throughout the day.  This just isnt fun,  adding more time waiting for an already long champ select and then punishing us for server issues on their end.  This is not okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T17:16:02.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes during champ select are most often caused by your client losing its connection to the server. Most of the time, this is caused by problematic local network settings that conflict with League. I strongly suggest taking a look at the steps inside our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first action in resolving the issue.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
