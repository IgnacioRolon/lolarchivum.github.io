Just played 3 games in a row no issue, all is fine, from queue to post game screen. Queue up for an Aram, and I click accept when it pops,  Boom my client instantly crashes and I have to force close before even seeing the champ select screen, and Im slapped with a 15 minute wait. That is complete and utter bullshit, and entirely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T17:41:26.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be some file corruption specifically with ARAM that's failing to render properly.  I recommend using our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot this, as well as downloading our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) incase any repairs are needed.
