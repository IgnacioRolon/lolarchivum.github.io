Im hard wired into 1gb/s internet   however for about a week now, Im getting miserable frame drops   Prior to this I would run between 320fps and 400fps no matter what was happening in game,   now Im running at about 330fps average but sporadically dropping to 19,  always 19 or 20  every maybe 30 seconds and it causes the screen to lock up and crash,  its making me take tower shots and die without even knowing WTF happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T02:58:56.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, it's possible this issue is being caused by the Windows Game Bar, which includes a *Game DVR* feature that has been causing low FPS and game crashes for certain players.
