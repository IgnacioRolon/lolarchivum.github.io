Make sure to feed to well so it can grow up into a big and strong 1920x1080 resolution ^_^!\n\nFor real though, I'm guessing that your settings may have been changed somehow and it's making your game open in a tiiiiiiiny resolution. Let's try resetting your config settings by going to your League install location, and deleting the Config folder. Once that's done it'll reset your game settings and you should be back at the normal resolution. Hit me back if that's not helping though!","replies":[{"poster":"AGNDAAPOK","date":"2017-05-11T23:27:47.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a true legend, thanks bud!","replies":[]}]}]}
