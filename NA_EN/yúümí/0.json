Your client is on the wrong patch, so it's failing to get you in-game with everyone else.  If a restart didn't help you can download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a Force Repatch.  Alternatively, the following manual steps might help as well:\n\nLocate LeagueClientSettings.yaml within C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen it with a text editor (such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Notepad++) and find gameflow-patcher-lock. It should have a number there.\nChange the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\nSave the file.\nRestart the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"drunkriver","date":"2017-05-24T19:47:51.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check server you have checked in log in screen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"drunkriver","date":"2017-05-24T19:48:13.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have exactly the same problem.","replies":[]}]}
