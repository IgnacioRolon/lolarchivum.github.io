In both cases I was attacked for playing Teemo mid and instead of responding in kind I politely explained why I enjoy playing Teemo mid and moved on. When toxicity continued to be directed at me I calmly told my abuser that I would be reporting them and continued to play my best, once again without lashing out in response. In one of the two games another player ragequit and sat in base when I refused to surrender and I asked others to report him for ragequitting. Is any of what I did in violation of the rules or am I missing something? I&#039;m just very confused about why I was chat restricted and if I don&#039;t know what exactly I did wrong I have no way of knowing what not to do again. Please let me know so I can work on whatever needs improvement. I will attach the in game chat log as a word document just in case you can&#039;t access it. Thank you.\n\n\nUntitled document.docx (9157 Bytes)\nJENNY711\nMarch 3rd 2018, 9:17:36 pm\nHey there,\n\nCertainly. I can explain to you why your account received a 25 game chat restriction. I actually agree a lot of your beginning chat was pretty positive and you handled their negativity pretty well. However, it eventually got to a point where it was sort like retaliation almost. When you say you are going to report them, that&#039;s the same as saying you&#039;re going to punish them. In this case, you were going to report them for their negativity directed towards you. Pretty much we don&#039;t want players retaliating. I do recommend that you mute them and report them but there isn&#039;t any reason to call it out. These things just aren&#039;t nice to say. Whether they are true or not, this only makes things worse, not better. In addition, towards the end of the game, there was a lot of calling others other for their negativity. Chat is really only there to communicate strategies in a civil manner.\n\nI understand other players can be negative or provocative but being negative in chat wasn&#039;t the right way to handle the situation. A chat restriction is more a nudge that this kind of behavior isn&#039;t very respectful and is out of line. It also means it might be best that you use chat more conservatively, mute players instead of responding, and focus on yourself and your own gameplay. If you feel the need to respond to their negativity, take a moment to recognize if what you&#039;re about to say will help the team or create a bigger rift. If you&#039;re not sure, it might be best to say nothing instead.\n\nMy hope is that you mute those players and report them instead of responding to them. If you&#039;d like more tips on how to prevent further penalties, let me know!\n\nI hope this helps. Good luck!\n\nJenny711\nPlayer Support Specialist\n&quot;Let my blade speak the law&quot;\n\nI&#039;m still super confused though.   Riot support said that &quot;When you say you are going to report them, that&#039;s the same as saying you&#039;re going to punish them&quot; and that my saying I would report them led to my chat restriction, but in this post: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/PzY1ArN3-we-dont-ban-people-for-asking-for-reports   A Riot employee says that asking for reports isn&#039;t a bannable offence and that it will only flag the system if it leads to harassment.  That seems to directly conflict with what I was told by Riot support and furthermore I don&#039;t see how anything I said or did can be called harassment.    The other players in the game were bombarding me with toxicity and I was responding to the parts of it that made enough sense such as (&quot;Teemo doesn&#039;t belong mid&quot;),  that I thought a logical reply might calm them down.  I didn&#039;t want to mute them all because muting chat impairs teamwork and I want to win.
