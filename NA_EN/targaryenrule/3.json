In game, my mouse keeps getting really jumpy and it's really hard to hit skill shots and farm. I notice it more when im making small movements and it seems to only happen while in game. I thought my mouse was broke so i bought a new mouse and pad today but im still having issues. Anyone know what it could be? It could be happening when im not playing league too i just don't notice because it woulnt effect much because they are just tiny movements. Its kinda like my mouse movement isn't consistent everytime.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T00:37:29.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which mouse/mice are you using and are you using any software to configure your mouse sensitivity or settings?","replies":[{"poster":"TargaryenRule","date":"2016-12-27T00:43:27.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was using logitech but the one i just bought today is microsoft... nah i dont use any software for it, just auto install through wizard thing","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T21:31:58.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha. Since this persisted through two different mice, it's possible this is caused by a background program. I'd recommend [**performing a clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to ensure no background apps are at play here.\n\nLet me know if this caused any noticeable change for your mouse.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
