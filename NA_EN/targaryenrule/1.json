I played a normal blind pick game and then after the game ended which ran perfectly fine I clicked on either collection or store (not sure which one at this point of frustration) but my game popped up with that message so I closed the client tried to re-login and was still popping up. I restarted my pc and its still happening. I'm browsing the internet and can play other games online SO I am DEFINITLY connected to the internet. It doesn't even let you click on the settings tab on the top right to attempt a repair or anything. Very frustrating what is going on Riot?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TargaryenRule","date":"2016-12-08T02:10:51.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what happened, but i downloaded that hextech repair tool and ran it, i was able to log in now. i ended up with a new client desktop logo to.
