I just lost my series because it happened and i couldn't get my pick in before it came back. I've been having this issue for quite some time, it happens very inconsistently, but enough to cause issues and really frustrate me. When i lose 3 lp, it's not a huge deal but losing a series game for it is annoying. I have no in game issues so I really dont think its my connection or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"batgirl2000","date":"2017-02-03T20:54:33.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:51}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T21:23:24.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/P6LUzk2.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T18:28:44.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have an unstable connection if you're inconsistently getting left behind during champion select.  That kind of uncertainty is definitely frustrating, especially if it's causing losses in your series.  Your best bet would be to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this, and tighten up your connection to our game servers.
