The only legit thing you said was that he has a below 50% winrate. Everything else is asinine and absolutely laughable that im not going to waste an hour to debunk your points but instead im going to call out your bs with the other champs you listed that \"THEY do not even need 1 damage item and still does massive damage to your backline\"\n\n>Shyvana\n\nShe's completely lack luster in all regards in the top lane. If she isnt winning her trades then she loses lane hard.  And if she doesnt build BotRK or any damaging item then she falls off extremely hard becoming irrelevant. \n\n>Hec\n\nHe needs to build Triforce inorder to do any damage and be a backline threat.\n\n>Rumble\n\nNeeds an offensive item to be of any threat. In fact, majority of his builds consists of nothing of offensive.\n\n\n>Shen\n\nStill does little damage but all he is is a walking taunt which has an extremely small hitbox and an R. He splitpushes extremely slow. Especially when compared to Jax. Not a back line threat as he can be easily ignored if he doesnt build TF or BotRK\n\n>Maokai \n\nA lot of times he builds ROA which contributes to his offensiveness during the lane phase. Other than that, he is a front liner, not a back liner.\n\n>Nautilus\n\nHe's better as a support due to his CC but he doesnt deal much damage. Especially without AP items. Again, front liner. Not a back one.\n\n>Ryze \n\nHe still builds AP. He is not longer as big of a threat in the early game but he still needs AP items to do anything.\n\n>Trundle\n\nTrundle's first item majority of the time is BotRk.  \n\nDont even bother trying to post a refute because I wont respond as it'll be a waste a time.","replies":[{"poster":"Xiao Long Nv","date":"2015-07-03T20:39:29.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"DO YOU WATCH LCS?????????\n\nGold 3??????????????????????

The thing is, you can just play Irelia and do most things for most of the game a lot better.","replies":[{"poster":"Xiao Long Nv","date":"2015-07-03T19:52:43.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you do have to understand 1 thing if you are not bronze:\n\nTF & BoRK item cost = 6 armor items\n\nU DO THE MATH","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2015-07-03T21:48:11.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xiao Long Nv,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KciT4vyU,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-07-03T19:52:43.305+0000)\n>\n> you do have to understand 1 thing if you are not bronze:\n> \n> TF & BoRK item cost = 6 armor items\n> \n> U DO THE MATH\n\nJax's ult passive and w do a lot of magic damage.

Leapstrike + stun + botrk sctive + phage makes it pretty hard to kite jax. Not to mention leapstrike has a pretty low cd.\n\nLastly, I mentioned ult passive. The ult itself actually gives a shit ton of armor and mr. But you probably know that.
