Some brushes are there but aren’t \n\nOcean - Invisible brushes everywhere, the most broken in my opinion\n\nCloud - Nothing\n\nMountain - Annoying invisible walls every where.\n\nAlcoves are also missing and the blue side brushes. Currently clash will be on tomorrow as well, please fix before then riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-12-07T09:01:22.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Clash isn't out yet wat\nis it live on OCE?","replies":[{"poster":"22 Caliber Rifle","date":"2019-12-07T09:03:50.125+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it is.

If you have a lead, its easier to press because the losing team may not ward correctly due to invisible brushes and be less able to read the map.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sora Omo","date":"2019-12-08T04:35:59.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Clash wasn't even out yet lmfao XD\n\nFlaming riot just to flame lol","replies":[{"poster":"22 Caliber Rifle","date":"2019-12-08T07:26:39.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"um.... well whats this new icon and match history say about it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2019-12-08T20:26:30.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:432}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RΟMPECHΟRIZΟS","date":"2019-12-07T19:18:03.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have loved to have that happen to me, because my team and I were put inside another team (we were 10 in total) but we 5 couldn't play.\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}  I love Crash...","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-12-08T00:09:51.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it was 10 vs 0?
