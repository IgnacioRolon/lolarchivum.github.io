This really wont change anything. Yi is going to keep his head down and keep farming.

Unlike earlier, scalng was on total AD ~200.\n\nIn short, his AD scaling is non existent till he get's an AD item. Earlier he would scale thru' all levels not just AD item.\n\nIt'll be a bit problematic .Yi will need an extra 2-3 seconds to kill anyone, that 1-2 is what I'm worried about.  Which means Yi runes have to be changed to include AD not just % AS, Armor and MR. \n\nIt's not like Yi is gutted, but yeah something to consider how his build, runes and mastries have to be resetup.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"69Pimpac69","date":"2018-03-31T23:00:52.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Master is no strong","replies":[]},{"poster":"fizz for me","date":"2016-03-11T22:47:00.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"seriously if they nerf him i will just quit this game! it's not fair he's my main and with that tanky build he surivie in teamfight longer by 3 secs more....and that critical build sucks really sucks he die in secs if he's CCed his Q made to dodge enemy abilities and CC but u can't dodge 5 abilities at once even with ur team mates u will get focused even with qss, stilll doesn't change a thing if there's enemy rammus or jax....who couter yi so hard, tanky build help him to carry and be useful in this game u are making this champion so rabbish, he got 0 CC and his farm after the nerf will suffer alot meaning he need to focus more on farm than just ganking  which will make the game 4vs5  just keep the champion as he is just stop it he didn't take any changes since 2013 just leave the champion alone he's balanced if  people are asking for nerf cos they can't deal with tanky yi it's their problem not yi! he's not even picked in high elo","replies":[{"poster":"ammannas","date":"2016-08-23T06:18:26.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fizz for me,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RdAIgmVa,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-03-11T22:47:00.221+0000)\n>\n> seriously if they nerf him i will just quit this game! it&#x27;s not fair he&#x27;s my main and with that tanky build he surivie in teamfight longer by 3 secs more....and that critical build sucks really sucks he die in secs if he&#x27;s CCed his Q made to dodge enemy abilities and CC but u can&#x27;t dodge 5 abilities at once even with ur team mates u will get focused even with qss, stilll doesn&#x27;t change a thing if there&#x27;s enemy rammus or jax....who couter yi so hard, tanky build help him to carry and be useful in this game u are making this champion so rabbish, he got 0 CC and his farm after the nerf will suffer alot meaning he need to focus more on farm than just ganking  which will make the game 4vs5  just keep the champion as he is just stop it he didn&#x27;t take any changes since 2013 just leave the champion alone he&#x27;s balanced if  people are asking for nerf cos they can&#x27;t deal with tanky yi it&#x27;s their problem not yi! he&#x27;s not even picked in high elo\n\nM8, if all u get is 3 secs I think u should reconsider the type of champs u play cuz u sound like a suicider...
