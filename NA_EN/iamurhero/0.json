I was thinking something like this:\n\nItem:\nActive\nA skill shot that sends out light (whatever element) at a fix range and when the light makes it to the end it turns into a circle field on the ground. Think of soraka e shape and cassopiea w cc combine. With the activation like the old {{item:3098}} completed item. Enemy in the circle is grounded(which means no dash, flash, and blink) for about 2 to 5s (whatever number seems balance). The circle should not do damage as its main point is to be a cc. Of course have a 90 second active item cool down. So its not spam-able. For the skill shot part we can change it to it has to hit an enemy champion to activate (whatever seems balance)\nStat\nWhatever stat supports need and does not get abuse by other lane. \n\nI know I am probably going to get a lot of dislike from ppl who favorite mobility champion. I really wish their was a cool active support item to choose from. Most of the items out right now are really lame and boring.","replies":[{"poster":"nasu010","date":"2018-06-08T04:57:59.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I actually found out that {{item:3309}} I think it was and {{item:3116}} did a really nice combo places a shield on you and an ally shield then explodes after a while and procs the slow","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-08T05:51:34.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3050}} {{item:3905}} ....","replies":[{"poster":"NekoniClaws","date":"2018-06-08T10:59:05.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-*sees this was downvoted*- -*tries to figure out why*- -*gives up*-\n\nIf there's a Talon charging at your ADC twin shadows is immensely dissuasive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psychoaryama","date":"2018-06-08T21:11:32.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe an item whose active is a skillshot that can hit champions as well as minions, monsters, epic monsters, and champion summons, and when you hit a target with it, you and the target temporarily swap movement speed (and movement speed related buffs/debuffs). Making it a skillshot makes it possible to miss/dodge, decreasing the danger a bit, and making it possible to land on a minion, monster, or epic monster, as well as making it swap movement speeds rather than just decreasing the target's movement speed, will make it possible for the item's active to backfire if used on the wrong target, further decreasing the danger for assassins and bruisers if they're paying attention. Making it swap buffs and debuffs further increases the likelihood of backfire, since an ally slowing the target just before the user uses the active will be far more negative for the user than for the target. It would have the potential to get the player out of a sticky situation if used correctly, but would require skill to actually be used effectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-06-08T10:31:08.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like this idea. Yes, there is kind of too much mobility everywhere, but this item would be bad for the game. Because it would be pretty much only used to restrict the mobility of assassins and bruisers. And assassins and bruisers are so dependant on their mobility, that the can do pretty much nothing without their mobility.\nAnd enchanters in general are already very efficient at peeling for their adcs. A lot of pro-players say that support (Itemisation) is too strong right now, adding this item with scuh an incredible powerful active would be too much.\n\nAnd I'm saying this as a midlaner who primarily plays control mages, the most immobile champion-class in the rift.
