Currently I have a mission that states \"Play 15 games to stage 4-5\", and it rewards a measly 100 points. at a loose calculation of 25 minutes from queue to stage 4-5. This mission takes a minimum of 6 h 15m to complete. If you get knocked out of any games early, it's obviously longer. 6 hours of play for 100 points where each individual game is actually worth zero. I get that this is a fun gametype, but RIOT you are not taking us seriously or respecting the time we put into keeping your company relevant. Stingy has been the name of the game ever since the blue essence switch, but this is overboard.","replies":[{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2019-09-03T11:58:12.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to complete all the missions to get full rewards from the TFT beta pass.

If you get all the others, you should be fine without getting that mission.\n\nThey want to have a high level cap for those who play a ton.  That's why there's 5 charges on each daily orb.  It allows those dedicated to get benefits that those who play only 1-2 games a day won't.  I don't see why people keep demanding that all missions and the daily orb are geared only toward those who play occasionally.","replies":[{"poster":"Werdi","date":"2019-09-03T08:32:47.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that mission pops after you have completed other missions, so ill like to know how you are suppossed to complete it with a full time job or once people start school.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-03T14:33:10.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Werdi,realm=EUW,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=BJwv8UJk,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-09-03T08:32:47.532+0000)\n>\n> Well, that mission pops after you have completed other missions, so ill like to know how you are suppossed to complete it with a full time job or once people start school.\n\nThe missions aren't geared toward people with full time jobs or school.  Nor should they be.  They want to provide a high cap for those who are dedicated, but still make most missions accessible enough to be completed without needing to invest too much of your life into.\n\nIf you have real life responsibilities, good!  But don't expect to be able to keep up with dedicated nerds who don't.  As of last week, I have a newborn, and have since had to decline many a game invite.  I don't expect to be able to complete all the missions anymore, as my life has different priorities.  I go for the easy missions, and basically ignore the 15-game one, and still manage to make enough progress to achieve my goals.  I don't see any right I have to demand that every single mission caters to my position in life.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lrrr Omicronian","date":"2019-09-03T19:18:20.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I the only one who saw the title of the thread and went somewhere totally different in my mind?   ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2019-09-02T15:02:30.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So like SR missions.
