My main account is no longer associated with my email address, so I cannot access or change the password for this account.  I obviously didn't authorize this, and I'd very much like to get access to this account back, as it was created in 2011-2012, and has hundreds (if not over $1000) sunk into it with Champ and skin purchases.  \r\n\r\nI understand there is a queue, and you guys are likely busy, but it's been over 36 hours and I don't even have a response.  Can I get some feedback or some reassurance that someone is at least working on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Lantrex","date":"2017-08-16T20:37:39.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm roughly in the same boat (\"the account was placed under a protective ban after we noticed some unusual login activity.\") and over the $1k mark (which shouldn't matter).
