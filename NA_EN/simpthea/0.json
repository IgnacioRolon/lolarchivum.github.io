I have had a bad day today. My dog died, my grandpa got put into the hospital, my mom yelled at me while drunk for being too bad of a son. League of legends is the only way I can release myself. I can&#039;t do anything without it. My main account got Perma suspended.  HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? I made a new years resolution after I got two week banned. I play one game and I&#039;m pretty toxic, but I muted everybody knowing they couldn&#039;t hear me. I que another game and in the middle, I get perm suspended. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  Why do I get suspended. I PLAYED ONE GAME AFTER MY TWO WEEK, AND I GET BANNED????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? MAYBE YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS FLAWED. YOU NEED TO STOP PEOPLE FROM FALSELY ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING TOXIC, WHEN IN REALITY THEY&#039;RE THE ONES THAT ARE MAD. Your system is flawed, and I really want my account back. and If I don&#039;t get it back than screw it. I&#039;ll go play smite, or CS:go. Since their system isn&#039;t absolute trash. They have people watch games and judge them on what they say and how the other people react. This is outrageous Seriously, my game from today I was toxic but that does not immediately escalate to a Perma Ban. This is absolutely un-comprehendible. All I ask is for you to thoroughly look at my chats and their, to see how I interact. Like come on, it was contructive critizim. Well, the last one wasn&#039;t. But the one before and before that was not. I&#039;m probably banned for life from this game, but just a warning, more and more people are being babies in a game. In games, you should feel to express your feelings as it is in the first amendment. And if people don&#039;t like it they can mute me. Most of my games i&#039;m calm , but when I do, people automatically clikc report and say to the enemy team, while being toxic, &quot;report this kid because he&#039;s bad and he flamed.&quot; Like WHY???","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-22T01:34:58.538+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"> MAYBE YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS FLAWED.

Everyone has, everyone does, and you always will again eventually until you just plain quit or gradually stop playing. Even pros have those moments.\nIf Bjergsen or Dyrus or Froggen or any of the other pros had gotten permabanned because in their entire 5 years of playing they've gotten a suspension or ban and then did it again, there would be huge outrage. I mean, there was for Videogamedunkey and he was genuinely toxic a lot of the time.\nBut, because its somebody nobody knows, because he has also had a few toxic moments and he got permabanned everyone is just saying \"its your own fault\" or whatnot. I've raged and been chat muted for many games, should I be permabanned? He even admitted he tried to do good and even muted his allies because he didn't want to be toxic. Anyone who's trying doesn't deserve a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-22T02:46:05.268+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, I do get angry and rage and have those moments.\n\nI do it outside of league.

However, I don't escalate it in the chat by consistently raging at them. What I normally do is ask them to stop trolling, and if they don't I just stop trying to reason with them as they obviously won't listen.

Just because someone is toxic 5 times in one month, ever, or 5 times spread out through several years, it doesn't matter, and he shouldn't be permabanned for it.

Lots of people rage, they get frustrated and just downright angry with their teammates. The difference is, a LOT of the community acts like adults and doesn't type it out. You can scream at your computer, punch your wall, whatever you like and while how you vent your rage may have consequences there, it won't have consequences in league until you bring your rage into league.\n\nYou are however, projecting pretty badly here. The average player doesn't type, let alone be toxic. They may have A bad match where they let loose on a teammate, maybe they have it once a month, or once every three months even. Those players don't  get banned, they especially don't get permabanned. No, the players who DO get permabanned are those who do it on a semi-regular basis while playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-01-23T01:10:40.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course you've never met anyone who hasn't raged every couple moths at least... because you claim everybody else to be lying.
