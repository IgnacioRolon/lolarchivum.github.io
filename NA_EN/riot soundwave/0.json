The reality is that player will get different benefits at different places in their lifecycle. So people who level might end up losing on level 30 content like end of season rewards. Additionally, you can still buy XP boosts while this is happening, so a boost is still a boost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-08-31T18:26:09.424+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexySoapTurtle","date":"2015-08-31T18:15:59.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"kool","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sandelsj","date":"2016-03-07T16:22:24.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this double exp still in the Russian server ? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedBlazeNinja","date":"2016-01-18T20:23:44.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot S0undwaves,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AtdUNLAN,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-31T18:15:11.944+0000)\n>\n> Hey all, \n> \n> We&#039;re looking to make some upgrades to League&rsquo;s progression systems long term. Right now we&rsquo;re thinking about the level 1-30 experience. Specifically, we&rsquo;re taking a look at how long it takes to level an account all the way to thirty.\n> \n> The numbers here are pretty disparate: the grind from 1-30 takes hundreds of games, and League&rsquo;s matchmaking systems can accurately place players pretty swiftly. While we still believe there should be a pretty big buffer between new players and fiercely competitive modes, we think the number of games between 1-30 could be a bit too big. To test that hypothesis, we&rsquo;re running a test in Russia only, doubling XP gains on the server from 9/1-11/20. After the test concludes, we&rsquo;ll use the data to inform improvements to the leveling experience on a global scale. \n> \n> We chose Russia because it&rsquo;s a younger, growing territory for League, making it ideal to test systemwide changes on. If anything, the test might help Russian players bring some of their friends into the game.\n> \n> Shortly after the test wraps, we&rsquo;ll circle back with you, share some of our learnings, and let you know how they could shape future changes. \n> \n> Let me know if you have any questions!\n\nhows is the new gameplay aint played in like 2 years","replies":[]}]}
