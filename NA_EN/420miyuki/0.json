The large amount of hidden information with the honor system is part of why it feels lackluster, along with everyone seeming to have gotten ribbons a few months ago, and now they're all gone again. No one I play with in ranked games has ribbons (maybe 1 out of every 100 players).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArisenHero","date":"2013-10-18T17:19:55.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that what players need is an indicator of how close they are to unlocking a banner.  I have over 200 teamwork but I have gotten a lot of those from my friends which does not count as much as getting them from strangers.  So I have no clue when I will ever get that banner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2013-10-18T17:19:30.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, giving reward for honor is like making honor void... I must say taht it's true that there are some honor-null-space depending on your level of play and your queue'ing, but one thing for sure, whenever you are truly honorable, you end up getting teamwork.\n\nI'm currently on a Poppy craze, and I'm giving honor to anyone that simply doesn't flame me, because I know that most people do. In the same way I also receive honor in most cases where I choose to fill for the team and actually work with the team to get our objectives.\n\nI once got teamwork because while losing lane, I diverted our jungler's attention toward more important ganks and chose to even give my top lane to create plays elsewhere. \n\nBasically, if you're questing for honor, choose one of the 3 kinds, and try your hardest to represent that honor kind. If you want teamwork honors, play with the team even if it means less gain for yourself. If you want friendly, choose to fill, ask your teammates what they want, offer custom bans/trades, in-game, ask people for their consent about X item/play, and most of all, just congratualte them for their plays and comfort them in their slip-ups. If you want Helpful, it's imo the hardest, but the key is to work for both others. Basically, \"teaching\" the game, without sounding like a total jackass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2013-10-23T06:21:34.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that Honor as a system is *incredibly* inaccurate currently.  It's very easy to either abuse or ignore, and it's actually more difficult to use it properly (i.e. giving Honor to players you consider Honorable) than not.\n\nHonor, if you decide to think about it this way, is essentially the reverse of the reporting system.  The report system uses community voting to determine whether players need to be punished, while Honor uses community voting to determine whether players need to be rewarded.  This is all well and good, but Honor doesn't have a check/balance to it.\n\nImagine for a moment that the Tribunal didn't exist, just for clarity's sake.  Upon reaching a certain threshold of reports or a percentage of reports per game, you're immediately punished.  This is essentially how Honor works currently, just in the opposite direction.  Without a system that checks the validity of Honor distributed, it's inaccurate to the point of uselessness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"No CS For You","date":"2013-10-21T23:27:44.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you lack honor its what your doing mate","replies":[]},{"poster":"J0HN C3N4","date":"2013-10-18T13:26:06.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I honor and receive honor all the time.
