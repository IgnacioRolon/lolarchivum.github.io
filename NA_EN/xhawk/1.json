I generally like mechically interesting champions however that isn&#039;t a requirement. I have an aggressive, playmaking playstyle. I&#039;m a jungle main, however I play any every role often. Finally, don&#039;t be afraid to recomment champions that aren&#039;t the traditional &quot;fun&quot; champions (like zed, Darius, stuff like that). I enjoy tanks, supports, and underplayed champions as much as the common ones. Also I don&#039;t really care if th champion is all that good at the moment\r\n\r\nIf it helps, my 5 highest master champions are:\r\nGragas (by a LOT)\r\nLee Sin\r\nAzir\r\nBraum\r\nNidalee\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!","replies":[]}
