I don&#039;t give a damn if you&#039;re bronze 5 or diamond 3 but flaming people for rank is toxic and annoying as hell. Am I go 0-10 and loosing you the game? No. I&#039;m just playing doing as well as everyone else. But I&#039;m getting flamed for being bronze when it&#039;s really not warrented. Why can&#039;t I just play and be a part of the team?

I don't care about being in bronze I'm just playing my game. I play mostly normals with friends anyway. So stop bringing up stat sheets.

It's not about rank. You're missing the whole point. My win rate does not solely determine my skill so don't be a toxic piece of crap when playing with me. Just because I'm bronze 3 doesn't mean I can't carry you and play well if I'm having a good game.

If people have a status that marks them as somehow superior to others they will seek every opportunity to rub it in your face if they are losing against you, both in competitive games and in arguments.\n\nIt's the lazy coward's way of avoiding having to alter their worldview. If they are losing it's not their fault, it's just that the enemy team has a really good player. And if they are challenged here on the forums, it takes less effort to dismiss the challenger as inferior than it does to actually engage with them or address their points.\n\nIt sucks that people are this way to you.
