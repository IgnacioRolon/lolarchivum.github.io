In over 70% I had an afk, and was docked a whole point for every game I had an afk. There is absolutely no chance to win in a 5v6. At least in League you have the possibility to win 4v5 assuming you are good enough to get fed and win your lane. Leagues afk punishment system is so much more respected than Overwatches afk punishment system.\n\nOh, and those premades that everyone seems to complain about? Yeah now you get to play against 6 as a solo, so lol. And its even more important to have good communication in overwatch, because most characters cant do anything on their own, at least if they are playing for the objective. \n\nEvery issue that gets complained about on this boards is present in Overwatches ranking system. Out of the 800+ games ive played this season in Ranked, I have only had about 20 afks. I can't speak for everyone but I know for sure that there is a lot less of an afk problem in this game than there is in Overwatch.\n\nI understand that ranked has only been out for about 4 days now and that Blizzard are still tweaking their ranked system,  but as of right now I feel that leagues ranking system is much less toxic than Overwatches. And that's saying A LOT.\n\nEDIT: It really bothers me the amount of players who went to overwatch but come to these boards to hate on this game. I know that i'm calling out overwatch, but there are so many old leaugers who lurk on these boards to promote overwatch.\n\n I really think that in a few months Overwatch will have the same problem league has, a community that never stops complaining, and is never happy. I honestly think that league can be good with the matchmaking it has right now. but I really think that Riot needs to start asking the community for concept Ideas for champion reworks in order to create more uniqueness. Right now It feels like champions fall into a heirarchy of \"which tank does the most damage\" or \"which Mid has the most dps\". If every single champion had a more distinct \"niche\" Then I could see League bouncing back. \n\nEDIT: #2 After reading these comments, I can see that the people here really just want League to die already. People coming out in support of League get instant downvotes by lurkers who quit League. It's depressing really, I come to a League board to talk about how my experience with leagues ranked system is so much better than my experience with Overwatch, And I get hate from overwatch fans, ON A LEAGUE OF LEGENDS BOARD. Dang. Everything is going exactly how I thought It would. And if it keeps going this way, All of the people who hate league will go to Overwatch, complain on those boards and ruin that game too, leaving only the dedicated fans of league playing league. Honestly I can't wait for the next few months. I feel like Riot will have a lot better of a time talking to dedicated fans about this game. I can see it becoming so much more productive to be honest. \n\nThe reason this game is losing interest is because of the lack of interaction between the company and the fans. This game could become so much better if the Rioters made more interactions on the boards than they do now. There would be so much more trust in Riot if they would take a minute and at least acknowledge peoples ideas on these boards. \n\nI'm not here to defend Riot, they have clearly made mistakes, the main purpose of this thread was to bring to attention that the grass isn't really greener on the other side. I think its important to understand that my experience is anecdotal. That is the #1 arguement against this post but people would rather flame and rant than use that arguement. The only other arguement is that overwatch is a new game. So what if its a new game? its 2016, so many games with ranking systems have coming out, and they chose something that barely works. I hope they fix it, I would love to play both League and overwatch ranked. \n\nId like to use this day of popularity to recommend looking in the concepts and creations board, there is some really good stuff in there. The more people who look in there and upvote good ideas, the higher the chance of Riot seeing those things and considering them.\n\nEdit:3 (possibly the last, If I go missing assume I was sacrificed to please the Blizzard gods)\nWE BROKE 50 UPVOTES FAM, 1.6 K VIEWS LATER LOL. I can only imagine how many downvotes this thread has. Probably best not to think about it to be honest.\nSo my comments have been hunted by angry overwatch cultists (=3) cute\n\nIts funny how many people came back to these boards to argue and downvote people who are in support of League. Like, \"you left league for overwatch, why are you still here?\" I swear, can't even go to a League of legends board to talk about an issue concerning League (albeit Overwatch as well) without getting mobbed by a swarm of League haters.\n\nI feel like I need to clarify this. Blizzard is a triple A company with ~5x more employees than Riot, and has more years under its belt. They have released ~6 huge successful games with a lot of experience with ranked systems. I find it very odd that Blizzard would use a system that has proven to create hatred and split communities. Surely they must see all the hatred that Dynamic queue creates. Why implement it into their own game? with all the time they put into it they surely must have been able to create something better?.\n\nI understand that both Overwatch and Leagues ranked systems are not set in stone, and can change in the future. \n\nI'm keeping this thread up despite the hatred and negativity in the comment section because it proves my theory 100% true at this point. The toxic people want this game to die. They will argue with people who support League because they don't like league, they just want something new. The dedicated fans of league care very little for these people, and ignore them because they are just trolls. \n\nTo all the dedicated fans of league out there, I'm sure that in a couple of months we will have a lot better time interacting with Riot. I am starting to see a lot of people who agree that Riot has been rather separated with the community lately. Only recently have they started making more posts like Leona vs Diana and stuff like that. I really do think that the future for League is bright. Though it may feel like a slump right now, I think that in the near future Riot will be making a greater effort to look for community ideas, and ask for more insight from the dedicated fans of this community. For now, its just important to ignore these trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"Wild Wes","date":"2016-07-03T18:18:53.666+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":15,"body":"Gets downvoting saying League ranked is better than Overwatch ranked on LEAGUE boards...\nWhat is wrong with you people?","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-07-03T21:43:19.331+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":12,"body":"Its shocking to me, I make a claim, back it up with evidence (anecdotal however) then the only thing that people can argue with is the fact that Overwatch is a new game. Who cares if its a new game? Out of all the ranked systems that exist, or Blizzard has made themselves, Overwatch has to be the worst ranking system to date. \n\nIts crazy, It really seems that people just want league to die. I want it to prosper again. I think the first step is to make every champion a niche champion, rather than the current heirarchy of \"which champ is the best.\" People really just would rather complain about Dynamic queue, a system that Overwatch has as well.\n\n I personally think that Dynamic queue isn't even the problem, its the fact that there is a champ heirarchy, and there isn't enough uniqueness in champions and items. League of legends was pretty much the only moba that had a solo Q option. If you are solo in a team game, then that means the other 4 players are practically deciding your rank as well. The ability to decide who these 4 players are helps good players play with each other to get to the rank they belong at.\n\n I really don't care much for these conspiracy theorys saying that riot did this to keep people playing league because of relationships. Every other moba has this, other big competative games like csgo have this. Honestly, I don't really care either way if dynamic queue is in the game, it has never influenced my play, and I have never had a problem with Premades. It seems only the vocal people care about Dynamic queue. Out of all the people I have ever played with, only a very small minority of them dislike dynamic queue. I didn't even know that it was a problem until I came to the boards. Thats kind of a red flag to me that its just solo's making a very big deal about something that doesn't really matter. Its funny how many people just blame their losses on premades rather than look at what they could have done better. I think that any toxicity problems with Premades and reporting can be solved once the tribunal comes back.\n\nI don't mean to be that guy, but the reason League is dying is because of the community. I think that things will get a lot better once some of these people go to overwatch. There they will complain on the boards 24/7 and cause overwatch to die, then on to the next \"big\" game. This game will get so much better when its only the dedicated fans conversing on the boards. I really just wish these lurkers on the boards would leave already, they aren't contributing, and they have bad arguments.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-03T22:00:03.799+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":17,"body":"IT IS IMPORTANT that overwatch ranked is new! Because it just started and will improve over time! If LOL would be new, we would have the exact same situation. Because its new and still trying out what works for it. You are trying to compare the fumblings of a newborn babe and the fck ups of a grown ass man!\n\nPeople want this game to prosper, that is why they are on these forums for fck sakes! They want it to be good!\n\nAnd people complain about dynamic, because it is a problem! It is the main problem. \n\n**And no, League was not the only one moba that had soloq system. Dota has both systems implemented, Hots HAD dynamic then scraped it for solo. Smite is the only one who allows 1-3 people premades (BEfore LOL). And these are the most popular mobas!**\n\n**So dont bullshit people!**\n\nAnd no, your assumption is wrong. Because when you have soloes, you are all dependant on each other and all of your skill and teamwork matters for victory. You also all have a level playing field. Havaing premades TOGETHER with soloes, destroys even playing field, thus ruining ranked integrity.\n\nAnd again, you show that you know shit about ranked integrity. People blame their loses on premades because its unfair for solo to go against premades! Even if you are skilled, its an unfair playing field.\n\nAlso, minority? Data please.\n\n\nIf we have bad arguments, could you refute them and could you tell me how exactly is dynamic q fair for solo players when they are matched with premades who have inherent advantages?","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-07-04T02:06:59.008+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ah, forgive me on my point about heros of the storm then. Replace heros with CSGO. Also forgive me about Dota, I was just going off of what my friend said (he still plays dota). Nothing is really stopping anyone from inviting people to ranked tbh, everyone has the opportunity to. I really don't care that much about Dynamic Queue to be honest. If Riot changed it so it caps at 3 people, within 3 ranks of each other I think that would be fine, as long as people stop complaining about it. I've never seen anyone complain about DQ outside of the boards. \n\nI've never had a negative experience with Dynamic Queue yet, and I was 500 games in before I saw that people were complaining about premades. \n\nHonestly, I would like to know Riots reasoning behind Dynamic Queue, their REAL reasoning. I really don't think that its to get more money, because they would be getting more money if they implemented a system that the community is asking for. I don't think it has to do with toxicity, however I haven't had any toxic players flame me yet this season, nor have I had many afks (~20). I can only speak from my personal experiences here. But you do have to remember, people only post about DQ on the boards when they get a game with a premade that they lost with/against. This leaves a HUGE part of the community that is silent on the issue because they just haven't had any bad experiences with it. The popular posts that gain traction really only get about 4000 veiws, its not a huge part of the community commenting on that stuff.\n\nI really don't want to defend dynamic queue, because quite honestly I really don't care if it stays or goes. I just think that people have blown the impact of premades out of the water, and they are using it as an excuse to blame other things rather than theirselves. People post images of really bad premades, well the same thing happened in solo q, you would end up with a bunch of idiots with no desire to communicate. I'm sorry but I just haven't had bad experiences with premades yet, and I'm about 800 games into this season. Boosting players really isn't something that riot can police, considering they cannot track what email accounts are the same person. I think that limiting  the grouping system to ranks, not divisions would fix that problem, at least a little. I always thought it was funny how a plat one could play with a gold 5. Maybe that plat one should only be able to play with plat 2-diamond 1. I'm pretty sure Riot has implemented this system at higher ranks though. Maybe they should implement it in lower ranks, but make it not so harsh. In lower ranks the change in skill really isn't that noticeable. It kind of grows exponentially as you rise though the ranks. And as I said earlier I wouldn't be opposed to limiting groups to 3.\n\nDo what you want with dynamic queue, I think the biggest problem right now is the fact that it is SO difficult to get in a conversation with a Riot employee.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-04T03:44:22.600+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"CS:GO Aint even a moba. With overwatch you can maybe draw it close because of heroes, but CS is farthest from moba one can get. Again, you are trying to equate games that are in different genres.\n\nAnd if you havent seen people complaining outside the boards you need to open your eyes. Because Videos were made about this, many watched videos. Reddit was also really active and still is. Roundtable video, downvoted to all 9 hells. Pros consistently condemed this system via twitter and youtube alike.\n\nI still think its about money. Games casualize themselves to get more casual players in. Having riends play with you, will make you more likely to stay, spend money and possibly invite others. It is an old tactic. \n\nAnd those who are silent, are unimportant. At all. When president elections are happening, those who dont vote, dont matter, only those who do matter. This is the same. Boards and pros are the hardcore playerbase of this game. And it is the main playerbase you should listen to, if you dont want to end up like Runescape or WOW.\n\nAnd yes, shitty things happened in soloq too. However, it was not an unfair system. You were always fairly treated in that system. However, having premades makes an unfair system and destroys ranked integrity. \n\nPremades matched with soloes will always have the advantage. In your team, the solo will be robbed of team decision making, as unlike in soloq, his leadership position is not decided by meritocracy, but rather, by mob rule of the premades. At the same time premades can go through ranks faster just because they are premade, nnot because of their skill. Furthermore, having premades and soloes together, hugely impacts the ammount of variables that go into deciding smeones rank, thus making it more and more innacurate. Its a bad system at its core that is unfair for the solo player.\n\nThe biggest problem rright nnow is that Riot is acting like a 10 year old child who just puts fingers in his ears telling himself \"Everything is fine, i cant hear anything\". They lied to us, furthermore, they refuse to make a simple experiment to prove all of us soloes wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-07-04T04:15:21.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Doesn't matter if CSGO isn't a moba, its a popular online competitive game that uses dynamic matchmaking.

While blizzard is working hard and talking, Riot makes announcements, and that's it. \"F you guys, we do it our way\".\n\nA question, if RIOT thought about everyone, why did they remove soloq instead of having both solo and dynamic separate ques for players? Why it didnt let its playerbase decide?\n\nBecause they knew that soloq would kill dynamic and that we are needed like fcking slaves to fill up dynamic so premade asshats wouldnt have long que times. Which is bullshit. Soloes are treated as tools for premade enjoyment.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-07-04T12:29:04.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why didn't Blizzard implement the same SQ and DQ like everyone's been bothering Riot about? Their excuse can't be \"because they're new and want to try things out\". Why isn't League allowed to have new things? Is it because they've been around for years and now we expect them to deliver everything on point?\nWell, that's a narrow-minded point of view right here.\n\nOverwatch's DQ doesn't seem to be finished as well. And you only mention badges and not the role selection improvements, overall matchmaking improvements and more improvements and restrictions to premades in Diamond + ELO. Seems like people expect the results to be visible and tangible, on top of actually being 100% accurate to count as results, otherwise they go unnoticed and we call Riot complacent, lazy and forceful.\n\nThis all stinks to me as letting Overwatch off the hook because they are new and are trying things out and if there are real world examples of failed systems that stem from a big game that has lasted for years, there's no excuse for making the same mistake but with your own Blizzard-y twist to it. If even Blizzard jumped on DQ train, and they are a big company too, then it certainly means something. It's not that developers are trying to push flawed systems upon us poor players, there's probably something that we are failing to recognize as an improvements because we are too focused on calling DQ terrible.\n\nThere's no logic to repeating the same mistake everyone's been condemning League for and trying to hide behind the fact of hype over the new fun OP in 17 years. If Overwatch's ranked doesn't work out, people won't bother playing the game at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-04T12:48:12.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blizzard probably didn't do that due to cost effectiveness. Because developing two systems at the same time, is not the most effective of things. And league is allowed to have new things, if they work and are not inherently broken.\n\nYes, Overwatch DQ is not finished, but again, it is a completely new game that is being started from scratch. LOL on the other hand has been around for years and should have had, both finances and experience to fully finish DQ and not ship out an unfinished product. Role selection improvements have nothing to do with dynamic, they are two separate system shipped together for Riot to show all role selection achievements as DQ achievements.  And  ain't it funny that an improvement of DQ is going back closer to soloq? They dont have to be accurate all the time, but they have not to lie to the community and listen to it, simple as that.\n\nI am not defending blizzard in any way, DQ is a shitty system and most who implemented know it. The only time it was succesfull is DOTA, but they give everyone a choise rather than forcing everyone into the same barn like LOL.  And no, blizzard trying to work with DQ doesnt mean anything. Because they had DQ in Hots and then scrapped it for soloq. Not only that but their decisions taken with WOW show that they also are prone to making mistakes.\n\nAnd no, this system isnt pushed because its flawed. But because it is casualizing the game, thus trying to attract new impressionable customers with the help of friendships. Tell me yourself, what has DQ improved? Less raging? Logical, but now the severety of raging increases. Not only that but New Champ Select had far bigger impact on raging. More people playing ranked? No shit, its easier to boost and get boosted, also this happens after again, Champ select changes and removal of dominion.\n\nOf course there is no logic to repeat the mistake. However at least i think that they are trying to do something that Dota did, just are doing it backwards (Like always). Do ilike their decision? NO! Do i support it? NO! But equating the two is not correct as Blizzard may implement the Dota system while Riot has no wish to do that so everyone would be content.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reconnected","date":"2016-07-04T02:15:38.884+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=shyv,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=1Lt3fVVI,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-07-03T18:51:57.184+0000)\n>\n> there&#x27;s a difference between a new game trying to balance out their ranking system that has been out for less than a week, and a game that&#x27;s like 6 years old deliberately fucking up their already balanced ranking system to appeal to casuals\n> \n> the only reason you can play with friends in league ranked is because riot profits off of people having league friends. that&#x27;s it. riot knows they fucked up and they don&#x27;t care because they&#x27;re making money.\n\nbingo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vertu","date":"2016-07-03T18:25:17.067+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is basically their trial season so if they notice any issues they'll be sure to fix it in future seasons.

First, the reason that premades are getting A LOT more shit here than in Overwatch is that League's ladder has always been based on solo play. Now, group play is encouraged, but the ladder remains the same, and so it is utterly meaningless. Overwatch has yet to really \"define\" its ranked ladder, as it is so new. I'm guessing that after a couple seasons (which are only 3 months in Overwatch) things will stabilize and ranks will start to make more sense to people and a sensible ladder will be apparent. \n\nThe other big thing that you're missing is that OVERWATCH HAS IN GAME VOICE CHAT. If LoL had this feature, then literally no one would be complaining about premade advantage, because the playing field would be virtually level. Voice chat allows a team of solo players to compete fairly evenly with a premade, at least in terms of coordination, especially in Overwatch, where objectives are generally much more simple than in League. You just don't need to coordinate complicating things like double teleport 5 man ganks bot lane in a \"push the payload\" game of Overwatch. \n\nFinally, the ranked rewards in Overwatch do not provide the same kind of incentive to rank up. Sure, the fancy gold weapon skins are nice, but those have no bearing on your rank. You just need to win games, then cash in the points you accrue to buy them. A bronze 5 equivalent Overwatch player can still get golden weapons on all their favorite heroes, it's just a matter of playing more games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2016-07-04T00:50:27.979+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"People left League for overwatch cause Dynamic Queue\nGuess what, thats in Overwatch as well","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-07-04T01:32:22.168+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think its really funny that people still praise Overwatches ranked system over Leagues.
