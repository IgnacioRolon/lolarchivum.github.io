It is one of my favorite pieces of lore in League and I'd like to hear more/ see more development. Heck, it would be awesome if we could see Serylda (not sure about that spelling) or Avarossa become part of the League of Legends. I know Riot releases short stories and things from time to time now and once even requested things the community would like to hear more about.\r\n\r\n**Point's I'm really interested in:**\r\n* Serylda? Who is this person besides on of the three? She's a real blank slate that Riot could potentially make into another icy champion. How did she feel about the battle of the howling abyss which split her sisters apart? Did she side with the either?\r\n\r\n*Did any of the three sisters have power greater than the others? What kind of powers did they actually have besides the ability to influence Ice as an element, how powerful were these abilities, and what did they use it for?\r\n\r\n*Avarossa, Lissandra's sister and enemy in battle, what became of her? Lissandra says \"I never forgave her. I had my revenge, but that is another story.\" I'd love to hear that story Rito.\r\n\r\n*Parents? Lovers? Children?\r\n\r\n*The watchers sound cool, they wielded great power which they granted to the sisters in exchange for their service/loyalty. But we don't know a whole lot about them besides that. Also did they give power to anyone else? And are any of them still around?\r\n\r\n**Points I'm not as interested in:**\r\n*Lissandra's current lore is obviously well established already and mostly about present time in the Freljord, I'm more interested about Lissandra's past\r\n\r\n*That's the only point I'm not really interested in","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-02T04:15:14.935+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lasergazer,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vAVwpQFa,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-01T03:04:57.869+0000)\n>\n> *The watchers sound cool, they wielded great power which they granted to the sisters in exchange for their service/loyalty.

The Watchers, at least according to Lissandra, gave out power to far more people than just the Three Sisters. Think Iceborn armies, not just a few individuals.","replies":[{"poster":"UltÃ®ma","date":"2015-04-02T13:28:42.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, that's great to hear but are there any plans to concretize this in-game or in-client? \n\nWe hear a lot of cool details/theories from Rioters here on the board, but really never through LoL itself.
