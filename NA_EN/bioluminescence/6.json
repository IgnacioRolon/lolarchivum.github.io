Competition Closed!  [Winner announcement post here!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/scnyLOw0-tall-tales-of-bilgewater-winners-fan-fic-contest-results)#\n**[edit - We reached the deadline for entries and now I have the terribly difficult challenge of choosing one of the winners!]**\n\nFor fun, I welcome any of you creative writer types to a bit of a game - a flash fiction prompt, if you will!\n\n##The Challenge - ##\nGangplank is back from the dead, and _everyone_ and their scurvy dog has a theory on how he managed it.  It&#039;s the only thing being discussed in the taverns, and the stories are getting more and more outlandish!  Can you spin a ripping yarn of how Gangplank spit in the twin faces of death?\n\nWas he swallowed whole by a shark and punched his way out?  Did the water part around him in fear and he simply walked back to shore?  Did he die and go to hell, but the underworld felt he was overqualified and sent him back?\n\n_(Obviously, you and I (and anyone who&#039;s [read the epilogue](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/bilgewater/#story-4)) have some insider information - but Gangplank guaranteed that saw-bones silence, remember?  So the city is free to speculate wildly.)_\n\n##Rules - ##\n1. __400 word count limit.__  This is flash fiction, and the patrons of the bar are looking for wild stories done quick.\n2. __There will be two winners.__  One I pick (and I may soon regret having to choose just one) and the other that is the highest upvoted in this thread.\n3. __The deadline is 7pm PST, 3rd of August (tomorrow).__  (10pm EDT, or 2am on the 4th in GMT)\n4. __Prizes???__  I&#039;ll see if I can wrangle some RP, but I honestly don&#039;t know if I&#039;m allowed to do this :)\n\nAnyone interested in taking a shot?  Channel your inner Baron Munchausen and go for it.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2015-08-03T02:01:05.392+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":9,"body":"At the bottom of the bay, Gangplank lay against the seabed. Everything ached, blood was rising upward and the only his cutlass lay at his side. Gangplank couldn’t breath, the ocean having filled his lungs. He probably only had half a minute before the lack of air finished him.\n\nFrom the darkness, two golden eyes peered at him. “Well well, if it ain’t the mighty Gangplank. Boy, your arm looks mighty rough,” spoke the voice, melodic and deep. “Seems like you’re gonna die down here. Course, I could help you out…”\n\nGangplank, however, had no time for this. Despite the agony he was in, despite his lack of oxygen, he began to push himself up from the seabed. The razorfins swarmed overhead, drinking in the corpses. He’d have to move fast, least they turn their attention to a warm meal. If there was one thing Gangplank didn’t do, it was die.\n\n  “Now I could- HEY! Get back here! You know damn well you can’t get past that, I’m your only chance here, son!” the voice spoke. Despite the ocean’s depth, it sounded like the voice was in his mind.”Come back and let’s make a deal, you know you won’t make it…”\n\n  As he swam upwards, Gangplank began to choke on sea water. His lungs felt heavy but the surface was so close!\n\n“You know you won’t make it…”\n\n  His right arm still working fine, Gangplank held his sword close. A razorfin noticed him swimming upward, baring it’s teeth. Gangplank grimaced, impaling the beast as it sunk it’s teeth into his shoulder\n\n“YOU KNOW YOU WON’T MAKE IT…”\n\n  His legs were like iron. His vision was getting blurry. The sky and the burning wreckage were so close. Gangplank kicked with all his might, clutching his sword in his metal teeth as his hand reached for a floating piece of wreckage.\n\n“YOUWON’TMAKEITYOUWON’TMAKEITYOUWON’TMAKEITYOUWON’-”\n\n  Silence.\n\n  Gangplank burst from the water, clutching a destroyed piece of ship. He spit his sword from his mouth, puking up disgusting sea water as he clutched the raft. Everything hurt and he would need medical attention but, somehow, he had survived. A lone orange floated past, likely from his personal store. Resting his chest on the wood, he reached for it and pulled it to his mouth. He bit down on the orange, chewing it peel and all.\n\n  “The captain doesn’t make deals with the devil,” Gangplank rumbled.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-03T02:12:01.887+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=5AiMAFN0,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-08-03T02:01:05.392+0000)\n> ...\n> “YOUWON’TMAKEITYOUWON’TMAKEITYOUWON’TMAKEITYOUWON’-”\n> \n>   Silence.\n> \n>   Gangplank burst from the water, clutching a destroyed piece of ship.

Right on his ship the, uh... er... theeee? O, The Nagging Maiden! Thats right lassies! Nagging Maiden! And he was about to execute, I think it twas Grevs and Twindy Faraway? Ye matey les go with that RRRRRR.\n\nSo these criminals were destroying all of Bildgewater, Just for a pint of black rum, HAR, the damn drunks!

Okey dokey mateys. When suddenly Miss fortune jumps on the ship and shoots yer dear Captain overboard! \n\nO, Gangplank's men wallowed so hard that they blew de beautiful Nagging Maiden sky high, and I'm not talking about Miss Fortune lassies, YAR HAR! They blew the ship so she could be with her loving Captain, how sweet rrrrrrrrn't i right mateys?\n\nSo everyone calms down, crying for the Captain, and Miss Fortune starts swaying the crowd to her side! The oranges on that one! Trying to gain favor right after the man's death! While this is going on, the water behind her starts to bubble! Who could it be? What could it be? Well it twas none other than your Captain Gangplank!\n\nWhen Miss Fortune shot Gangplank, she shot him dead in the chest. What she didnt know was that Gangplank saved an orange for later in his coat pocket. She shot the orange! He was k! Did you hear that Mateys! He was K! And thats it...

The _Foul Owl_, luckily, was a piece beyond Butcher's Bridge and avoided much of the chaos around the Slaughter Docks. Elsewhere, the gangs that ran Bilgewater for the deceased Pirate King had immediately gone to fighting, but the small alehouse had so far escaped.\n\n\"I know how to settle this. Hey, Elyn!

Grabbed a plank as the dead got eaten. I saw the captain sinking, a chain tangled on his arm and his ship's wreckage dropping around him. Not many could even struggle with that much weight, but he fought until he hit the seabed.\"\n\n\"When I dipped under to look at him, he'd picked up a blade from the seafloor and was sawing at his arm. As much as he's dropped to the deeps, you think the Lady's gonna let ol' King Gangplank pass on?

He dove for the chain that Graves was still attached to, and was dragged under with him. \n\nI remember my hand just sliding against his fancy ass boot, and grabbing hold of the chain instead. I'll admit, the jolt from the chain yanking me towards the water actually surprised me, and the explosion that followed.

I may not stop myself next time.( _The doctor, lying on the floor in sheer terror, slowly got back to his feet, and continued what he was doing._)\n\nAs I was saying.......all I remember is some large creature diving into the ocean, followed by some melodic voice saying \"You owe me, son.\" Whatever that creature was, it must not know who I am.\n\nThe only thing I owe to anyone........is a bullet in the god damn head of whoever blew up my ship.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI think I'll cut it there. what do you think?\n\nJust so you don't have to count, it sits at 381 words.

If that's the only way that I could do this, then I'd never be able to do this (nor would any of the Rioters in other regions) resulting in a net loss of daft little competitions like this, spontaneously started.\n\nI also don't have the power to get these stories up in the client, or anything else like that, but I do have a personal allotment of RP that I can share with another player or two (very infrequently, before anyone gets idea that I'm Miss. Moneybags!)\n\nI realize this might make some players feel a little left out, but I hope instead you can be happy for the people able to participate, and encourage the Rioters in your region to do similar things for you too!  (Don't bully them - but let them know it went well!  ;)  \n\nIn my perfect world, there'd be lots of little, personalized, games and ways for players and Rioters to interact with each other, all around the world!

I think you did really well for typing this on a phone - there are lots of words and turns of phrases that I'm sure autocorrect tried to mutilate.

I love the idea that the Blood Orange Inn is where the most loyal captains and crew hang out - that's a really nice touch :)  I think you could stand to mix up the sentence length in the opening paragraph to help it flow a little better - it comes across as a little halting with so many short sentences next to each other.

Excellent turns of phrase here, with a good tempo.  \"...spit in his eye and bit him right back...\" in particular, is a great phrase that goes along at a great clip.  I like the tall-tale framing you're using - exactly the sort I was hoping for - with a salty sailor spinning yarns to an audience hungry for any possible clue.  I also like that you never use his Tahm Kench name, instead using the euphemistic 'two-coats' moniker.  Almost like calling the devil  \"Old Nick\" for fear of drawing his attention.
