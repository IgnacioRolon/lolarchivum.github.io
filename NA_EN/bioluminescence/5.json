Its a shame that you dont sell these, id totally buy one. Never been much of an artsy or DIYer but I think I might give it a try since your guide is so detailed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ham døg","date":"2016-01-31T20:29:07.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew you played a lot of sona, and that I rekt you as draven (pce pce pls dont hurt me), but I never knew you could do this!

Sometimes I've added black bars to fill up any excess space, other times I have cropped off non-important parts of the image instead.\n\nThe tricky part is getting the image the right size - it all depends on what you set the DPI to.  Some of the more heavyweight image editing programs will actually let you set the exact print size of the image - which would be ideal!  Otherwise you'd need to carefully take the size you want, multiply it by the DPI, and re-size the image to that many pixels.\n\nGood luck and I'd love to see what you come up with!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"thedome1999","date":"2016-02-03T06:01:56.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just finished mine, a tree might be missing somewhere but who can tell ;) http://imgur.com/a/rKShK \nThanks for sharing the awesome tutorial!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-03T16:15:37.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thedome1999,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Zui3AjH1,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2016-02-03T06:01:56.344+0000)\n>\n> I just finished mine, a tree might be missing somewhere but who can tell ;) http://imgur.com/a/rKShK \n> Thanks for sharing the awesome tutorial!\n\nAwesome!  You've done a great job with that.  Still in one piece?\n\nThese things (with the gloss paper and the glass front panel) can be really tricky to photograph (especially in artificial light) so I know your photo pain :)\n\nI can recommend taking a black sharpie pen to the joints of the frame to help hide the gaps at the corners.  I've actually been considering taking a pen to the edges of my paper too, to give it more of a defined edge, but while I'm sure that would work awesome on the Braum/Ryze/Gragas/Varrus campfire scene, I don't know if a black border would be overwhelming for this, lighter colored, scene.  I too have a couple of ragged edges where the white paper shows though, you see.\n\n(And no-one is going to notice your missing trees unless you tell them ;D  I know how damn fiddly they are though!)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"thedome1999","date":"2016-02-03T06:03:26.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the bad picture i finished it like 5 minutes ago and it's midnight","replies":[]},{"poster":"sumdee","date":"2016-02-02T23:47:15.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by \"fancy paper?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-03T00:04:19.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lightcool777,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Zui3AjH1,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-02-02T23:47:15.307+0000)\n>\n> What do you mean by \"fancy paper?\"\n\nI mean the thickest photo paper you can find - you want the highest quality image print you can wrangle, and normal copy paper will result in a rather dull and flimsy end result.
