[fan fic contest results]","subforum":"Community Creations","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/17fdpYO.jpg\r\n\r\n#Congratulations to our three* winners: NegaDKR, Aguamagician, and Eevlynn!\r\n\r\nThe results are in, and I have finished giving my feedback on the [PROJECT: FICTION fan-fiction competition](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/aOV8UEy9-fan-fic-micro-competition-project-fiction?show=nested)!  Our mission to the PROJECT universe resulted in a _wealth_ of harrowing mission reports, traumatic audio-log transcripts, and tear-jerking memory readouts.  For those interested in some cold, hard, uncaring, statistics, you all created:\r\n\r\n* 77 entries, (within the time limit)\r\n* 37 mentions of Leona, \r\n* 30 of Zed, \r\n* 25 of Master Yi, \r\n* 23 of Lucian, \r\n* 21 mentions of Fiora, and \r\n* 16 of Yasuo.\r\n\r\n(Thanks to CaptainM&aring;rvelous for running the numbers for me while I was judging.  I would have used champ icons to make this prettier, but this post is looooong already.)\r\n\r\nIncredible work by everyone who entered - you all made judging a wonderfully difficult task :D  It was a joy to read these all.  The winners should be getting a little something through their client by midday today (PST).  Speaking of the winners, jack in, zone out, and enjoy these stories from the PROJECT universe:\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n##Player&#039;s Choice Winner (16 votes\\*\\*): NegaDKR (NA)\r\n **Date: Classified**\r\n **PROJECT: Zed**\r\n **Status: Unstable**\r\n \r\n Specimen has been growing increasingly hostile ever since VR training session with **PROJECT: Shen**.  Specimen said to have stared upon its fellow **PROJECT** for several minutes, ignoring all commands before eventually entering combat mode and attacking **PROJECT: Shen**. Both specimens were put into controlled stasis before severe damage could be made onto either **PROJECT**. \r\n \r\n **PROJECT: Zed** has been subjected with higher levels of **SERUM** dosage since then, but each increased injection has been met with more and more hostility. If specimen continues resisting **SERUM** effects and growing unruliness, forced shut down may be only option.\r\n \r\n Log: End\r\n \r\n **Date: Classified** \r\n **PROJECT: Zed**\r\n **Status: Missing**\r\n \r\n Specimen has broken out of containing unit and all connection towards it have been lost. All attempts of search and recapture have been met with negative results, other **PROJECT** units are being sealed and monitored until further notice.\r\n \r\n Lead Researcher Stanwick Piddly has issued a forced shut down upon **PROJECT: Zed** when found. Specimen will be scrapped and parts used for future **PROJECT** units.\r\n \r\n Log: End\r\n \r\n  ~~Date: Classified~~\r\n ~~PROJECT: Zed~~\r\n ~~Status: HOSTILE!~~\r\n \r\n~~SPECIMEN HAS ATTACKED LABORATORY AND IS KILLING RESEARCHERS LEFT AND RIGHT SOMEONE HEL-~~\r\n\r\n**Log: End**\r\n\r\n([Original post link here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/aOV8UEy9-fan-fic-micro-competition-project-fiction?comment=0007 ))\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n##Judges-Choice Winner: Aguamagician (NA)\r\n\r\n**Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead  Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is dead Zed is\r\n **\r\n \r\n _Download of program_ **PROJECT: ZED personality overlay** _interrupted due to unexpected power loss._\r\n \r\n _Continuing with wireless data transfer..._\r\n \r\n _Incoming transmission: Video Feed Corrupted.

They&#039;re trying to pass it off as a simple terrorist attack - hah! How would you explain the sheer amount of destruction to that street after the explosions? No technology that I know of could cause that kind of damage. Plus, how does any of that police report explain how I was the ONLY survivor this mess who _also _miraculously managed to get away with only a broken leg? (Oh wait, I &quot;lied about being there&quot; as far as they&#039;re concerned. Silly me.)\r\n>\r\n> And the biggest mysteries of them all are the ones that I didn&#039;t even get to report thanks to the _wonderful _police force: Who, and **what**, was she and why did she save **me **(well, most of me, anyway - hah!) of all people...?\r\n> \r\n> All I wanted were some donuts from Pantheon&#039;s Bakery...instead, I got a bunch of pain and now I donut (hah!) see any other option than to take the detective work into my own hands and find out just what exactly is going on here.\r\n>\r\n> **She **might be a good place to start.\r\n>\r\n> Broken leg or not, I&#039;m going to find you, whoever you are.

It&#039;s people like yourself that make these competitions a _delight_ to read :D\r\n\r\nThank you ALL so much :D\r\n\r\n###### \\* Yep, I said there&#039;d be two winners but I kept editing this post over and over again, trying to decide between Aguamagician and Eevlynn, and life is too short for decisions _so_ difficult.\r\n###### \\*\\* Curious about the voting?  I checked with the guys who work behind the scenes on the boards to find out the actual up and down vote totals, and NegaDKR had the most up votes with 16.  I dislike the boards system for measuring popularity (as mentioned in one of the comments here) so I had to do the best with what I had.  Downvotes are mean, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2015-09-18T17:47:21.370+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations to NegaDKR, Aguamagician, and Eevlynn!

I didn't go to bio-school for four years just to have punks like you... wait.  What am I saying.\n\nAnyway.  I was talking to one of the peeps who work on the Boards side of things today, and they said that if I wanted to run another fan-fic competition in the future, I should reach out to them to get help letting more people know about it in time to enter.
