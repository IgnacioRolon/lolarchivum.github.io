I AM SIMPLY POSTING ONE OF MY OWN FAN-FICTION STORIES ABOUT BARD.  I&#039;M NOT EVEN ON THE NARRATIVE TEAM :)  I&#039;LL STOP SHOUTING NOW!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Y8K6fqw.jpg\n\nSoundtrack: [http://youtubedoubler.com/eMAT](http://youtubedoubler.com/eMAT) \n(I recommend turning the volume down on the login screen music.)\n\n>#One Winter's Catch\n\nYes it&rsquo;s true - my grandmother met the Bard once - when she was long haired and young.  It was many years ago and life was terribly hard for our village - and we were sure we would die of a winter that had forgotten how to end.\n\nIt was a bitter cold morning - tiny puddles fractured at her step as my grandmother walked to the lake to spend her day fishing.  Other food was hard to find and the plants would not wake.  The cold bit at her hands, though she wrapped them in wool and she was wearing all of the clothes she owned all at once.  Even as she lay in her bed as death called to her, many years later, she said she never wished such a cold on anyone else.\n\nShe sculled her coracle to the middle of the lake - where the early mist made it feel like she was alone in a cloud - and settled in with rod and net.   After a few peaceful minutes, the cloud parted and she saw another fisherman in a too-small vessel - wrapped as she was against the cold and almost spherical.  This was surprising.  She did not recognise him, but she called out a greeting and she remembered he returned it kindly.\n\nSuddenly, her lure twitched!  Once.  Twice.  Three times and splash!  She hauled a fish into her arms.  It was a good fish - a bigger fish than she&rsquo;d seen recently, with a rainbow flash upon its belly.  It was as long as my forearm, and fat as summers-end.\n\nWhen she was settled again, she looked over at the other fisherman - and he held up a fish even bigger than hers!  It was almost as long as my full arm and sparkled in the pale sunlight like stars!  She hollered a congratulations - but in her secret heart she was jealous that he&rsquo;d hooked a bigger fish than she.  She decided she&rsquo;s show him how our village could fish better than that, and settled in for a long day.\n\nAnd so it was - they sat, alone together, and fished for the day.  The timorous sun rose and fell and no fish would show themselves for hours at a time.  By even-time, my grandmother tells that she considered giving up - the fish were not showing.  She glanced up just in time to see the first star rise when suddenly a stirring!  Her lure twitched - once, twice, three times and SPLASH!  She pulled a monster of a fish into her tiny boat!  So big it was that she almost tipped into the water with it!\n\nExhausted, she knew that she would have won the envy of the other fisherman - and she would have fed the village for a week!  But when she looked over - her fishing companion held upon his lap an even bigger fish.  She had heard stories of such a fish - but it almost obscured his whole boat, it was so fat and shiny.\n\nMy grandmother, stubborn as all grandmothers eventually are, would not have this!  Though the sun was down she called out to the fisherman and challenged him!  The next thing they caught, she said, whoever had the biggest catch would be the winner and must claim the other the superior fisher!\n\nEvery time she told us this story, his reply was different.  Sometimes he said &ldquo;I accept your challenge, pretty girl!&rdquo;  Other times he said &ldquo;You are courageous and I will match your skill with honor!&rdquo;  When I asked her about this, as a child, she eventually told me she could never remember the words he used - only that she was sure he was pleased with her challenge and had accepted.\n\nAnd so they sat - as the sky unfolded its beauty, and the silks of the heavens painted stories in far away tapestries.  But as beautiful as the night was - deadly too in that winter.  Her toes which had hurt for hours, now burned - a very bad sign, she knew.  The mist, their constant companion, started to thin and the lake was so still that she felt like she was falling into the sky on all sides, and the huge, brilliant, moon now looking down upon her twin in the waters.\n\nSuddenly, there was a twitch on her lure.  This was it!  It twitched once.  It twitched twice!  Finally it twitched three times!  But all that was on the end of her line was a little wooden box, no bigger than your fist.  She heard splashing from the other fisherman - and for the first time she saw him struggle with his catch - he pulled and hauled and struggled and fought!  She couldn&rsquo;t see what his catch could be at first, but when she followed the line it was with a gasp that she saw what he was drawing near - the reflection of the very moon itself!\n\nIt was impossible!  But he pulled and struggled until finally he leaned over the edge and pulled the moon out of the water!  It was as big as a large coracle itself and glowed so bright!  He picked it up like it was a feather and held it aloft, looking to my grandmother.\n\nAnd she looked down at the tiny little box.  The very moon from the sky compared to a teeny tiny box.  He had clearly won.  She was about to call her congratulations, when something told her to open the tiny box in her lap.\n\nDo you think she should have opened it?\n\nThe little box was old, and wet and had a tiny latch.  She held it in one hand, while her wrapped fingers struggled with that latch.  It felt warm - but she told herself it was probably the cold sickness settling into her hands.\n\nFinally the latch clicked and she carefully&hellip; carefully&hellip; creaked the hinge until&hellip; SPLASH!\n\nA huge flash of light hit her and she fell out of the coracle!  The water would surely kill her, and she thrashed and gasped, even as her eyes struggled to see once more.  Her hands made contact with something she hoped was the overturned boat and she pulled herself to the air.\n\nWhat she saw amazed her.  Can you guess?  All about her was the singing of birds and the splashing of fish - all in the beautiful daytime!  The sun, brighter than she remembered it, filled the world with warmth and love and spring sang all around her.  She felt strong hands pull her into a boat, even as she wondered.  When she looked up, it was the masked face of the Bard that looked down upon her - and she knew he was pleased.  He handed her the empty little wooden box, and daintily stepped upon the edge of the coracle - not tilting it even a little bit.  Then he bowed, once, and leapt to the skies above like the sparks above this very campfire.\n\nShe would show me the little wooden box now - the box that she told us all had held the sun of spring captive for too long.  She&rsquo;d say that Bard had helped her find it, and save the village from an endless winter.  She&rsquo;d tell us that that year was a bountiful harvest with the best fish and the richest fields.  Mostly, though, she&rsquo;d tell us how she beat Bard in a fishing contest - because surely the only catch greater than the beautiful moon, is the glorious sun.\n\n__________________________\n\nWhat did you think?

I especially like it as a contemplation of elemental magic in a high-magic setting like Runeterra, where the sun is not just a ball of burning hydrogen but also the reflection of an idea. In a way, just like most magic is the manifestation of human thoughts and desires (e.g. \"I hate you\" becomes a fireball or a Vader-style Force-choke), you can imagine the magic that surrounds Runeterra's sun as a \"thought\" belonging to the universe. \"A winter that had forgotten how to end\" plays with this idea in an intriguing way: an aberration in the elements suggests an aberration in the thoughts of the universe.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=3zEoMJKZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-14T15:53:37.509+0000)\n>\n> the plants would not wake.\n\nSame as above. I like the idea of personifying the environment in this way.\n\nIf you're looking for critique, though, I did find the descriptions of suffering a bit…tiresome? I'm not quite sure how to put it. It almost felt like you were going straight for a pathos cash-in before building up the stakes. A lesser version of the problem of, \"hey, here's a character, and I'll tell you they're sympathetic, then I'll kill them off. Emotional reaction where?\" Absent more setup about their hardship, I feel like it would be better to go subtler with the tearjerker aspects. The reader doesn't really know these people yet, and asking for more than a bit of \"aw, that's sad\" is perhaps a bit too ambitious, IMO. It sort of feels like someone walking up to you, meeting you for the first time, and unloading all their deepest sadness at once.

(\"settled in with rod and net\". Maybe tack on something about waiting a few peaceful minutes, then move to a new paragraph.) Then collapse the rest into something shorter? I'm not clear on why she didn't see him before that moment. Was he doing a reverse Batman?\n\nIf so, maybe: \"She saw another fisherman in his boat. She wasn't sure why she hadn't noticed him before, as he was within a stone's throw of her coracle. At first, he seemed to be a bearded old man, hunched over and swaddled in so many layers that he was virtually spherical: a big ball of dull gray cloth, adorned with a beard, with a fishing rod sticking out, rocking back and forth in his boat.\"\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=3zEoMJKZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-14T15:53:37.509+0000)\n>\n> Suddenly, her lure twitched!

But the raw ingredients are there. The part about “a rainbow flash upon its belly” is awesome. Maybe make the summers-end comparison a bigger part of the section? The “rainbow flash” obviously works great there. Then talk about its strength, its vitality, and its “fatness” in summer-y terms. But I would suggest you lead with the part about summers-end, rather than making it a closer.

The mist, their constant companion, started to thin and the lake was so still that she felt like she was falling into the sky on all sides, and the huge, brilliant, moon now looking down upon her twin in the waters.\n\nThis could use a once-over revision, but I like the idea.

Phrasing could be improved, maybe?\n\nMaybe explore a bit more why she was uneasy about opening the box? Like, realizing that magic was in the air, and that box could contain just about anything?

The water would surely kill her, and she thrashed and gasped, even as her eyes struggled to see once more.  Her hands made contact with something she hoped was the overturned boat and she pulled herself to the air.\n\nNeat, but I think you need to be clearer about her hitting the water. Less meandering, more direct. Like: “A flash of light hit her. She could see nothing but blinding radiance, and lost all perception of up or down. She felt like she was floating, or falling, through this endless brightness—which did, in fact, end quite abruptly when she crashed into the dark, icy water.”\n\nThat’s a bit too meandering, as well. Hmm.

Can you guess?  All about her was the singing of birds and the splashing of fish - all in the beautiful daytime!  The sun, brighter than she remembered it, filled the world with warmth and love and spring sang all around her.  She felt strong hands pull her into a boat, even as she wondered.  When she looked up, it was the masked face of the Bard that looked down upon her - and she knew he was pleased.  He handed her the empty little wooden box, and daintily stepped upon the edge of the coracle - not tilting it even a little bit.

Funny to watch in a gif; not as charming in practice.\n\nOk so first off - I remember the monster journal and reading each one avidly.  Why didn't I comment?  I don't know - I really should have.  I enjoyed them and it's _exactly_ my kind of thing.  That one is on me, plain and simple - I read it, I _loved_ it, and I didn't even comment.  That's just crap of me.\n\nThe only excuse I have for the Ahri story (as it's a perfect length for me to read) is that it was posted before I was a Rioter.  I realize that doesn't excuse the rest of Riot - but I can only speak for myself.  I particularly like the nursery rhyme method taken there - they are fantastic ways of conveying cultural fears and warnings.\n\nI'm reading through the Lucian comic now - no idea how I missed it the first time round.  Maybe I clicked on the topmost link and only found one page.  Not sure.  Certainly little excuse.  That panel with Lucian wiggling his eyebrows was impressively creepy though.  Looks like the series stopped after the image of the Unbroken King?  Or I'm missing the rest somehow.  Did it just end?\n\nRise of the Glorious Evolution, and Ionian Nights, are both more meaty than I usually have time to spare for the boards.  If it'd take me half an hour to read, then that's a lot of other threads I can't read or look at.  I take so long to post anything (because of fear of mucking it up) that writing a post can easily take me all morning.  For example this one - I was wanting to write some volunteer VO today before the meeting :/  Anyway - I know that's a crap thing to hear.  That if people get really invested in their story, it lowers the chance of me replying, basically because tl;dr.  I applaud the people who DO read and give feedback!\n\nThe Unofficial Telling of League of Legends Lore That Makes Everything Fit (part1) is a tricky one.  I have some small amount of knowledge about what's going on in the background (and I really do mean small amount) but possibly enough information to get me into trouble.  I can appreciate the effort that's gone into that attempt to connect everyone, but other than a simple \"Wow - that's really impressive!\" I can't really go into much more without being in danger of being right and leaking something I shouldn't, or worse - being out of date and leaking something that's not even true any more!\n\nJust read the Braum story, and I'm having to blink a bit of the tear from my eye.  It was a good story, though I personally have never been sure if Braum was ever a boy or not or if like Bard, he's eternal and forever :)  I suspect the fact that, like my story,as it is being told by someone (ooh, who could it be?) means that the story can be as factual or fictional as we like - as long as it is _true_ to the character.  Not sure why I didn't read this the first time round.\n\nNow, I'm running out of time before I have to get ready for work.  I know there's more to your post, ForCarthage (are you and Darrosh Jewfist acquainted?) but I'll have to come back to it.  One quick question - should I go back to these older posts and post what I should have done back then?  About how much I enjoyed the monster journal entries?  Or the Ahri nursery rhyme?  Or is it too late.  Or, more likely, is that not the point and that too little too late is exactly that.  Can I start fixing this?  Or are you here to say I cannot.  I can only speak for my own actions, remember.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-07-15T21:09:58.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... :O\n\nI thought everyone forgot about the journal entries.

They were quirky and wonderful and I'm sure contributed to the current state of affection people feel for little ol' Scuttlecrab :)  I would love it if you (or you both) did more.

I think I'll definitely tackle as much as people are willing to check out (and then some), though it may not be at the speed I created the first set.\n\nSo yeah, I'm going to be going through them again. The order currently sits at Blue Sentinel (already mostly done, just need finishing touches), Dragon, Baron Nashor, Shopkeepers (although I'm under the impression they may get names, so I'm a bit hesitant), and then from there it'll be requests with filling in ones for the poro and Vilemaw along the way. Gosh, there's something exciting about starting this up again. Maybe someday I can upgrade them all with better assets and what not, but that'll be something to tackle later ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"2nd Fiddle","date":"2015-07-18T02:39:45.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always love a good fairy tale.","replies":[]},{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-07-14T23:12:18.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**MEANWHILE IN THE BARREN LAND OF LORE TEAM:**","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-07-14T18:49:05.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it quite a bit.
