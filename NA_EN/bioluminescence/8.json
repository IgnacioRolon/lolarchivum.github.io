(Vote for your favorite stories of the year)","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":42,"down_votes":5,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/5M8hku5.jpg\n------------------------------------------------\n**[EDIT] VOTING IS CLOSED!**\n**Frozen Hearts (248) wins, vs An Explorer's Journey (129)**\n\nFrozen Hearts will go on to battle Confessions of a Broken Blade on the 15th!\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Introduction\nHello lovely people!  So 2018 is coming to a close (holy Rammus that was fast) and I thought it&#039;d be fun to look back at the stories that we got this year.\nAnd pit them against each other in pseudo-deadly combat!\n\nThere was a bunch released - but I&#039;m only going to be considering main-universe Runeterra stories, written content only, and for the sake of brevity, I won&#039;t include champ bios.  So no comics, skin-universe, etc.\n\nThat leaves us, this year, with 25 contestants!\n\nI&#039;ll be pitting two stories against each other, every day at 1:30pm PST, until the 29th of December (if I don&#039;t get hit by a bus).  Today, we begin with...\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n#FROZEN HEARTS vs AN EXPLORER&#039;S JOURNEY (6th December)\n\nIn [Frozen Hearts](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/frozen-hearts/), _by David Slagle_, little Nunu asks his mother a question and she tells him a story.\nIn [An Explorer&#039;s Journey](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/an-explorers-journey/), _by Matthew Dunn_, we read Ezreal&#039;s handwritten account of the discovery of a vault beneath Zaun.\n\nWhich of these stories spoke to you the most?  Do you love snuggling by the fire listening to Nunu&#039;s mum telling you how the world works, or are you more of a fan of pomade and it&#039;s many (and unexpected) uses?  Do you have criticisms of the characterization?  Grammar?  Were there things about these that made you happy or mad?  Take this as an opportunity to revist these stories and identify what worked, or didn&#039;t, for you.  It can be hard to get a discussion going on a story when it&#039;s no longer flavor of the month - so I&#039;m hoping maybe this can be a second chance for us to air some opinions!\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIf this post works, there should be an image showing the schedule for the upcoming lore matches, at the top and also linked [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/5M8hku5.jpg), but alternatively, here they all are written out:\n\n> 6th December: Frozen Hearts vs An Explorer&#039;s Journey\n> 7th December: The Black Powder Plot vs Human Blood\n> 8th December: The Girl Who Came Back vs At the Edge of the World\n> 9th December: Leaving Weh&#039;Le vs Art is Life\n> 10th December: The Cage vs The Shadow Door\n> 11th December: Stone Cold vs Hunter of Shadows\n> 12th December: Stains on a Name vs The Monster of Kalduga Outpost\n> 13th December: The Dreaming Pool vs The Curator&#039;s Gambit\n> 14th December: Then, Teeth vs The True and Ghastly Tale of the Beast of Boleham Tower\n> 15th December: Confessions of a Broken Blade vs &lt;winner from 6th December&gt;\n> 16th December: &lt;winner from 7th December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 8th December&gt;\n> 17th December: Twilight of the Gods vs &lt;winner from 9th December&gt;\n> 18th December: The Eye in the Abyss vs &lt;winner from 10th December&gt;\n> 19th December: Where Icathia Once Stood vs &lt;winner from 11th December&gt;\n> 20th December: From the Ashes vs &lt;winner from 12th December&gt;\n> 21st December: Whom Does the Desert Know? vs &lt;winner from 13th of December&gt;\n> 22nd December: The Principles of Strength vs &lt;winner from 14th December&gt;\n> 23rd December: QUARTER FINAL: &lt;winner from 15th December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 16th December&gt;\n> 24th December: QUARTER FINAL: &lt;winner from 17th December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 18th December&gt;\n> 25th December: QUARTER FINAL: &lt;winner from 19th December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 20th December&gt;\n> 26th December: QUARTER FINAL: &lt;winner from 21st December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 22nd December&gt;\n> 27th December: SEMI-FINAL: &lt;winner from 23rd December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 24th December&gt;\n> 28th December: SEMI-FINAL: &lt;winner from 25th December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 26th December&gt;\n> 29th December: FINAL: &lt;winner from 27th December&gt; vs &lt;winner from 28th December&gt;\n\nAbbreviated image here:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9Nn2s1E.jpg\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nI&#039;ve posted this at 1:30pm PST, and I&#039;ll try to aim for that time for counting up the votes (this is daily!) and posting the next match!\n(Sorry, in advance, all you Red Name Tracker fans who aren&#039;t so into the lore.

His self-reporting obviously makes it all sound more routine than it actually is, in a vain attempt to make himself look better, but that's part of why the story is so fun. He's a hero with realistic flaws, and I find that compelling. \n\nPerhaps it's because I'm ensconced in academia... but I know people who *must* have an internal monologue like this. And it's hilarious to see it written out. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the writers were inspired by real-life stories about academics; his obsession with pleasing the faceless \"Explorer's Guild\" is such an obvious parallel with pleasing one's academic colleagues.\n\nActually, in writing this out, I'm seeing why maybe this story doesn't appeal to a large swath of League's fanbase :P But nevertheless, the people responsible for that character and story should be proud. You captured something real there, and I appreciate it very much. Ezreal, as a character, speaks to my life experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Elf0491","date":"2018-12-06T23:10:08.840+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"With all due respect, I disagree completely. And it has nothing to do with the fact that it is couched in a broader context of academic institutions and how they function. There are two main things I strongly dislike about it:\n\nEzreal is an arrogant snob. From reading some of his other lore, I get the impression that he is actually a somewhat accomplished explorer, but this particular story depicts him as someone who clearly has no idea what he's doing (he brought no food with him?!), yet presses on ahead recklessly anyway, destroys ancient artifacts (the door) that could have contained very valuable information, and after unleashing mayhem on the city, has the gall to place 100% of the blame on everyone but himself. All in the pursuit for his own personal glory, which is clearly the only thing that even remotely matters to him. Not preserving history. Not finding answers. Certainly not the lives of other people. Just himself. If this story accurately represents Ezreal's character, then I can't consider him a hero at all. I find his flaws 'realistic' in the sense that yes, some people are narcissistic and short-sighted, and none of those things are good.\n\nMy second problem is fairly simple: plot armor. Ezreal shows up woefully unprepared, and actually stumbles upon some things that sound like they have some real power. Despite this seeming imbalance, there is absolutely no indication that Ezreal was ever in any real trouble. It makes the story completely zero-stakes, as Ezreal doesn't need to utilize his skill, determination, intelligence, or any other potential factors to survive. He just gets to because dumb-luck-plot-armor. Now I realize that this may partly be because it is written as though from his perspective, and he may have rather selectively left a few things out. That then just goes back to my first point. Why do I want to read something that just serves as an ego trip for the 'writer' (not the real author of course)?

There wasn't much subtlety in that story. I did like his other story a lot, where he's talking to the cultist and haggling, and his other story where he's cave diving for that vial or whatever it was. It's just the journal that seemed off; he was written to be a pompous idiot after a getrichquick scheme instead of somebody who powers through stuff with his mentality.\n\nI feel like he is ready to be a good character and have depth, but we haven't seen much of it yet. I'm ready for it, but it had better happen when or before he meets Lux (which seems inevitable).

Similarly Ezreals story but I haven't played as much of him since his rework as I have nunu.\n\nAs for Ezreals story I felt it could have been fleshed out a bit more. The personality and humour were there but the exploration aspect didn't quite hit the mark. I would have liked more details with regards to the place he was exploring, the challenges he faced and major successes. The diary format was fun and very appropriate plus the first person account was refreshing but it also felt a bit disjointed. Both geographically and timewise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChunLii","date":"2018-12-06T21:56:05.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want to say Principles of Strenght and From the Ashes were the two best stories of the year for me.
