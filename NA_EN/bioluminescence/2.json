Because I am all over that.\n\nI think that, for many games, the non-linear, asynchronous, storytelling is excellent for certain types of narrative information - Dark Souls, like you say, does well for giving you information about the world, and some limited information about relationships between characters.  \n\nI believe that the VO lines for champs in League, for example, excel in non-linearly building up an understanding of a character, and the character's relationships with other champions.  And it does so in a way that doesn't require breaking out of the game experience, which is great and highly accessible.  \n\nEven Dark Souls, for all its wonderfulness, generally requires you to go into a menu screen (or rather, the inventory) to read background text for the items, to start your learning process.  (Obviously later, you can use those clues to gain information in the world - such as where an item was found and its relationship to other items and characters - but that's only really useful _after_ you've read the descriptions.)\n\nThe position of those objects is environmental storytelling - another wonderfully immersive method of conveying story, and one that doesn't require you to break out of the game and shift into a different mode.  For example, The Return of the Obra Dinn is pretty much 'environmental storytelling: the game' - where the placement of objects, people, and the contents of them, conveys the narrative of what went on in that location.  It's like reading a crime scene.  Many many games (some of which I've worked on) have used this to deepen the sense of immersion of the player - the most basic form of which is usually a trail of blood leading away from a trap or hazard in a horror game.\n\nEven League experiments with some environmental storytelling, even though Summoner's Rift isn't 'canon' to Runeterra at the moment.  The stories its telling, however, are the stories of both the history of the game (finding old, retired, items hiding in the jungle, or in the goods of the shopkeepers) or the stories of the Rift - such as the cracks emanating from the Baron Pit showing the corruption, or even the wear marks on the lanes implying an age to the entire location.\n\nFor games, there are usually some storytelling methods that are more appropriate than others.  Your typical linear single-player shooter or RPG for example, is often best served by dialogue, environmental narrative, sometimes playable flashbacks, and some will have cutscenes; how you feel about those can vary from person to person.  Asking the player of a typical shooter game to stop and read will break up the tempo of the game, and they'll likely avoid doing so if possible.\n\nOther games, such as say, League, find ways to convey information in a way that won't interrupt your experience, too.  The loading screen tips, the VO lines, the animations, champ models, even the mechanics (if you're a fan of ludonarrative resonance - you couldn't think I wouldn't drop the old buzzwords with this much of a wall of text, could you?), all help convey character and relationships narratives.  What it fails at spectacularly at is linear storytelling.  Or, maybe that's unfair.  What it has failed at so far, is linear storytelling.  One could argue, if you were especially contrary (and what are designers if not contrary), that if you zoom out far enough, there is a linear story being played out on the Rift.  That the release or update of champions, in sync with the stories that exist outside of the game (bios, color stories, short stories, etc.) convey a progression.  The easiest example would be someone who saw Gangplank before Burning Tides, played the game during his 'death', and then saw him post-Update.  That could be considered a linear story, conveyed through the experience of playing the game.\n\nAnd of course, that brings us to the player-narrative.  Every match is a story that the players create - one with highs and lows (too many lows) with villains and heroes and twists and turns and big finishes.  Then there's the narrative of a player's promos, or of the season.  Or their entire experience with League of Legends.\n\nI know that those player-narratives aren't what we generally talk about, but they are critical to the game and in fact work in concert with the more conventional champion narratives we try to convey.  You are experiencing and enacting the narrative of a match with 9 other players, and with 10 champions as your agents.  Like 10 actors on a stage, playing 10 different improvisation characters.  The characters have relationships, quirks, and abilities - a range of expression that molds the player story.\n\nOk, I've written enough nonsense to choke a goat now.  I just get very excited when talking about narrative methods in games, and even though I've wittered on here incessantly, I've only talked about maybe 1% of the fun awesome methods and styles.\n\n\nPS - As an example of where Dark Soul's method was perhaps unexpectedly used, Destiny had a similar out-of-the-game method of gathering story together in their online Grimoire cards.  While some players really enjoyed digging through that as a method of learning about the world, many players chose not to interact with something so disconnected from the game experience.  Sounds familiar to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-11-10T20:46:05.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have anything to add this time but I just love talking about this stuff, too.

Fine by me. I don’t. \n\nBut as an event? Bilgewater has actual story progression with the culmination of 4 character arcs. \n\nThe characters within the story actually had plots and their actions made sense within the framework of the narrative and as character moments \n\nThe magic system was even decently well explained. We saw the limitations of TF’s abilities and how he used his cards. All of which makes the drama around how Graves can think through ways of going around those abilities. Culminating in him giving TF back his card at the end. Which has significance both to the plot and metaphorically as we see Graves’ growth as he returns TF’s power too him giving up the last of his hatred. It was frankly, wonderfully executed. \n\nThe Shurima event? A group of characters that never had anything to do with each other meet up and decide to run away together. Nasus faces down Xerath. And the description of the magic is fine, but since we have no frame of reference for how any of it works or what their limitations are, it just becomes the literary equivalent of fireworks. Pretty enough and fun to watch things explode. But there is no higher meaning to it. Xerath wins because his magic is better than Nasus’s magic. And his magic is better than Nasus’s magic...  because it is. \n\nIf you mean the lore of both places as a whole. Eh. That’s fine. I don’t particularly care about any of the characters and the more I read about the Darkin the more I am convinced the Aspects are idiots (let’s try to kill them all but after making them hate us let’s just make them immortal! What could go wrong?)\n\nSo yeah. Not a fan myself. Not that Bilgewater is doing much better these days. Watching MF do her political maneuvering is fun, and has a touch of deeper meaning with how she compromises her morals to be effective. Making her more like Gangplank. But it’s just running in circles at this point. We already saw her set up TF and Graves to die for her revenge. So nothing new there. And the rest of it is about some eldritch horror below the sea or some crap. And I don’t care about it at all.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-11-09T18:36:26.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's see about the \"not anything to do with eachother\". Nasus witnessed his beloved nation getting destroyed by Xerath, then had to sacrifice his own brother to keep him locked. Xerath was imprisoned thousands of years because of Nasus so they do have a build up. His magic is better than Nasus's for these reasons: 1. Xerath drained the Sun Disc of all its power when he Ascended 2. Xerath got stronger while Nasus weaker and 3. Nasus uses cosmic magic, while Xerath uses Arcane empowered 1000 times by the full power of the cosmic magic from the SunDisc he drained. \nThe higher meaning is that Nasus was willingly to sacrifice himself so that the citizens and Sivir can escape, and Xerath didn't struck Nasus down cause he wanted him to suffer the same way he did, and see his own brother being a monster. \nIf you don't like it that's fine.

Who all run away \"together.\"  And Sivir may be the descendant of Nasus's leader, but.  Eh.  This is the first time they ever see each other.  \n\nAs to the magic.  Sure.  That's a reason why Xerath is stronger.  Now.  How does any of that work?  He sends a bolt of energy that turns rock into vapor instantaneously.  To do that, he is shooting beams of energy hotter than the surface of the Sun.  Why doesn't he just keep shooting that at Nasus?  Why is he changing his spells?  What do the other beams of energy do?  What is Nasus doing?  Why isn't it working?  How does the magic interact?  \n\nI have no idea about any of this.  It's just fire works.\n\nAs to the meaning, we already know that Nasus is self-sacrificing and noble.  That's pretty much everything his own lore says about him.  We also already saw Renekton became a monster.  That tells us nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-11-09T19:50:08.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He wasnt chanting them he was casting them instantly. And his spells do different things his arcane bolts were exploding like artilery fire, his normal beams were basically normal beams, his telekinessis was telekinessis, and the beam that stunned Nasus basically was a stun. He was changing his spells to have more effect on Nasus. The reason why Nasus's magic wasn't working was because Xerath was too durable for it, tho his volcanic fire and wither burst damaged him quite a bit. \nAbout the first time they see eachother, what was Gangplank seeing TF and Graves then?

I’m on my phone and auto-correct is a bitch. \n\nYes. I know he casts the spells instantly. What I don’t know is why is Xerath using this specific spell at this specific time. And why doesn’t he do it again?  He hits Nasus straight in the gut once. Then just let’s him get back up. Why didn’t he just keep blasting him with his best spell over and over?  Is he using a Vancian casting system? Can he only use each spell once? Does he just get bored with the spell so he tries something different? Can he cast multiple spells at once?  If, he can create beams hotter than the Sun why doesn’t he just do that next to Nasus?  Why is it a beam in the first place? If the volcano hurt Nasus. Do it again. On repeat. Until he’s dead. Or do it bigger.  And if he cant do it bigger, why not?\n\nAll of this is just handwaved with Sun magic. Compare to TF. Where we know that his magic is connected completely with his cards. He can make explosions but only as far as he can throw his card. He can teleport but only a small distance and he has to hold his card. \n\nThis is the difference between magic as tactic and magic as spectacle. I don’t care about magic as spectacle. Because it’s just people writing about how super cool this beam of energy is and then this beam is. It’s meaningless. \n\nThe first sentence of your last paragraph makes no sense.

Having Illaoi's color story, The Burden, before the Epilogue of Burning Tides, works chronologically, but 'ruins' the surprise of Shadow and Fortune introducing Illaoi for the first time.  Then if I were to place Illaoi's bio and mini-game immediately following, would (in my opinion) be too much of Illaoi testing captains all at once.  But that's all it is here - my opinion.  I'd tried to keep as much of Illaoi's mystery intact, without breaking the chronological order of events, as I could.\n\nAs for the Gangplank bio - again, it's down to opinion rather than a definitively right or wrong answer.  My intention was that, the last few lines of Gangplank's bio speaks to the return of the Reaver King, the threat of his rise - and that's still to come, rather than detailed in Shadow and Fortune or the related pieces.\n\nGlad you liked it, Atgo!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-11-10T09:12:53.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kinda makes me wanna do another one of my field guides for Bilgewater....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-11-09T14:47:04.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short, curated playlist, right? :D\n\nBut thanks, Bio! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2018-11-09T12:53:16.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**\"So the scuttlebutt goes\"**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-11-09T12:05:21.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why we love the lore team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2018-11-09T09:02:08.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THE MUSIC SUGGESTIONS THO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2018-11-09T07:44:38.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is awesome.
