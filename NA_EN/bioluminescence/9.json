I really do hate that 500 word limit because I could have done so much more with more words, but hopefully this will work.\n\n> One was a fool and the other a leech, but Anebos could not voice his disdain upon punishment of exile or execution.\n> \n> The priest merely stood by and did his duties diligently, as if this wasn’t a direct sin against the Sun’s wishes. He anointed long reeds with frankincense and myrrh, lighting them and mumbling the sacred words while Azir disrobed behind him. The Ritual was a protracted process that had dragged on from sun-up to when the sun was highest. It was here that Azir would be bathed by the rest of the Sun’s Priesthood, an act that would wash away all his earthly sins...and Azir had many to rid himself of. The young Emperor spoke the words many had said before him: \n> \n> _“I have not killed unjustly, I have not stolen. I have not turned back to You on your holy days. I have not slandered. I have not polluted myself. I have not forced myself upon a man or woman…”_\n> \n> The priest turned his head to the wall and rolled his eyes. He could not speak a word against his lies.\n> \n> Anebos had been the pious leader of the Sun’s Priesthood for countless summers, having overseen the previous Emperor’s life unfold from diapers until death. The priest did not believe the stories told of He-Who-Is-Beloved’s death. He knew that the curling snake of a man who stood in the corner watching over his “brother” had something to do with it. To Anebos, the man was still nameless. He refused to speak the name that the slave should not have.\n> \n> The head priest finally turned to the Emperor and dried him with the towel, and the underlings rushed forward. They would dress him as a man, but he would come down as an Ascended. Anebos led the procession from the Sun's Temple through the City of a Thousand Pillars, Azir and his false brother behind him, followed by the very pregnant Royal Wife who led his other two children. Behind her was the rest of the retinue of priests and scribes. Anebos stepped quickly up the stairs and took his specified place on the outside of the Holy Dais. When he looked again, Azir was leaning into the leech's face, whispering something unheard. Anebos swallowed the bile in his throat when he saw the Emperor kiss the sullied man's cheek. \n> \n> Anebos rose his voice and spoke the final prayer loud enough for it to echo into the crowd below as Azir stepped into the circle. They'd been cheering as they strode to the Dais but fell silent once the shattering noise of the Sun's light crashed down upon the platform. In moments, the silence turned to screams of outrage. Anebos turned and witnessed Azir's 'trusted man' shove him from the Holy Light. The Emperor vaporized instantly. The screams turned into ones of terror behind him but before he could react, the blast hit him as well and Anebos turned to ash with the rest of the city.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-05-16T02:50:54.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trash Empress,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GGYEUcJc,comment-id=003c,timestamp=2016-05-11T12:34:11.982+0000)\n>\n> One was a fool and the other a leech, but Anebos could not voice his disdain upon punishment of exile or execution.\n\nSo before I go any further, this is a killer opening line.  Maybe lost of a bit punch at the end there with the unclear punishment, but it still grabs you by the throat and gets your attention!  Here, then, is a narrator with _opinions_!  With flaws and a perspective that isn't washed and modernized and given the benefit of all the knowledge that we have from our windows into all the players with their color texts.\n\nI love the attention to detail of the ceremony - it reeks of verisimilitude with the creation of handmade incense and ritualized bathing.  Some very nice touches there.  I suspect most people don't even know how incense is made so I appreciate your research here.\n\nI suspect the final paragraph is where the yoke of the 500 word limit really hit you hard.  There's a lot going on, all at once, and it gets a tiny bit muddled.  What does it mean to say \"the shattering noise of the Sun's light crashed down\"?  Are we talking about the Sun Disc shattering and falling?  It gets a little poetic at the expense of clarity and I can only guess that it was because you were forced to choose between evocative imagery, or clarity of action, and with 500 words you couldn't squeeze both out of the meager allowance.\n\nLastly, I also appreciate your judicious use of capitalization for terms or phrases that are of critical importance to our very traditionalist narrator - things like \"Royal Wife\", \"Holy Dias\", and \"Ritual\".  This underlines just how sacrosanct the objects, titles, and actions of his world are to him.  She's not just the royal wife, she embodies the role of the Royal Wife - and that is title and promise all in one.  You can tell that he has some form of respect for her that he doesn't even afford Azir in this (not any more).\n\nThe ending is sudden - just as the event itself was.  It's almost humorously without complications.  For a man so obsessed with ritual, so full of opinions on what was happening and the worthiness (and lack thereof) of all involved, you just _know_ he'd love to get an \"I told you so\" in there - but he is denied any opinion in a last bout of injustice.  Also, the word limit probably put paid to that too ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doctor Kill","date":"2016-05-10T03:03:47.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-05-10T16:48:54.376+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DynoBot,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GGYEUcJc,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-05-10T03:03:47.782+0000)\n>\n> way back when the kingdom of shurima was first established, it was well known that the land of shurima was very rich in the shiny mineral called gold; everyone wanted some, but these greedy shurimanz were being jews and not sharing...eventually war broke out over the gold since everyone else was poor in comparison and wanted only a tiny portion of the gold that the shurimanz refused to share... \n\nDynoBot - I'm not sure how you can imagine that using 'jews' as a derogatory term is going to be OK.

Sometimes, I wondered what the Star Forger would do, were he to learn that his celestial power was being siphoned and used to birth immortals of such power that they could even stand up to his immortal masters. It is an idle thought, something to consider in the times between wars.\n\nShurima was poised to take over the world itself. This, I could not allow. There was no army on the planet capable of standing up to the empire as it marched. The numbers were nothing. It was a simple feat to turn an average warrior into a raging wave of fury, grant one mortal the power to fight against ten at once. But Shurima's magics made it difficult to turn the tide of battle, even for me. And the brothers would be able to fight me. They lacked the power to kill me, but they were too powerful for me to kill easily. The battle would be a stalemate long after Shurima decimated whatever paltry forces I roused to resist them.\n\nSo I had had to take a different approach. An approach that was bearing fruit now—though I stood so far from the empire that the Sun Disc was a mere coin to my eye, I could feel the sudden _wrongness_ in the air. The twisted ritual began to consume the Empire from its heart outwards, the celestial energy from the sun twisting and overloading the magical wards of the Empire.\n\nIt took hours for Shurima to be swallowed up entirely.\n\nI stood and watched all of it.\n\nUnder a moon that glowed with strange, orange light, I felt the last of the Sun Disk's energy settle, as the great relic was buried by its own power underneath the shifting sands.\n\nBeside me, a whirlpool of water emerged from the solid rock of the mountain.\n\nFrom it, emerged an ancient evil. He was bloated, his body stretched to its limit from his recent meal. It did not help his otherwise grotesque image. Outwardly, he looked like a rather fat Shuriman merchant, but not the kind to try and sell you fine linens or golden trinkets. No, he had the sleazy look one might find in a back alley. The kind of man who would sell you a slave that he fathered himself, and never bat an eye. Or rather, he partly looked like it. The flesh of his body was sloughing off, great tears in the skin and muscle hanging out. His form was changing. That, more than anything, was proof that Shurima was well and truly gone.\n\n“So much misery today,” he commented idly, rubbing his stomach. “Whispering to the slave was well worth it. I owe you, brother.”\n\nHe vanished in the next instant, seeking a new land to call his, a new greed to exploit.\n\nI spread my wings.\n\nThere was always another war to fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-05-10T16:09:42.175+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SuperLuigiLXIV,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GGYEUcJc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-10T01:25:08.720+0000)\n>\n> ...Sometimes, I wondered what the Star Forger would do, were he to learn that his celestial power was being siphoned and used to birth immortals of such power that they could even stand up to his immortal masters.

Years ago the pagans who dwelt here feared my kind; and now only the sand-blasted carcass of their once-mighty capital remains. An ample enough carcass to study, naturally, but still quite amusing. Human hubris has yet to be quantified, and that of Shurima’s last emperor is no exception. \n\nNo organic tissue remains. The last time I was here, eleven, twelve hundred years ago (in human time, at least), the pale bones and leering skulls still grinned up at me. The bones were surprisingly inflexible, for such a fragile species. Disintegration revealed a large majority of calcium and magnesium. Pathetically formulaic. However, I will admit to experiencing a brief moment of amusement at the absurdity of their elbows.\n\nI was not paying attention to the Shuriman viewing-sphere the day it fell; my eye was directed elsewhere in Valoran. I later learned the story from a Xer’Sai that I was fortunate enough to dissect (their kidneys have such wonderful use as paperweights), and what garbled, sapient Voidspeak I managed  to discern told me a story of betrayal, and a familial bond between two men who shared neither shape nor blood. Intriguing. The lesser creature, connected to the hive’s consciousness, managed to pick up an witnessing account from second Xer’Sai whom, from what I could make out, had been crawling along the entranceway of the human’s palace. The palace upon which the desert burned. The latter of the Xer'Sai did not survive, naturally, but the former proved quite useful. When dissected, neither have grows back, and for years I have sought to forge my own way into their collected consciousness, and to behold the thoughts of their magnificent specimen of a queen, to no avail. Such fascinating evolution. \n\nI cast a long shadow on the shallow dunes, bits of pottery and the tallest spires of their grandest buildings the only things poking up from the sand. My mind drifts and my tentacles pick through the sand and clay, the buzzing of vultures and the desert's barely audible haze whispering in what humans might call my ears. A rustle. A brush of wind, and my eye flicks downward. Violet light illuminates the scrap of parchment on the ground beneath me. A tentacle scoops it up and I hold it closer for examination. A schematic, blueprints grey with dust and yellow with the sun's heat. A disk, concave at its centre, the golden sheen it had obviously been once painted faded and cracked on the sand blasted parchment. Spidery handwriting in blue ink weaves across the page. A moment. I recall my ancient linguistics. Old Shuriman, Fifth Age. The Last Age. Informal dialect with poor syntax. \n\nIf I could snort, I would. The paper disappears in a flash of violet light. It has managed to last thousands of years in the dunes and it will continue to last in the recesses of a peerless mind for millenia more.

Some say that the whispers of the trickster god Xerath led him towards this path. Others, that a rival kingdom had poisoned his wine and caused him to lose his mind. But either way, Azir would not be stopped until he’d joined Rashar, Haralum, and Sesur-seti in the Palace of the Sun. \n\n“The king had his slaves construct a mighty disc in the shape of the sun to channel its power, and had a thousand priests and magi brought there from across his empire. When all of this was in place, the king had the people of the city assemble. He not only wanted to become a god, but wanted the world to know of his ascension. As he stepped into the center of the disc, Azir bade his priests begin the ritual, thinking he would soon rival the power of the gods.\n\n“But Rashar was angry with Azir’s hubris. He had been beloved by the gods and blessed beyond compare, but still sought to transcend his mortal existence. For that, he could not be spared. \n\n“And so, as Azir stood on the disc and prepared to reach godhood, Rashar smote him with the fury of a thousand suns. Azir and all his priests burned to ash in an instant, and the mighty disc broke in two. The tall towers of Shurima fell, its streets blackened, and the people who’d assembled that day burned with their master. They had stood by and watched as his desire for power grew ever stronger, so they too needed to be punished. In the aftermath of Rashar’s fury, Haralum and Xerath descended to scorch the remains of the city with their lightning. In a day, the strongest empire in the world ceased to be.\n\n“The sins committed that day is the reason we live in the desert, and it is here we shall stay forever. Forget not Azir’s hubris, children, lest you too reach for that which is not yours.”\n_\n-Traditional Shuriman folktale _","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2016-05-10T14:54:19.982+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GGYEUcJc,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-10T00:13:22.264+0000)\n> ##The challenge - \n> \n> We know how [Azir remembers the fall](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/azir), we know how [Xerath remembers the fall](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/xerath), and we even get glimpses of rumors that may have come down the ages about it.

The entire city seemed vibrant with an energy not seen for a long time. I stared off into the crowd, thinking bitterly of how many of those citizens were my siblings of some sort. It hurt my mother, more than he knew and she showed. I supposed he had his shortcomings as much as any father, though who was I to judge? \n\n\nI continued watching the crowd, wondering what made them act his way. Was it fear? It wasn't love, that was certain. Though my father was fair in governmental matters, he was definitely not loved. No, the scandals, the rumors, the harsh militaristic rule, his tunnel vision, all were reasons as to why my father would never be quite as loved as _his_ father. I wondered, how could he dare opt to Ascend now, when Rek'Sai still terrorized the Sai. How could he Ascend now, when radical tribesmen still resisted his imposed rule, becoming more desperate and violent each day. **How could he think he could be a god, when he couldn't even be a father?   \n**\n\nI glanced down at Navir, my younger sister. She seemed too young to quite understand the gravity of the event; that her father was to become a living god. Beside my father, to his right, was the ever-present Xerath, his right hand man. He had always scared me; calm, calculative. He was like a dog, always loyal, always watching. As the pair made it up to the apex of the temple, he turned, and voiced regally and imperially, \"By my decree, from this moment on, _all_ slaves are free. Throughout all of Shurima, there will be no slaves to serve or exist ever again.\" \n\n\nThe crowd's reaction was of a mixed one; many unhappy, but acquiescing, though part of it was no doubt due to my father's status. With that, he turned to Xerath, and, naming him his eternal brother, began the Ascension ritual. And it was there, a little flicker, an internal conflict in Xerath, when I knew something was wrong. My father, royal, unfaithful, arrogant, and blind was obliterated in an instant at the full height of the ceremony. \n\n\nAt first I thought the ritual had gone wrong; was the Sun too powerful? Did my father not deserve it? No, it was _Xerath_, his eternal brother, that destroyed him. As he stepped into the circle, screaming as the full power of the Sun seared his flesh, I was dimly aware that everyone was screaming, crying, running. But what was the matter with me? Did I not care that my father was dead? Xerath emerged, pure arcane energy, and with one blast, eviscerated nearly all of Shurima's people. I stared at Xerath defiantly, refusing to cry, refusing to run, and staring him in the eye, staring _death_ in the eye, whispered one word before my demise.\n\n\n_**\"Traitor.\"**_","replies":[{"poster":"The God of Cakes","date":"2016-05-10T07:54:50.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1671cefff0737565238d220de59c977/tumblr_o61pf5UXUj1v9tibpo1_400.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sneezing slug","date":"2016-05-10T05:22:47.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright time to take a swing at this.\n\n_\"RAHRHAHRBZHBAVv.\"_\n\n_\"HAGABAVFABRHhsnwjHabHHAGB\"_\n\n*incoherent screeching*\n\n--Rek'Sai\n\n\nJoking.

He kept taking chugs until he fell down. After snoring many hours, he woke up and saw that the mixture in the cooking pot was gone. Angrily, Gragas looked up in the skies and saw a weird looking cloud that was moving fastly away. The heat had vaporized the liquid!\n\nGragas followed the cloud as fast as he could, taking long steps with his big fat feet. The cloud stopped above a strange city. In the middle of the city was some sort of a golden shiny plate. Suddenly, it started to rain and all of Gragas's delicious drink dropped on the city, corroding its buildings. Since his marvelous mixture was gone, Gragas turned on ragemode and stepped forward to the enourmous golden plate.\n\n\"Yaarh!\" he shouted and burped so that the whole sky and earth seemed to tremble. Then he turned and farted so loudly, that all the people of the city escaped in disgust. Their last view of their beautiful city was the plate which falled down and broke into pieces. Gragas shaked a barrel with force and threw it on the ground.\n\nA massive explosion occurred, Gragas flew back home and the glory of Shurima had perished for ever.\n\nEnd & Sorry","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-05-12T05:29:14.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OnlyGragasOnlyGG,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=GGYEUcJc,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2016-05-10T09:43:25.591+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Yaarh!&quot; he shouted and burped so that the whole sky and earth seemed to tremble.

The stone tablet this is recorded on can be dated back to merely a century after the great collapse.\n\n_CHO’XAL AHL IX ZIR’KON_ (Great Swallowing(?) of the Emperor’s Realm)\n\nOn the Sun of Zero [Day of the collapse], All of Humanity was shaken by the thunderous clap(?) of an empire crushed to the earth. As the prophecies had foretold, the Empire of Shu’har’rei’mah [Shurima] was brought down as the Gods of the Infinite Realm had predicted: Betrayal. Emperor Azir, while engaged in the Ritual of Infinite Life [Ascension?] was brought down by a disloyal servant during the climax of the ritual, sending forth Energy of Great Force outward. As the Emperor fell to Feral Energy the entirety of the City of the Empire was brought to its knees. As the Gods predicted, the Earth swallowed them up, ending many lives. As objects of the Emperor’s Appearance and Wealth crumbled around them, the people fled to the outer reaches of the Empire. Others who remained in the city were devoured by the Earth, succumbing to the Sand. This, as the prophecies spoke, is the same fate that all who oppose the Divine Energy of the Infinite Realm shall succumb to. As the stones began to fall, the People of the Empire waged war among themselves, seizing power only briefly before another army would come to drive them out. Famine and Plague struck the survivors as they fled to the Sands, who threw off their shackles of the Empire’s oppression, for many were slaves. Those who put their faith in themselves died of these illnesses, while those who put their faith in the Void lived on. This time of Great Dying is called the Sorrow Time. As the Empire collapsed on its own weight, the Holy Creatures [Voidlings] claimed thousands of lives and huge stretches of Land. It was in this time where Icathia emerged, as those who submitted to the Gods were given Mercy, while those who refused were given Punishment. Praise be unto those who have created our Empire of Icathia, showing the world the True Darkness and the inevitable Destruction of the Mortal Realm. For if it had not been for the first prophets of the Collapse, none would have been spared from the Unstoppable Wrath of the Infinite Realm. As these first Blessed Ones settled in the lands of what is now Icathia, they carried out the tasks of the Void, flourishing while the Empire crumbled. As Prophecies had foretold, those who worship the Void with their entire Mind shall be spared, while those who shun it shall be flayed. The Worshipers of the Void who had existed before the Collapse became the Priesthood(?), while others worked to serve every whim of the Void. Praise be to the Void for our prosperity, and for the Empire’s destruction, for it is only the first step!\n_____________\nI don't know how good it is, I tend not to work as well when there's a word limit >_>\n\nAnd yes, that Icathian title is completely headcanon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhin UItd JFK","date":"2016-05-10T03:07:31.150+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"_The following entry was found buried beneath rubble of ruins of Ancient Shurima. It was written by an unnamed palace architect._\n\n\nThere's an enormous gathering outside today, and lots of noise.\n\nI hate noise.\n\nNoise prevents me from getting my work done. In fact, I was almost done finishing the blueprints to add onto the emperor's chambers before I went to sleep. Supposed to be a huge armory, filled to the brim with armor and weapons from all over the known world. Axes from Noxus, great broadswords from Demacia, intricate blades from Ionia, and several more. \n\nI could care less about the emperor's new playthings. War never interested me that much. I would always be fascinated by studying the palace when I was a small boy. My father was originally an architect, but became a soldier after my mother died in an enemy invasion. He wanted me to become a solider as well, but I hated the though of that. He was a great architect! He was well-paid too. And he gave me his gifts. I'd be damned if I would put my handed-down talents to waste.\n\nThe noise outside is getting louder, and I can't concentrate. I'll look at the palace from my window. Seeing it's elegance, and the gleaming Sun Disc, making even the greatest architect's feats look like something a child built in the sand. \n\nAzir seems to be standing under it, and there's also... energy? A swirling mass underneath the Disc. I could see now why these people were making noise. It's beautiful. There were multiple Sun Priests as well. What were they doing? I could care less what the emperor does with his free time, but doing something with this many people gathered... it's bound to be important.\n\nThe priests were addressing Azir. What they said, I don't know or care. Whatever it was, Azir turned around afterwards, and addressed his people. They went crazy. Like a bunch of barbarians. And then, he turned to his magus, Xerath. They hugged.\n\nXerath however... what in the world was he doing? He... he killed him! No!

That works really well.  \n\nI think you get a little caught up in telling instead of showing in the above paragraph, however - if this is a diary entry, as it appears to be, then why is the architect telling themselves what they already know?  You had quite a few words spare under the limit, so maybe it could have worked to bulk out this segment a little to take it a little less on the nose.  The information is great, but maybe you were too direct in getting it across.\n\nIt's so hard to write good journal/diary entries, particularly ones that end with the author's death (or interruption).

Others that it was the sea of wealth it had gathered. Perhaps the armies it could muster. The truth is, it was a great deal more than that. It was the people that lived in those lands. It was the merchants who toiled day and night for that wealth.

If every last one of them desired to see him ascend, even the old gods would be helpless to stop him. That was the meaning of the disc of pure gold. The power of Shurima was that great.\n\nSo on that day; the day that the emperor, the man on the top of Shurima would climb to the heavens themselves, he raised his mighty voice. To all the corners of Shurima, he said that from that day, no one would ever be bound by the chains of enslavement. That every man, woman and child would be their own person.
