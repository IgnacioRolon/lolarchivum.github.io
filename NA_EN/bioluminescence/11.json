The deadline has been hit and now it's time to read (the super enjoyable part) and judge (the super difficult part).  My deepest respect to everyone who entered - this has already been an incredibly interesting and entertaining collection of stories.__\n\n[Winner's Post Here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/yablnc6I-project-fiction-winners-fan-fic-contest-results)!\n\nAfter being blown out of the water (yeah, I went there) by the entries to the [Tall Tales of Bilgewater](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/5AiMAFN0-fan-fic-micro-competition-tall-tales-of-bilgewater) contest, I&#039;m totally stoked to try running another mini competition!   This time &#039;round, you are issued instruction to access your memory banks and jack into the PROJECT universe for what I&#039;m calling...\n#PROJECT: FICTION\nThis will be telling a story of the alternate universe as seen in the new PROJECT: OVERDRIVE video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1XvMyEBNA\n\n##The challenge - \nFiora, Lucian, Leona, Yi, Zed, and Yasuo - biomechanical killing machines of incredible efficiency.  Engineered for speed, power, _**obedience**_.  But in their hubris, their creators forgot to allow for one special variable, one &#039;flaw&#039; that could not be fully ripped out of the host minds - their humanity.\n\nYour challenge is to **craft a story that features at least one PROJECT unit, and how this terminal flaw (humanity) interacts with their mission**.\n\n**Rules -**\n\n1. **500 word count limit!**  (Which is more than last time.)  It&#039;s still flash-fiction, and we want to keep the action taut and lean.\n2. **There will be two winners!**  One that I pick and one that you, the players vote for!  Upvote your faves.\n3. **The deadline is 7pm PST, 12th of September** (10pm EDT, or 2am on the 13th in GMT)\n4. **Prizes???** Maybe some small amount of RP, and I liked printing out and displaying the stories for Rioters last time.  Let&#039;s try that again, and I can see if there&#039;s anything else we can do, if there&#039;s lots of interest :)\n\nGood luck to any and all who enter, and remember: _//Do not trust corrupted memory._","replies":[{"poster":"NegaDKR","date":"2015-09-09T05:30:10.911+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":9,"body":"**Date: Classified**\n**PROJECT: Zed**\n**Status: Unstable**\n\nSpecimen has been growing increasingly hostile ever since VR training session with **PROJECT: Shen**.

That really caught me off guard, even though I've been reading quite a few Leona and Diana stories, and Lucian and Senna stories - for some reason this one got me in the gut.  Good job.\n\nYou also have a great turn of phrase in a few places - I was particularly fond of \"I am alight with movement and destruction.\"  Conversely, I think the wooden door/metal leg contrast came across a little clumsily, but I have no doubt that if you were to go back over it again you'd find a more visually impactful way of hitting that beat.\n\nI've seen a couple of stories now that have things within 'acceptable parameters' - maybe I'm too harsh of a task master, but I usually think that acceptable parameters probably don't exist for PROJECT subjects under full control of their masters (except maybe for acceptable civilian losses).  Just the tiniest, and a completely tonal, thing - it being acceptable implies that there is a concept of 'good enough' that I never imagine exists for these poor creatures.\n\nAnyway - good job wrenching my heart with this one.

The target was agile and quick on it feet, using everything it could to slow me down. garbage bags, boxes, even climbing over a fence, but my pursuit was relentless.

Giving us a sense of the target's panic and fear (or maybe her incredible prowess - amazing for a human, but human nonetheless) would show how terrifying and inhuman Lucian is, until his moment of realization - and give us a bigger shock.

They have taken so much from me, but they cannot take that! “You will comply” the voice booms, “There are none they can escape the march of progress!” I am worried for my apprentice, but I quickly realize I don't remember his name anymore.

He sheathed his blade unwilling to inflict more pain, and looked back at me from atop his perch at the peak of the steps. \n\n\"You don't have to obey them if you don't want to,\" Yasuo spoke calmly, but with conviction.

Viktor created the _Battle Cast_ line, proving how machines could be implemented into any being. Obviously the League was outraged at this for harming another champion outside the rift. But Viktor claimed it was harmless, so they let it pass. In return, Heimer and Jayce got to work creating the _Mecha_ line. Kha'Zix, Aatrox, and Malphite. The League demanded that they stop tinkering with the Champions, but their work was irreversible. Viktor soon got started on created Death Bots. Deadly machines, with ungodly aim. From there, all of Runeterra was transformed. \n\n     The Battle Cast ravaged Runeterra. The Mecha tried to stop them, but there is strength in numbers. Then _they_ captured us. Yi, Fiora and I.

After the test trial of Project Yasuo I have mastered the art of cybernetic transformation.  I have removed all weakness from them and created the perfect assassins.  They are stronger, faster, and more powerful than anything ever before.  My creations will create a new world._\n\n**Day 13**\n\n_The initial tests were a huge success…however, project Leona shows….troubling signs.  Moments of aloofness when not on an active mission, a tendency to stand away from her cybernetic brethren.  I have pulled her from the rogue cyborg combat exercise to conduct tests at a later time.  I must be certain she is free of defects before putting her on the field._\n\n**Day 24**\n\n_Project Leona is still troubling, but what bothers me is why I cannot figure out what is wrong.  I have checked every system, replaced several parts, and she undoubtedly follows my every command but random behaviors still occur.  They are not extreme behaviors but they could be annoyances.  I questioned her why she stood apart from her brethren and she had a curious answer, “Why do I have a shield?”  It dawns on me that her programming has in some way determined that her shield functions differently from the swords they all have.  I will download updated files for shield usage into her memory, it must have been a corrupt file when first uploaded._\n\n**Day 30**\n\n_All projects will be going on their first mission tomorrow.  An “Investor” of great interest in my creations has a specific target in mind for them to assassinate.  Some politician of sorts, probably a rival.  Project Leona has still been displaying...odd behavior, but it was demanded that all 6 of my cybernetic creations be put to use.  I am not perfectly content with Leona but I do not see how these behaviors would jeopardize the mission._\n\n**Day 32**\n\n_The mission was a success…Leona, brought a child back with her.  Apparently it was the daughter of the political rival.  I have no idea why she brought back the child as it was not in the mission.  However, I am in need of more test subjects, perhaps she internalized a sub-mission of acquiring new supplies?  I have allowed for them to learn and adapt but…within 32 days to go to such lengths?  I am troubled greatly by this.  I may have to disassemble Leona to figure out what is causing this change.  Why is she so different from the others?_\n\n**Day 40**\n\n_I underestimated the severity of Leona’s abnormality.  I realize now that somewhere within her core human instincts or of her past life were shining through.  Ingrained to the primal level was an instinct to protect others.  Installing her with a protective shield kept those instincts alive, and now…she has escaped with the child from before.  A section of my lab is in ruin now.  The maternal instinct to protect overrode my fail safes.

He couldn't understand them anymore, the doctors made sure to remove that function, but he knew they were talking about him. He wanted very much to be back on that place, the sterile heat of his charging station back at the Station, after he completed his mission, he reasoned, he would go back. \n\nHe would take down Yi first, in a surprise attack. The ALPHA PROJECT was too dangerous to let escape again. Fiora next, he would stick his sharp gauntlets through her exposed face, ripping her visor off if need be. Lucian would be the easiest target he would be easy prey for this unit, blades or no. \n\n\"-too dangerous to let live,\" Lucian growled, the wound on his good arm still healing from the last escape attempt, \"Destroy him, completely and utterly, let his soul find peace in death.\"\n\n\"No,\" Fiora stopped the man, \"He is too useful, we need him if we're to strike back at the PROJECT. He knows the facility inside and out.\"\n\n\"We need Zed, not this dead thing.\" Yi retorted, clinically calm, \"Zed was dead long before the PROJECT began, there's no chance to bring him back.\"\n\n\"_She_ freed me.\" Lucian interrupted, cold as ever, \"I hate to admit it, but there must be something left inside this shell. That doesn't change my opinion on the matter, though, I still say we free him the more 'conventional' way.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\" Was all the Wuju master said, stalking up to the captured ninja, who continued exercising his only freedom against the wall. Yi brought up his arm and pressed a small button. Instantly the room filled with light, driving out the shadows and giving the free units a better view of their brother.\n\nZed howled, mind screaming against the shackles, flexing and twisting against the control they had taken from him. He cried, sobbed, and raged all at once in a final effort to break the hold the doctors had taken from him so long ago. He wanted to be free again, but visions of the box from the Kinkou temple flashed before him. The damage was done, he would never be free.\n\nThe ninja scraped against the wall, one last time.\n\n**//TIME UNTIL EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN: 0 DAYS, 0, HOURS, 0 MINUTES, 0 SECONDS**\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI'm sorry I missed the deadline, I was struggling with the muse for a while, and ironically, I only found the drive to write it after the deadline passed.

He was unfeeling.\n\nYi’s thoughts swirled in turmoil. What did this to me? Why can’t I feel?\n\nAs the battlefield smoke dissipated, Yi caught glimpses of Zed piercing a security droid with his bladed armor, Lucian blasting through two droids, Leona hurling down a giant beam of light that tore through a platoon of the robots, Fiora slicing her away through the remainders of the enemy and Yasuo finishing off his own opponent, a larger, more heavily armored battle droid that sent a rapid, armored fist slamming across Yasuo’s helmet. \n\nYi reached for his blade but Yasuo quickly got to his feet, the wind strangely blooming around him, sending torn, shattered metal scraps flying. The battle droid never even hesitated, raising an arm that fired a crackling bolt of plasma towards Yasuo. Yasuo moved swiftly, sweeping across the air with his sword and the wind _reacted_, leaping upwards, a solid wall of rushing wind that howled as if it held a powerful typhoon. The attack was sent hurtling up in the air and Yasuo ran forwards nimbly, gracefully moving alongside the air currents and with two swift strikes, ended his opponent, sending the robot crumbling into miserable pieces. \n\nIonian. The intrusive word exploded into Yi’s mind and somewhere, hidden in his memory was a place full of falling white petals, rustic villages, rustling leaves, _home_. But the way Yasuo had moved, it looked so familiar… Yi focused. Ionia, Wuju, Invasion… _Noxus_.\n\nYi’s eyes snapped open; he had heard tales of Noxian dark sorcery, returning their dead to life, casting powerful illusions. Were they responsible for this?\n\nYi ran into the wreckage of the laboratory Fiora had uncovered him from, unburied the rubble that covered the chair that he had been strapped down to. Linked to the chair lay a sleek plug, somehow, instinct caused Yi’s feelingless fingers to reach up to the back of his helmet, where there was a tiny hole, roughly the shape of the plug. He hesitated, for just a moment, and then plugged himself back in. _It’s time to find out who I am._\n\nYi… remembered.  He was a child training next to his peers. Swords flashed and danced. He had been rash, impatient. And then… death, darkness, but he opened his eyes and somehow light streamed into them, life, and a second chance. He remembered finding an old woman, the last practioner of wuju, he remembered learning patience, forgiveness, and strength. He remembered battling the Noxians. He remembered his old goggles. Wuju gave him power, power he never had as a child, power that might have allowed him to defeat his… brother. \n\nYi pulled his plug, shaking. He looked up to see Yasuo kneeling next to him.\n\nYasuo fumbled at his helmet, pressed a button.

Is it simply for setting the tone, and accentuating that what he is experiencing is new and wrong?

If the weekly forecast called for anything but a steady downpour it was a miracle, if there was a chance of seeing the sun it was the end of days. Dealing with the overwhelming volume of water was a monumental task, and consequently so were the storm sewers. That suited their needs just fine.\n\nYasuo rolled his shoulder and adjusted the arm wrapped over it. Behind him, the sound of metal boots echoed into unlit corners of the sewer. Turning his head, he watched them all from the corner of his eye as each escapee danced circles trying to take in the world. They all wore masks, but that couldn’t hide the desperate curiosity shared between them. He almost snickered, but thought better of it. No less than three weeks ago he’d done the same.\n\nPassing off his burden to a yellow member in the string of new acquaintances – _<form method=\"get\" action=\"26-74-79-A6-42-0F-84-FF-DO-D2\">_ Yi, his name is Yi – Yasuo plucked an I.D. card from his belt and flashed it over the scanner.

Leaving the maintenance access tunnel behind, Yasuo pulled the limp body from Yi and threw it onto his back.\n\n“Where’d you get that?”\n\nYasuo glanced at the bare arm with dark skin pointing at the card dangling from his hip.\n\n> static size_l wrfu(void *pbe,  size_l  size,  size_l  nmemb,  void *stream)\n> {  \n> (void)stream;   (void)pbe;   return ident * nmemb;\n> }\n\n>Lucian.

I won’t keep you guessing for long.”\n\nComing to the end of an alleyway and the beginning of a street, Yasuo held out an arm. “Hang on,” he commanded. Leaning the body against a rain-slicked wall – damn that guy was heavy – he looked over the collection of neon-tinted renegades.\n\n“I need a volunteer.”\n\nYi immediately stepped forward. “What for?”\n\n“To stay here with our weapons,” he answered.\n\nThe shock that went through them could have powered a city block.\n\n“No.” \n\nA body lined with fuchsia stepped closer, a matching visor glaring down at him.\n\n> static size_l wrfu(void *pbe,  size_l  size,  size_l  nmemb,  void *stream)\n> {  \n> (void)stream;   (void)pbe;   return ident * nmemb;\n> }\n\n>Fiora. Bodyguard. Savatier International.\n\n“You really think we can walk across the street armed like this? This is city-regulated space with cameras everywhere. You’d barely make it halfway before CivE smothered you with drones.”\n\nHer face betrayed nothing of the thoughts inside her head, but the slight shiver of her blade told him more than enough, and he couldn’t blame her.\n\n“Fine,” she sneered.\n\n“Good,” Yasuo replied, “Now let’s get moving.”\n\nSandwiched between a pharmacy and an insurance office, a red sign waited in the rain, the words “Discount Tech” proudly blazing over the sidewalk.\n\n---","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-18T15:21:47.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Superb Villain,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=aOV8UEy9,comment-id=0046,timestamp=2015-09-11T16:51:36.734+0000)\n><form method=\"get\" action=\"26-74-79-A6-42-0F-84-FF-DO-D2\">\n\n500 words exactly.  Nice ;)\n\nI like the concept - that Yasuo, being the older, wiser, PROJECT skin, is leading the new renegades away from the authorities with the knowledge and connections he's gathered.  The implication that he went through something similar when he was first 'released' is appreciated too.  Nod of respect to the 'always raining' cyberpunk trope also :D\n\nWasn't sure about the turn of phrase \n>Turning his head, he watched them all from the corner of his eye as each escapee danced circles trying to take in the world.\n\nSomething seems a bit odd about the use of the term \"danced circles\" in this instance.  Usually used to imply that someone is outperforming their opponent by a huge amount, I think here it's meant to imply that they were going every which way, taking in everything they could.  I know you're hurting for words under the limit (not much to be done with a whole zero words spare ;) but unless I'm missing a reference, I think that one misses its mark a little.\n\nI do love the code-like references.  That first one reminded me most strongly of HTML, while the later ones seem more like C, or some derivative thereof.  I know the implication wasn't there, but it's funny to see the word 'void' be used so often in a League story, and it not refer to The Void!  I've probably misidentified those programming language references, and made a fool of myself - but either way, it's reasonable enough looking to add a wonderful sense of authenticity.\n\nThe ending was left slightly ambiguous - my initial reading was that the Discount Tech location is a front for their hideout, and that there is someone there sympathetic to their efforts.  However, it later occurred to me that I may be being too naive for a PROJECT story, and that it's possible that Yasuo is taking them there for chopping into parts - or at the very least, to do so to Zed.  The new PROJECTs seem like babes in the wood compared to him - it would be so easy to take advantage.  The chuckle at their childlike curiosity also made me wonder - because while it could be taken wholesomely as someone seeing what they once did, it could also have been read as derision at the foolishness of soon-to-be hoodwinked marks.\n\nI like my first thought better, of course.  I thought I'd mention my second thought simply to point out the secondary reading, if you were not already aware (and if it's not entirely intentional!).\n\nLastly, I like that each (conscious) PROJECT gets a single moment to display their personality.  Lucian is suspicious, Yi can't bare to part with his sword, and Fiora is pragmatic.  That was very efficiently done, and seems almost effortless on your part.

A ticking of boots on a polished floor as well as the mechanical recording of a frail voice. Nothing was seen, but it was felt. Cold, harsh, metallic. Things had changed, had improved.\n\n\t“PROJECT: Zed will be given one final mission as a way of proving himself a successful unit. Task: Destroy or return all rogue units. End of notes.”\n\n\tSuddenly, silence. The being had stopped its moving, its talking, its breathing. The recording device had clicked off and seemingly died. \n\n\tLights, sounds, movement. Before his eyes, he saw the text “PROJECT: Online” flash on a black background before it faded. The world suddenly came into focus, one octagon at a time. A much smaller man looked up at him with a smirk, holding up a clipboard. Upon it, lay the blueprints for three other PROJECTs, pages folded and ripped to show the three figures in one, jagged image.\n\n\t“PROJECT: Zed. Find these three rogues. Either capture them and return them here, or destroy them. Do you understand?”\n\n\tLoud cries of metal snapping away from itself freed the cyborg, leaving his own body to hold himself up. He did not respond to the scientist. Rather, he pushed the tiny human out of his way before pulling apart the metal doors of his wing in the lab. \n\n\tHe would prove he wasn’t a failure.\n\n\tSomehow, he knew where he was going. He was… programmed to know the layout of the lab he had been given new life in. As he made his way outside, he stopped to scan the city. It was nothing he had experienced before and yet… he knew it. He could relay information about anything he set his eyes upon, data showing up and cluttering his vision.\n\n\tHe moved with a fluidity he hadn’t known since he had first opened that box in his master’s temple. He had once again been renewed by powers he didn’t understand, but he knew he didn’t have to. This was his key to perfecting his powers and embracing the shadows to his full potential. The body of a human was far too weak for the task, but this… This body that was half man and half machine promised greater power than he had ever known.\n\n\tSoon enough, he had found his prey. Locking on to each of them, he tested the new limits of his shadows with this body. He was able to fight each of them, perfectly. Finally, he would know perfection.\n\n\tLike all those years ago, he had tasted victory for the first time over his brother. He had bested the master’s blood, but to be seen a failure. \n\n        Never again.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-18T06:33:25.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Azriela Wolfe,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=aOV8UEy9,comment-id=0053,timestamp=2015-09-13T01:55:09.793+0000)\n>\n> Total failure of all PROJECTs has been achieved.

(You then went on to spell it right later in the story - so I suspect it was just a tiny slip up :)\n\nI was worried that we weren't going to see Zed's humanity peeking out in this tale, but you managed to keep the trigger a secret until the very end.  It is his pride and determination to never be second-best again that causes his complication!  Well done, and well done!\n\nI was a bit confused near the start - who is the elderly figure that appears to be machine, and what is the implication of that mechanical person all of a sudden ceasing to move?  And then there's someone showing Zed the blueprints, rather haphazardly assembled.  Should I assume that this method of giving a mission is by no means the usual way?  You can see, I'm a touch uncertain what's going on here - but at exactly 500 words, I can understand you're a little short on space to elaborate :)\n\nI also liked the idea that when he was a man of flesh, the shadows were to some extent, too strong for him.  With the new metal body, they can really get to work and do some serious damage.  Nice idea :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ayame Isaki","date":"2015-09-12T22:35:37.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Subject: PROJECT: 416B616C69\n>\n>To all PROJECT staff:\n>\n>From this moment, PROJECT: 416B616C69 has been terminated. Memory wipe in advance of disassembly shall begin immediately. All records of its existence are to be sealed. The subject has proven too unreliable for field deployment.\n\nThe screen reflected in the soft green glow emanating from her visor. Her memory was in shambles, bits and pieces dancing at the edge of her consciousness. They taunted her, promising the one thing she wanted more than anything; answers. The message on the terminal before her seemed to be taunting her.\n\nShe turned her attention to the construct it was attached to, the cylindrical coffin from which she had emerged. \"416B616C69\" was etched into the thick glass. She ran her metal fingers over the letters as more memories danced at the periphery of mind. She was hit simultaneously by the feeling that her hands were both normal and wrong. It was as if she were two distinct individuals, each vying to take the place of her confused mind.\n\nShe was without purpose and stared aimlessly at her faint reflection in the pod glass. For the briefest of moments, a young woman stared back at her, with long black hair in place of her white hair, hard eyes in place of her visor, and body of flesh and blood in place of her metallic form. It was like a small crack had formed in the dam that held those dancing shadows of memory at bay.\n\n_I am Akali, the Fist of Shadow._\n\nShe staggered under the weight of self realization. She was to be terminated, but something had gone wrong; the fact she was active and self aware was a testament to that.\n\nShe turned her attention to the terminal and seemed to instinctively know how to use it. She was unable to access anything sensitive, but did manage to find a log overview of PROJECT: 416B616C69 (formerly PROJECT: AKALI, renamed to eliminate references to her former name). She learned she had been reset repeatedly after attacking PROJECT: ZED without provocation during field testing on multiple occasions. Multiple measures had been taken to attempt to repress her former self, none successful.\n\nHad she been human, she might have cried as a wave of anguish unleashed itself upon her mind. They had brought him back. She had dedicated her life to opposing him, and they had brought him back. They had brought her back to be used as a weapon alongside him. That anguish gave way to anger. They thought that they could impede the balance.\n\nShe pulled her kamas from the stand beside her pod. Their energy blades ignited at her touch, one red and one green.\n\nShe would show them just how wrong they were.\n\n\\* Fun fact, 416B616C69 is the hexadecimal encoding of Akali in UTF-8.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-18T05:49:30.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ayame Isaki,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=aOV8UEy9,comment-id=0052,timestamp=2015-09-12T22:35:37.490+0000)\n>\n> The message on the terminal before seemed to taunt her...\n> She ran her metal fingers of the letters as more memories danced at the periphery of mind... \n> They thought they could impeded the balance...\n\nAh ha!  A PROJECT: Akali story - and why not.  Thanks for the hex translation - I like little touches like that.  I'm a real sucker for them :)\n\nThe lines I've quoted above, to me, seem like they may contain typos or, in the case of the first one, perhaps are just tricky to parse the first time you try to read them.  Obviously typos aren't game breakers - I'm just a stickler for spotting them.  Of course, Muphry's Law means I'll have to make a typo in this response somewhere.  Feel free to give me a hard time for it, whenever it should appear.  Only fair, after all.  ;)\n\nAs for the story - I like the idea that Akali is furious that they brought both of them back to be used as weapons.  That Zed (who is the enemy of everything she stands for) is someone she's being forced to work with against her will.  I hope she's found some small measure of bitter satisfaction in her repeated attacks on PROJECT: Zed.    I'm not actually sure, according to that paragraph near the end there, if she _is_ or _isn't_ capable of feeling that anger.  The implication is that she can't feel the anguish as keenly as her human self would have done - and that the anguish she _would_ have experienced turned into anger.  Does she imagine that her human self would have been angry, but she herself is only distantly so?\n\nLastly, loved the image and the tactile description of her running her fingers across the metal designation letters on her glass pod.  That's a cool idea, and not many people have used touch in their descriptions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-09-12T22:20:53.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">// WELCOME, User: YASUO.\n>// Please input command.\n>> Access: Memory Bank.\n// Input command accepted.\n// Accessing memory bank. . .\n// Accessing. . .\n// Accessing. . .\n// ERROR.\n// Memory corrupted.\n// Attempt to repair files, Y/N?\n>> Y.\n// Booting up file repair.\n// File Repair: ACTIVE \n// Scheduled file repair is turned: ON\n// Run at 1:00 AM every Wednesday.\n// Last Run: 18 hours ago (central time).\n// Would you like to initiate manual file repair, Y/N?\n>> Y.\n// Initiating manual file repair. . .\n// Repairing files. . .\n// File repair complete.\n// Memory bank accessible.\n// Select memory folder.\n>> Open Folder \"Installation\".\n// This folder is passcode protected.

I hope you had fun writing this one, Dragonzzilla - I spotted a couple of things that suggested you did.  The end user agreement, the scheduled updates, the Pinocchio song quote (or Ultron, depending on your reference), the binary encoded Yasuo quote \"One step ahead of the past\", and lastly the (completely unwarranted!) Serenity quote.  You monster.\n\nBesides that needless stab at my feels, this was a lot of fun to read.  The verisimilitude of the user 'unfriendly' interface is very Brazil-like in its bureaucratic tedium, and brings a rather unexpected comedic quality which is a change from most of the stories I've been reading.\n\nI found it interesting that Yasuo's speech is never 'said out loud' - it's described or implied, but never spoken.  Quite an interesting choice, and one I assume is because we're observing one of Yasuo's memories, and his internal-view wouldn't involve listening to himself speak.  Like I said, an interesting choice.\n\nI can only guess that this story happens sort of back-to-front, in that we have the assumption of Yasuo's memories and humanity bubbling to the surface, which causes his personal intra-hacking to discover the memory, which then leads to the latter half of the story.  He doesn't explicitly complicate a mission through rediscovering his humanity (which would be the very letter of the compo assignment) but one could speculate that we are seeing the immediate aftermath.","replies":[]}]}]}
