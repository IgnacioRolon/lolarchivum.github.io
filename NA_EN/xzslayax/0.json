It would make sence if riot banned them or did something to them but they get no such thing so when you try  to climb in ranked and you want to win but someone goes afk because \"got to go eat food\",\" I dont want to play\",\"Had to take the dogs for a walk\". Then i will get mad i just want riot to improve there system that i once knew and loved. Rather then now when i want to just cry every game because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2016-10-26T08:03:52.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all click REPLY under a post if you want to answer someone.\n\nSecond, Riot gave you a chat ban cause you flamed in several games. \n\nYou ask for a System where someone which makes a failure once (like going afk) gets banned. Don't you see the irony? You would have been banned after your first flame. And then you would also have come here and whine about the shitty system.\n\nYou have to go for bad behaviour several times before you get punished.\n\nAnd if you want to tell me that someone which is running down mid doesn't get punished then please give it a try. Start a game, run down mid the whole game and post the link from the match history. If you are not banned for 14 days after that game after at least 48H I will gift you a random skin box.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-26T07:56:47.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The statistical odds of having an afk or intentional feeder on your team is lower  than the odds of having one on the opposing team as long as you never do it, four chances as opposed to five.\n\nIf you are stuck in lower ranks then it is because you are failing in some aspect.\n\nWhen people are caught intentionally feeding they are inmediately issued a 14 day ban, with their next punishment being a permenant ban. Just report them and they will get what is coming.\n\nThe main issue with issueing intentional feeding bans is that a lot of people dont understand the word \"intentional\" which leads to a lot of false reports.\n\nAs for afk's, they are handled primarily by the leaver buster which gives people low priority queues for leaving too many games and if they keep it up for too long they get banned. \n\nPersonally I would like to see it work quicker but that would lead to people with temporary internet issues getting harsh punishments.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-10-26T05:46:34.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yelling or swearing at someone isn't going to make them stop, nor going to help you or your team work together to try to win the game. \nKeep your mouth shut and report the person at the end of the game.
