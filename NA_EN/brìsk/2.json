What you're experiencing is a known issue that occurs only between the transition from being in queue and champion select. The current workarounds that are being tested are to either collapse your friends list groups **prior** to queueing for a match or to swap over to the Legacy Client (which you're having issues with at the moment). You may be able to reach the Legacy Client after launching League as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*). Below is a screenshot showing what your friends list groups should look like before queueing, if you'd rather try that workaround instead:\n\n(click to enlarge)\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GJulP\n\nWhile I won't be able to return your LP, as we're locked out of making LP changes, I can address any other questions you may have.","replies":[]}]}
