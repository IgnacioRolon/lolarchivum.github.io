It started during a ranked game with no warning. Soon after champion select it told me that \" a problem has been encountered and the program needs to close...ect.\" I have tried to go into custom games as well to test that but it doesn't work either. I've tried restarting my computer, and even tried the hextech repair tool to fix the issue.\nEDIT:Solved by going into game.cfg and changing the resolution to the appropriate setting","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T19:12:31.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something is failing the game to render and causing it to crash after champion select.
