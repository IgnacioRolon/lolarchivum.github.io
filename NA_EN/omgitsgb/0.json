This update made some changes to the Xbox service and enabled \" DVR (game recording)\" by default. Whether or not players have used this in the past, it would be in their best interest to double check that this is turned off. To turn off the Game DVR feature in the Windows 10, please do the following:\n\nOpen the Xbox app by going to the Search bar on the bottom left of the screen and typing \"Xbox\"\nClick on the Settings (Gear) icon on the left.\nClick on Game DVR at the top.\nClick on the On/Off (switch) under \"Record game clips and screenshots using Game DVR\" to turn it off.
