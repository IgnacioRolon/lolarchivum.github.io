But i will attempt to explain it. So I have not changed anything on my computer for a long time and the only thing I have done was when I was shutting down my computer the other night, it said \"update and shut down\" and so of course I clicked that because that will happen periodically when my computer has an update (I have a Dell Inspiron 2350 with Windows 10 so it was just an update of windows 10 I believe). But ever since then, my league client is slower and when I get into a game, my ping is normal but as I click around and move every few seconds my champion will stop moving to where I am clicking and the minions will still attack but they aren't doing damage and then after a few seconds of this, my character and everything around me catches up and everything fast forwards to normal time in the game for like 2 seconds. And after a few seconds of being normal again, everything doesn't completely freeze but my character will stop moving and everyone will just be gliding around again for a few seconds and then everything will catch up again. It does this over and over and over again and has been for the last two days. I hope y'all can understand this and help me somehow. My computer was working fine last week for league but now its doing this. Can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T22:29:27.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing heavy packet buffering or bursts of packet loss. Since these packets carry the information that tells your client what happened on the server, it can delay or miss actions and then suddenly catch up when these packets finally get to their destination.\n\nMost of the time this is caused by network settings that conflict with League, so I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this. Let me know if you continue to experience this after completing those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suavè","date":"2016-10-03T21:38:24.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically my FPS is 60 and i believe that is normal and my Ping is between 30 and 40. So those are good but my champion and all the minions and other champions start gliding around and freezing and then the game catches up after a few seconds but its this constant back and forth every 10 seconds or so. While this is happening, my ping does not go up and my FPS does not go down so I am not sure whats going on.","replies":[]}]}
