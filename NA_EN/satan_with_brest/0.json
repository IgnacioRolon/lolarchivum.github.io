Calling a player garbage is toxic. Calling teammates or opponents retards is toxic behavior. Refusing to fight because you don't get along is toxic behavior. Mate I'm sorry but your ban is more than deserved. When you see that you're actually the one in the wrong, maybe that'll be when you're ready to reform. If you're a nice person in real life, then be a nice person in league. You're going out of your way to attack people and it's not right. \"But they did it first\". It doesn't matter, be the bigger person and let it end there and report them at the end of the match.
