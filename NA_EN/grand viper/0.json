For mortal matters, it doesn&#039;t really matter, it&#039;s more the implication of certain traits your parents wanted to be present in you if they choose a specific name for said qualities, like Michael with the thought of loyalty and strength ala St. Michael the Archangel, or Sarah in honor of your grandmother or so on. \r\n\r\nThe rules change when you apply them to gods and pseudo-godlike beings.\r\n\r\nIf his name was Achilles, it&#039;d be random but okay, sure. _Pantheon_ means &quot;all the gods of a people or religion collectively,&quot; and Atreus ascended and became &quot;Pantheon&quot;. Does that mean he is another Legion, an entire pantheon of Rakkor&#039;s war gods embodied in a single vessel ala Kalista, Udyr or whoever hosts more than one soul within themselves? Is Pantheon a single entity, a singular god-like being who is the aspect of war? If he is the latter, why is his name Pantheon outside of recognition then, as it doesn&#039;t make sense when you give the context that gods and the divine work in specific way. Ares is the God of War, singular. The Furies are multiple beings and are collectively known as &quot;The Furies&quot;, plural. \r\n\r\nIf it&#039;s the former, will we expect to see a VO representing Pantheon&#039;s multiple war-like facets now?","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-05T03:03:35.627+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"in Runeterra, the word \"pantheon\" may hold a completely different meaning than it does in real life, or at least slightly different. \n\nIn this case, \"pantheon\" may refer to the collectivist nature of pantheon, who is a amalgamation of heroic souls infused with the aspect of war to create this character.

Does that mean Pantheon should refer to himself as \"We,\" or is the amalgamation condensed into a singular being and is referred to as \"I\"? I'm not trying to take it literally, but my inquiry stems from the fact that Pantheon was just a name prior to godhood. Now that it's referring to a god-like being, how will that play into his story or if it does at all? The name of a god is important. The definition may not be the same, but if his name was \"Astrapi,\" (\"Lightning\" in Greek) and he was the god of the farm, some streams are getting crossed. If he was Atreus,  the Artisan of War, no problem. Akeus, the God of War, not a problem.\n\nBut when you use a real word term that has specific meaning, you can't necessarily make the excuse that it can mean something different, either slightly or entirely, without proper groundwork. If I say there's a duck in the Runeterran pond, you're going to assume your typical mallard unless I go into description of a great hairy beast greedily drinking the water. Something seen in AT:LA with your bear goats and your badger moles and the like, and everyone is really confused when there is just \"a bear\", no combination of any animal.\n\nSo again, I would like to know why Atreus became Pantheon. In a literary work of fiction I'm not trying to take it \"literally\", but I want to know if the name has any point and any connection with his god-like status now. Pantheon is a very specific word choice, compared to Zeus. Zeus is the God of Lightning, but lightning is \"Astrapi\", so his title is \"Zeus, God of Lightning,\" so there's no confusion as to what he's the god of. \n\nI mean there's Leona the lion which stems from Leonidas, and Diana who is directly lifted from the Roman mythology of Diana, the Goddess of the Hunt and of the Waxing Moon. Considering you have two _very_ clear cut characters from very specific sources, it'd be weird if Pantheon was just named that now because it's recognizable and it doesn't play into what you suggested, an amalgamation of heroic souls infused with the aspect of war which in turn creates \"Legion\".","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-05T10:48:54.920+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"If pantheon was created today then they would probably would give him a different name, he's a pretty old champ.

In fact, Pantheon was created a few years ago! He was created a few years ago, as a man who was really, really good at fighting (and later revealed hints of hidden depths, fortunately). \n\nHowever, with this in mind, it's important to realize that Pantheon's character base was changed with the knowledge of who he was when he was first created. Turning Pantheon into yet another god-like being (which Riot promised they wouldn't be doing that much this year ;_; ) was a decision his writers made, not some sort of necessity - it's not like the only thing keeping him bound to a mortal frame was the existence of the IoW or whatever old lore stuff had to be revamped. \n\nSo that being said, I think the bigger question here is why Pantheon was turned into the god that the man Atreus became, if changing the nature of who/what \"Pantheon\" is meant that the name wouldn't really make as much sense. While just not making him into a god could've been one way to avoid this, there's also the case wherein Pantheon would've remained a man, and Atreus could've been the god, and then we'd get \"Pantheon, the Avatar of Atreus\" or something like that. Wouldn't be as descriptive as \"Pantheon, the God of Combat\" or whatever, but if this were a situation wherein turning Pantheon into a god were an absolute necessity (ie. if Riot was going the Dawngate route and making every champion a god or an avatar of a god, which kind of feels like what they're doing with each rewrite), then there are other ways to keep the name and have it still make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Kasyrgan","date":"2016-03-07T04:00:55.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Rakkoran lore, there were 4 stars that represented 4 Gods.

The constellation/aspect/god/whatever was just named Pantheon by people, or people were told that this was its name. The simplest explanation is that in the Rakkor language (and/or whatever language the name comes from) Pantheon does not translate to \"all the gods of a people or religion collectively,\" it translates to something like \"the war god.\" The common language of the world of Runeterra is English, but that doesn't mean that all words used in the world are going to hew to English meanings.\n\nThis is a thing that happens in real life too. The German language has a few good examples: \"bad\" in German means bathroom, \"kind\" in German means child, and \"gift\" in German means poison. \"Pantheon\" in the language it comes from means the war god, that's all, no need for any additional lore shenanigans to explain it.","replies":[{"poster":"Grand Viper","date":"2016-03-06T16:50:46.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually not the case with Pantheon. \n\nWhat does \"Rakkor\" mean in Runeterran/Rakkor language?\n\n>\"Rakkor means Tribe of the Last Sun\"\n>- Cited from Leona's lore\n\nWhat does Ra-Horak mean in Rakkor language?\n>\"Ra-Horak - a Rakkor title which means Followers of the Horizon.\"\n<-Cited from Leona's lore\n\nWhat does Pantheon mean in Rakkor language?\n\n>\"Atreus was a proud young Rakkoran named after one of the four stars that formed the Warrior constellation in the night sky â€“ the constellation known to the Rakkor as the Pantheon.\"\n>-Cited from Pantheon's lore\n\nSo the fact that I've been hammering on why he is named \"Pantheon\" now is not out of a place of ignorance. It was because Atreus was named after one of the 4 stars/god-like warriors that creates the constellation. In fact, Pantheon is highly implied that it's consisted of 4 individually named stars to create the Pantheon, an aspect of war created by the most stalwart and powerful of Rakkor's warriors.\n\nNor is there a different definition given to us like they provided for Leona. This is not the case of a \"same word = different meaning in a different language,\" as the implication is still quite strong that it's a group of warriors creating a singular unit.;\n\nSo I ask again, will Pantheon be an individual, or will he be like Udyr and refer to himself as we?

Although he has come in many forms, as he takes on numerous bodies over the years, he is still one God.

From what we've seen so far anyway, he doesn't appear to be a collection of souls.\n\nDo note that 'Pantheon' is more likely a name given to him rather than what he named himself. It would make sense for those who've heard his legacy and know what the cost of bringing him down to Runeterra is, to consider him a 'pantheon' of their warrior's souls, even if he is not.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-03-06T18:10:28.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Given name or true name, it's still a purposeful decision made by writers who are in full control of their actions, not just the happenstance of a purely fictional world. \n\nIt'd be like having a god of fertility and naming it \"Dirge\" or something - you could say that \"Dirge\" in that language means \"giver of life,\" but since they're still speaking a real language (English, in this case), it's going to be pretty hard to just rewrite the audience's understanding of that word in this specific context (especially if that word is used elsewhere to mean what it actually means - and I'm pretty sure Riot isn't going to just stop using the word \"pantheon\" since it's a real word with a specific use and meaning).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-03-05T16:51:03.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well in this case lore wise \"Pantheon\" is a collection of stars known as the warrior constellation, kinda like how Taurus is the bull constellation and how Saggitarius is the Archer. Given naming conventions Pantheon as a word might mean \"warrior\" in the native Rakkoran tongue, so when speaking of Pantheon it might just be in the context of that old language, similar to how we use names like Saggitarius and Scorpius, which just translate more or less to Archer and Scorpion respectively. \n\nIn that way the name Pantheon likely doesn't tie in with our earth based languages and simply has a different meaning for the folks on Mount Targon. Pantheon refers to the constellation and the mysterious being tied with it that now inhabits the body of Atreus, but Pantheon in itself is not so wholly different from the beings inhabiting Leona and Diana, just that it has a different approach to the whole being an Aspect thing.

The constellation is made up of multiple stars, meaning that there is a pantheon of stars which insinuates multiple godly entities of war. \n\nIt's hard to not ignore the fact that it may mean something in their language vs our language as we have the exact same language. Other than a couple of new words sprinkled in, the common terminologies we share are seen even in the re-defining of the words like using \"Ra\" as the word for sun, which reflects Egyptian etymology. This is what I meant about crossing streams, it's saying \"walk\" in Runeterra can mean to run, and \"run\" mean a kind of animal. \n\nI still see that if he were a part of the god of war pantheon, then as a singular star making up the constellation, he'd have his own identity like a hall of heroes almost. Each star has their own name and together they are the Pantheon constellation. There's Atkliseus the Strong, Merecher the Swift, Helen the Thrower, and now Atreus the Stalwart joins their ranks. If Pantheon is a singular entity, it makes more sense for him to be named after a singular being. If he is truly a collection of all the stars in a single host, Pantheon makes sense, but I wonder if Riot will make his in-game character reflect that aspect now and have him say Udyr-like things such as, \"We\". \"\n\n\"They are privileged to die at my feet!\" vs \"They are privileged to die at our feet!\"\n\nWhich is why I keep referring back to Legion. Rather than be a one man army, Pantheon would make more sense to have an entire cohort rain spears down, to act in formation, when he comes down from the sky you see 50 Mantheons coming for you. When the clouds darken and the sun is blocked, you realize the horrible truth: It's raining men, bloody run.\n\nAs for my mother, with a name like that, do you think I can afford to _not_ get her something good for mother's day? :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-03-05T09:10:03.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"All the gods of [...]\" is a very broad term.
