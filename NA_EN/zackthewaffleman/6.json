What benefits would a 7-year ban (which is a pretty ridiculous and arbitrary stretch of time) have in comparison to what is essentially the same punishment?\n\nAnd, I say it's essentially the same, because, if you got banned from something for seven years, odds are high you'd ultimately forget about the banned account by the time you're finally allowed to play on it again, so, effectively, a 7-year ban would be much the same as a permaban.\n\nSo, again, I gotta ask: Why replace the permaban with a 7-year ban?\n\n> Change my mind.\n\nThat's not how proposals work. _You_ have to change _our_ minds (moreover, you have to change _Riot's_ minds). A proposal with no backing and the simple (and pointless) challenge of \"change my mind\" is not even remotely a proposal worth considering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P4ppino","date":"2018-04-30T06:48:20.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice troll, I assume your mind has already been changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-04-29T21:30:10.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xurreal","date":"2018-04-29T19:30:30.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Permaban threat is important to this community who has already shown what its capable of with no presence of authority or enforcement.\n\nPermaban stays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-04-29T19:01:58.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be pretty interesting logging in after 7 years (if I still played then) and seeing what old icons/skins I had and if anyone on my friends list still played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-04-29T18:39:54.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this change my mind stuff...?
