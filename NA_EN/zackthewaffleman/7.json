Sure.\n\nWhat is the difference between ranged and melee champions? Ranged champions have access to a strong safety net. They can clear minions and attack enemy towers from a distance, allowing the player to quickly kite back if anyone tries to approach him and get away unscathed. The difference between melee and ranged champions is so staggering that even a full AD melee champion can only hope to split push a side lane and maybe sneak a second tier tower while marksmen have been required in the game for seven years and only recently have stopped being 100% pick for both teams.\n\nRange is an incredibly powerful tool. It is under rated by those who have it, but those who do not recognize the absurd power of range in a champion's kit. \n\nAssassins do not have range. Divers do not have range. Therefore, they need higher base stats in order to allow them to survive properly when they are approaching an enemy and when they are being kited. If they do not have higher stats, the mage or marksman will simply kill them as they try to close the gap.\n\nIn the same vein, mages and marksmen must have very weak stats. A diver or assassin spends about five seconds properly approaching and closing the gap on a mage or marksman, and then the mage or marksman can still use Flash or some peel and kite back further, which requires further gap closing on the diver or assassin's part.\n\nIf the mage or marksman not only has access to ranged kiting and escapes, but also high health armor and MR, there is no chance for the diver or assassin to kill them.\n\nMore importantly, why should the mage or marksman get BOTH range AND high stats, while the melee champions get only high stats? If you wanted to do this, you would either turn the game into an entirely ranged champion game, as there is no benefit to selecting melee champions, or you would need to increase the durability of assassins and divers even further, as they would need to live even longer in order to kill the more durable mages and marksmen.\n\nAssassins and divers are SUPPOSED to kill mages, that is their primary job. Why should Riot make that more difficult for them while not impacting the mage's offense? \n\nIf a mage player wants to be durable and survive assassination, they can build {{item:3143}} or{{item:3068}} like everyone else.
