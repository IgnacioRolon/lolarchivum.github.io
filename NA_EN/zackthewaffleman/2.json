Removing allied creepblock means you just stand inside the wave now at no penalty, making ranged and lane bullies more oppressive against non ranged, and skillshot champs far harder to effectively use because they can freely reposition better and faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-27T17:47:04.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No what your not considering is a large minion wave and your just chilling in the middle not only can the enemy not reach you now since you are stuck in the minion wave but no skill shots can really hit you. I really hate creep block as a Melee champion player (Ekko), Do you know how many times I hit E to move up and then have to walk around my own creep which stops me from getting to my target. It drives me nuts!!!!!!!!!!! another thing that annoys me is casters early game attacking you when you go for a creep and they just killed one of your minions and now decide to go HAM on you. its a lot of damage early game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-07-27T03:13:40.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aren't most champion hitboxes bigger than minion hitboxes?","replies":[{"poster":"AnAggravatedPimp","date":"2018-07-27T03:17:49.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZackTheWaffleMan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zq3PVslU,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-07-27T03:13:40.573+0000)\n>\n> Aren&#x27;t most champion hitboxes bigger than minion hitboxes?\n\nBut it would lead to scenarios where a minions was inside a champions model but that minions was postitioned just the right way to block a skillshot.
