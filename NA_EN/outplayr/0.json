Recently Riot said that they would be giving out Riot Kayle as well as an icon for the awesome 10-year anniversary as long as you have played in the last few months. I got Riot Kayle but I didn't get my icon. I played over ten games that weekend waiting for my icon. This includes my 18-4 Ekko game with no \"S\". So could someone pls tell me why I haven't gotten my icon and/or how to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, :D\r\nMatthew","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T16:45:49.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gifts are being sent out individually, so you may not get it all at once.
