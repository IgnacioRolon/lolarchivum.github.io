I wait one painful day and it is still not working. I have tried everything on your website, even tried to repatch it with the Hextech Repair Tool. Now it won't even patch. I can't submit a ticket to your Riot Support page because it won't let me log in there either.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T17:02:21.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, sorry for all of this hassle you've been going through.  :(  It sounds like your network is struggling to reach the game server and kicking you off.  Our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help fix this up.  The HRT is also good to try auto-configuring your game file, but a reinstall or repatch won't do too much for a connection issue.  \n\nIf you continue running into issues, you can also reach out to us directly through email via support@riotgames.com.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"outplayr","date":"2017-12-09T13:14:16.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My game is completely broken...","replies":[]}]}
