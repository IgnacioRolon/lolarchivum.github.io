However, he can be played in a number of different roles (top, support, jungle, hell you can even play him mid ap if you want to have fun) and has the capability to make huge plays thanks to his ultimate.\r\n\r\nWorst: {{champion:203}} : A champion with a bunch of minigames as well as being forced to play either jungle or a gimmicky adc. If you are a new player to league of legends and end up with her in your first few games... \r\nWorst Honorable Mention: {{champion:122}} : Lets make a champion designed around killstea-I mean kill securing.\r\n\r\nWhat I think Riot&#039;s design philosophy is now: &quot;Elite Micro Skills... Counterplay and Big LCS plays. IF YOU CAN OUTPLAY YOUR OPPONENT YOU CAN 1 V 5&quot;\r\nBest: {{champion:114}} : Come on the queen of duelists. Can pull some ridiculous BS-I mean sick plays- with her dashes, her riposte and her damage.\r\n\r\nWorst: {{champion:223}} : The king of denying #BigLCSPlays\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy I play League of Legends: I play LoL instead of Dota 2 because I don&#039;t have to worry about games ending because of a freaking checklist or getting countered last pick and just losing the game. (In other words: pick phase doesn&#039;t determine who wins the game). In Dota 2 if the enemy Anti-Mage (A hard carry) gets like a 12 minute battlefury the game is pretty much over unless you UTTERLY STOMPED the other lanes. Oh look Arc Warden has a early midas... welp unless we end this in 15 minutes Rat Warden will be taking all of our racks. Finally, who can forget last pick broodmother when your team has no counters.\r\n\r\nWorst: {{champion:75}} : Your top laner lost lane against him or went even in lane? GG PREPARE FOR WOW RAID SIMULATOR. You rekt him in lane but game is 20+ minutes because you didn&#039;t push/win and he got a decent mid-game? GG PREPARE FOR  WOW RAID SIMULATOR. It is late game: GG PREPARE FOR WOW RAID SIMULATOR.\r\n{{champion:11}} : Did this dude get 1-2 early successful ganks where he got the kills? If yes then prepare for a game of &quot;hold hard CC&#039;s (not silences or slows... YOU NEED STUNS) and hope you are able to land them on yi before he alpha 2 shots your adc.&quot; Whats that you don&#039;t have a ton of hard cc&#039;s because you played blind pick normals and wanted to have fun with off-meta picks? Well then you lost.\r\n\r\nWorst Honorable Mention: {{champion:55}}  but at least silences are effective against her and she is pretty weak right now.\r\n\r\nBest: I don&#039;t really know. A lot of champions can be countered effectively even if your picks aren&#039;t great.\r\n\r\nMy favorite Champion: {{champion:90}} : I made a thread a while back on why I enjoy him but he pretty much fits my playstyle: Not ridiculously mobile, anti-assassin, tells your team &quot;hey clowns, I just suppressed their mid yasuo, go the fuck in&quot;.\r\n\r\nMy most hated champion: {{champion:92}} : Holy cow I hate this character. I hate the toxic riven mains who play her, I hate how she gets a bigger shield for stacking long swords. I hate her playstyle of &quot;always aggressive&quot;, &quot;always try to 2 v 1 under opponent&#039;s tower&quot;. In fact I always banned {{champion:92}} until season 6 where she actually isn&#039;t that strong right now and all the &quot;riven mains&quot; swapped to {{champion:157}}  or {{champion:11}}","replies":[]}
