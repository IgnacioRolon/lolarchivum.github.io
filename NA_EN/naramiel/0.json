The fact that it makes up the majority of your score has always seemed off to me. If you're achieving the main goals with middling farm, to my mind that's better than not achieving any other goals but having perfect farm.\r\n\r\nMy last game provided a good example (to me): as Udyr, I scored 9/1/10, 3 out of 4 dragons, rift herald, and 3 towers. My vision score was well ahead of everyone including both supports. However, because my farm was mediocre I got an A-.\r\nSo according to Riot, this was a subpar performance. I would definitely have gotten a better score if I had spent the entire time in the jungle farming (and warding). Is that really the kind of play we want to reward?","replies":[{"poster":"JuiceBoxP","date":"2019-05-22T15:43:55.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS is infact the MOST crucial skill in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2019-05-20T00:12:21.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don’t worry about the grading system.

Blue essence is meaningless past a certain point, but Hextech chests actually have some value. It's also the only way to advance in the mastery system, though I confess that's pretty unimportant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-05-20T00:00:46.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that so much emphasis is placed on cs because this game should be about 3 things: cs, vision, and objectives.
