Your network seems like it's degrading, so it's likely that over time you just won't be able to play any game.  I know that's a lot of uncertainty, so I recommend going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.  Make sure to go over each step to rule out possibilities, then test it in custom to be sure!","replies":[{"poster":"ydaTx","date":"2017-10-26T05:08:47.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the exact same problem and sometimes it does say that my connection has been lost. I've looked and looked for a solution, been through all of the YouTube videos and all of the forum feeds. No solution. I used to just reset my router and it would work, but not anymore. This bug made me quit LoL for about 6 months only to return to this shit. I know Riot employees have to follow their steps in directing people to the connection issues page, but it hasn't helped me. On every forum I see the same thing, a nice reply from a Riot employee with the same link near the bottom of their response. The only thing that i know for a fact works is going into Computer / Local Disc: C / Riot Games / League of Legends / Config / CFG File. Then once your in there you change the \"WindowMode\" to 1\nBut if you do this you have to play in windowed  mode (Which sucks) and if i swap back to full screen or borderless it has the same problem","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bentron","date":"2017-08-01T19:06:27.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the problem exists?","replies":[]}]}
