So they basically know, that people will keep the higher quality ones.  But since the preseason OE nerf they can&#039;t afford them. \r\nI have Elementalist lux, Arcade Hecarim, Project Leona, Alien Invader Heimerdinger and Drgon Blade Riven in my inventory and will not be able to afford them in the next centuries, looking at the OE drops.","replies":[]}
