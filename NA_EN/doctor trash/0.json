Or are you responding to those that are saying you make a bad play?\n\nRegardless of which on it is, you have to understand that this is a game. You are playing this seriously, but that one game of win or loss isn't going to suddenly make you hit your ranked goals.\n\nThink of this like street football or basketball. You can be competitive in the game, but the point is to get some fun out of the game and it is really pointless to get angry at some stranger that you probably won't see again.\n\nAlso understand how the rules of the behavioral system. Play within the rules and you'll be fine.
