Like to use flash sometimes i have to sit there and hit it over 5 times for it to do anything, and that goes with the other abilities as well. it works most of the time if I press the button and hold it down and then release. But everytime I hit the button, the sound plays when you press an abilitiy. Just sometimes they don&#039;t go off... HALp\r\n\r\nI tried repairing/ reinstalling\r\nriots keyboard and mouse trouble shooting ideas.\r\nI can&#039;t find any suggestions online on what to do.\r\nany help will be appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:43:00.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given you have tried multiple different troubleshooting steps already, I would like to rule out packet loss on your connection as a possible root cause.  Essentially, when you press the key you are telling the server to execute a command, but if that packet of information never reaches it, then nothing will happen. This would also explain why hitting it 5 times will cause it to go off normally.\n\nTo rule this out, make sure to use our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader).  It will let you know if you have any packet loss, or any other connection issues as well as steps you should take.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Wet Mustard","date":"2017-12-01T06:35:08.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem but I don't experience any kind of packet loss, lag, or connectivity issues while playing. I have a packet loss of 0.06%. I've been experiencing this for quite a few patches now and I need help because It's extremely annoying while I'm playing and my spells and abilities don't go off.","replies":[]}]}]}
