Thanks everybody!\n\nAlso, I should clarify since people keep posting the same \"how to beat krugs 100% of the time\" comment, I typically don't have a problem ~95% of the time. It's just that little 5% of the time where nothing is going right that game and needed an item to stay afloat, but couldn't get one because I didn't have one. Even it happening that small amount seemed too frequent as item drop numbers should really be the same for everybody, that's all :) #NormalizeItemDropQuantites\n\n ","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-07-28T03:27:45.389+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I actually wonder if there is a way to position against the krugs so the furthest Krug will be killed first..","replies":[{"poster":"SpaceDonut","date":"2019-07-29T22:52:17.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kei143,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=uaHvAaWv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-07-28T03:27:45.389+0000)\n>\n> I actually wonder if there is a way to position against the krugs so the furthest Krug will be killed first..\n\nBlitzcrank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Disulfiram","date":"2019-07-28T15:21:43.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can put a tanky champion close to the two krugs on the side: it will keep them distracted while the rest of the team focuses and kills the other krug first.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamo Tua","date":"2019-07-29T12:09:31.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works only if you do not have assassins in your team, that can and in 2/3 of times will teleport to the pack instead to the single one and so your team fails because one tank and one dps will die from the 2 before the seperate one died.

The problem is the dps do come from this teleporting assa when u have at least 2 tanks one for the pack and one for the solo one.

Availability of stronger units sooner, with Morgana, Kennen, Volibear and Aatrox being hotly contested, you want to get them coming up as soon as you can.\n\n2. Getting the core of your composition as soon as possible, synergies help a lot, you'll have core units you're wanting and you'll want them as soon as possible.\n\n3. Player damage mitigation, more units on the field means less chance of losing by large margins and less chance of taking a lot of early damage that can be hard to recover from. \n\nI'm seeing players even in Plat trying to use the econ strategy only to get eliminated before wolves, right now you shouldn't be trying to econ early unless you're doing high roll and that's entirely dependent on getting several 2 star units before the end of the initial creep waves. Econ only comes in now when you have your composition core and are at a place where you can mitigate/win fights more often than not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"phoda","date":"2019-07-30T14:50:28.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#leveling. 5 champs beat them","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGreatRasputin","date":"2019-07-29T18:48:11.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Raptors are worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Booty Heals","date":"2019-07-28T23:38:39.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually have to level to 5 and put 2 knights, 2 rangers, and someone random just to beat it and if I do beat it by some reason I always get 6 gold ffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-07-28T21:26:13.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have no items or level 2 champions you can beat krugs every time be leveling up to put 6 champions on the board and positioning them on the right side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Barkley","date":"2019-07-28T16:44:28.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 things you can do to 100% beat krugs:\n\n1.)
