Then they repeat the word \"excited\" several times as if it's an  English  101 course, pretty fucking sad. I'm not excited about gambling. \n\nAgain afterward, they repeat several times they don't think consistency is healthy for the game. This only proves my point that they have no idea what they doing.\n\nThey could instantly turn this mode around with normalized item drops but for some reason they don't. It's so weird, I'll never understand why they refuse to listen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-10T14:20:10.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That same post mentioned above, https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/JPnqfEBT-tft-new-item-distribution-system, says:\n\n> \"Behind the scenes we’ve done a LOT to control how we distribute the boxes, as well as what’s inside the boxes. Our goal is that games have a lot of variation, but that they also have some degree of fairness to them. **So the amount of boxes are much more controlled across the entire game.** The difference between the best and worst cases is now much more narrow than before.\n> \n> [...] In addition, the total number of boxes and items across the entire game is much more controlled. **If you start off slow, there are more boxes and items coming.** We also prevent the most extreme and wacky cases (no gold boxes before stage 2-6, no more than 3 gold boxes per person max, etc).\"\n\nI really think these changes are at least close to what people are asking for.  If you don't get items immediately, you get extra later.  Also, from playing on PBE, the gold you get in those boxes is far higher than previously.  Give it a try before knocking it.","replies":[]}]}
