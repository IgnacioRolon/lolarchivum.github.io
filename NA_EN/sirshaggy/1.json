Honestly. I want to know. Why is this community made of so many sociopaths? And what's with their fixation on people being gold?\n\nSo my ping decided to be stable today so I wanted to see how playing a normal game by myself would go. It's rare I have a nice day where it isn't going up and down from 60 to 200. So I'm just playing my game as Quinn ADC. We're having fun. Nice jungle pow-wow with the enemy team before the game starts. And then I get screwed over in bot lane by the enemy Zed with no MIA. Me and my Thresh die and the tower goes with us. Ok, whatever, it sucks but it happens.\n\nI'm farming trying to catch back up and my team starts fighting in mid. Our Azir's laughing saying I'm on \"tilt\" for not joining. When I told him I was just trying to farm back up he goes \"Oh, you're gold. That explains it.\"... This happens to me in like half of my normal games. My NORMAL games! Why the hell do people always pull this card? Why do they look at rank in the first place? It's so damn frustrating.\n\nOf course I'm pretty pissed now but me and my Thresh explain to him that I was just going to farm to be relevant again. He of course replies to this with more douche-baggery. Then his buddy Darius chimes in with \"You don't get it Quinn. You don't get it. You don't have enough experience. You don't know how to make plays that aren't completely r%%%%%ed.\" This is quickly followed by a circle-jerk between him and Azir about how shitty I am for being gold.\n\nI got fucking mad. I ragequit. I told the enemy team to report them and myself for leaving. I know, it isn't fair to the other people playing, and I could have muted them once they started talking shit, but I just can't stand playing the game like that. As a sensitive guy who got bullied growing up it seriously makes me shake, heat up, and gives me a migraine. I just can't deal with it. What the hell is wrong with the people? Why are people in my blind-pick games always screwing with gold players? This just makes me want to finish my promos to platinum so I can never hear this bullshit again...\n\nSorry for the rant... I'm just so tired of running into people like this. I know I shouldn't let it get to me, but it puts me into a really shitty mood. Like I've been typing this for twenty minutes and I'm still stressed about it. Please people, stop being so damn mean for no good reason. My anxiety would really appreciate it.\n\nTL;DR Community sucks. Especially to gold players.

You have Challenger, Masters, Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze.  Challenger - Diamond is literally 1-2% of the server.  Like you said, Gold is roughly 30% of the server. So like in my mind, i think hmmm gold.. must make u like average or something? But really it means holy shit! ur top 1/3 of the players. Idk it has just really bothered me, maybe because I have played this game so long and still am silver. like in my mind, bronze means your new, silver means your better than the new players but need work, Gold would be average, and then up from there. But that is not what it means in this game at all. \n\nThe other weird thing about this game is the rank resets at the beginning of the season. Its fine and dandy for those Challenger - Diamond players cuz lets face it, they play a fuck ton of solo rank and now they can finally find games. But it really messes up things on the lower end of the spectrum. Like my cousin, who has always been bronze. He went like 8-2 in his promos this season (ended season 4 in like bronze 1 or 2). Its like damn dude nice! good work!. Well he got bronze 4.... Which is w/e, but my buddy who was silver 3 last season did bad in placements and also got bronze 4.. You also see gold players drop to bronze at the start of the season. So wtf are bronze players supposed to do? There is no where for them to go but down or wait half the year until people get back to their old ranks. Idk, just seems weird. Then you have these new players who dont know shit come in and play 10 provisional games and automatically get put into silver since they started playing ranked with only a few months left. Then they tell their friends \"hahah I got silver and I just got 30 like a month ago\". Then they got 2-13 (as someone said above) and are in silver 4 but really should be low bronze.\n\nI just feel ranks in this game can be meaningful if you play a lot of games and want to judge yourself vs your pers on average. But at the same time it is not the tell tale sign of much, because obviously ranks can fluctuate a lot especially at the lower elos.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-09-02T00:01:21.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well once you account for people playing more than one name 30% is prob 50% at best, so good is average probably, plat is competitive and pretty good, diamond is really good to great players.

(I actually played some PvP recently, and I was happy that I was. But slowly became depressed again after the enemy was spamming laugh & focusing me) But because I have depression now and become tired whenever I play actual PvP game besides customs with friends.\n---\n\nMy response to:\n> I'm farming trying to catch back up and my team starts fighting in mid. Our Azir's laughing saying I'm on \"tilt\" for not joining. When I told him I was just trying to farm back up he goes **\"Oh, you're gold. That explains it.\"** ... \n\nI have a sad story, that I will try to cut down in length. Please tell me if this is okay to you.\n\nSo here I am Queuing up for Solo-Que, and I get into a game. The enemy team (which I did not look up, unlike them.) have one Gold and one Platinum. This means the Platinum player had Que'd up with lower levels. Which is not okay because the MMR is split and I have to endure this game. They didn't say anything until their Yasuo walks into my blue and tries to take it, and we get first blood. I said ''Okay?'' - I knew I shouldn't but I wanted to know why. The response was something along the lines of ''You aren't allowed to type''. At this point I thought he was just an asshole because maybe something happened on the enemy team. But that wasn't the case... I also didn't mute him and here is why:\n\nThe Plat and Gold start harassing me ''Because you are Bronze haha you don't get to type.'' --- this butterfly effected all the way to my Ally Top Laner, and he starts saying stupid things like ''Wow they are right\" and \"You move like Bronze player''. What the hell does that even mean? That legitimate, if I read that out loud, sounds like what a 10 year old would say. \n\nNow of course I have someone (who is Silver 5 by the way) telling me I play like a Bronze player. I feel like garbage because I can't say anything without being harassed on both sides.\n\nThe enemies are purposely dying every so often, then saying that it doesn't matter if we are fed because I'm bad. \n\nSo what really threw me off the edge, is that I get top fed early on, around 3-4 kills. But guess what he builds against 4 APs and 1 AD? ... armor... The Plat notices this and asks why, then saying ''#JustSilverThings'' --- okay, that's awesome. I then ask why and what he says just made me rethink my life ''I don't even care for this game.'' ... I felt like I was back in Pre-School again. I can't even react to that! That is borderline harassment on multiple levels. I did the best I could and we were doing fine, but he insists that we lose because ''ur bronze.'' \n\nI needed a hug and I felt like crying.\nI'm pretty sure ranks are a badge of skill and effort, not a birthright. :(\n\n---\n\n[Vent]\n##Serious question:\n##Why does rank matter? If all I see from higher Elos are just a bunch of Egotistical jerk-offs? \n\n**I honestly can't and don't want play Ranked for 4 reasons.**\n\n* Everyone is on tilt; the last time I played ranked, it took one person freaking out just because I didn't take Flash to mess up the whole game spread the unnecessary hate for everyone. \n* DuoQue, I'm not gonna repeat that. - ''We want bottom. Doesn't matter if you are first pick.'' - something along those lines.\n* Why should I play ranked? If I can just play normals and have FUN. You know, the thing that video games are for? I get that there are people who have fun in Ranked but I just can't.\n* What is the point of getting a higher rank? I've had countless people say/act to not want to play with me, because of their superiority complexes, just because they are a little bit higher in ranked? Why does it genuinely matter?

I'll admit that even unranked, I'm more secure about my play and find most players that aren't at least Gold 1 to play very poorly. I constantly see teammates and enemies alike that commonly have the same bad play habits, and those don't usually disappear until Plat/Diamond for most people (and even then, some of the \"high elo\" streams I see just make me facepalm). The point is that you should expect this kind of thing. Not just for being under Plat, but also because it's the internet... and LoL... and this community. Just gotta thicken up that skin and shrug that sh~t off.\n\nOne last thing. Don't rely on MIA pings or chat. **Only rely on yourself.** Watch your map constantly. If you go 5 seconds without glancing at it, you're doing it wrong. That isn't just \"elitism\" either.
