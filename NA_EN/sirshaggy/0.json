They offer a fun and unique playstyle that can go Top, ADC, and even Mid sometimes. An ADC that can be an assassin, or a split-pushing lane-bullying bruiser. They&#039;re not LCS viable, but anyone that invests enough time to learn their playstyle will find themselves snowballing quickly with relative ease. As the first ADC I&#039;ve ever gotten good at, I love Quinn and Valor! They&#039;re a great pick for learning how to position, read the map, and  noticing when you have an opportunity for a good trade or a punish on enemies that over-extend. Being able to play such an underrated pick with success really put a smile on my face. It felt like old Karma again!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it&#039;s old Karma again. With the way the PBE changes are looking Quinn and Valor is going to become Quinn and Quinn getting a ride from her pigeon friend. They not only removed her iconic blind that allowed her to 1v1 Vaynes and Rengars late-game, but completely reworked her partner Valor into an MMO mount. Now instead of being a situational yet powerful form of burst damage, dueling, and escapes, Valor is just Quinn&#039;s magic carpet to sail around the map on. Two kit-defining abilities were completely removed, and the last one, Skystrike, has been kept in just for the sake of nostalgia but doesn&#039;t actually have a use or deal any real damage. A 2-second channel for a mana-draining speedboost... That&#039;s an ultimate? They removed Valor&#039;s entire ability to fight and be his own character for that?\r\n\r\nQuinn and Valor are supposed to be partners! They&#039;re a duo that works together. It&#039;s not like Annie and Tibbers or Nunu and Willump where one is just an accessory to the other. When Riot said they were going to work on a couple changes for Quinn/Valor I was already nervous, but they promised they would be keeping all the unique parts of their kit that the fans enjoyed. Once again Riot you&#039;ve exceeded my expectations. You&#039;ve completely gone against your word and are going to destroy the identity of another champion I love playing. I&#039;ve only seen one reason for these changes: &quot;We&#039;re trying to make her a roaming ADC&quot;. She already IS a roaming ADC! You win lane, then you roam or you split-push! You want her to be more of a roaming ADC? Fix her bugs so she can more easily win lane and roam! Or lower her ult cooldown! You don&#039;t have to rework her kit to accomplish this! This is just change for the sake of change at this point. It really does feel like a joke.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care if they&#039;re never LCS-viable or even strong in the meta. I care about preserving what drew people to the champion in the first place. The whole appeal of playing as Quinn AND Valor is gone. It&#039;s just Quinn, a girl with a bird in her arsenal. All you had to do was fix the bugs on her autos and Vault, and maybe give some defensive stats to Valor. That&#039;s it. Everyone&#039;s happy. But I know how stubborn you are to admit mistakes or even find any sort of compromise with players so I&#039;m not keeping my hopes up of ever being able to play my favorite ADC twosome again. It might look like them, but it sure as hell won&#039;t feel like them. I expect a refund on Corsair. Next time you rework a champion can you please be honest with your players that you&#039;re going to ruin their playstyle and identity? I&#039;d really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"jade harley BARK","date":"2015-10-31T01:44:45.661+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Despite the majority disagreeing with these changes, odds are they're going to be official.

This new ult is solely just for roaming, nothing else. It's not really an escape when one hit from a minion disrupts the cast or one hit from an enemy champion cancels it. It's not really an engage either because...okay you're in lane now all you can do is vault and be pushed away. Additionally, taking away her blind is another core aspect being removed.

I agree that in some ways, Quinn's \"niche\" role was more of a role-mashup between assassin and adc that made her not necessarily as effective at either role as some other champ could have been. So, making a change that gets her back on track to serving a needed purpose at all levels of play is gonna require a little more than a few tweaks.\n\nAT THE SAME TIME, the spirit of Quinn is the spirit of tag-team, and this is no longer a tag-team. It's just Quinn, with a premium membership to Gandalf's winged transportation services. Riot is not touching on the real issue. Valor's kit is basically a slight modification to Quinn's. Quinn's is best as a ranged champion, and that's why Valor suffered except during niche assassination opportunities. Quinn left you in a lot of situations where you actually had to wonder whether you should just stay as Quinn so you don't a) lose your passive and b) get blown up 'cause why the heck would you dive into melee range of 4 enemies?\n\nSwitching to a spammable ult from some OP rare-uber-burst skystrike that occurs maybe 10 times in total during a game? AWESOME. GOOD MOVE RIOT. You've made a step to balancing the roles between Quinn and Valor. Replacing everything else Valor did with, nothing? Uh, wait a sec... back up, huh? His main purpose when you're Quinn is both offensive and defensive utility. Shouldn't he be doing the same when you ult? The roaming is a good aspect to that, but it shouldn't be the ONLY aspect. Valor needed something to make him stand out more on a regular basis and for regular use, but something that would fit a melee style and put him on even ground with Quinn in terms of usefulness.\n\nIf it were me, I would experiment with a lower-damage but more defense/utility-oriented Valor that matches his uses for Quinn (he's a bird, not a gun/crossbow/cannon toting serial killer.) Consider, for example, the fact that he's in flight - shouldn't some of his movement put him in an untargetable state?  Here's a collection of suggestion:\n\n* Instead of autoattacking, you're right clicks on enemy players periodically (maybe once every 2 seconds) marks them for OTHER players, like Valor does for Quinn when you ARE Quinn?\n* Increase the cc effects on q and e and reduce the cooldown, BUT drastically reduce the damage output. \n* Turn W into a semi-spammable toggle between \"flight\" mode where you soar above the battlefield, untargetable, granting vision and remove collision with walls, but can't interact with enemies offensively - and a ground-grazing mode, where you gain a temporary speed boost (from the falcon dive) and the abillity to use q and e and auto-marking (this could be EXTREMELY OP for spammable vision/untargettableness without extra balancing mechanics, but I think it would be very fun and unique, and also easily balanced with said additional mechanics. Maybe add huge mana costs, or a limited number of uses in a given use of Valor, or a fairly long channel mode between states while granting vision on Valor for the enemy team for the duration of flight mode (it's a bird, in the air. Surely people see it.)\n\nDidn't expect to make a rework suggestion. Guess I should make a thread out of this toolkit suggestion. But back on point: The Quinn/Valor tag-team would become a glass-cannon/support-tank tag team. You would STILL have unique combo, STILL maintain the spirit of tag-team, and you'd potentially make Valor effective for teamfights and other purposes instead of just the rare assassination.\n\nMaybe this isn't the best alternative choice for a rework, but it's better than \"we're demoting Valor to dishwashing duty.\"\n\nBottom line: Riot, the OP is right. Fix Valor's \"niche use\" issue, but don't gut the tag-team.","replies":[{"poster":"freeformline","date":"2015-10-31T05:56:30.448+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GetMariahCarried,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=98WfAxEA,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-10-31T03:12:33.149+0000)The spirit of Quinn is the spirit of tag-team, and this is no longer a tag-team.

In my experience, most people who play Quinn, including myself, do so for the fantasy of playing a true tag-team duo. In other words, they like turning into a bird and killing people! Quinn and Valor are currently the closest thing we have a true tag-team because they are the only case where you can play two champions. There are transformers like Elise and partnerships like Kindred, but there is no other case where you can press a button to simply switch out and play a different person/bird. I would hope any rework to Quinn and Valor would be made to enhance that tag-team-turn-into-a-bird-and-kill-them identity, and I am disappointed that the changes they are looking at now are taking them in the opposite direction.\n\nAs a side note, I think allowing Valor to apply harrier marks to enemies that other teammates can consume would be pretty neat. It would be a great way to enhance Valor's unique kit, though it would move Quinn and Valor a little away from her typical assassin identity.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-31T06:12:56.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you like the idea, check out the thread I just made for it that flushes out the ideas a lot more (I realized it was turning into a toolkit suggestion, which basically means \"thread time\").\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/iuNk4c74-a-better-valor-rework-meh-close-enough\n\nIt removes the \"and kill them\" aspect, but I think that was the sticking point that made Quinn-balancing hard, as I discuss in the thread.

The goal of league to to have many unique choices. I would argue that Quinn being unable to do _**something**_ better than anyone else makes her hum-drum, and I think most players agree (not saying your opinion isn't valid, just that it's the minority one).\n\nQuestion: Have you given her a try on the PBE?

A play-making, high risk/reward, assassin/duelist marksman. Honestly, it sounds like Vayne but their playstyles are very different. Quinn capitalized on early game powerspikes so she can continuously shut-down carries with her bursty Valor form later.

Aside from maybe Vayne, who Quinn counters, no other ADCs can really do all this. If people took the time to learn to master her they'd see that she has many unique strengths of her own and is far from trash-tier. You don't like her right now? Well the people that took the time to play her and learned how to utilize her kit correctly DO like her and see no reason why she can't remain the same but with a few bug fixes they've neglected to give her since her release. There's nothing inherently wrong with her kit that deserves this much change. This is the same crap that happened with Karma. Underrated, underplayed, never looked at, and reworked into something unrecognizable from her original concept cause people didn't have a clear idea what she actually did.\n\nNo, I have not. I've seen videos but don't have a PBE account myself. My main complaint is that they're destroying her thematically by removing Valor's ability to fight. They're gutting her ultimate into something completely different that goes against what they originally set out for with the champ. They advertised in her damn spotlight that you play as Quinn AND Valor. That's the actual name of the champ. If Riot's vision really was plain and they aren't \"preserving champ identities for their mains\" then they need to stop saying it! Stop asking for our feedback and saying you're just going to make a couple tweaks! Just tell us outright you're reworking our main into something different and give us a reason why. I have no problem with them giving a champ these abilities, but why not put it on a new champion? Not one that already has an established playstyle and fanbase. I like new Karma, I'm sure I'll find a way to enjoy new Quinn, but it's not the same champion I mained and bought the skin for when you remove so much of her original kit and characterization.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2015-11-01T06:28:52.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RyodinWake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=98WfAxEA,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-10-30T22:05:00.063+0000)\n>\n> She's the best duelist ADC in the game, has almost instant hard cc, the ability to assassinate squishies in one rotation, can destroy/kite bruisers by herself, and is a god-like split-pusher.\n\nShe beats tanks.

Not to mention she's ridiculously oppressive in top lane if you don't have a ranged auto attack. That's what's wrong with her right now.\n\nBut instead of trying to fix any of this, they change her ultimate.

She ISN'T in a good spot, because she can't do ANY of her jobs better than other champs. As you've already said, that keeps her from being a competitive pick.

Reworking a champ simply because she is unpopular.\n\nPeople weirded themselves out whenever I say Quinn is actually strong botlane, especially when working with a backline support that can just throw all the buffs. You see stupid scaling ADCs like Jinx, Vayne, or Trist? Fuck that shit, throw a blind and Quinn now can 1v1 them at ANY stage of the game. You see smelly lane bullies like Cait? No, step down, Quinn is our queen today. And now add a just as underrated Lulu support and it's literally a free win lane. I loved Quinn despite of her weird kit, and even the playerbase (more like Quinn mains) are awesome people. She is so underrated, so if I ever see one (which is actually only five times this season in ranked), I know botlane is going to be awesome, even if we don't win games. Speaking of snowballing... good times!\n\nFrom a pretty darn unique kit that is unpopular to a \"just your roaming poky adc hurr durr\", that's what I'm seeing (or at least sorta). I'm pretty sure her identity is some kind of \"scouting tag team\", in which is already fitting in her old kit. In the new one, the \"tag team\" doesn't really fit anymore, Valor is pretty much a MMO mount, like you mentioned.\n\nJust remember the Morde rework that created a community backlash. Just remember the death of Old Karma that actually has a unique kit instead of being Lulu v0.1.5.
