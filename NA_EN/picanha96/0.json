Still unable to log in.\n-Other family members with League accounts that use the computer are able to log into player support.\n\nHe has been trying for days now to log in to player support, but can't seem to do so.  I hope this gives a bit of clarification on what he's tried, and maybe you can give some insight on what he needs to do next.  He's been trying to do the last step on account recovery, but can't log in to support to submit the ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"Picanha96","date":"2017-01-19T20:16:06.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am trying to submit a ticket again through the account recovery form but above the subject line there is a red box reading\nRequester: Picanha96 is suspended.\n\nI cannot log in Support specifically any more that is happening last 2-3 months.\nI can continue to play the game and use the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-01-19T20:31:40.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you receive a reply when you submitted an email to support@riotgames.com?
