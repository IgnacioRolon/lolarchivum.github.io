Ever since patch 6.10 whenever Vladimir would Q someone you can actually hear his base skins Q sound underneath the Blood Lord sound. This is also apparent with his E which actually plays the sounds from the old Vladimir E. \r\n\r\nAlso, on a side note. Ever since the Mage update,  Blood Lord Vladimir&#039;s visual particles have also been glitchy. Previously, the veins on his cape would glow red whenever he performed Transfusion and the blood ball he carries around seems to be hollow and overly shiny. I&#039;m not sure if this was intended but it is very unfortunate to lose these effects especially on a legendary skin. \r\n\r\nRiot can you please take a look at this to make sure everything is working properly. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-05-22T14:28:06.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also noticed these things too when i was spectating someone play vladimir.
