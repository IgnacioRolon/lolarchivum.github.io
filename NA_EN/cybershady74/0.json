I hope you guys will like my suggestion and Riot/LOL team will take it into consideration.\n\nGo fk your trolling self, i've already been thru plenty of threads who do extremely bad suggestions, perm ARURF is one i have seen plenty of times and lets go over the facts again.\n\n1. \"Perming a game mode can unintentionally cause a similar experience to the 'ARAM only' account gag\", Alot of players already pull this by only playing select champions in ARAM so they basically always roll those champions, with ARURF having the same formula but even more busted, it would end up spawning ARURF accounts. It would make the 'regular' players continue to have a bad experience because they constantly face the same busted champions ({{champion:35}} , {{champion:5}} , {{champion:119}} , {{champion:245}} just to list a few).\n\n2. \"Those game modes can end up exhausting people because of the excitement\", A problem on some games is if they just keep throwing out too much content to play, then people will get tired by it, leave a very highly stressful but addictive mode to play, then people will likely play it so much they end up getting sick of playing the game and might only play that mode and not play any other game modes ever.\n\n3. \"Flash itself is a abusive spell, using it as a positive reason to promote perm ARURF is the same excuse as people who would white knight exploitations and broken champions in LoL and likely are part of the reason why Riot get delayed from removing the broken gameplay mechanics that make so many champions get shafted from gameplay\", Your 'reasoning' is that AR URF is better then every other game mode, you just basically admit on that end that you were basically saying \"LuLz, just scrap all the game modes and make everyone play AR URF\", that my sir is basically saying Riot should just give up on LoL and turn it into a salt'fest of screwery.\n\n4. Even if AR URF is not supposed to be balanced, the plain problem with high frequency of specific champions appearing just ruins any fun in matches. They really just need to make ARAM and ARURF into proper 'All Random' modes so they can easily resolve the 'meta abuse' as you can call it in those modes since it feels like half the people are able to pull broken champions in the high tiers and no one ends up pulling a 'shitty champ in Aram/Arurf', even if the champion is normally a good champion in regular mode. Obviously 'normal' tier can exist in AR URF, but when you can never see champions such as:\n\n{{champion:164}} ,{{champion:163}} , {{champion:74}} , {{champion:79}} , {{champion:201}} , {{champion:429}} , {{champion:240}} , {{champion:76}} , {{champion:20}} , {{champion:154}} ,{{champion:106}} ,{{champion:254}} and so on. Even much so where i basically don't see them in aram or barely that much to even count as 'appearances', it feels like a bunch of people basically 'refunded' most of those champions to nerf pull them in 'rolls' ever again. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"idiot482","date":"2017-03-13T17:56:03.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh, I enjoy urf more than aurf and I play a little of everyone so all I could see was whiners complaining about zed/shaco/diana/etc, whiners in every mode so I've just become unfazed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkLordArbitur","date":"2017-03-12T16:50:06.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying, Taliyah has the potential to be a nightmare in arurf.
