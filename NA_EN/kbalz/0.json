They hide behind the interns \"business as usual\" we're just going to reboot.  The connection issues are the player's fault, not ours.. its so different compared to two years ago. Riot doesn't listen, or TALK to their players like they used to.\r\n\r\nTryndamere used to come on the boards and say \"man I'm sorry the servers lagged once on Saturday, everyone gets 400 RP.. or win bonus\"   \r\n\r\nnow its EVERY DAY. Attempting to Reconnect. total crash. DDOS. bots.  Riot is so far behind now.. they only care about SR visual update, and skins.","replies":[]}
