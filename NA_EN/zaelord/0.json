{"poster":"ZAELORD","date":"2018-02-22T20:08:20.228+0000","title":"I really want Kai'Sa to succeed","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"So after playing Kai&#039;sa a few times I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that most other people have: She needs work.\r\n\r\nI doubt that Riot will do anything to fix it at this point, but regardless here&#039;s an opinion/analysis from some one who _really_ wants her to succeed: \r\n\r\nHer gameplay is fun and inventive. I like it a lot since it fits my playstyle nicely, honestly I&#039;ll probably end up maining her for a while because she&#039;s so fun and has a nice learning curve. Her model is also really sleek as well as her skin and I like it a lot. I know that plenty of people have had problems with how she looks, and I have some issues too, but honestly all of that is so superficial. In order to survive in literally the _most dangerous place in the universe_, she would have to be in good shape, which means have a nice body. Attractiveness comes from our basic drive to be with someone who is healthy, and damn bro, she needs to be healthy to live in the Void. Say what you will about &quot;too many sexy champs&quot; but we haven&#039;t had a conventional &quot;sexy&quot; champ in quite a long time and it&#039;s kinda nice to think about how someone who had to live through hell got at least something nice. Of course, there was a lot of things that she could&#039;ve been, and I agree with some opinions over others. \r\n\r\nThough I&#039;m waiting for the lore to be released, so far it feels like the symbiote isn&#039;t.. void-ey enough. It doesn&#039;t do what other Void creatures conventionally do. No Voidling is submissive or beneficial to anyone but themselves; why then is this one? IMO it would make for a better narrative for the thing to be more parasitic and have Kai be able to beat it into submission than for it to initially think: We can help each other. That&#039;s a big reason why people are dissatisfied: She doesn&#039;t represent the Void like she should because right now _it just doesn&#039;t make sense_ . I can see Riot justifying why she looks the way she does in the lore, and her suit can account for why she doesn&#039;t have scars, but It really doesn&#039;t matter what she looks like because, as ya mommy always told ya: it&#039;s whats on the inside that counts. That&#039;s the real problem with Kai&#039;Sa: she doesn&#039;t have a compelling enough personality to make her stand out from all the other attractive girls or Voidlings in the game. \r\n\r\nPeople can be attractive. Plenty of people are. But the reason why people stand out is because of their personality, their motives, their desires. I don&#039;t see a lot of that in Kai&#039;Sa. She could be the optimistic, badass hunter, loner type girl that she _should_ be, that Riot has made her out to be. But all of her lines and design so far doesn&#039;t really reflect that. \r\n\r\nAgain, waiting on Lore for a solid opinion, but the thing that annoys me more than anything is her VO. I can take the accent that&#039;s fine. But based off of the VO she might as well not have been in the Void at all. Yeah sure there are a few lines that indicate it and some that are great, but I feel as if someone thrown into again, _the most dangerous place in the universe_ would be mentally scarred from it. Even if she got used to it. There isn&#039;t much indication of it right now. \r\n\r\nAlso, this might be just a weird thing for me, but her lines ramble a lot. Like they are too wordy or long. I could get that if she was talking to herself to stay sane, but it&#039;s when she&#039;s talking to other characters and it just feels... weird. IDK. I don&#039;t mind if she doesn&#039;t have good social skills, but it should feel intentionally written awkward not unintentional. \r\n\r\nBack to the suit, I wish it was more than &quot;really itchy&quot;. Isn&#039;t it alive? Is she worried about it? Does she trust it? How did she get it? This suit is just as much apart of her as anything else now, she should talk about it more. \r\n\r\nHowever, despite all that, she does have some parts that I really like. She loves peaches. That&#039;s great! It makes her feel human. She counts kills. Also fun! But I just feel like overall she is really flat and confused at the moment and it&#039;s just hard to stomach. I have faith in Riot. They usually do really well, but I _really_ want Kai&#039;Sa to succeed. I want to be as excited to play her as I am to play Jhin (my main), but right now I would only be playing her for the gameplay, not the character like I do with Jhin or Zoe.\r\n\r\nRiot has the means to make her great, but I&#039;m worried they&#039;ll skip over her. Even if they had to take her down for a while, it would be worth it to me if they put real effort into her to make it worthwhile. I want her to do well I really do.","replies":[{"poster":"CoolRadius","date":"2018-02-22T21:56:55.576+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":6,"body":"Zaelord! Thanks for taking the time to express your feelings on Kai'Sa. I am confident that your questions can be answered upon spending more time with her. As well, there is more coming that I think will shed a little light on her and her relationship with the Void, her skin and what she desires. I hope I'm not being cheeky about it, but hopefully you'll see more as you play with her more. Thanks so much for being a passionate player and taking the time to give us some feedback.

It's just straight up evidence that her intended character design doesn't carry across to the platform where it will actually matter (the rift). It's not like you need to read Jhin's or Aurelion Sol's stories to find them compelling. \n\n>As well, there is more coming that I think will shed a little light on her and her relationship with the Void, her skin and what she desires.\n\nThis is not a validated argument in regards to the nature of League, if the character can't convey who they are through solely the game, the design appears to be flat no matter how much lore she has displayed on the Universe page. The concept is incredible at its core, yet my opinion is that there's way too much unexplored and wasted potential where Kai'sa only functions as a mediocre placeholder. It sounds harsh but I just assume a certain standard from Riot's design team as they have create incredible pieces of art during the past year {{champion:164}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:497}}.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2018-02-23T18:50:04.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me or does she play similarly to {{champion:84}} and akali 2.0 {{champion:131}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-02-23T17:20:23.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn’t what we wanted to hear.

If you have nothing to talk about other than the present, \nyou have to make the most ou of it ( at least i think that could be an explanation).\n\n\nWhat really bugs me are the visuals.\nI like the direction. Badass huntergirl with living armor from the horror-dimesion.\nI think it's great that she's a beauty, but her suit, which is actually a void-creatur, seems lackluster.\nIt's not horrific enough.\nMake it disgusting. Make it creepy. Make us say: \"Good God, how can she wear that?\"\nA full unsettling beauty-theme. Pretty, but you just can't look at her.\n\nAt some point she says something about others seeing her as ugly or repugnant, but that she's on their side.\nThat line feels misplaced since she looks very human and her suit, apart from the two wing-rocketlauncher-thingies on her back, quite normal.\n\nWell, here's hoping for a skin that embraces the horror-aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Lore Connoisseur","date":"2018-02-23T09:31:01.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I saw the little opening thingies on her thigh, I really wanted it to be more...visceral.
