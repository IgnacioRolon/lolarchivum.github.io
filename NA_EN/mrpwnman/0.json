To start off, your quick fix might be to swap back to the legacy client then return to the updated version.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI can't blame you for feeling frustrated, I'd be pretty pissed too if I couldn't use my mats.  Let me know if that does the trick for you.","replies":[{"poster":"mrpwnman","date":"2017-03-08T18:31:44.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT WORKED!!!
