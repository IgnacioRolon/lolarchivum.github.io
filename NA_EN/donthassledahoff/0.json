We made the whole package visually match the client, Champ Select, and Hextech Crafting, which means a few buttons and bars got moved. Most notably, you&rsquo;ll see that the navigation bar has moved from its old spot on the left side of the store to the top (see below). \n\nhttp://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/misc/forums/2016/svu_featuredLanding_publishing.jpg\n\nOther changes include:\n\n* A more streamlined navigation bar \n* A Gameplay menu featuring Runes and Boosts, \n* An Accessories menu, including Wards, Icons, Chests and Keys\n* A new Account Icon in the upper right, where name changes can be made\n* A new RP button (ohhh fancy)\n\nWe hope you dig it. Let us know what you think.

Given the nature of splash arts, it feels like a battle-scene stretching across the whole client. With the current shop there's the tabs on the left, and the misc. things like top sellers on the right. It's easier on the eyes to have some larger portions to rest from all the action-y/bright splashes. There's a lot going on in each splash, and making them so large and having so many of them is just a bit.. _much_.","replies":[{"poster":"Enshaedn Embrula","date":"2016-02-27T08:38:02.040+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"I just wanna slightly disagree here.

To me it doesn't look cluttered at the moment, and the new addition doesn't look cluttered either. It shows stuff that isn't going to be there forever, such as sale items.
