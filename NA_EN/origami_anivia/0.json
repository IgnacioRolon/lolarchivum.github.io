I would instead suggest that if combining would add a 4th item, the FOURTH items simply doesn't get put on, and you retain what was already there.  You had to purposefully put max items on someone, so there's no reason you should be able to add something in addition.  It should be the \"new\" item that gets thrown on the bench, rather than ones you designed to be there permanently.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GSLEWISH","date":"2019-07-14T08:51:33.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just add a question after the carousel asking if you want to combine.
