If you compare it to a [picture of a real crucible](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/100604635/Arcual_Ceramic_Crucible_CH_3_2_.jpg), you can see that the icon seems to be upside-down and it doesn&#039;t look like you could actually put anything into it, as it can&#039;t really balance with that little knob on top.  I&#039;d like to imagine there&#039;s a lid on top of it that could be opened, but, it really doesn&#039;t look that way as the two bands down the sides make it look like it&#039;s one solid piece.\r\n\r\nThe more I look at it, the more I see a bell rather than a crucible.  Was the name changed partway through after the icon was already finished or something?  I like the icon just fine, I just have a hard time seeing how it could possibly be any sort of crucible.","replies":[{"poster":"Lowvyr","date":"2015-07-27T01:32:29.000+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"While we're on this topic....\n\n{{item:1037}} + {{item:1036}} = {{item:3035}} \nlike wat\nA pickaxe plus a sword equals a bow.

It's called as \"crucible\" because it's designed to hold the mana generated from the forbiden idol in liquid form. And yes, if you ask, the resonation of the mana trying to escape makes the crucible make it pretty hot.  That's why you have to pay more for the combination, because you need to make your chalice heat resistant and add a lid under it to release the mana at will.\n\nOf course when the liquid mana explode and recover it plasmic form in the air, it disrupt all magic enchantment like roots, stun and slows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gaby1best","date":"2015-07-26T23:19:42.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it may be a little off-topic, but isn't 180 seconds cooldown a little TOO long?
