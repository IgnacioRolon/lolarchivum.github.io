How long does it actually take to get back to mastery 1 or 2? I've had over like 50 games since I last got temp banned and it seems to be taking forever. Am I just stuck with honor 0 for the rest of my time on League? If so, whats the point of the mastery system? Why is there no progression bar or anything?","replies":[{"poster":"87870959DEL1","date":"2017-09-07T06:36:41.024+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"We don't have a timer or visible meter to track leveling honor.\" Translation: We don't know.

Stop being a little kid and we'll think about it, maybe.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been waiting 2 months+ for mine to change in one direction.
