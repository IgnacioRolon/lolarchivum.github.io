Essentially once you have the rage buff, your on-hit procs start hitting more than once on every other attack. On-Hit effects are things like BotRK or Wit's End","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-08T16:32:44.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how to explain it without repeating exactly what you posted... It's pretty straight forward. \n\nLets say for example you have Blade of the Ruined King and Guinsoo's Rageblade. Every time you hit a basic attack, you gain a stack from the Rageblade, and you apply the Blade of the Ruined King passive on your opponent. After you basic attack someone 6 times while maintaining the buff, you'll gain the Guinsoo's Rage passive, which will apply the Blade of the Ruined King passive twice every other attack. Meaning if you hit someone 6 times, you applied your BotRK 6 times. But if you hit them 10 times, you applied your BotRK passive 12 times, which is calculated by 10 hits - 6 (prior to obtaining the rage passive) = 4, and 4 / 2 (every other hit) = 2. Other stuff that comes to mind could be Nashor's Tooth, Wit's End, Hydra, Muramana, etc. You only have the Rage passive while you have 6 stacks, so when you notice your hits getting slower, it's not active.","replies":[]}]}
