Giving her sustained damage at the cost of reducing her burst would give her wiggle room between 'useless' and '1v5 machine' because a kill doesn't reset 95% of her damage (which is also AoE).","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-08-17T23:31:08.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alternatively it just creates scenarios where Kat burst tanks or bruisers for ~50% of their HP then DPSes them down before resetting onto an ADC.
