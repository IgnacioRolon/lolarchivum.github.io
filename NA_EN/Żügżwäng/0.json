It was a little dry (mostly kai&#039;sa running around shooting at random monsters, some more substantial story would have been nice), but the ending made up for it. Great art though, and well put together overall.\r\n\r\nI then discovered the other comics that I missed during my hiatus from league. While the Poppy one was a little hamfisted/cheesy, all of the comics were very well done. Even though Varus&#039; story was botched, the team that did his comic did a phenomenal job on that one too.\r\n\r\nParticularly, I have to say I loved Ekko&#039;s comic. Props to the team that worked on that, and the rest of the comics.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-03-07T16:24:18.798+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to hear that!  Also, welcome back after your hiatus.\n\nYou said you'd discovered the other comics, but you didn't mention my favorite one, \"Blood of Noxus\" (with Darius) so I wanted to make sure you hadn't missed it.  There's an 'explore' page on Universe that has a bunch of them linked:\n\nhttps://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/explore/comics/newest/\n\n(What?  I'm allowed to have a favorite, right? :P )","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-03-07T17:24:05.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that...that... explore page is the most awesome thing i've ever seen. I've always wanted it. Thanks on whoever did it. I think the only thing that's missing is the biography updates, can there anything be done with that?","replies":[{"poster":"Żügżwäng","date":"2018-03-08T05:18:56.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, it wasn't linked with the other comics. I agree, this one also had a more mature level of depth to it.\nAlong with Darius' \"Fear\" predator (the wolves), Darius has got some serious lore love.\nDefinitely nice when a champ just isn't \"macho brute\".\n\nPerhaps Riot will expand on the lore by including some new PvE scenarios? I know making a full campaign section might be impossible, but I don't think it would distract people from the regular PvP modes after they've played it out.\nSimilar to Star Guardian, maybe have \"Noxus invades Ionia\". Have players choose from different Ionian soldiers, and have them on some defense scenario. Or maybe have players choose from Noxians, and be the attackers. Perhaps this could be some sort of asymmetrical PvP. Off topic, but just didn't want to leave a \"yes, Darius comic was great\" :)","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-03-08T08:22:13.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didn't say that :))) i was just talking about the webpage,i didn't know there was something that showed you every stuff made on the universe so i don't need to go on every champion / faction to find a story\n\nif you want, say that to the rioter, he/she'll be happy xD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2018-03-08T21:46:14.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Varus is interesting though.","replies":[]}]}
