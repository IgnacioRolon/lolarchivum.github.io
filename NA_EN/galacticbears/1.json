Now in no way, shape, or form do I think that League should be played absolutely one way or within \"the meta\". That being said having seen more fails than successes with these odd lane choices/setups I have to wonder  why (specifically in ranked) people  continuously insist on trying something outside of the  meta. Especially when it's not in the best interest of the team.\n\nAgain  I get playing  different champs  in different  lanes/roles. I'm all for experiments  and  finding  new ways to play  the game and have fun. However when the data (your win/loss, kda, farm, ect.) shows that your experiment has a low success rate I think it's time  you hang it up,  at least in ranked . You're really  only doing it for yourself if you continue to do so, and unfortunately for you this is a  team game. You have  to think about other people when making the choice  to play with said experiment.\n\nI think that's it   just  wanted  to let that go. What are some of your  worst experiences with someone trying to \"break the  meta\"?  What are  some lane selections you made not in the meta  that worked?  Some  that  seemed like they could work, but failed? Some that seemed unlikely  that worked? What champ do  you  think will be moved soon due to a \"new meta\"?","replies":[]}
