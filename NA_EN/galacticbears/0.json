Once hit diamond on an alt account, but I was admittedly the WORST kind of league player (toxic, only played my champ in my lane, dodged, ect.) I hated it and left for awhile afterwards. Since then I've come back because I just love the competition. I'm addicted to it. \r\n\r\nSo what about you? When did you start and what keeps you playing?","replies":[{"poster":"Tribbles Foxfolk","date":"2017-06-26T09:11:09.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing since about late Season 3 or early Season 4. I keep playing simply because there isn't anything else like it out there.\n\nDotA 2, as much more competitive and balanced it tends to be, is a really dry game that lacks personality. It's also a very old-feeling game, with a lot of the mechanics feeling like its DotA 1 ancestor. It's a lot slower and games drag out a bit too long for my patience.\n\nHeroes of the Storm is a fun, but overall too casual for me to take seriously or invest too much time in. Fun as it is, I see it more as something like popcorn chicken to League's chicken breast: the same thing as its core level, but used in different ways. HotS is small and snacky; fun to eat while you have it, but not really memorable enough to stick with you. League is larger and more akin to a full meal; potentially the tastiest thing you've ever eaten or perhaps it's not even fit for pig slop, but you'll still probably remember it regardless.\n\nSMITE is...I dunno, it exists, but no force on Earth is going to make me take 5v5 SMITE seriously. 3v3 Joust is where it's at there.\n\nLeague stands head-and-shoulders above other MOBAs for being so laden with personality and character.

Learning the game was not really fun but stuck with it because i loved the characters in all their glory.  Also playing with a friend really helped( the person who introduced me to LoL).  After jumping from champ to champ trying to find the right one for me i found Malzahar, who i proceeded love very dearly.  I played him in the majority of my game, with a few others here and there that were fun in some ways but never as good as Malz.  I played a lot during this time.  Then came the horrible scourge on LoL, the much dreaded but hoped would be good, MYMU.  I went into that hopeful that they would keep the fun parts, and if they had to prune something they would remove his ult and put something new in.  I could stand that.  What I got instead was a gutted mess with so much focus on his minions ( F.W.I. I didnt play him for some minionmance appeal but for his E and his W and Q in lesser extent.  Wont go into all the details on why i liked what i liked unless asked) that his spells felt like crap to use, and his laning felt like it relied so hard on how smart or how bad your opponent was.  Were they good and killed the minions fast?  Then you felt useless.  Were they bad and left them alive, then \"they\" did so much damage that it was ridiculous.   \n\n               When these dark times were here, i left LoL for the most part, just coming back for a odd game here or there to see if i could find another champ i could love as much as I loved Malz.  I never had any luck with this.  Then, one day when checking the patch notes to see if they had done anything interesting, i saw some potential light!  Malz, the spell caster part of him received some  love.  I was hopeful, but once burned you do not forget it, so i checked it out with a hope of better things.  All can say is with the experience, Malz feels back to me, not as much of a minionmancer( though its still there, just not as prevalent.) but as a spell slinging mage, slowly destroying minds, not with elemental damage, but with visions so horrible that their minds can not handle it!  I have been happily playing malz again!  Though i like other champs, as long as malz is the fun exciting champ he is, i will be around.","replies":[{"poster":"GalacticBears","date":"2017-06-26T11:27:55.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malz main here too!

It was my first MOBA ever - My friend told me about it back when i was a sophomore in high school while in marching band, so I tried it out on my mac at the time and was hooked. It was nothing like I've ever played before in terms of gameplay. ( I did upgrade to PC btw)\n2. The champions I play are fun - I've dabbled in other MOBA's here and there like HotS, Dota 2, and more recently Paragon, but none of the characters there are quite satisfying to play as they are in League. I prefer playing Darius and getting the sweet proc of my 5 stack passive or ult than playing Dota's Axe and wait for my E to go off and wait for the kill shot of my ult. There's just something about these champs that stick with me that the other games can't seem to get a hold of.\n3. I think I've just been programmed to - I've been playing League for almost or now 3 years. Most of my other friends have quit playing outside of yearly Esports event and I just end up playing by myself, simply because I've played the game for so long I don't exactly know how to quit it and I don't have many other games to go off of. I know I just said I dabble in games like Dota and Paragon but I don't ever find them as enjoying as League and I think that's actually a problem. It also doesn't help that I don't have a TV set up for my Xbox so I can't hop on that and play some Halo or Shadow's of Mordor. I've just been playing League for so long that I don't know how to quit it pretty much.\n4. FInally, it's mostly for the lore - While I have fun playing certain champs I don't have fun playing against certain champs or even playing the game now since it's so snowbally and how toxic or trollish players can be. But with the lore of League it's got me hooked. I love the backgrounds of some of these champs. I love the short stories Riot comes out with. I love the world they set up. This is mostly why I stick around.

We've been playing ever since then, League was the best game we ever played. We had so much fun playing the game. Even though we had chat restriction most of the time because we're too toxic, we had fun. I don't play league any more because everyone I know quit the game or just move on with life. I met so many cool people on here, every day after school ended I would rush home t login and play with people I met. When ever I see my friends list it makes me so sad to see everyone I know just go offline one day and not say a word about it. It's like they just vanished tbh. I don't see any point in playing league any more if everyone I know moved on or just quit playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeSin Carefully","date":"2017-06-26T15:33:42.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have Played for like 5 years , i quit this year because league sucks. everyone is toxic and even my behaviour changed irl because i had been infected with toxicity. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n10/10 would ruin my behaviour again","replies":[{"poster":"GalacticBears","date":"2017-06-26T15:47:20.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeeSin Carefully,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=RsTmMw4v,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2017-06-26T15:33:42.419+0000)\n>\n> I have Played for like 5 years , i quit this year because league sucks. everyone is toxic and even my behaviour changed irl because i had been infected with toxicity. \n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n> 10/10 would ruin my behaviour again\n\nSAME! That one good season I had I became the worst kind of person and it rippled into my real life too.
