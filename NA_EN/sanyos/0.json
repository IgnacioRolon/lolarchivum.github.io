When ever I finish a match it takes forever to load the end game lobby and it's getting pretty annoying.

When that is turned on, the client closes during a game so then it needs to restart from scratch when the match ends. Try turning that off and see if you can get into the after match lobby quicker!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revontheus","date":"2017-05-22T14:43:37.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to me too, FeelsBadMan","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sensual NyoTengu","date":"2017-05-22T06:21:04.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have that issue too. takes 2 to 3 mins for it to be done.
