But the Jinx said she was getting boosted and gave us a link incase any of us wanted to be boosted. The person was 346 wins, and 1 lost. And last season was low silver and is now on a non-stop winning streak. So myy question is do I need to tell Riot and is this legal in game? Or do I have to deal with more boosted people in my promots?","replies":[]}
