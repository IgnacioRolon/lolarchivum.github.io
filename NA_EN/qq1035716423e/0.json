Please check the IP&#039;s / any physical evidence / any evidence at all and you will find 100% that I am no booster/account sharer/ anything, please forgive me for naming myself after those guys I didn&#039;t know it was a really severe offense, please I haven&#039;t done anything wrong besides naming myself after them I would&#039;ve never done so if i knew it was permabannable.","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-06-11T03:20:21.867+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want a guaranteed response from Riot, you'll want to submit a ticket to Player Support.
