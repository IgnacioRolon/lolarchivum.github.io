He should at least look bigger, somehow he looks less intimidating than he should be with this skin.\r\n2) After immobile mage rework, His blood orb is glowing white light from the center... is this intended? because it seems off.\r\n\r\nI would consider this half bug and half feedback so I will post it both in feedback and bug section as well.\r\nWhichever is less related should be deleted but overall I want to attract Rioter&#039;s attention for this matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Calvin Bun","date":"2016-05-09T16:28:32.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I think the most important thing is to remove the little hop as Blood Lord Vlad casts E\nsuch hop makes Blood Lord Vlad like playing in the Wonderland...","replies":[{"poster":"TwinDenis","date":"2016-05-09T17:04:41.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Calvin Bun,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=W3jtBnAO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-09T16:28:32.441+0000)\n>\n> LOL I think the most important thing is to remove the little hop as Blood Lord Vlad casts E\n> such hop makes Blood Lord Vlad like playing in the Wonderland...\n\nYou have to see it the other way around, he is a wizard so he needs to be fancy when casting spells.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-10T19:01:39.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThe white glow was always there, just more noticeable with the (E).

As for resizing, it&#x27;s not something we&#x27;d like to do at this time, as sizing of champions do have gameplay implications - mages are smaller than tanks, for example.\n\nI was specifically referring to bloodlord vladimir skin since it is the only one that makes it feel like playing a yordle, not really saying that he should be like chogath or anything, just that he looks smaller than vayne and that is somewhat concerning.\nI mean classic vladimir looks larger than the skin, in which skin he looks beefier in the splash art.\nOverall singed is a mage/tank kind of character too and the playstyle of both champions served better at top lane as well, although with the recent rework I he is better for mid (everyone picks top assassin type of champions that outscale him in fast served damage), so overall he seems smaller than singed and vayne.\nWell anyway we saw some good re-sizes for multiple champions the last 2 years as well as texture reworks that prove it can be added to the list in the future. There are solutions for the resize to not affect gameplay, you have done that to Cassiopeia right? Generally resize requires some polishing but overall it would not be any big of the deal, I would say that now when vladimir uses his Q, it seems like he got huge range to cast it when in fact that is not the case. Clarity is also important imho though so I hope when the time comes, it doesnt impact gameplay.\n\nAs for the glow, it just occurred to be  odd for it to exist inside a blood-blob.\n\n{{champion:8}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-05-10T20:26:40.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you mean mages are smaller than tanks? :P","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-10T20:42:35.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FFFF.
