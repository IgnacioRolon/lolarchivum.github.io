And after the match ended wanted everyone to report me for flaming, I defended myself and said what I told you. THEN they told me that I am silver 5 and don&#039;t know anything. so who was really flaming here? This was a first to happen to me so it really took me aback to be targeted as a flamer only to be flamed afterwards..","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-16T08:06:04.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flaming is against the rules whether you are being flamed or retaliating with flame.\n\nThe best option is to mute them and report them at the end of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperSaturn","date":"2018-05-16T15:35:38.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just told some kid to seek help irl after he died once and told me to go kill myself over and over.

You literally cannot say a single thing back to a player who has the power to report you. You either have to take the abuse and mute, or reply back and risk being the one punished.
