I ordered the large Women's style, and I have to say, this says LARGE but it's a damned small. It's so tight and the arms are so constricting and it keeps rolling up. Like, this is why women have such horrible self-confidence. Like, I am not a tiny woman, but I'm not obese. You name things as large, but it's 2-3 sizes smaller than an actual large. This is upsetting because I am not a huge person, but if you force me to order, in your sizes, a 2x just for the shirt to fit me properly, that just absolutely shits on my self-confidence and many others. \r\n\r\nSo this is a formal complaint: Fix your damned sizes. They are ridiculous. A large should be a large, not a small with an L on the tag.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T00:00:25.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes that's no good! It doesn't make much sense to have a shirt that seems to have been sized incorrectly.
