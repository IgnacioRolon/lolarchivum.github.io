This will likely be a lengthy post. You have been warned, enter at your own peril.\n\n\nTo start, I&#039;d like to thank the likes of RiotScruffy, Meddler, RiotChun, Statikk, CertainlyT, RiotRepertoir, and any other rioters associated with work on Morde or in working with community feedback, for being involved in helping to make Morde the champion we all know he can be. This post took me several hours of searching and compiling information, as well as writing and organizing, and I would appreciate it if any rioters give it a look and perhaps answer some questions.\n\nFirst, I&#039;d like to state that, as a Mordekaiser main, I am willing to make some sacrifices to ensure that Morde can exist in a healthy and supportable state in the game, even if it means making some painful compromises.\n\nI also understand that, above all else, Riot&#039;s goals must be worked on and met in order to provide an enjoyable and sustainable game. In essence, what I currently see as Riot&#039;s primary goal for league is to increase replay value to create a more sustainable game. The ways I see Riot currently attempting to reach this goal are through: increasing champion diversity in terms of viability, making each game of League feel different from the last due to the differences between champions and variable strategies in the game, and finally an attempt to alter the meta (introducing melee bot lane carries, like morde and yasuo, or having mages being potential bot lane carries, like azir, etc.). \n\nThe major points I would like to cover/comment on in this post are as follows:\n\n**Identity**\na. Who is Morde? \n\nb. Visuals.\n\nc. What makes playing against/with Morde unique relative to other juggernauts and champions? How should Morde itemize? How the game feels different due to Morde being in game.\n\nd. What lanes is he supposed to be in? If Morde is to fulfill the &lsquo;adc&rsquo; role, how is he to push towers/siege? How to make him healthy when interacting with ranged champions without him becoming oppressive for melees.\n\n**Gameplay Patterns**\na. Hard to balance, but is he impossible to balance? Counter-play and the feast or famine nature. Does he need a Sion level rework?\n\nb. Strengths and weakness profile. Is this healthy to have in the game and if so, what can be done to make it healthy and rewarding?\n\nc. Buggy Ultimate.\n\nd. Reliance on team/agency. \n\ne. Fall back patterns. Providing usefulness when behind as well as safe patterns to follow when losing. Who should Morde prioritize when ahead/behind?\n\nf. Emphasizing Skillful Play &ndash; What players can do to show the difference between good and great play of morde.\n\ng. My Suggestions\n\n\n**Identity**\n\nAs a player I see Morde as fulfilling the dark lord archetype, similar to Sauron from Lord of the RIngs, the Lich King from World of Warcraft, etc. He is the heavily armored emperor of death. He is very much supposed to be a powerful entity and commander of vast armies to supplement his reach upon the world. In this way, I can understand that the duo lane can fulfill this concept and am not against it. With that being said, I like many of you, wish for morde to be able to be played in solo lanes and even in the jungle. Reviewing many of you Rioters&#039; posts regarding who morde is, I can see that there is a general agreement as to morde being this powerful juggernaut. I for one, am all for making morde a juggernaut as opposed to his old squishy unthematic self. As far as what abilities I would say are core to Morde&#039;s identify, it is clearly his passive and his ultimate, as any other morde player would attest. The &#039;magneto&#039; aspect of morde is actually not necessarily core to his identity but does make some sense.\n\nConcerning Morde&#039;s visuals, I understand that the resources necessary for a visual update are currently being allocated elsewhere, however, I would still like to state that, whenever the team looks to altering morde&#039;s visuals, they keep his core concept of heavy armor, dark color palate, and undead vibe.\n\nNow, when considering what makes Morde unique relative to other juggernauts and other champions as a whole, is Riot set on morde being a bot laner primarily with heavy emphasis on dragon control? As a player, I&#039;m actually fine with this. It helps put Morde in a unique space that definetly contributes to making the game unique for Morde being in it. My concerns with this come with how well morde can be supported in a duo lane without making solo lane too oppressive for melee matchups. I believe Riot has similar concerns and are being very careful regarding the changes they make to morde. As a side note to this section, does Riot want Morde to itemize like other juggernauts, essentially a build like: Ninja Tabi, Randuin&#039;s Omen, Deadman&#039;s Plate, Spirit Visage, Trinity Force, Sterak&#039;s Gage; or would you prefer morde to have a more hybridized build featruing Rylai&#039;s and Liandry&#039;s or Gunblade?\n\nWhen it comes to how Riot is supporting Morde as a bot lane carry, I understand you had to address how Morde is to properly siege/kill towers to effectively fill the adc role. In this regard, I see that the dragon does in fact help remedy these issues somewhat. However, this power is highly situational and leaves a morde who&#039;s team cannot acquire dragons, without sufficient ability to push down towers when being directly contested. I understand this may be an intended weakness, however I feel that if morde does not have a reliable way to push down towers, he may not see very much play in the bot lane due to a reliance on snowball to grab either dragons or champion ghosts via kills to push down towers. Essentially it seems morde doesn&#039;t have a fall back pattern in terms of tower taking when behind. This leads me to the other major point concerning gameplaly patterns.\n\n**Gameplay Patterns**\n\nIt seems evident that Mordekaiser is a difficult to balance champion, with a heavy reliance on snowballing, team input, and exhibits a very acute strengths and weaknesses profile. I even read that it was suggested that Morde may eventually require a Sion level rework. While you guys at Riot did a phenomenal job reworking Sion I would prefer that Morde reach a healthy game state without requiring a full rework due to the sheer amount of time I would have to wait to play my favorite champion, when I believe he isn&#039;t too far off from a balance-able state.\n\nWhen it comes to Morde&#039;s strength and weakness profile, does Riot still stand by trying to make an immobile melee champion with no cc work? Do any of you feel this is a task that can actually be accomplished or is it simply bad game design to allow such a champion to exist? I personally like that morde has stark contrasts in his mechanical design, with clear cases of being strong and clear cases of weakness. I am willing to accept changes should Riot deem them necessary, however I would like to have morde have similar strengths and weaknesses. As a side note, I believe it was RiotChun who acknowledged that there was issues with pet AI and that work is being done to remedy the issues. How far along is this work if you don&#039;t mind my asking?\n\nBack to more design based gameplay discussion. I read somewhere that it is intended that morde, being a juggernaut and being a duo lane carry, has some level of reliance on his team to play at the most optimal level. I also read that there is a degree of agency that morde must have to affect the game independently of ally input. When it comes to morde&#039;s performance in regards to reliance on team and agency, does Riot feel morde currently has a sufficient need for team input while still retaining enough agency to be satisfactory for players to play morde?\n\nEarlier, I started on about fallback patterns. It seems that the general consensus by Riot is that morde lacks reliable fallback patterns both when playing behind in lane and when providing for his team when behind. Is this the case or am i mistaken? \n\nWhen it comes to emphasizing skillful play, does Riot feel that morde players have enough tools available, as well as healthy enough gameplay patterns, to establish a difference between good and great morde players?\n\nFinally I would like to discuss counterplay, morde&#039;s feast or famine nature, and some potential suggestions. At the core of the issues regarding healthy levels of counterplay with morde is his passive, which, by in large, can make it seem almost impossible for plalyers to play around, especially when morde is ahead. With the current state of his passive, granting shield based upon the amount of damage being dealt, it makes morde very feast or famine in nature. When morde is ahead, he can&#039;t really be interacted with, as he can just kill you while taking minimum to no damage. When morde is behind, he finds it incredibly difficult to contribute to his team as anything more than a brief distraction, as he cannot do enough damage to generate enough shield to survive long enough to be of use. I understand that some of the community was against RiotChun&#039;s idea on morde&#039;s passive in 5.4. I, on the other hand, actually think RiotChun&#039;s approach to the passive may be the only possible way for morde&#039;s passive to exist in a space where it can be used fairly both when ahead and when behind. I urge you to look more into this option as I feel it can greatly assist with morde&#039;s gameplay health issues. Also, if Riot deems that Morde cannot exist in a healthy state without having some degree of cc, I feel that the &#039;e&#039; ability is the most likely candidate for cc, with appropriate cooldown timers of course. Morde doesn&#039;t need to be more powerful the more pain he inflicts, merely more powerful because he is inflicting pain. This is the way I view how the passive change would affect his identity as a champion.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to what Riot decides to do to create a healthier morde, that can be reasonably supported without detracting from the overall health of the game.\n\n\n\n**TLDR:** Morde has issues with gameplay health. Issues with counterplay, fall back patterns, lane diversity, ultimate AI issues, and a feast or famine nature that puts heavy reliance on snowballing. Overall, some compromises may be required to be made in order to get morde into a healthy and supportable state.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-01-11T20:13:00.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to discuss Morde with you if you dont mind entertaining some of my half baked thoughts.  \n\nI agree with many of your thoughts so far, the character feels lackluster due in no small part to theme and a lack of focus.  The thought of Morde being a Juggernaut fits very well but his kit lacks the reliable foundation of what the Juggernaut should be built around.  His passive makes this point very clear as it seems to be the main balancing point.  I'm afraid i dont know the passive change you refer to from RiotChun but I'd personally like to suggest swapping it out for Xereth's old passive(gives armor based on ability power) or at least some variation of that and move the temporary HP bubble that Iron Man is now a\nonto his E.\n\nSomething I'd like to mention real quick is the idea about being an immobile character.  I very much agree this is what he should feel like and the nerf to his movespeed was a good attempt to give Morde that feel but lacks the correct application to feel meaningful.  What i mean by this is that rather than a flat nerf this mechanic should have replaced Mordekaiser's HP costs on his spells.  Thematically Morde is a spirit that manipulates the armor around him so would it not make sense for him to slow down to lash out at the living outside the reach of said armor as he splits his focus between manipulating the armor and crushing the weak?\n\nLastly, his Q should be his main damage ability but i feel how its implimented is alittle wonky.  If pressed to suggest a fix I'd like to see the three hit mechanic altered to a stacking debuf style that can only be applied to one enemy champion at a time with each consecutive attack on the first target hit.  This would force Morde to focus his assault and could perhaps give him a buff like Darius in that if he kills his initial target he can then pass those stacks to another champion to continue his rampage.","replies":[{"poster":"Praise the Son","date":"2016-01-12T01:43:52.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Selegun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A4Hvjleg,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-11T20:13:00.949+0000)\n>\n> I'd like to discuss Morde with you if you dont mind entertaining some of my half baked thoughts.  \n> \n> I agree with many of your thoughts so far, the character feels lackluster due in no small part to theme and a lack of focus.

I would like to avoid a full rework if possible, whereas it seems that you would prefer larger overall changes to his kit. I certainly can see where you are coming from, in that Morde's passive is certainly a point of contention in regards to his mechanical balance and an approach similar to yours may need to be made. I would prefer things don't come to that, but in the end, as long as morde exists in the game in a healthy state, I will likely continue to play him.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-01-16T02:44:33.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I remember this post!  Wow, must have misread it the first time as I mistook what was here for how it worked now.\n\nI agree that anything radical might not be good for Morde right now so it might just have to boil down to those that still play him to work around the constraints we are given.  That being said I'm finding a few items I would have never thought of buying on Morde starting to look super appealing, Death's Dance being the most notable pick from what I've theorized and had the opportunity to test.\n\nWould I be able to bounce a few ideas off of you so I could get some second opinions on some of my test thus far?","replies":[{"poster":"Praise the Son","date":"2016-01-16T21:42:01.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, Id be more than happy to help. As for itemization for morde, I've been testing a variety of builds including: The old magic pen bruiser build before the rework, a build suggested in a reddit post by a master-challenger level mordekaiser player, and mega tank builds.\n\nStandard Magic Pen Build Ex. Sorcs, Abyssal, Sunfire, Deadmans, Rylais, Liandrys\nHigh level players Build Ex. Tabi, Steraks, Deadmans, Guardian Angel, Rylais, Trinity Force\nStandard Tank Build Ex. Tabi, Thornmail, Spirit Visage, Deadmans, Randuins, Rylais\n\nNeedless to say I've been doing a lot of experimentation. As for masteries, I happen to prefer using Deathfire Touch to Thunderlord's or Grasp of the Undying. \n\nRight now I'm testing out different skill orders now that his w can be cast on minions again.\n\nAs for the Death's Dance, in theory the item offers solid ad, cdr and the bleed passive (all synergetic stats and passives with morde's kit) however I feel a lot of the gold invested in the item is wasted on physical vamp which is largely useless on morde. I would compare this item to the effectiveness of Hextech Gunblade and determine through play testing if the item is worth purchasing in contrast to other available options. It's certainly an interesting Idea I will entertain. I've also had interesting thoughts regarding how well morde could use titanic hydra.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-01-19T02:24:36.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tried Deaths Dance a few times so I wanted to let you know my findings thus far.  The item is good, until you have to fight anything with very rapid damage like jinx or teemo.  Long story short I wont be using it again lol.\n\nI've dabbled with minor variations of the first two builds there with mixed results and impressions.  How has the tank build felt for you?  It looks promising though I might change a few items in it to give him.  \n\nSo I'm driven to conclude that Morde favors 3 stats above the rest in roughly this order.\n\nCDR, HP and Magic Pen\n\nFrom this point on we will dive into the deep end of my crazy pool.  I'm 100% sure Rylais is a poor pick on Morde.  Not as bad as Deaths dance at this point but still a sub optimal pick.  While the HP is good on it and the AP is high it just does not give enough of his core stats to be worth picking up even with the slow.  With that out of the way this is what I'm looking to try in the next week or so.\n\nOhmwrecker, Trinity Force, Abyssal, Guardian Angel or Zz'rot(maybe both at some point), Thornmail, VoidStaff\n\nIf that build looks odd then your right.  With the tactics I like to use on Morde I often times wont buy boots because frankly movespeed doesn't feel good on him like it does on other champions.  Its a subtle feeling, but I've noticed it after skipping boots a few times.\n\nRunes and Masteries were another spot I've been fiddling with and I think I have what would work best for the build above.  12/0/18  Sorcery, Double edge, Natural Talent and Bounty Hunter from ferocity while rounding that off with Unyielding, Explorer, Insight, Legendary Guardian and finaly Strength of Ages.  I go with Strength because the build above lacks HP and because you can clear the jungle to top off your health.  Undying doesn't let you heal off of anything but champions and I often find that the healing it would give isnt enough even if its ment to be for team fights.  As for runes I've been taking AD per level Marks, HP per level Seals, CDR per level Glyphs and Gold per 10 Quints.  You could trade the quints out for more armor or something but being able to rush both levels and items compared to my opponents is a bit too good to pass up.\n\nLastly I'd like to mention the summoner spells I take.  So far the most luck I've had is taking exhaust and smite.  Smite is great for taking jungle camps when the jungler is away and having a double smite for dragon is its own advantage.  From there exhaust is effectively my replacement Rylais but better since it reduces damage which has saved me more than flash ever has on Morde.  \n\nWith all of that I should have 35 CDR so I can always cast at least something for the trinity force proc and my shield, some nice armor and mr to make said shield feel better and the pen to make sure I at least hurt things lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"Praise the Son","date":"2016-01-21T17:05:11.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly wouldn't attempt the item, mastery, and rune usage you are using. I feel like a lot of what you are doing is anti-synergistic with what mordekaiser needs. I feel the champion does sufficient damage as long as you can stay in range. Your build, while having high resistances, is extremely immobile and relatively squishy due to having a low TEH (Total Effective Health) The following link, while old, is still extremely relevant when it comes to optimizing durability. http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1528902\n\nAs far as Morde's primary stats, I would say that a mixture between durability and the ability to stick to targets are the most important. I feel that, on every champion, boots are a necessity, especially so on an immobile champion like morde. Other great options for items would include anything that can help morde stay in range to utilize his kit, like rylais, trinity force, etc. As for taking smite, I feel it is not worth taking smite on a champion outside of the jungle. Magic pen is a very useful stat for morde, as he is like 95% magic damage. I personally find the most usefulness by using 18/0/12 masteries, going for deathfire touch. Runes I am currently trying out on morde include: 9x m pen reds, 9x scaling health seals, 6x scaling cdr blues, 3x flat mr blues, 2x flat ar quints, 1x flat mr quint. I haven't fully tested out the tank build, however it is fairly close to what I had tested before: Tabi, Randuins, Visage, Deadmans, Rylais, Liandrys. As for a detailed rune guide, I would suggest viewing this chart here, as it details what runes are the most efficient options. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tGLIdn-YNRH0gk-VPq_vrAERn4VFK_dSygV2OJeGXs/edit#gid=0\n\nGood luck with your builds, trial is the best method to producing optimal build combinations.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
