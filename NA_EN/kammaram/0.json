The issue with the current progression is that the mission needs to be active for it to count.  Each mission is \"watch 3 of your team's games\" over the course of the 2 weeks that mission is active.  If you watch all 4, you get the mission granted and one of the games is flagged as watched but doesn't count towards the next mission since it's not active yet.  The trick is watching when the \"watch your team\" mission is active, and you can't watch a game you've already watched.\n\nI'm actually in the exact same boat on my passes, and we're working to make some changes to the progression so that this issue is more obvious and solvable.  Kammaram, based on what I see you should get your next on after this coming weekend.","replies":[{"poster":"Jenevere","date":"2019-07-09T21:04:28.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So for those of us who have watched all of our team's games on time, are we now unable to complete out team passes? I've been stuck at mission 3/8 with 2/3 games watched and the games this weekend didn't count towards completing the mission for some reason. I'm now worried I wont be able to complete the pass after spending money on it. Also, are you saying that we needed to wait for our mission to activate instead of just watching them when they aired? Because if that's the case, anyone who was actually keeping up with their team is now unable to finish their missions. The missions should have been sequential so that as soon as you complete one, the next one is available so this problem didn't occur. It's just really frustrating to be keeping up with my team and not able to make progress on the fan pass missions because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duggy Boy","date":"2019-07-14T17:27:26.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So each unique game counts towards the pass? That is fair enough, but with 8 missions that is a total of 24 games. The summer split has each team only play 18 games (up to mission 6 complete). So if the match still needs to be unique then any supporter of a team that does not reach play offs will be unable to complete the final two missions. If this is the case then this is extremely frustrating as it means teams that are unlikely to reach play offs will get no support, and therefore no money which they need to fund new talent (IDK how much overall money the teams are getting from the pass so I am unsure as to the impact of this exactly). I hope that I have made a mistake about how the system works so it is possible to complete all missions even if your supported team does not reach play offs (also so I get he most out of my ~Â£10, also lets go Rogue *penguin dab*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meowmo","date":"2019-07-22T19:32:40.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you write to riot support they will fix the missing progress.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reverend Black","date":"2019-07-07T21:45:00.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive had the sameproblem. stuck at 2/6 for team pass level 3 and 2/3 for team pass lvl 2","replies":[]}]}
