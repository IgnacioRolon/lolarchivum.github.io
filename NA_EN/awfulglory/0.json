people, giving up, etc. These are punishable behaviors. You got a 14-day suspension 15 days ago, and you were told that the slightest misbehavior beyond this point would result in a permaban. You couldn't go _one day_ without \"gg go next\" and \"u need a brain\" and \"i guess boosted egirl\" and \"IT IS ALREADY OVER\" and \"if u have a brian\" and good Lord it goes on and on and on. You were absolutely lucky that the system let you play more than two dozen games like this before giving you a permaban.\n\nYes, your behavior was indeed terrible. I'm not just suggesting this as a vague possibility; I'm informing you of a certain fact.
