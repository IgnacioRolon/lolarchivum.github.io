The thing is they don&#039;t take the fact that they died into account the next time they fight.  They dont farm and just keep feeding uncontrollably.  I just had a game where I was 6/1 as Graves, I got top two assists and xp lead then he proceeded to die twice solo and ended the game 0/6.  I got a double kill bot lane and then the enemy varus was somehow 6/4 the next time i went down there.  How do I make people play safely and use the lead that I give them?  I try to ward for my laners as much as possible, getting deep wards in the enemy jungle and whatnot laying pinks, but its been about 5 straight games that my team has just failed completely.","replies":[{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2017-02-07T18:24:56.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't make them all you can do is suggest they farm and stop fighting if they are behind and hope they do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-02-07T18:11:27.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it can't be helped. You should also realize though that you're helping a lot less than you think if you take every single kill every single time you gank though.","replies":[]}]}
