It crashes when i am in game at random times. It doesn't look like other software interfering with it as I tried clean boot.\r\n\r\nIt is also not driver problem as I have the latest version. I don't even get bugsplat but it just crashes. I have also done everything that Riot told me to do but nothing seems to work. My last hope is formatting windows in case it is faulty.\r\n\r\nI also think that my graphic card might be the problem but I only crash in league and  in other games. \r\n\r\nIf anyone knows what might be the problem and what can i do then please suggest something.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T18:45:50.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you notice any particular behavior when the crashes happen? Low fps, screen stutters, high latency, attempting to reconnect messages? With a bit more info, we can work through some steps to solve this.","replies":[]}]}
