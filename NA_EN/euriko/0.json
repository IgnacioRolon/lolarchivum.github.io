One high moment that would turn the tides of a fight but nowadays the same spell can be used more than once during a fight, meaning there&#039;s a lot of additional crowd control flying around in a messy teamfight.\r\n\r\nAdditionally damaging abilities and mobility have also been affected by this change, meaning that damage and mobility is higher.\r\nA lot of mages in particular itemize Morellonomicon, already providing them with 20% cdr and making them able to use their spells several times more often than in older version of League of Legends.\r\n\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nIs there a way to combat this influx of CDR that is warping the battlefield of Summoner&#039;s rift?\r\n\r\nFrankly?\r\nYes, indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd it&#039;s rather easy.\r\nIt would simply require core items to have less Cooldown reduction on them and force champions to consciously invest in this particular stat without getting it passively through their core itemization.\r\n\r\nMorellonomicon, Black cleaver, Iceborn Gauntlet and Trinity force in particular need some changes to their stats while other CDR items should have their niche of being geared towards higher spell uptime made more pronounced.\r\n___________________\r\n\r\nAs a closing remark:\r\nYes, cooldown reduction is a fun stat to have as it allows you to sling more spells at the opposition and overall get to use your champion&#039;s abilities more often without having to keep them for certain threats.\r\nBut it does lead to the game losing a lot of its strategic thinking when hard crowd control is so readily available and certain damaging abilities become too overwhelming.\r\n\r\nBut reducing the builds that lead to 40 or 45% cooldown reduction would benefit this game heavily as it would turn down the overabundance of Crowd control and damage that many people seem to have a problem with while making the experience of playing League of Legends overall more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CU37-5tfgq4/U-c98Gg5mDI/AAAAAAAACeA/ttGbKrv78wQ/s1600/keep-calm-and-cool-down-9.png","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-09-14T20:19:54.335+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually, its the champion designs and reworks as of late. \n\nMost CC is knock-ups, not even affected by tenacity. \n\nSlows are tacked onto everything. \n\nMobility is thrown on almost every new kit. \n\n________________\n\nCDR is a very small part of CC/mobility creep, considering most people aimed for 40% CDR anyway. \n\nCDR contributes to damage creep much more heavily than CC/mobility, since people can itemize more damage in lieu of CDR-specific items.\n\n__________\n\nWhile I do agree that itemization should be changed to make CDR a trade-off, as opposed to free on items, don't get the contributing factors of the current game-state mixed up.

My philosophy is a champion needs counterplay in teamfight\nold sejuani had no counterplay in teamfight\n\nI'd disagree that Sejuani had no counterplay in a teamfight, she had the same conterplay as pretty much any short ranged champion. Outside of her R everything on her kit required her to maintain melee range to be even remotely effective, so she was vulnerable to peel. She had the damage to down squishy champs, but there was no way for her to kill of tankier melees without assistance, so assuming you could keep her off your squishies her effect was fairly limited.\n\nConversely new Sej is much more effective at range, her W obviously has a far better range now and her E doesn't even require her to ever enter range assuming she has a melee ally because of this pealing and kiting her back just doesn't really work to the same extent that it used to. This is a significant and unarguable dropoff in counterplay.\n\n>new one has counterplay in 1v1\n\nI'd like to understand this argument but I don't think you actually have one. The only time when a 1v1 against Sej is ever going to be relevant (baring niche toplane builds) is when it's an early game invade. Since Sej doesn't lane she interacts less with the enemy team in a 1v1 sense. Old Sej typically lost almost every 1v1 in the early game due to her late game scaling nature, new Sej actually performs far better in early 1v1s and is certainly better at holding off until her team can reach her.\n\nIf you get caught out in a 1v1 late game against a Sej as a non-duellist champ you've already fucked up. Sej shouldn't be able to create this situation. She could theoretically splitpush to force a 1v1 but since she's a jungler there's already inherently good strategical counterplay to this. I just don't see very many times where Sej being stronger than average in a late game 1v1 was an applicable strength, had she have been a top laner who ran TP and was less reliant on teamfights then maybe, as it stood she just couldn't abuse that strength.\n\nThis is where the argument of \"add counterplay\" falls apart completely, when you actually go and break the rework down it becomes immediately clear that no significant counterplay was added while real counterplay was removed from her kit on mass.\n\n>i don't have any preferences, my view is that sejuani needs a real rework\n\nReal reworks take time and resources, two things Riot has already squandered in regards to Sejuani. A simple revert could be accomplished in a single patch (as seen with Kog'maw). So the argument becomes, assuming Riot doesn't have the resources for a full rework or they're better spent elsewhere which one of the two is better. I'm yet to see a convincing argument for new Sejuani over old Sejuani, you cite counterplay but your argument falls flat under the slightest of scrutiny from someone with actual understanding of how both kits worked as it's very clear that Sej lost counterplay in the rework.\n\nFrom all other angles new Sej appears either equal to or worse than old Sej. She fits her thematic worse, she's less fun to play, worse to play against, more generic, doesn't offer anymore skill expression and is lower counterplay. I fail to see any reasonable argument which wouldn't land on the side of Old Sej being significantly better.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-09-15T08:19:01.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sejuani is meta atm, and in high elo i never saw anything you talked about\nsejuani splitpushing? wtf?\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=LankPants,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mwWKGjgB,comment-id=0001000200000000,timestamp=2017-09-15T08:07:17.408+0000)\n>\n>\n> she was vulnerable to peel. \n\n\ni would like to see a 5k hp tons of armor/mr tank that is a damage threat being vulnerable to peeling\nOld sejuani also had 0 mechanics that was unique to her\nNew one is the only tank immune to slow and empowers melee \n\nThe reason new one is cancerous is pretty simple: she makes melees unable to move, she's a pile of cc and a reason we get to cc creep thanks to riot\n\nOld sejuani definitly needed a rework\n\nthe rework was bad because riot's philosophy of design about the game, about tanks, about cc , is completly garbage","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-09-15T08:38:19.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">sejuani is meta atm, and in high elo i never saw anything you talked about\nsejuani splitpushing? wtf?\n\nNo shit, you didn't see it because it didn't work, if you reread my point you'd see I was using that to point out how absurd your argument of \"no counterplay 1v1\" is when Sej almost never 1v1ed.\n\n>i would like to see a 5k hp tons of armor/mr tank that is a damage threat being vulnerable to peeling\n\nYou kite, the same counterplay to someone like Nasus. It doesn't matter if someone has 1000 HP or 10000 HP, if they never reach you they eventually die having done nothing. Sej was outside of her R a melee threat, one CC and moving back 300 units meant that she was no longer able to deal any damage.\n\n>Old sejuani also had 0 mechanics that was unique to her\n\nMalz passive, Gragas E, Rengar Q, Braum passive, Lisandra R\n\nI'm sorry, new does? \n\n>New one is the only tank immune to slow and empowers melee\n\nIn practice this doesn't matter, because she functions the exact same way as Gragas, or Zac, or any other cancer tank of Riot's recent design. At least old Sej had differences in playstyle to other tanks because the combination of her abilities, even if not unique individually created a unique playstyle.\n\n>Old sejuani definitly needed a rework\n\nShe was pretty damn far down the list. She was one of the better designs amongst tanks.

She would have got like a +2% buff on her W and went back to being a pretty balanced champ.\n\n>the rework was bad because riot's philosophy of design about the game, about tanks, about cc , is completly garbage\n\nThat I will agree with, but it's not really the point.\n\nThe point, which you are trying your hardest to dodge is that in a straight choice between old and new Sej old Sej wins out easily.

Knock-ups should not ever be excluded from CC and if a team if 5 knock-ups what do you do? Just give up because the one stat meant to beat CC is worthless.\n\nThe second way I'd do it is by applying the logic from Paladins where every instance of CC adds to this stack of CC. Whenever you are hit with CC directly after one instance of it, the new CC will be less effective. Basically if you have 3 stuns that last 2 seconds each it would work like;\n\nFirst stun - 2 seconds\nSecond stun - 1.75 seconds\nThird stun - 1.5 seconds\n\nAs an example. This is to prevent heavy CC stacking at the end of the day and league has probably the most instances of hard CC in any game I've played so this is just a really good solution to being CC locked by a lone Sejunai for about 4 whole seconds.\n\nAnother solution is make CDR more niche again. CDR is way to build into everything nowadays and if a person wants to build towards a stat, there should be a trade off. CDR doesn't. Simple as that. So let's solve that and make CDR less of a glut stat and more of a niche, you need to build towards stat.\n\nOther things like dashes and mobility as well as damage are rooted in a lot of different things but I think CDR would heavily solve some of those issues while the CC fixes help out a lot of classes that are struggling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-09-15T00:22:06.295+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What would actually happen with less CDR in the game:\nBanshees Veil becomes much deadlier because it's more of a cost to break the shield.

For example if Morello's were to keep its CDR it should have its AP reduced to ~80 and a new item building from Lost Chapter could be introduced at the 120 AP range so there's actually a question of \"is it better to get 40 extra AP or 20% CDR\", just as an example.\n\nYour argument is a ridiculous strawman of the most extreme case where we just removed CDR from every single item. We're not saying Amumu should always have to rely on his base 8 second CD Q, we're saying that an Amumu who chooses to opt out of CDR should get to be significantly tankier for doing so. Amumu could still build any % of CDR he wants, but for every 10% he doesn't buy he gets an extra 150 HP or 20 armour or something the like, so it may not always be best to rush 40% CDR since he could be significantly tankier if he didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-09-15T14:59:45.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're failing to understand Riot's position here though. With the spread of CDR to multiple items, they want players to feel like they have options for their itemization. They added CDR to {{item:3001}} and{{item:3194}} specifically so that you wouldn't feel like you had to buy {{item:3065}} just for the CDR. You aren't buying these items for their stats (unless you need mana), instead you're buying the item based on the passive that you want. \n\nSo you are asking for CDR to be a significant trade off. But we've lived in that world in previous seasons, and people still went for CDR. Riot is instead devaluing CDR, making it less and less costly and willing to tack it onto anything. It's less about opting into CDR than it is that everyone's cooldowns slowly lower as the game time goes on. \n\nAnd again, people shouldn't be opting into having more burst or more tankiness anyway. Using abilities is straight up better than standing still. Tanks, mages and supports get almost nothing out of their auto attacks. They can ONLY contribute to fights with their abilities. Why would you want to be tankier than have more spam when you can't draw aggro? Being tankier can only help you if you survive long enough to cast your abilities again, in that situation you'd rather be slightly less tanky with slightly lower cooldowns. It's an idiotic request to give up CDR in order to live longer and MAYBE cast your abilities again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ðelofasht","date":"2017-09-15T14:25:44.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Damage creep = really just Crit and a few new items bypassing too much armor sometimes.
