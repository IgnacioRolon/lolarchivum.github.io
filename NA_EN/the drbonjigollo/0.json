Neeko seems to have a this kind of I-think-I-say personality and is very cheeky about it. \n> It&#x27;s also probably not very nice to turn into someone of the opposite gender, especially when you&#x27;re not attracted to it.\n> \n> It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that: a) while it is a stereotype that men are stinky and ugly, it is one that&#x27;s often used in a humorus manner. \n> B) most of league champions definitely stink and would be unattractive (even in a non-sexual way) to a teen.\n> \n> \n> EDIT: but I guess that if people find it too mean it could be removed or redirected - maybe towards one specific champion or to the ones that are deemed stinky.\n\nYea sure, it's humorous to use the male stereotype of smelly and ugly, but if anyone makes a joke about any FEMALE stereotypes it's suddenly a huge political debate. Mind you, IIRC, there is not a SINGLE CHAMPION in League who makes any sorta of comments on the female gender as Neeko does. In fact, 90% of the roster don't even have any gender-specific voicelines at all.\n\nI like Neeko and all, but some of her voicelines are really pushing it. I love that she's our first openly LGBT Champion, but some of this just makes it look slapped on. If we are actually going to keep these quotes \"Because they're in a humorous manner,\" it'd only be fair if we get something similar on the opposite side of the spectrum; jokes about women (innocent ones please, nothing that devalues or objectify women), but even that won't go very far considering how much of a controversey that'd be.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugarlicious","date":"2018-11-20T23:06:29.883+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BonzaiBuddy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bv4397yE,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2018-11-20T21:41:42.319+0000)\n>\n> Yea sure, it&#x27;s humorous to use the male stereotype of smelly and ugly, but if anyone makes a joke about any FEMALE stereotypes it&#x27;s suddenly a huge political debate.

You mean like 90% of the female rooster being feminine, slender, and all in all, attractive? Not one of the female champs has below-shoulder-length hair, and from what I can see, many of them have makeup. Why aren't there any fat girls with short hair? Why aren't there any girls who are blind, bald, disfigured, ugly, tomboyish? You see only what you want to see.\n\nAlso, her comments are actually realistic. She's a teenager who likes girls, of course she's gonna think that men are gross, ugly, and smelly. Yes, it's a stereotype, but it's a stereotype that even in reality, girls of that age are very familiar with. Hell, I have a lesbian friend who'd use exactly those words to explain why she dislikes men - they often smell of sweat, they are gross with their burping, not shaving, and whatnot, and girls are much prettier. \n\nAnd what do you mean by \"pushing it\"? You're offended? So don't play her. Are you gonna get mad if you hear that line in game, are you gonna feel insulted by a game character? Hell, I couldn't care less if there was a champion calling women weak or unworthy, as long as there was an actual explanation for it (Neeko is a lesbian, she's \"allowed to\" dislike men). Actually, I think Evelynn insults women more than any male champ could, with her being a milder version of a succubus, pretty much using her sexuality. Or Miss Fortune, who's more of a joke than an actual captain or a leader. Why do so many female champs need to have that aspect of seducing men? Even Ahri with her \"charm\". Ever thought of that? Bet not.","replies":[{"poster":"Weiss Guertena","date":"2018-11-21T01:45:37.045+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sugarlicious,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bv4397yE,comment-id=000200010001,timestamp=2018-11-20T23:06:29.883+0000)\n>\n> Any female stereotypes?

Vi and Quinn are pretty tomboyish, possibly Taliyah too. Sejuani (oh look, another short-haired woman) and Illaoi fit the strong/buff acrhetype. And more.\n\nAs for \"ugly\", Riot has been phasing out \"ugly\" from their game for quite some time. When \"hideous\" champions get reworked, they adopt a much cleaner look; while you wouldn't call, say, Urgot beautiful, what's left of his flesh is far from fat, scar-ridden monstrosity he used to be. This also shows with new champions; Pyke who's pretty much a drowned zombie is a well-built, and I dare even say attractive human male with only a glowing eye to indicate his true nature. Ugly champions simply aren't a thing anymore, male or female.\n\n>Also, her comments are actually realistic.

Teenage boys also have similar stereotypes about girls; however if those made it in-game as a huge part of champions' interactions accusations of sexism would be all over the place. No defense of \"those comments are actually realistic\", \"I have a gay friend who uses those words to explain why he dislikes women\" or \"they are in a humorous manner\" would stop raging SJWs from tearing Riot apart.\n\nAs for if anyone is \"offended\" - you don't have to be offended to not like someone's personality/attitude. League is full of charming individuals such as serial killers, racist dirtbags, self-absorbed narcissists, violent thugs, ruthless dictators, mad scientist and many more. Having a sexist character (even if it's up to debate) suddenly doesn't seem as bad - but believe me, if said sexist character happened to be male he'd automatically be branded much worse than all of the above by SJWs.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugarlicious","date":"2018-11-21T08:48:20.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Weiss Guertena,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bv4397yE,comment-id=0002000100010000,timestamp=2018-11-21T01:45:37.045+0000)\n>\n> \n> As for if anyone is &quot;offended&quot; - you don&#x27;t have to be offended to not like someone&#x27;s personality/attitude.
