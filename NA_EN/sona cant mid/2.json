Having an extra 240-600 HP for their combo forces them to commit more resources to killing you, if they can even get through it at all. \n\nThe point of marksman is that they don't need to aim their damage, so their skill expression is in their positioning. Finding that balance between being close enough to deal sustained damage but far enough away to not get blown up is what separates good marksman players from the bad ones. If marksman were simply able to itemize their weaknesses away entirely, it would negate all the skill of playing marksman and make it all boil down to who can have better stats. \n\nItems like {{item:3046}} , {{item:3156}} , and {{item:3026}} are the closest thing marksman can have to defensive items. They're not horrible options, but they won't keep you alive through everything. That's the point. \n\nMarksman are balanced around being squishy and dependent on their team. If you want to wade into the thick of things while dishing out damage, play a fighter.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-13T06:08:07.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried Bloodthirster, Death's Dance, Tabi/Merc's, or Mercurial Scimitar?","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Cant Mid","date":"2019-05-13T06:16:59.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"these things are all sustain items that people are pointing out, bloodthirster helps late game, but the lifesteal doesnt stop kha, rengar, zed, ect from just jumping on you and blowing you apart before you can even fire a single shot.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-13T06:37:07.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sona Cant Mid,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0sPXANpl,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2019-05-13T06:16:59.944+0000)\n>\n> these things are all sustain items that people are pointing out, bloodthirster helps late game, but the lifesteal doesnt stop kha, rengar, zed, ect from just jumping on you and blowing you apart before you can even fire a single shot.\n\nBloodthirster has a shield that lasts a really long time out of combat. DD mitigates some up-front damage and turns it into a DoT to give you time to react.

Most \"Tank\" Supports are absolutely trash at soaking damage if they are the only front line you have. I DID say \"Shield Supports\". There was a time when Shield Supports were strong enough to negate a LOT of assassin damage. Now, Assassins blow you up through shields anyway. \n\nWhen I mentioned Tanks, I wasn't suggesting Tank Supports. I was suggesting Tanks period. Especially Top Lane Tanks. Currently, they are useless in lane and don't survive long enough outside of lane to be viable. Especially if the enemy team has a Vayne that can kill you in 6 or less auto attacks despite having a 800+ armor and 4k+ Health Malphite. \n\nADC's don't need defensive options or you make Fighters irrelevant. In a traditional ideal scenario, the ADC's primary job is to kill the enemy tanks faster than the enemy ADC kills your tanks. Enchanter Supports do their best to keep the ADC alive, Assassins look for angles/opportunities to delete them, the Tanks will soak as much damage as possible while disengaging to try to peel for the ADC, and Control Mages will try to zone enemies way from being able to effectively deal damage. ^^^ This is more like the balance you will want. \n\nADC > Tank\nTank > Assassin\nAssassin > ADC\n\nIf we include control mages?\n\nControl Mage in a controlled siege or anti siege....\n\nControl Mage > ADC\nControl Mage > Assassin\nTank > Control Mage\n\nControl Mage when not protected by turret or team.....\n\nADC > Control Mage\nAssassin > Control Mage\nTank > Control Mage\n\n\nI had to leave out Fighters for the time being because I am not feeling well and typing is difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Cant Mid","date":"2019-05-13T06:51:15.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like i said in the OP, i dont think adc's should have a \"fuck off assassin\" item that just completely counters them, as their main job is to blow apart a squishy.

Its not a good feeling game.  Tanks have counters too, but they have room to play against them because most counters for tanks are cc.  The counter for an adc is \"hey im rengar with a 40 second cd on my ult, and you're dead now\". Control mages have cc to stop them even though they are squishy so theres an outplay potential. Tanks are tanks and arent countered by assassins.
