Clearly if consistently toxic and previously banned players are forced to make new accounts new players will be placed with these toxic players and their enthusiasm for the game will be ruined the first time they come across some gold 4's 15th account chat abusing them in blind pick. Dont believe me? go make a smurf and see just how afraid of perma bans people are. People saying this isn't a problem are lying to themselves just because they think its a better punishment to perma ban the account's ability to play than it is to perma ban their ability to chat. someone thats going to troll in high elo isnt going to be dumb enough to chat abuse they simply start trolling when they get mad, everyone knows the system","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-21T05:56:07.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want a link.....","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-12-21T07:00:39.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have to take Riots word for it.
