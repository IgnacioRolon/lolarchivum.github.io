This is why the laws are different for those categories.\n\nWhy do you keep on bringing up players accessing or modifying Riot Servers? I have said nothing to even hint at that as an action.\n\nWhat I have said is that: \na) If a player OWNED a champion using the laws for physical objects, then no one else would be allowed to use or modify it.\nb) That means that Riot would be unable to sell any champion to more than one player.\nc) Riot would also be unable to modify any of their code, because that would be owned by the player who purchased it.\nd) Because players need to have a champion to play the game, Riot would need to create a vast swarm of characters. They would need at least one character per player, but people would get really bored with only one character, so the number of characters would be huge.\ne) With this vast swarm of characters that Riot is not allowed to fix, buff, nerf, or modify in any form, there would be a lot of problems.

You'd also be the only one allowed to sell the movie to other people. And many other things that come with ownership.\n--------------------------------\nThe same laws that allow Riot to ban accounts are the ones required for them to be able to function as a game.
