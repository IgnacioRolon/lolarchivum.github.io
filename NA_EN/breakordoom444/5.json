Riot does ban for unauthorized third party program use. Unfortunately it is pretty easy for 'botters' to simply create a new account and try again. If they manage to get a few level 30 accounts without getting reported, they can sell them and make some easy cash. Riot has also caught on to some of these accounts and banned them after the transaction, meaning the person who gained the account wasted their money, but the seller still made out. \n\n2. Despite the fact that your friend is in on your false-flaming session, that can still be reported by the other players in that game, and due to the fact that Riot is not aware of your external communication, they can restrict both of you for toxic behavior. I would recommend you not continue that behavior. \n\n3. Feeding is punishable. Refusing to gank your lane is not. \n\n4. Doran's Ring is a perfectly good item, so I don't see why it makes you feel bad. If that is the case however, ... don't buy it?? There are other items you can start with.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-10-14T02:46:31.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"no what i meant was that the elise was a bot and feeding and not ganking at all also i do fake flame each other but we tell the enemy just a prank bro after.\nand with your 4 \ni am a person who trys to make funny jokes but has no humor so i got to do something to get attention XD","replies":[]}]}]}
