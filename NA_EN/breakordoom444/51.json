MvM went over three editions, international localisation, and over 70k sold units, iirc. It's Ranked 29th on Boardgamegeek, and the BGG forum is moderately active (for a game that is this light on rules). That's a great track record.\n\nRiot said that it was a One-time thing. Despite that, they still produced the Editor and had weekly riddles running for a while. \n\nI don't think \"following in the footsteps of M:TG\" is a good plan. While commercially and critically successful back in the day, if you ask a lot of people in the game industry about M:TG nowadays, they'll probably state the most important lesson learned from Magic is \"knowing when to stop\". Even Richard Garfield has moved on to design \"better\" skinner boxes: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/keyforge/\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'd love to see more analogue Games by Riot, but I'd prefer a really solid standalone game every ten years to three lame cash-graps each year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reksee","date":"2018-12-02T22:48:56.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probs no one gonna see this post cuz the last post was made four months back.
