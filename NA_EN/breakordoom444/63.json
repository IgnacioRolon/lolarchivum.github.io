I believe that the leavebuster system should be more evolved about reconnects and also review the chat log for sensitive words from leavers.","replies":[{"poster":"Arisha the Dark","date":"2018-05-02T05:52:30.248+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you mean, but I don't entirely agree. Even 5 minutes can loose you a match. In 5 minutes enemy can use you not having support/adc on bot or jungler. Also, a jungler that started 5 minutes later is so easy to counter jungle, making it very difficult to come back when playing against good opponent.\n\nAlso, if you reduce/remove punishment if player reconnected, it will open up a new way of trolling. Disconnect for 5 min, then reconnect. Your team might be screwed now and you got no punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-02T12:19:19.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd only add to this that *your* connection is *your* responsibility.
