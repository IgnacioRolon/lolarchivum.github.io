Only Valoran is more or less the size of North America. Difficult to see a bridge.\n\n**Ionia**\n> What happened to Rakan and Xayahs tribe? or just vastaya in general?\n\nTravelling like guerrilla fighters, not located right now. Vastayan tribes are dispersed through the land and we don't know any specific territory.\n\n> Why dosen't Ionia take the small island on its borders? even if its a divide and conquer sort of 'nation' it would still make sense to take islands that pose not a threat.\n\nProbably the resistance tried but i'm sure that is a difficult task. Maybe very difficult if the coming Syndra story (leaked) takes place there.\n\n> Shouldn't wuju have its own pin? wukong and Yi studied it. (read lore for info)\n\nProbably yes. And I think the Wuju at the map is a village.\n\n> Why dosen't the giant capital for Ionia have more champions? and why is swain part of it?\n\nIs not the capital, just an important sacred place where a big battle against Noxus happened. Irelia cut the Swain's arm in that battle.","replies":[{"poster":"JonnyBoyy","date":"2018-07-25T17:29:25.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Probably the resistance tried but i'm sure that is a difficult task.

I know it because I read it already before it got removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Loborcs","date":"2018-07-25T17:32:48.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I supposed that.
