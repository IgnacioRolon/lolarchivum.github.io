Even the seasonal reset won't drop you lower than 2.  You literally just have to not be inconsiderate to other players and you get free stuff.  Such an unreasonable requirement, isn't it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2018-11-07T17:41:44.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=uEeU5APw,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-07T02:47:40.467+0000)\n>\n> **Q: why do people have level 0/1 honor?**\n> \n> A: with the new introduction of the honor system, Riot announced that any player that receives any degree of ban (10 game chat ban, 20 game chat ban, 14 day ban, P E R M A ban) will have their honor reduced to 0.\n\nNot quite.  A chat restriction only knocks you down to Honor 1 if you are at 2 or higher.  This is explicitly stated both in the first article you linked and in the more in-depth FAQ here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148\n\n> A chat restriction knocks your Honor level to 1, or 0 if you're already level 1.","replies":[]}]}
