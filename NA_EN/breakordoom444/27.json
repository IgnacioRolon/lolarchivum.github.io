You need to Live life. Make a goal in real life. Find out what is missing. Maybe it is love, maybe it is financial freedom. Maybe it is boredom or lack of nutrition and exercise. Life, just like any game, is trial and error. You will not find the answers anywhere. This answer I am giving you will be re-worded by someone else but the message is the same. Find meaning in your own life. Be sure it is YOUR meaning, not someone else's influence. Anyway, good luck.
