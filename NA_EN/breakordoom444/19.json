Some of them do it for one game out of spite, big deal. Just punish’em.\r\nThere are people who make hundreds of accounts just to ruin people’s lives.\r\n\r\n**Point 2** \r\n\r\nBan baiters are a thing.\r\nIt is the person which gets baited that is at fault, but if someone is maliciously abusing the game to get people banned, I don’t think they exactly should be playing.\r\n\r\n**point 3**\r\n\r\nToo much bad behaviour.\r\nAnyone has a chance to reform, even my man Tyler did.\r\nIf someone is not trolling, but rather has a high ban streak (10+) i think at that point, they needn’t be part of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nAm I too harsh? Too lenient/strict?\r\nLet me know.\r\n \r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-09-26T05:50:39.716+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
