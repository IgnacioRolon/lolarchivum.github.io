Most people _do_ know the rules, their understanding of them is just very poor.

These are pretty much your average 'Player Behavior' posts, titled something like \"Unbanned fairly, proof inside\" or \"Riot's system is bullshit, I got banned for THIS?\"\n\n I've been permabanned before, I know what it's like. Most sane people are able to understand what will get you punished after a 10/25 game chat restriction. It's just some people in the community don't listen and they need to be punished accordingly. IMO it's just a matter of people being bull headed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-12-02T09:48:35.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"People like to punish other people.","replies":[]}]}
