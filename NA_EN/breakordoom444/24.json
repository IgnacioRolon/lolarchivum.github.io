I main support, and when I'm having a good game, I'm often the most influential player on the team. It's not unusual for me to have 70%-90% kill participation before 15 minutes. I think the reason most ppl don't like to play support is because most ppl just really want to kill stuff, and that's not what supports do. That, or they misunderstand how important it is to have a good support on your team.","replies":[]}]}
