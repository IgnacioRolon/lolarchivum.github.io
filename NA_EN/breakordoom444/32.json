(look at that area wheres stonewall is)\n- Shouldn&#039;t riven be a Ionian champion? since she thats what she considers herself.\n- Why hasn&#039;t Noxus attacked Zuan and Piltover? sure they have technology, but the history has taught us that brute force will always beat technology, Noxus and their use of magic should be able to annihilate a small trading city.\n\n**Piltover/Zaun**\n- I get it, its a city. but what happened to its geography? can we have a city map maybe?

It's an hermit kingdom. In the [Medarda's map](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/piltover/medarda-heirloom) they say it. No \"official\" trade permitted. \n\n* Why dosen't demacia take a little more land? i mean the land eastern to them is surrounded by ocean and mountains, and the silent forest is there as well.\n\nIt's a lot of land more to protect if they reach till Nockmirch. Anyway they go to fight out there from time to time. In \"[For Demacia](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/for-demacia/)\" story we found that there was a battle in the Gates of Mourning between the Dauntless Vanguard and the Trifarian Legion. \n\n\n> NOXUS\n\n* I understand swains decision to stop the conquering of the lands, but why not TAKE LAND THAT IS SURROUNDED BY THEIRS? (look at that area wheres stonewall is)\n\nProbably not that easy. And probably it's one of the next objectives before Pilltover's war. \n\n- Why hasn't Noxus attacked Zuan and Piltover? sure they have technology, but the history has taught us that brute force will always beat technology, Noxus and their use of magic should be able to annihilate a small trading city.\n\nRead \"[Progress Day](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/piltover-progress-day/)\" story. They're preparing the ground. \n\n> Piltover/Zaun\n\n* I get it, its a city. but what happened to its geography? can we have a city map maybe? (from a top down view)\n\nLook at the images that come with the map. It gives you a good idea. \n\n> Shurima\n\n* Where is rek'sais current home? did she just swim back to icathia?\n\nIn the Sai Kaleek north of Icathia and southeast of Ancient Shurima.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-07-24T16:48:53.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> * Where is rek&#x27;sais current home? did she just swim back to icathia?\n> \n> In the Sai Kaleek north of Icathia and southeast of Ancient Shurima.\n\nThe above Questions are my foolishness for not reading the stories, but:\nI'm asking why dosen't sai'kaleek have its own pin? ashe gets her own, why dosen't a void creature that can eat 2 fucking animals in less then a second?","replies":[{"poster":"Loborcs","date":"2018-07-24T16:51:24.904+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In twitter they're saying that the map will expand a lot in time.

They were warring against each other the entire time they conquered Africa.

Also Africans didn't have magic and that's a huge advantage for Noxus considering Icathian mages were able to create shields powerfull enough to block magic projectiles that were wiping out entire batalions in seconds, and Noxus mages are more focused on combat and receive more military training than the Icathian ones did (Shuriman mages and Ionian ones may still be more powerfull than Noxian ones tho considering how much magic exists in both these places and knowledge about it too)","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-07-24T16:51:10.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, armor and weapons are technology which the Africans did not have.

Honestly, it doesn't make sense anyway, so if the writers want to say that Piltover's tech is great enough to combat Noxian magic, then honestly I'm far more interested in why Piltover hasn't expanded themselves.

Why is magic in Runeterra not making sense...? \n3. Darius's legion wasn't prepared for that, it was a surprise,  now that they are attacking they know what to expect. \n4.
