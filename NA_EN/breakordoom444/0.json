Petricite after all needs magic to trigger its anti magic property. Galio cant move with out magic near him via lore.  So I figured if Garen Is able to at will make his sword and armor function with anti magic, much less Summon Giant freaking swords out of thin air, he might be magically inclined.\n\nWell more lore is out and its clear that Petricite stores magic. Looks like it eats manna, It does not destroy it.  So i'm still entertaining the notion that Garen might have magic in his blood. Or failing that,  he innately learned how to release the MP his armor and sword has stored. \n\nAnyhow Sylas has the innate ability as a mage is to copy cat magic he comes in contact with. So he uses the chains to eat spells, then he mimics it by contacting the stored Magic in the chains.\n\n> When he tried to shield the child from the mageseekers, he accidentally brushed against her skin. The girl’s magic rushed through Sylas’s body—but rather than killing him, it shot forth from his hands in raw, uncontrolled bursts","replies":[]}]}
