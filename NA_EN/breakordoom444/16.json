And everyone wants to be in the spotlight. They want to make the big kill plays and stuff. Most people dont want to sit back and heal (lets face it though damage is so high that healing is laughable rn) or protect or take damage. Because there isn't much glory in it. Lets also add in the fact that you have to have follow up for things to work out, if they dont you dont get a kill you blew a bunch of mana for nothing and you have probably a huge chunk of health or you are dead. Hopefully someone else sees what happened or else its your fault. Or lets say you take the kill. Then people will bitch that you are taking their kills (I don't see this happen to much but when it does its a real drag). \nIn other words you are supposed to do everything but at the same time take the fault when nothing happens or things go bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dat Kat","date":"2018-11-11T17:37:57.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone should speak for himself, don't speak on behalf of the community.\nWE dont appreciate.\nWE hate.\nWE don't like\nWE nana, stop it.
