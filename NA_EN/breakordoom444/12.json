That NO ONE takes seriously. Watch streams of it as apparently you dont have it if it was sej wouldn't have been released like this. Same with Zac.

Keep the pbe for \"ideas\" and things that players are concerned about. However riot need a designated balance team that balances things towards EVERY champion in League. That would be their job, to playtest with ALL the champions all day with that specific champion. Obviously counters are a thing to have. But they need to test how poor the champion is (EX: Zac 7.9 totally garbage in all ways.) and not COMPLETELY broken.

And rank doesn't mean shit buddy :) you're ego definitely shows a toxic little kid that their parents kept telling them no when they went to the store and you saw some nice toys or candy you wanted.

To try every team comp once would take thousands of testers once and since balance is fluid and a made up concept and not a true state its impossible to truly find.

I don't see a release anywhere. \n\nAll I said was they don't balance anything. Which they don't they rely on players to do that so they don't have to pay money to more workers to do it for them. Hense the PBE and why it's there. Yet the PBE players seem to no say anything. \n\nOtherwise 7.9 tank rework would have been postponed due to hatred of Zac. (or he just would be), Sej being BROKEN overpowered, and Maokai being garbage now and not doing damage unless you buy full ap and get 1 shot. \n\nI could say a lot more champions.
