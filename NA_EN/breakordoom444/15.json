I think most people here simply couldn't understand anything he was saying since the vast majority of the people who post here are teenagers, hotshot college kids or people who think Riot is the best company on earth.\n\nWhen someone downvotes a lawyer who knows far more about real life and the court system than 90% of the people on this forum (how many people here are licensed lawyers or law students?), then you KNOW there is a problem.  And the problem is in the community (or rather, humanity in general).  I read through his post several times, and as an older adult, I realized that he was 100% on target.  And being right doesn't make people popular, especially if public opinion is different.\n\nif he posted his same post on reddit in an active civil/legal group with a critique topic regarding game companies/Riot (Tencent), it would probably have had 1000+ upvotes...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-08-29T22:12:56.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sub-board is not for appeals.\n\nCheck out the sticky of what we can do.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/eHGdgA3h-punished-heres-how-this-board-can-or-cant-help","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheKingOfBiches","date":"2018-08-29T21:31:39.013+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Your right lmao.\n\nits been this way in this board section. *anyone* that post about getting punished,or disagrees with the hive mind that toxicity is bad,they get downvoted to hell.\n\nThe thing is that's *not* what downvotes are for.they are for removing post that break the rules,like being disrespectful,posting sexual content etc. Its not a \"I disagree\" button. \n\nIts litteraly going to be a gigantic hive mind,until a moderator does something about downvotes in here.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-08-29T21:40:17.202+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> its been this way in this board section. anyone that post about getting punished,or disagrees with the hive mind that toxicity is bad,they get downvoted to hell.\n\nTypically, I've only really seen people get downvoted when they post about getting punished and claim that the punishment was unfair, when their logs and behavioral history prove otherwise.\n\nAs for disagreeing with the \"hive mind\" - do you mean people who claim that the IFS works in ways that we _know_ it doesn't?

I am simply addressing a reasonable argument for toxicity, and providing a counterargument based on the supposed general consensus of the playerbase.\n\nMy point being; _Most people don't like toxicity._\n\n> It's not valid.if you disagree with someone simply don't upvote their post.\n\nSo, is using a hard-case multitool as a hammer not valid, because it wasn't designed specifically as a hammer, _even though it totally works as one_? Is using _Frozen Mallet_ on Yasuo not valid, because he wasn't designed specifically to use tank/bruiser items, and tank/bruiser items weren't specifically designed to be used by skirmishers?\n\nBecause things can be used for more than just the explicit design. Upvotes and downvotes are reasonably versatile. You haven't provided a reasonable argument against upvotes/downvotes being used to show agreement/disagreement besides \"well Riot didn't say they're used for that, did they?\"\n\n> just look in gameplay+,mods decided to block downvotes because it was deconstructive.\n\nGameplay+ also has posts curated by the forum moderators to ensure that every post has solid discussion value and minimal (if any) overlap with other existing discussions. There's no reason for Gameplay+ to have upvotes or downvotes, because all of the discussions there will be of good quality and value, and the Moderators want to drive active discussion with those threads - meaning people who disagree or agree will have to post to show their agreement/disagreement.\n\nGameplay+ isn't a good argument.\n\n> You got me there,but isn't it better to _not_ downvote at all if your not sure what its used for?\n\nNo? People will ascribe their own use to a thing. Multiple people can ascribe a variety of uses to a thing, and people can also use a thing for multiple reasons at once.\n\nIf you don't want to downvote, don't downvote. If you don't use downvotes/upvotes to show your disagreement, you do you. Everyone else, though, can use downvotes/upvotes how they please - the two uses I described (agreement/disagreement and raising/lowering posts of various quality) are the biggest two uses people have.","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingOfBiches","date":"2018-08-29T23:02:33.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I edited my comment,it looks like you replied late","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-08-29T21:37:39.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downvote because I disagree.\n\nHowever, I DO agree that you need more coffee.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lemmy","date":"2018-08-29T21:39:04.449+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is, do you moderate the person who cast the stone or the people retaliating to having the stone thrown at them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-08-29T21:37:32.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not wrong, but on the flip side, I don't think I've ever seen a -10 comment worth reading.","replies":[]}]}
