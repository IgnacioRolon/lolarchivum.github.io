Mostly the latter.\n\nThe Passive: Nothing in the kit speaks to this character being fast, why should he be faster out of combat? The second part of the passive if first of all nonsensical. If a champion has less than 55 hp, they die from a single attack. I'm guessing you meant 55% hp. If that's the case, scale it better. 30/40/50% is better. The Lifesteal you gain doesn't make sense either. Give a proper percent above 10 at later levels or it will not matter. And the % health damage just seems like an extra thing you just slapped on. If it's because he's supposed to be finishing people off, deal percent missing health damage instead.\n\nThe Q: I take it this is like Jinx's Q in switching? Well, if that's the case, there's seemingly no reason to switch to being Careful, for Ruthless is so OP. 2 strikes every 3 attack is already super strong and then you make it deal even more damage with each hit? To understan the balance this might need, look at Master Yi's passive. Considering it's a choice, that version of your Q can be slightly stronger than Master Yi's passive. Not 480% stronger.\n\nThe W: Passive effect: You do realise how little 10 range is in League, right? The length of 1 Teemo is 100. A normal attack range is 525. 10-30 bonus range is NOTHING. The Active effect: The Active is another state-changer. Two (From the Q) is more than enough. The Damage on the active is also really stupid and needs rebalancing. \n\nThe E: Boring.\n\nThe R: Passive effect: 3% extra damage means you need to hit someone 33 times before you've dealt enough damage with this passive to deal equal damage to 1 attack. This is insignificant and needs removing. The Active effect: This is your 4th state changer. Stop it. You've put a lot of redundancy into this active. Removing half the words wouldn't make it harder to understand. Other than that, it's too strong and there's no way to balance it. Giving yourself 5-15 seconds where you can just shoot an opponent for 240 damage per shot with no danger to yourself is too OP. You can literally stand in base and kill the enemy ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T05:34:55.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and also it SAYS 50% PERCENT, LEARN HOW TO READ","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T05:28:57.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I didn't make this shit to\n be serious I was at Starbucks waiting for my fucking friend so i decided to post a fucking broken champ, and you don't have to writ 20 sentences and 4 paragraphs, and the other important shit i post nobody reads and everyone reads my Starbuck shit? damn","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T05:50:54.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"instead of just writting little comments let me tell you the things you commented on \n\nThe passives movement speed was to make you run faster trying to roam or just going back to lane, chances are with my designed kit its gonna be hard to sustain yourself if you play her(him) in mid where there this thing called assassins.\nthe second part? it was 50% not 50, there was some mistakes. edit: it should scale better i agree but do i have the time in starbucks?\n\nthe Q: i made ruthless to be more helpful in a team fight and not to be destroying your opponent, changes could be made. but i m keeping the hp regen on careful.\n\n\nthe w the range wasnt suppose to be a big deal, i just left it there so it can some what fit in the theme of the sniper character.\nand i was going to make it that the on hit shit from ur q dosent apply but once again no time to edit, and the damage, how was i gonna know balance, have you seen illoai??? and they call her damage balanced.\n\n\nthe E: its boring same man same. the original idea was to use this to be a bit more mobile and have a 0.5s reduced cooldown every AA but i wanted to be the most unbalenced fk.\n\nThe R: the P was meant so it wouldent change the game alot while giving you some buffs so you can deal more damage (anyway its stupid prob doing some changes before i sleep) and the meaning is you only get 1000000000000 range for 1 shot and the rest is about from your mid tower to the enemys red buff(i dont know how units in league work)\n\nand the gender factor at last. i m not very sure a male or female, most adcs are woman and some are....(twitch and urgot) and theres abit thats man, so its really hard to decide, to be man or woman.\nand plus why take 10 minutes typing this up? like you can just comment you need to do some changes.\nand i will be taking this more careful, i will be making tons of changes so stay tuned.\n\n\ntrashcan I smurf__","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mushubaby","date":"2016-12-06T02:34:26.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not very unique","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T05:32:00.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wasnt made to be, just like all of the assassins for ex: rengars W (no 4 stack verison) is legit tahms e in a healing way, and his 4 stack E is olafs fucking ult","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l DÃ¡rius l","date":"2016-12-06T01:39:17.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahahaha no","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T05:44:48.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"69944531DEL1","date":"2016-12-07T05:29:21.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:29}}","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-07T05:30:24.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its made to kill one specific person so not like twitches penta sht","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"J Epstein","date":"2016-12-06T03:15:57.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quit reading at :\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=1vu2q2ww,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-12-06T01:28:18.481+0000)\n\n> Dead: when dealing damage to a character with 25/50/55 hp or lower you gain 2/3/5 lifesteal and _**deal 0.5/1.5/2.5 percent max HP true dmg**_","replies":[]}]}
