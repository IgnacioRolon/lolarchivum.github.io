If you got punished and are Dishonorable because of it, you have to prove to Riot that you can do better.\n\n**Why stop people from ever having a chance?**\n\nThey don't. Just because you can't jump from Honor Level 0 straight to Honor Level 2 doesn't mean you don't have the chance to climb to Honor Level 2. You may not be able to jump to HL2, but you can climb to HL1, and then to HL2.\n\n**Can we have more visibility?**\n\nPractically speaking, I'm pretty sure the Checkpoints are as good as we're going to get. We can't have clear visibility (like an actual progression bar), since Riot wants to avoid making Honor a senseless grind to the end of the bar, as well as to avoid letting players get a better look at the math behind Honor progress.\n\nGranted, there may be other ways to increase visibility to some degree, but they wouldn't be offering the kind of visibility that people want.\n\n**Can we have more consistent rewards drops, like daily/weekly?**\n\nWell, depending on what rewards drops we're talking about, there already is a degree of consistency.\n\nKey fragment drops are random, but Milestone rewards are, if not semirandom, at least consistent in the respect that they outline your progression.\n\nMaking daily/weekly rewards drops (I'm gonna assume this would refer to key fragments) would oversaturate how many key fragments players get, and then the rewards (key fragments) would lose their value, since, getting a fragment a day pretty much means you'll never experience a time when you don't have a key compared to not having a chest.\n\nAnd, if that ultimately became the case, the next big question would be;\n\n**Can we have more rewards?**\n\nWhich, the only way I can answer that hypothetical question is with another question: How many free rewards can Riot give us for being Honorable without rewarding us overmuch?","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-16T18:16:58.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that people can change, for the worse or the better, and giving everyone a equal head-start in the honor system could (undisencourage? how do you even speak english?) people from trying to climb. \n\nbased my friends info, it took him 3 month from H1 to H2.\nand he wasn't even talking.\n\nIts suppose to be a hard grind, but the amount of time just straight up discourages people to even try.\n\nnow that I spent more money on skins, I think rewards can be things like Legacy skins or some Rare ward from 2011 or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-16T18:32:01.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I believe that people can change, for the worse or the better, and giving everyone a equal head-start in the honor system could (undisencourage? how do you even speak english?) people from trying to climb.\n\nPeople can change, but they need a reason _to_ change. Having Dishonorable status is meant to, in some small way, catalyze that change. Lack of ambient key fragment drops, Honor rewards, and End-of-Season reward eligibility are all incentives for players to change their behavior.\n\nBesides, resetting Honor Level _upwards_ as well as downwards would also lead to miscommunication. Some people may wind up thinking their account gets put back to \"clean slate\" status with the reset, leading to them making a mistake due to lack of caution, and getting a way harsher punishment than they thought they'd get - potentially even a permanent ban.\n\n(And this is generally ignoring the fact that tying an Honor pardon to a specific date is just kind of arbitrary.)\n\nAs a side note, you don't need to use a double-negative affix, you could just use the antonym. In this case, rather than saying \"undisencourage\" or \"undiscourage\", saying \"encourage\" (or synonyms, like \"incentivize\") serves the purpose.\n\n> now that I spent more money on skins, I think rewards can be things like Legacy skins or some Rare ward from 2011 or something.\n\nLegacy skins would probably only suffice for Honor Level 5 rewards - and, even then, Riot would have to be pretty selective about it. Our first two Honor skins were Legacy carry-overs from the Refer-A-Friend program (Grey Warwick, Medieval Twitch), so I think Honor Skins should probably be something exclusive, meaning they'd have to avoid skins that can be, at various times, unvaulted.\n\nWard skins, though, are tough to consider, since the End of Season bonus Honor rewards consist of ward skins based on Honor Level (at 3+). Perhaps they could tie it to a specific milestone reward (Like Honor 4?), but largely, ward skins (whether existing or not) are also tough to consider, given that they're 5$ a pop.\n\nMy point, though, with the rewards hypothetical, is that we already get quite a lot of free content between Honor rewards and Hextech Crafting, and there's something to be said about Riot being cautious considering that they've given the metaphorical mouse a cookie.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2018-12-16T10:32:30.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually relate to your first point...
