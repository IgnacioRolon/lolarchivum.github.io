For one, unlocking/progressing in Honor is more about your own behavior than anything else, and on top of that, if valid reports _did_ unlock Honor, then that would probably wind up rewarding instigators, which isn't really something Riot would do.\n\nI'd reckon that your Honor unlocking at the same time as getting an Instant Feedback Report is just coincidence - correlation, not causation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-01-16T12:02:21.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as we know the way to earn honor is to not be validly reported, with constant end screen honors _slightly_ speeding up the process.\nI do hope in the future serial reporters (people creating non-valid reports in an unusually large quantity) should have their own honor halted a little simply so that the whole system is not so cluttered with reports that have to be processed, but that is just a personal hope and opinion.","replies":[]}]}
