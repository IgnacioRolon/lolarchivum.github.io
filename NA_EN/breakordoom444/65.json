Also {{champion:157}} did receive a nerf recently for those still complaining about him. he was by no means gutted, but he has to release his tornado sooner. Also why is no one complaining about {{champion:240}}. If you do like 1k magic damage on him when his skarl shield has like 50 hp left on it, that 1k damage now becomes 50. He does not take any exra damage outside of the 50 unless his own hp is at 50 otherwise he just gets knocked off skarl.\n\nListen you skilless brainfucks. Learn how to play against these champs and stop complaining. There's a reason why {{champion:17}} is still in this game. Just learn to enjoy the game and stop complaing of \"omg he's op\", just because you got killed by one in lane.
