So, you weren't negative at all. Your entire chat was shotcalling and positive chat. and you got banned? Please provide chat logs if you want an honest opinion.\n\nP.S. If your bot lane does this every game with the intention to lose, you should write a support ticket to get manual review. Riot sucks ass at detecting inters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sintama","date":"2020-02-28T06:44:53.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a snowball meta. You can't be banned for playing poorly unless Riot can 100% rule out the enemy didn't just shit on you. There's a good chance the enemy team is just better and completely destroyed your team; that's not bannable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-28T06:39:35.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know the rules don't take sides? You could all be guilty. None of you could be guilty. Either you follow the rules, or you don't. The bot is the arbitrator, and he doles out judgement every time you report, indiscriminately (probably) and with weights defined by the masses of reports in its massive memory.\n\nAlso, this image doesn't show anything convincing except some players performed poorly against their opponents. Like, Zed was losing against Sett? Who'da'thunk? We've seen FAR worse performance, this is nothing by itself. Rujitra's got you pegged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-02-28T05:31:52.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Likely you for trying to flame/blame your teammates for everything instead of working as a team.
