I only rarely played old Sion and Poppy, but I was pretty put off that Riot totally threw out their champion archetype in the process.  I was seriously hoping that Sion's rework would have given us two champions, one focusing on his Juggernaut archetype and the other on his Mage archetype, both tweaked for game health of course.  Instead we got something that, while certainly a really cool champion, isn't Sion.\n\nFull VGUs invoke equal parts dread and hope.  I think my main ({{champion:96}}) could do with a VGU that just keeps his W with a heavily modified Q, but at the same time what if Riot thinks the thing that *defines* Kog isn't what I enjoy about him?  AP Kog players have already been burned on that front.\n\nBasically, I've got a love/hate relationship with the full VGUs.  Even some of the mini-gameplay updates have been intensely polarizing.

We never intended Yorick to be a broad appeal champion like Poppy, for example.\n\nI want to preface this by saying that it isn't my intent to be contrary, so I'll apologize in advance if it comes off that way.\n\nIn ranked play at least, Yorick is sitting at *just* under twice Galio's play rate.  Yorick was intentionally nerfed into unviability over on Rift, so it's no shocker that his play rate has roughly doubled now that he has a kit that can be balanced.  Galio is getting a rework, too.  But he isn't nearly as bad off as Yorick was.  He's unpopular, certainly, but his players are doing quite well with him.\n\nSo I guess the question is *why* is Galio getting remade?  He isn't unhealthy for the game.  He didn't get 'Eve'd' and his win rate is solid.  He's just really unpopular.  Is Galio only getting remade because of his out-dated model and unpopularity?  Because if that's the case, then he's getting remade for the people who *don't* like him rather than the people who do.\n\nThis is why the full VGUs make me uneasy.  Changes for the sake of the majority who aren't invested in a champion, the minority that already enjoyed that champ notwithstanding.  When a Poppy or Sion or Yorick remake goes live, a champion is being removed from the game and being replaced with something wholly unlike their predecessor.  Are they healthier champions for it?  Without a doubt.  But the complete loss of their identity is off-putting.\n\n's why I'm totally okay with VGUs like the one Gangplank got.  He's VASTLY different now compared to what he was when he still had his trouser tarantula model, but he's overall a much more interesting and compelling champion while also maintaining his core identity and gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-27T19:07:23.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They also do things for thematic reasons.

Mostly I take issue with the archetype of Poppy and Sion being changed.  Yorick remained a minion-focused Juggernaut.  Just in a fashion that's more compelling than 'spam ghouls at people until you run out of mana'.  Poppy was somewhere between an Assassin and a Diver while Sion was somewhere between a Skirmisher and a Juggernaut.

Obviously the champions with deeper problems usually get prioritized first. \n\nCorki is mainly on that list because his theme/visuals are pretty dated. He's a very low priority though.\n\nA VGU is basically when we take a champion and build it from the ground up as if it was a new champion. We ask ourselves \"what would this champion be like if we made this champion today, as a new champion?\"\n\nSome things stand the test of time and don't need to be changed while others don't. By the time we get to Corki we could find that most of his kit held up and doesn't need to be changed. Tristana was a full VGU for example that had pretty small gameplay changes.\n\nA VGU just means that we change whatever makes sense to make a champion feel like a modern, cohesive champion that we would be proud to release today. It doesn't necessarily mean that it needs to have a full new kit (though in many cases with our older champions it does.)\n\nAlso sometimes changes to lore/art/theme requires gameplay changes to make the overall champion feel cohesive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
