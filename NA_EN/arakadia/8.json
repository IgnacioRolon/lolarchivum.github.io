So if there's a champion where all you need to do is press Q and you can basically get a kill no matter how bad you are or how much of a bad decision it was to do what you did, Riot should keep buffing it and rewarding you? If all of Swain's abilities were skillshots except his ult, I guarantee you no one will complain because that WOULD make him considerably harder to play. There are certain champs like Garen or Xin whom against certain matchups you can basically just punch the top left side of your keyboard to get a double with minimal amount of mechanics involved really. Does it make sense to give such champions so much power? Why play other champs at all if they are hard to play and don't net the same amount of reward? (Not saying Xin or Garen are strong atm) That's not how balancing works. You're just asking an already retarded-easy champion who's currently strong state to remain the same disregarding BALANCE.\n\nSure there are effective means to counterplay but no one can deny Swain is too powerful right now.

Lets take a look on why your wrong:\n\n* He requires mana management much more than most champions.\n\n* If he can't cs, he will get oom much easier. He really needs his passive to get mana back.

They remove spell vamp items, gut Vlad's sustain and now they are gutting Swain. No wonder mages are becoming something that is only seen in the JG or as a support role. AD's do better sustained damage, have better farming, far better late game damage, and also have sustain. The only solo lane mages that see play are burst mages picked into squishy comps. The only reason mages still exist is to counter armor stacking... they fail in every other way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xietnin","date":"2016-06-15T23:02:00.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain's getting cassiopeia'd? \nNearly every time I come to the board, I find something that has me depressed about playing LoL.\nEDIT: I meant the Casiopeia'd the time before the current Cassiopeia that got nerfed to the ground and was no longer viable due to being flat out broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nymzo","date":"2016-06-15T19:42:47.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here how I would see Swain gameplay:\n\nPassive and all basic spells: q and w same as now, e would be a skillshot.\n\nUlt: Available at level 1, no cost for transformation, staying in this form does not drain mana anymore but there no ravens that attack nearby foes and heal Swain, cd 10 or 20.\n\nInstead, his basics spells would be empowered, giving him spellvamp (like someone suggested). However, the spells would cost double or triple the mana of the original cost.\n\nThis would turn Swain into a brand new champ, a skillful player would have to think when he would need to transform since using the spells in Bird form would cost A LOT of mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-06-15T19:47:50.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats cool, I'd like to see how his spells are empowered.
