Rivers run with vibrant colors, flowers bloom with incredible perfumes and living beings experience psychedelic visions and surges in magical power. For a time, such places are wondrous and brimming with miracles, but soon the landscape is twisted into new and deadly forms, and if the Void is able to consume enough biomass to survive, it can grow and evolve into something ferocious and terrifying.\n\nIn fact, that could be the Sai. Or it could be the Void since we don't know what the Void looks like but know it has regions in it at least somewhat similar to Shurima since otherwise how could Rek'sai be from the Void?
