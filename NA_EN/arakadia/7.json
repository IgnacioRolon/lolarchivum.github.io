As in, if an enemy is hiding in a bush, and Zombie Brand is running towards it, it'll switch to the chasing animation?  If so, I can understand them not wanting to implement this into any more champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2016-08-23T15:04:56.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's client side. If you are in a brush and you have vision of Brand and Brand doesn't have vision of you, you will see him do the chase animation, the Brand player won't see anything, it will still do the normal walking animation on his screen. Don't know how this stupid myth spread. For the footprints, they only show if you have vision of Brand.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-24T02:59:19.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for correcting me there.
