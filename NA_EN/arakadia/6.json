Every now and then I would get ganked by multiple people with Riven and end up having to fight them all off, but instead of just slaughtering Riven every time she went to lane to farm, I told her in all chat to farm, that I wouldn't touch her. I would walk past her and farm the minions behind her, she would farm the same.\n\nIt was a normal game, of course, and that could be considered throwing. But to be honest, I have no care for winning alone. Stomping someone while they're down is no fun. I'd rather lose when I deserved it instead of winning early just because I knew the laning phase better (that, and I was Renekton, a rather powerful early game champ).\n\nI got 3 honorable opponents after that game.
