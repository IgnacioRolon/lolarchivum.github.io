Pro teams have an idea of what champions their opponents are playing so there actually can be some decision-making around bans while regular games just come down to \"what champ is OP\" and \"what champ do I hate playing against\" with very poor odds that you'll even hit a champion that an opponent was planning on picking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-26T04:54:23.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget us Twisted Treeline lovers and Ranked 3s and don't forget we love you too. <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-07-26T03:18:12.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It does undercut some of the promise of one ban per player though ('you can always ban the thing you want') if you're one of the people with a later ban.\n\nA good way to mitigate this is to give each premade a single preemptive ban where available.

If I get a draw 3 times in a row against you in checkers that doesn't mean that checkers is a guaranteed draw no matter what you do but there is at least some system for forcing draws in at least 1-3 random-ish cases. For a scientific proof this isn't enough but its plenty for a forum discussion","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-07-27T18:25:47.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've started with fizz. There are a lot of reasons to ban out fizz but in all honesty, because were totally pro today, I'm just going to assume its because you don't want to deal with a snowballer that counters whatever mid pick you are strong with.. sure it could be for toplane but with these limited bans it doesn't matter what you actually banned for. \n\nFrom here I could ban leblanc but I ask myself if she's really all that strong right now. Especially since you are the one banning fizz. I'm going to go against the grain and start off by banning something champs like fizz try to push out of the meta that have been really strong recently. So I'll ban azir since recently he is symbolic of this. \n\nI'll get last pick and your first ban is mostly problematic as a midlaner. Sure he snowballs in top but the real problem is if he roams and ends the game in 17 minutes. 2 midlaners are banned now. I hope your team strat isn't centered around mid because if this keeps up I'm going to grab some advantage with the last pick. in both selection and bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakeRoIIs","date":"2016-07-27T18:13:06.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fizz","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaÃ­tlyn","date":"2016-07-24T04:49:01.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"The answer is always the LC$","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-07-24T05:23:16.968+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno if everything is based on LC$, especially because more bans would make LCS better.","replies":[{"poster":"CaÃ­tlyn","date":"2016-07-24T05:36:22.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but Im assuming whatever their reason is, it would be something to do with its impact for LC$.\n\nThere was a thread somewhere that Riot responded to where they gave about 4 reasons why not more bans, Im not going to dig it up for you but you can find it.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-07-24T06:48:28.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oker Dokers.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-07-24T04:49:58.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they literally said they were interested in doing that.","replies":[]}]}
