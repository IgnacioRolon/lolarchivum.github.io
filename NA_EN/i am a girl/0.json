I have changed my paypal password and added additional security measures but I'd like to know whether or not these measures will actually keep someone from just clicking on the paypal option in my account again... \n\nSince my account was seemingly transferred to another region (That is what it tells me when I try to log in on NA), will my rank be reset when it is brought back to NA? \n\nThis may go without saying, but I of course need the $200 in riot points refunded.\n\nThanks for your help, I was a little agitated by the issue at the time and probably came off rudely, and for that I apologize.","replies":[]}]}]}
