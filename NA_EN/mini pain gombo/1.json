The thing is that each time this happens i get a timer and a \"bad guy reputation\" in they eyes of riot. So i would, and that is without counting the 30 mins wait i had to do because the client crashed on me. I would really like to know what is the issue with the client. And if it would be possible on riot's end to recognize those occurrences and don't penalize me for it. If it is impossible... In the past, I have received notes saying that i afk less, when any time I did afk in a game, there was a legitimate reason behind it (not talking about that kid who afk because someone gave 3 kills to Katarina and calls it GG or feeds because someone accidentally banned their champion). Whether it was connection issues or computer freezes, ( my old computer had that issue, it would freeze at any random moments, especially during ranked games -.- and i consider myself to be in the amount of people who are the least toxic in this community, with chat and and general behavior in game) but that's on my end. Riot had nothing to do with my computer freezing or my internet going off. Client crashes though... that's is something I would like riot to address some attention. Or at least maybe try to separate the real trouble making players from those who are just having connection/system issues. I Hope you understand my problem/request and that it can be fixed in a near future.\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\n\r\nI hope i will get an answer sometime soon.\r\n\r\nFrom a silver 4 who just wants to climb :D","replies":[{"poster":"Orthrod","date":"2016-09-20T16:23:01.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not the only one having problems with the client crashes lately. Sent a ticket in myself a few weeks ago and downloaded the hextech repair tool. Me and literally everyone I group with has there client crash probably at least one time a day. Sometimes it happens while waiting to que or while searching for a game. Other times it happens in champ select and we are forced to wait through the leaver buster timer, of which 90% of the time i end up having because of technical issues with the client not my connection. Luckily I have not had the client crashing problems in game nor, luckily, during my promos so i have not had to suffer a loss because of them. I may just not be looking hard enough into it but I have not seen much on Riots end acknowledging this problem and communicating about it, something they have recently said they are trying to improve. They may get more complaints about it as well with ARURF hitting the RGM and people getting hit with 20+ minutes for a client crash. A little acknowledgment and communication is really all a lot of people are looking for around this issue, and maybe a temporary alleviation of the leaver buster while they work out the bugs as that is just annoying. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Orthrod","date":"2016-09-20T16:24:59.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And no there is no message that pops up, although before it would just be the client closing but now recently the client has just been freezing and I have to force it to close through task manager and reopen it if that helps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T21:13:21.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it *really sucks* when a disconnection or crash happens due to a technical issue that isn't immediately in your control. Unfortunately, a disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match, regardless of whether it was intentional or not. This is a prime reason why penalties cannot be modified or removed in any way.\n\nIf you can give me a bit more details about what error messages you see and any specific behavior when the crash happens, we can work together to find a permanent solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mini Pain Gombo","date":"2016-09-19T06:48:59.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And 4 hours later internet decided it needed a  vacation...
