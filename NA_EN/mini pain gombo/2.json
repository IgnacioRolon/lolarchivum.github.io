The thing is that each time this happens i get a timer and a \"bad guy reputation\" in they eyes of riot.","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/nExEvLPx-client-keeps-crashing-right-after-afk-check","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.... \r\n\r\nSo I have made a post about 20 days ago about my client crashing during AFK check or right when we get into the lobby. It happens OFTEN, to me at least. I do believe that the issue is not coming from me and on the first post a rioter asked me to explain the problem more in depth .... even tho its kinda simple. I am losing my time and my LP, hard earned LB btw (hard to carry through silver) for absolutely nothing. At the time im making this post, i am currently in a 30 min wait timer because of this issue and it drives me crazy. I don't know what's causing it, but i'm getting really tired of it. Simply put, what happens is that i click accept on the AFK check (has to be just after -.-) and then a box pops up saying that lol client isnt responding. Tell me if i have to change something on my side but give me an explanation as to why its happening so i can perhaps fix it. Otherwise... plz adress this issue.\r\n\r\nTY very much","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T21:40:23.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes during champion select or when interacting with the PvP.net system (accepting queue) are generally caused by an unstable connection to the servers.
