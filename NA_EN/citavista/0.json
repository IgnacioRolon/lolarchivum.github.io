If I load up and the game is displaying good ping I can usually expect to experience good connection throughout the game. If I load up and see the ping in the 250-300 game I generally hate the entire experience and even AFK out of pure frustration.\r\n\r\nNormally I'd blame Riot and their servers but I'm pretty sure the problem lies in TWC and their bad routing. I'm sure of this because by using the WTFast free trial I was able to get consistently good connections to my games, which normally using a proxy should only add more delay.\r\n\r\nNow my time with WTFast is up and I'm wondering if there is something I can do on my end or if I have to cough up money to WTFast to get consistent good connections to my games.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T20:54:59.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm....If you are getting two completely different types of ping depending on the game, then it very much seems like it is due to the connection path you are being put on by TWC.  Essentially, there are times where you get a very efficient path from them and connect directly, then there are other times you are given a really in-efficient path, giving you much higher ping.  This would also explain why using WTFast gives you a better ping as you are bypassing that route from TWC.\n\nUnfortunately, there is very little we can do on the case.  We have [built up the Riot Direct Network for North America](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204#h3q2) to help players with different ISP's get the most direct route to our Game Servers as possible, but it is still up to the ISP's to get your connection on there.  You may want to consider talking to TWC about this issue directly, but there is very little I can do on my end :(\n\nI wish I had better news >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"karuaan","date":"2016-06-06T13:06:02.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um there are a lot of people experiencing the same problems as you but aren't on TWC. I am on Verizon Fios and I have having this problem as well. A lot of people think its on Riots end!","replies":[{"poster":"Citavista","date":"2016-06-06T19:59:16.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if it's a problem on Riot's end then why did using WTFast help?
