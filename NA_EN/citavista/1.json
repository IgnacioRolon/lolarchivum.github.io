Nothing.\r\n\r\nNo bug splat, no error message, no disconnect message. Nothing. I bring the client back up and it says I've abandoned the match. Attempting to click reconnect causes the client to disappear and the loading screen still does not appear. \r\n\r\nUsing the repair tool, would still like some help if this issue persists.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T04:57:03.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is dropping its connection to our servers entirely when this happens, which often occurs as a result of conflicting network settings.

Can't patch the latest update to League, which is the second time this has happened to me and the only way I resolved that was by a fresh reinstall, and thanks to the download of League on this site that doesn't ever work I had to find the base install of League somewhere else on the internet because no advice I ever receive on here about patching problems ever helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T17:30:35.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if the patching issue happens after the patcher hits 33%, this is definitely related to a connection drop. Can you give me more context as to how and where it fails?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
