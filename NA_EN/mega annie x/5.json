And even if you will get it after all, you will never have an use of it anyway in late game. \nConsidering games are shorter than ever, you will basically never get this item at all. Rabadon, rylai and nashoor are must have for kayle, providing utility and damage at the same time, not only damage that is dependant on stacks, which without item is not cost effective.\nI play kayle since season 1, and i tried to buy this item lots of times. To be honest, a way of stacking change is what it killed this for kayle somehow. You have to AA, if you dont for 5 sec, stacks will disapear and you cannot hold them as you used to with abilities. \nThe stats are cool, but unfortunately not the reason i should get it before i buy rylai and nashoor, that are essential items for a champion. \n\nLets just assume we have rylai and nashoor already, rabadon is still a better choice because it will give you 230 ap by itself, while rageblade 40 ap and 30 ad, boosted up by stacks. At this point, without stacks, damage per hit is 2x higher for kayle with rabadon, and the price is 52% higher, not 100%. Including Q damage from it and a heal, rabadon is more cost effecient than rageblade with 3-4 stacks.

I know several players who are rushing rylai on her since the rylai slow change and it always worked out, because it suits mid game best, reducing mobility of other champions, gives decent amount of AP and increases defense. Do you even orb walk with kayle boy? With rylai it is a deadly weapon, much stronger than guinsoo herp derp tons of damage. If you cannot outplay anyone, you cannot win on kayle, thats what is all about. You could get CC'ed, baited and played with if you dont have consistent source of CC on her.  \nI played the champion on eune on the different nickname got 90k points in mastery with her on SR in about 2 months after riot released this system. \nI remember when she had a real hybrid passive, when she got her E buffed up to 0.4, Q nerfed several times and W-R range reduce, but never leaved the champion in the opposite to you, bragging out the kayle in s3 after she turns into strong champion with the buffs and leaved her after nerfs. \nIf someobody has no room to talk, it is you.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-11-13T05:42:59.416+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL.
