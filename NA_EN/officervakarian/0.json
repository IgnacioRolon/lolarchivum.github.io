Imagine you're trying to climb to gold, it's so close you can taste it, you have one week left.... and then it happens. The Login Server decides, \"Nah, man. End of the line for you.\" And refuses to work for over 24 hours, even after you follow the support steps from the Knowledge Base article.\r\n\r\nScary, I know. Panic-inducing, even. But this is no work of fiction. This is happening to me, as we speak, and I have done everything in the Riot guides that they say should fix it. I don't read the boards often, and so I don't know how many times this sort of thing has been posted in the last 24 hours, so please don't get mad and downvote this. I'm frustrated and tired and I just want to work on my climb. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-28T01:27:17.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what knowledge base articles you've already worked through, but most login issues are caused by a few factors.
