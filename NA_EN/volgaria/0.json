Anyone else experience this? I was on skype at the time and it was still working perfectly fine. My music was still playing, everything working fine. But me and our support DC'd at the same time (we weren't duo and definitely not on the same internet). It said \"attempting to reconnect\" and i could watch people move around a little but no damage or spells. I had to restart it entirely. What happened?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T21:39:30.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From looking at this, when only a few players DC from a game (and everyone else is perfectly fine) this usually boils down to some sort of ISP issue.  Even though you weren't duoing, it is possible that both of you were on the same ISP, and when that ISP had a sudden problem, both of you disconnected.  This is only speculation as there is no way to confirm 100%.\n\nSince this game, have you been experiencing any other issues?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volgaria","date":"2016-05-04T12:06:37.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply. And no it was just that one point towards the end of the game. I was talking to a friend in Skype and he was still in game with 0 issues. I have comcast so seems weird only two of us on the team would only have comcast if it was ISP.","replies":[]}]}
