They bashed me all game and were extremely toxic all because i wasn't as good as my elo says i am for the lane i was playing.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-02T23:01:02.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who cares!

But I can believe some of them get their butts kicked in lower elos, because I've seen a few higher elo players who don't adjust their strategy to handle the strategies of their teammates.\n\nFor example, I heard one higher elo player indicate that most lower elo players don't fully take advantage of their enemies mistakes, or the potential gains of an early success, which, based on my experience, is true. A lot of lower elo players (including me) are more laid back after a small win. But KNOWING that, you should be careful as to what advantages YOU try to push if you know your allies aren't going for it.\n\nI had a 3s game where this Renekton just kept harassing the enemy jungler solo, until he got 3v1'd and killed. He did this like 5 times in the first 10 minutes until the opposing team was fed. He kept touting his rank, ragging on us for not backing his plays, and all I could think was, \"KNOWING that a full-team aggressive invasion might be advantageous is not an excuse for incessantly SOLO invading, feeding, and then whining at your teammates. If I wanna play safe and farm for now, that's none of your business. Just quit invading and go farm. It's not hard. Sheesh.\"\n\nI'd say MOST league players have this issue. It especially causes friction between the groupers and the lane pressurers. \"OH MY GOSH JAX, QUIT SPLIT-PUSHING AND GROUP. WE JUST LOST ANOTHER 4V5.\" Basically 1 out of 4 games in League have some bitching like that going on at some point. And all i can think is, well... since you're 4v5, STOP ENGAGING! IT'S NOT THAT HARD. I don't even have to be the jax to come to this conclusion. And yes, 90% of the time, it's the groupers engaging, not getting engaged upon under tower, or some other situation they have no control over.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish League players would do (other than stop throwing insults around) it's for each one of them to stop pretending there's ONE universal strategy in EVERY game that's LAW, and if someone isn't following it, EVERYTHING BAD THAT HAPPENS, NO MATTER WHAT, is that person's fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-10-03T05:21:47.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain.
