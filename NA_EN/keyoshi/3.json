I kind of assumed they'd nerf the Locket aura along with the Aegis aura, since they did that when they went from 20 to 15.\n\nI don't get the \"Shield duration lowered to 2 seconds from 5 seconds\" thing. It's already 2 seconds, isn't it? I tried it in a custom and it sure seemed like 2 seconds. If you guys are right then Locket gains a worse build-path (weaker Aegis) but ends up being 250 gold cheaper, which seems like a pretty decent deal for me. If you're wrong and the aura is 10 then that's a massive nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-11-01T02:23:38.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"\"muh ap will be overtaken by adc overloads\"","replies":[]}]}
