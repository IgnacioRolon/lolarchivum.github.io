Its about consistent and not easily counterpicked.  The professionals keep their jobs by winning, which means that a risky pick could cost them their jobs.

And when you have to be able to play almost entirely by instinct since you won't have time to think, you have to have a champ where you've played/practiced them for hundreds and even thousands of hours.  \n\nSo most pros really have a champ pool of maybe 5 champs they are willing/able to play in a game unless the team plans ahead for some kind of unusual comp.

Certainly, but they might not fit the comp should the team need to change tactics in the middle of a match, so, the pros go with the same champs.\n\nOf course, the best solution would be to make it so there are no generalists, but that would anger the pros who need those champions.  They don't want to find their team saying \"I'm sorry, but we aren't renewing your contract.\" and to make sure that happens they need to win.

For example, 500 ap or ad is about normal near end game, move speeds are all similar ranges etc.  Stuns rarely last more than a couple seconds and so on.\n\nChampions are all balanced relative to eachother.  In this sense the problem is they dunk certain champions into the nerfbasket, but others remain at or above the baseline creating wildly large gaps in their consistency.  Champs that have lots of consistency consequently have the most of what everyone complains about...  that is having very little counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2015-02-16T16:51:59.554+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":">For example, 500 ap or ad is about normal near end game, move speeds are all similar ranges etc.\n> \n\nI just want to point out that it use to be that AP always reached the end game with higher AP than AD champions had AD. More and more AD scaling skills have been getting added to the game over the past few years, {{champion:92}}{{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} , and for some reason AD has been reaching the same numbers as AP. Yet AP still doesn't scale their basic attacks directly with their AP or have a stat like crit, capped CDR at 40% compared to 2.5sec atk speed (which also scales naturally), and spell vamp was gutted years ago compared to lifesteal which with a {{item:3074}} or {{item:3072}} a champion can heal to almost full in a single minion wave.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-16T07:46:52.856+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keyoshi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ok6UNBEI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-16T04:31:19.617+0000)\n>\n> So instead of nerfing everyone like they do, why not buff everyone else? just a thought.
