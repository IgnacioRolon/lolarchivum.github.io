So like when u engage on her and she ults u and that gets block, she's literally useless. If someone like a janna tries to peel u off her adc, you would be able to block it with EoN. Ultimates are almost always shorter cd than spells like flash, exhaust and heal.

Example:  Yi pops EoN, Ults, runs at you retard style like they do and unless you have 2-3 hard CC gets a double or triple.  Plus you get AD, MR, MS, and Lethality thats a fuck load for 3100g.  But with all that said the main issue is the hard cc block.  Your one way to stop an assassin from getting your adc or APC gets negated way to easy.  So a champ like Yi who can't be slowed or zed who is already tough to lock down or even Kat who I have seen this on all get a get out of jail free card with MR too (the list goes on).","replies":[]}]}
