Gnar is sort of a weird exception in that he has range, and fairly good CC and utility, but he pays the price of reliability.\n\nRiven is a fairly squishy champion who's only ranged ability is her ultimate.

Riven front-loads, like, 10 seconds of damage in 7 seconds.\nOr if you're super solid at animation canceling - you can do that with any champion's combo and auto-attacks themselves, leaving Riven proaportionally slower at unloading her combo to most you compare her to.\n\nSo - exact opposite.

Riven is more about endurance than burst, where a fighter/assassin like Jax, Aatrox, Fiora, Yi, Xin, or Pantheon, etc. is going to bleed more into the assassin side than Riven.\n\nI mean, I'd even give Vi better assassination potential than Riven.\n\nAssassin is mostly burst, fighter sustained DPS in melee, and Riven is about as sustained DPS in melee as you can get without being limited to auto-attacking alone.\nI mean - at 200 AD Riven's Broken Wings is only going to do 210 damage, where anyone ever auto-attacking with 200 AD is going to do 200 damage.
