Just like Twitch is more Assassin than Marksman, Graves is more Fighter than Marksman. Like other Fighters, he needs to be kited by ranged champions to be beaten.\n\nThe resistance from True Grit isn't meant for him to survive burst or help him escape. It's made for him to dash _into _ his enemy, and kill them with a shotgun blast to the face, and the resistances help him do that.\n\nI think a good compromise would be to only grant True Grit if he dashes towards an enemy champion or jungle monster. This rewards Graves for being aggressive, and doesn't if he just uses Quickdraw to get out of trouble.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorasama","date":"2016-03-27T10:07:01.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I kind of get their intention here.
