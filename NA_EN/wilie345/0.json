I didn't notice any problems until entering the game. I tried to reenter the game and the moment the game loaded completely it froze my computer up again. I'm not sure what other info you need, so I'm basically just asking if this happens to others or if there are some trouble shooting options for me to try and fix it. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T22:41:18.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This freezing issue may be a result of a Windows 10 update.
