It said the pvp client crashed and now every time I go to launch League it says that it's unavailable. Has anyone else had this issue, specifically kind of around the same time as me? (it's 7 AM right now) My main concern is the fact that I was in the middle of a game when it shut down and I don't want to get banned.\n(also i'm sorry if this is the wrong board but i've not used the boards before!)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T23:37:48.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were some server issues last night so loss prevented was activated and ranked queues were disabled.
