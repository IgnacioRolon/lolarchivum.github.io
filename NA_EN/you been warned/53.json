There are a lot of people who don't want to think when playing games, there is a reason why simpler games or dumb downs are mostly the ones dominating the market, with some exceptions.\n\nThen besides that, there is Riot's balancing issues. Since we are no longer talking about competitively optimal and sub-optimal, it's almost always just competitively viable or unviable. So people are just like \"wth would I want to purposely handicap myself so hard just for the sake of standing out a little?\" (This Season seems to be hella better but still, it's Riot, you never know)\n\nSo if you wish to see a game community where people play their own style. you need to find a game that allows both dynamic customisable competitive playstyles, and has smaller enough active community so it doesn't get flooded by conformism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2015-04-14T12:13:58.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People want to play what's good without taking the time and effort to calculate what's good, so they just do what really good players (who do take that time and effort) do.

Don't you feel like filth from the inside?
