And her E is a shield with damage as well? The abilities transition more strongly towards their supportive attributes lategame. Zilean&#039;s kit should provide similar strength to empower his solo laning capability.\n\nThe idea:\n\nZilean can now cast E [ Time warp ] on bombs laid **on the ground** :\nThe bomb is rooted, so no minion or champion can carry it.\nThe radius of explosion is increased by a value (35%?)\nThe bomb explodes 1 second later.\n\nOther: Time Warp SFX is applied when cast on a bomb, the bomb is visually altered when said combo occurs.\n\nThis way Zilean has access to safe waveclear and clever, telegraphed harass that is gated by mana.","replies":[]}
