If you're melee, he can be hard but not impossible. If he misses his duskbringer, he loses so much power. Likewise, if you break the fear tether (easier if you're not tagged by duskbringer) he's easysauce. Also, he can be cc'd while he flies to you if you happen to know where he's coming from and you're quick as like alistar or Blitz","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2014-10-23T08:24:08.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"duskbringer is just as thick as morg Q, and guess what people say about that.\n\nalso CCing him doesn't work, spellshield.\n\nkiting sort of, but I detest kiting as a whole.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bruddah Mase","date":"2014-10-23T07:28:08.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"he doesnt build armor pen outside of youmuus unlike other retarded champions like jayce/zed/khaz/fiora so for once in this goddamn fcking game building defense is actually viable. his ganks are also weak unless you're extended becase he has no actual gapcloser.\n\nas a ball of stats, he appears to be ridiculous, but when you see that he gets kited much like trundle who can have 5k hp, 400 ad, 400 armor/mr, and 600 ms and 1.7 attack speed at the same time, it gets better.\n\noverall his weakness is late game scaling, he cant afford to put enough arpen in his build to scale well, eventually his damage will just fall off too hard","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2014-10-23T08:38:01.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see him building LW more often than you think, hits like a truck and doesnt die.\n\nThe build is usually LW, lifesteal (hydra/botrk) , full tank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2014-10-23T07:43:55.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"...People actually think Nocturne is broken right now? What?\n\nAs for counterplay: to put it gently, Olaf absolutely tears Noc's asshole open. He's probably the most direct counter. Noc is a single-target bruiser that has the ult of an assassin; the usual bruiser counters usually work on him (APs with low-CD CC spells like Ori and Syndra, ADs with BORK/phantom dancer/youmuus, Heimerdinger and his turret bullshit, Pantheon the ultimate 1v1 bruiser).","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2014-10-23T07:15:59.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Play tank?
