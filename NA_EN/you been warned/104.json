There were and are ways to positively impact...multiple things, just with the mastery system I feel, but the way they implemented it wasn't it.\n\nIt is little more than a basic achievement system that decided to grade you based on an arbitrary set of data you aren't privy to, as another way for those people looking for reasons to judge people, to be judgemental. There are already third party websites to allow people to see your elo, the champs you play, the masteries you use, etc, and now someone in champ select can see my profile and see I don't have, say, Braum mastered and think I'm bad at it, mostly because the system isn't retroactive (but that is another issue entirely).\n\nSadly I've been around this community too long and I've become cynical :(","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kikirino","date":"2015-05-08T02:08:15.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Outside the normal set of good champions is not breaking the meta.

Its stupid is based on wining games cuz wining a game doesn mean you  are good with said champion, just like loosing a game doesn't mean you were playing bad... makes no sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-05-07T21:23:53.738+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"I kind of want to see them make it so that you can only play champs you have mastered in ranked, obviously not immediately but maybe next season they could do this. That way when a champ comes out of obscurity because of the lcs at least people are forced to practice them if they have never played them before. This would encourage people to not play their mains in normals do that they can expand their available pool","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-05-07T21:51:26.321+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"Yes, let's restrict access to a champion you obviously enjoy because hurrr durrrr playing someone you're good with is bad\n\nwtf is wrong with you people?","replies":[{"poster":"League of Ori","date":"2015-05-08T02:44:21.650+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Auryiel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HeQUYxNN,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-05-07T21:51:26.321+0000)\n>\n> Yes, let's restrict access to a champion you obviously enjoy because hurrr durrrr playing someone you're good with is bad\n> \n> wtf is wrong with you people?\n\nthis is not at all what the OP said.","replies":[{"poster":"r11na","date":"2015-05-08T03:13:09.207+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's what the person he replied to said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZionSeeker","date":"2015-05-07T22:15:38.762+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's the way Smite does it.

For example, I went YOLO Cassio top last night against a Sion and lost my lane pretty hard.  I over-pushed lane WAY too far and too early trying to build passive stacks, so to farm anything I had to be extremely over-extended. A roaming fed Sion was probably the biggest contributor to the loss.  In other words, I single-handedly lost us the game since our other laners had good advantage until Sion showed up.\n\nBut I ended up with the highest score on the team.  It was a B or B+ when it should have been a D.  It's just all based on weird metrics that don't account for true impact on a game.  Another example was a game where I was basically a meat shield support, and we ended up with a super-fed ADC while the other team had a fed turret.  I got a C that game, even though 3 or 4 of my deaths were executes that gave our ADC a kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"r11na","date":"2015-05-08T03:18:08.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">That will encourage people to think outside of the meta and reduce the amount of people who tryhard with their mains on normals. It's a win-win situation.\n\nNot sure why people trying to play well with their mains in normals is a problem but I guess some people need to find any reason to blame others for their losses... shit allies, tryhard'ing enemy team etc...","replies":[{"poster":"ZPIN2WIN","date":"2015-05-08T08:24:55.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"PFFF come on, like you want to learn say {{champion:236}} VS someone who's been playing {{champion:67}} all his life.","replies":[]}]}]}
