( mostly weak )\n\nThis is more relevant after the {{item:3031}} nerf, intended to diversify ADC builds from {{item:3087}}. It indirectly nerfed these guys {{champion:86}} {{champion:41}}  {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} just to name a few.\n\nWhat do you guys think? :)","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-01T23:27:23.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's on-HIT.
