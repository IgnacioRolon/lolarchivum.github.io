I don't think 300 reflects that. Lower it to 25-50 because in all honesty, it's the easiest game you'll ever play. If you're new, sure it won't be as easy. But otherwise it's fairly simple. \n\nMost bot games I play, even with someone totally new, I don't die. Also not uncommon for me to go 20+/0. Bots really aren't that difficult.\n\nThey always chase if your health is lower, they completely ignore you were there if you stealth, can be easily chased since they run linear paths, and their builds never change. They also suck at last hitting, and won't harass an enemy that is at full health, and has more than 3 kills. \n\nThe AI is really super simple, it doesn't prepare you for PVP, nor does it really demonstrate any mastery of a champion since you can abuse that AI to no end. I'm down for it giving you mastery for Aram, maybe even Dominion. But those being games with different play styles, the points awarded should be significantly less, around 50-250 would be fine. \n\nIn the end, the Mastery system is really only there to show you've played quite a few games with a champion, and thus know the champion well.

SR is the main map mode that is played. It has the largest player base and thus the largest variability in the skill of its players. Additionally it is the mode with the most exposure and thus understanding of its particular strategies. For instance, most people can probably tell you what standard lanes looks like for summoner's rift, and a lot can tell you it's tank meta right now. I know ARAM is poke meta, and snowball messed w/ that, but I have no idea what meta is for TT or Dominion, and that is more common than not knowing those things for SR. AS a result players playing games on SR are more likely to play a wider spread of skill even when the games are matched (more people is a higher chance you play someone who is improving their game and hasn't been raised enough yet, or someone out of practice who is dropping), and the average skill level expected to be at in order to be considered in the middle is higher (people know the basics so you are expected to improve on that).\n\nIn theory it could be argued that because of these factors the average game on SR, is slightly more difficult than the average game on other modes, and this should be accounted for in rewards. Of course, if I'm not playing devil's advocate I'd invalidate much of the argument by countering that since high MMR (plat diamond etc) games don't award more mastery than low mmr games (bronze and silver) then the skill level of the game shouldn't be counted and all maps should be equal (although then the same argument could be used to say bots should give the same points, but that's bull shit so let's not go there).","replies":[{"poster":"K端rama","date":"2015-05-10T16:30:24.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"TT's meta currently is fighter / assasain based while Dominion's meta is adc / fighter based.
