Sure, over time, it equals out, I don't think anyone is gonna contest that.\n\nThe point is that RNG shouldn't decide laning as heavily as it currently can, not necessarily \"RNG IS EVIL\". \n\nPretend you're in bot lane, playing ADC, in 2 different scenarios(crit vs no crit). Let's assume you get hit 3 times in the first lets say 10 minutes of laning, equaling the same amount of damage in either scenario. \n\nIf you're hit by 3 non-crit autos, you know exactly how much damage you can take, you can still CS and trade, and it doesn't necessarily change the way you approach the lane.\n\nHowever, if the first of those 3 autos is a crit, you've now taken a large hit to your health, and even if the other 2 autos are non-crits that by themselves do less damage than in the no-crit scenario, you have to play safer. Not only do you not know for sure whether the next autos will be crits or not, you've taken twice the damage for no extra work on the enemy ADC's part,  you have to come out on top during trades to reach equal threat levels with the enemy ADC, and depending on the damage level you might feel the need to (depending on when the damage was received) burn heal or your support might use mana/skills they wouldn't otherwise due to the immediate damage spike.\n\n--------------------\n\nRNG definitely has a place in league, and on paper the numbers are balanced. The issue comes from the negative gameplay experience it causes, particularly in cases where a frontloaded crit in a trade rewards way too much for zero extra work on the \"crit-er\"s part, even if they sacrifice later damage instances to acquire it.\n\nThe \"Consistent DPS\" versus \"Burst Damage\" ***is*** a legitimate candidate for debate, as both have their benefits. The problem comes from \"Burst Damage\" being almost universally the superior option with regards to highly trade-focused lanes like Top and Bot where players are usually playing \"Consistent DPS\" roles, and that shouldn't be the case as much as it is.\n\nCrit should stay, it should just not *always* be the more powerful option (at least as far as ADCs are concerned). Pure stats say it is not, it's effect on gameplay, laning, and PvP interactions say it is. If nothing else, raw AD should be just as appealing, but IE is such a powerful item right now (as it has been for awhile, since the BT \"changes\" *cough* nerf *cough*) and gives so much AD that rushing IE is almost always superior except in a few fringe cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-04-29T02:31:55.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lane it affects the most is actually top lane.

The problem with having ONLY that one item prevent all dodges, even though it's the same in DotA, is that far fewer champions here could make use of the item (raw attack speed with pretty much no other stat, whereas MKB in DotA has raw damage, a bit of attack speed, and a mini-stun on-hit with more damage and a 35% proc rate, making it fairly reliable), and so it was inefficient to get it since it was only valuable against ONE champion, another difference with DotA, wherein there's a couple champions with dodge straight-up built into their kits, as well as accuracy reductions functioning similarly that MKB also countered. \n\nIn short: Dodge was removed because there was much less counterplay, and it completely invalidated your actions that led up to the dodge, while crit has numerous counters and invalidates nothing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZPIN2WIN","date":"2015-04-28T18:46:43.418+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't see a problem with that, if melee carries turn out strong after crit rework they can make it so that {{item:3031}} & {{item:3104}} unique passives don't stack.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2015-04-28T19:10:30.906+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":9,"body":"Agreed completely.

A crit rework that derandomized crit wouldn't have to touch their DPS at all. If we changed crit to a %autoattack damage increase, it would have the exact same expected DPS that the current random crits have. Reworking crit could just be for the sake of removing randomness, not hitting damage. What are you trying to say here?\n\nI think the melee champions could be changed pretty easily. Yasuo is reliant on crit, but he isn't reliant on the RNG part of crit. He builds crit just because it is the best DPS steroid for him, not because he is trying to randomly get crits on people. You could change his to a % damage increase model easily without losing any part of his feel and without hurting him at all. Exactly the same DPS, which is all Yasuo cares about.\n\nSimilarly, Gangplank pokes with the Q, but he doesn't need to have crit-fishing as a main mechanic. Just increasing the damage of his Q by an equivalent amount to what the expected dps of crit would be plenty, particularly if it happened alongside buffs and changes that he already needs.\n\nTryndamere is the only one who would really need changes, since he is reliant on the randomness of crit early in the game.
