They are pretty large after all, and will appear as critical strikes most of the time with the only thing making the crits noticable are a tiny symbol.\n\nAlso, there are critical strike runes.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-06-01T12:31:01.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between those is an exclamation mark following the damage; I've seen it, I also know when a hit did more damage than it should. \n\nI checked on his runes, he had nothing.
