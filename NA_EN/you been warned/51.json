People consistently counterpick top and mid laners, but why don't people ever think of grabbing someone who punishes the team for grabbing them.... I play Ali bot all the time, and blitz's are so afraid to help me initiate they rarely ever throw out their hooks.

The way support blitz's itemize, they get barely any gains from their passive, so the whole too tanky to kill thing is plain bullshit. I can see him being tough to deal with when you have no frontline, but this meta is all about tanks, people blitz's shit their pants from grabbing. The player base complains so much about champs with straight forward counters like Nasus tryndamere and blitz that I find it hard to even take them seriously, especially when champs like Leblanc exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-05-29T18:22:54.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it might be straight-forward to counter.

No other ability holds that much power.\n\nAnd be honest: wouldn't you like to see his Q get hit so he can get some free space in his power budget? Reduce the hitbox and range, make it like Varus' Q so that it slows you and increases in range while you charge up.\nThere, now we can revert the slow on W that Blitz players complain about so much.

However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing because Blitz is insanely fast for the first second of his W. This allows him to close the gap between him and the enemy laner very quickly, and in my experience it often catches the opponent by surprise.

Blitzcrank is very straightforward, and his skills don't have a ton of nuance to them (shield based on mana at low hp, hook, M.Speed/Atk.Speed increase, knock-up on next hit, AoE silencing ult w/ damage).
