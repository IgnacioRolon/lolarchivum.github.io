The ranged vs. melee argument is a load of crap.  Yes Howling Abyss is not a beacon of balance.  Being random its not really going to be.  Ranged champions had an edge yes, but this summoner with its long range, short coolldown and small projectile size takes that and throws it completely aside.  There is no place for a ranged champion anymore let alone a front line as there is no way to keep carries safe long enough to do anything. Lets be honest, sure poke hurt in ARAM, but its not like it completely put the opposing team on tilt if you knew how to build and work together.  Its not like Summoner's Rift where I can back and heal.  Death in ARAM is the ULTIMATE way to force a lopsided match as it denies experience and gold and the more deaths just keeps the snowball rolling.  The ability to abuse a 20s ability with assassin like items is waayy overpowered for such a small map where there is no returning to fountain.  There are already plenty of ways to reach the back line if you know how to work together and plan your team fights. It has taken what little semblance of balance that did exist in ARAM and throw it away.  The only ones who will succeed any more are those 100 to 0 champions or those that can live long enough to abuse jumping in an out.  Its not like an ranged is EVER going to abuse this mechanic... goodness he wouldn't live long enough to get enough AA's off.\n\nIf people had to get a bit closer and actually time this ability instead of just \"letting her fly\" and chasing after the first ADC hit by it I wouldn't care as much- in other words the range is way to long its ridiculous!!!  If the projectile was a bit bigger like a morg binding and instead of being able to squeeze in between minion waves easy I would not have a problem.  If people actually had to time the ability like an actual summoner I wouldn't have a problem.  Why should all assassins get a free insane gap closer on a 20 second rotation that quite frankly isn't that hard to hit when the ADCs whose only countermeasure is to try and dodge it... or 5 of them for that matter... on a map with already very little to no terrain to hide behind.  Even worse, champions can't block it with summoner abilities and I can't cleanse it which rules out Cleanse Summoner or a Quicksilver Sash.  There is nothing an ADC can do besides just rage quit because they can't get enough Auto Attacks to help there team.  At least an APC .. more likely bursty anyway... has access to Zhonya's that provide some protection to opposing Mark/Dash skill.  Hence just more proof that the summoner caters even more to bursty cooldown champs that make use of timely stealth Zhonya's and flash. If there was another summoner (namely that provided a sivir type shield) to prevent this ability... FINE!  This mindisight behind items and abilities should not \"Lets think only of engage.\" Lets at least be fair to those champions that require a bit of distance to get anything done and give them a way to react or live long enough to react.   And not have to do it every damn 20 seconds  or 4 seconds if I have to account for the whole damn enemy team.\n\nYou want this ability, fine, lets just put flash on a 30 second cooldown in aram and call it done.  At least then an ADC with flash can react and counter the damn thing and get off a few auto attacks instead of just being jumped on in the beginning of EVERY team fight because you hit A) them B) the minion close to them or C) the ally close to them.  Or B put this ability on a 75 second timer instead of 20.  There ... 4 of these per 1 flash defensive cooldown per champion and not 15- this still doesn't help when the assassin hits you and stealths back but it at least shrinks the pool of champions that can one shot safely.  If you manage to 2 of the 4 during a persons flash down then you deserve your kill.  An ADC shouldn't have to weave and dodge one every 4 seconds of gametime to stay safe.  That's just a ludicrous mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"TelekniTech","date":"2015-05-04T00:35:44.441+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":5,"body":"-Call ranged vs. melee argument a load of crap.\n\n-Give perspective from ADC side.\n\nRanged bias 3 confirmed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-05-04T15:09:02.361+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"Stopped at \"There is no place for a ranged champion anymore.\" Because we all know that's not true.

Anyway...\n\nARAM is inherently unbalanced, teamcomps are random, ARAM poke accounts are less important, blah blah blah. You know that stuff. We all know that stuff.\n\nI agree that the Mark spell gives assassins and heavy engage champs even easier engage. I understand your point that they can Dash to a minion then use their kit's gap closer on you. (Hell, I did it as Tolan, against Zyra plants).\n\nI disagree that it's game-breaking, or game-warping. And I'll explain it the scope of your post (that I still argue agrees with me, but anyone can twist a statement to their desires).\n1. Dodging snowballs is easy. Not like \"wow you suck you can't dodge a snowball afk\" easy. But relatively easy.\n2. That said, you can watch the snowballs fly at minions. If you see it heading toward a minion you're close enough to, it's really no different than laning against Irelia. Except everyone now has her Q. Inconvenient at best, OP on the right champions (Katarina maybe) at worst.\n3. Hide under tower at all times. I understand the sarcastic point here. No one does that in ARAM, especially with how weak the towers are, and brush located so close. But on that topic, if you're a squishy ADC/mage, you can use the brush between outter turrets to your advantage when poking, and hope your team peels in teamfights. If you're Sivir or Kog'Maw below level 6, yeah you'll probably die when they engage on you. If you're longer ranged like Cait or Xerath (yes I'm using extremes) it shouldn't be hard to position.\n3a. Random teams in ARAM, who knows who each will get, blah blah blah.\n4. 20 sec CD gap closer with ridiculous range. The true damage is hurts the most on this IMO. I've literally snowballed on champions after getting snowball kills. That's weird. But 20 seconds. That's a decent window of safety. I'm not expecting anyone to know exactly who threw the 3 snowballs you just dodged, but it's safe to assume that's a decent time to poke. And on engaging? If it's your job to engage, you're most likely willing to take snowballs to the face. (Unless Ori/Sona, etc., I guess).\n\nAs for my original point: ARAM heavily favored range champions since its official implementation. (Maybe before, I didn't play it much back when it custom exclusive). Assassins were strong too, but not auto wins by any means. Now, melee champions without hard engage/poke have a free tool they can use to their advantage. Unless you become that fed Katarina or Zed, it's not game-breaking. On that note, we do have defensive itemization for that, but admittedly it may be an issue. Or not, it's random.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-05-05T16:42:44.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I agree with all of your points to an extent, but not enough to actually think the summoner spell doesn't need a nerf.\n\n1) The projectile should be more visible. Plus, there's already a LOT of shit flying around in ARAM. Adding 5 enemy projectiles to the mix gets really old really fast.\n2) This links to point one, the snowballs can be hard to keep track off. Plus, the fact that you need to be wary of your own minions because really tedious. You've compared this to laning against Irelia, but I feel like that's not an accurate representation of the situation for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, when laning against Irelia, it's (usually) a 1v1 of two bruisers. Let's for a moment forget the inherent abusive nature of top lane when one opponent gets a lead and focus on the fact that USUALLY it's two guys from the same class who beat on each other. Snowballs, especially on tanks, enable the initiation of team fights. That's a completely different story.\nSecond, you actually need to be wary of every single minion that is not near death. That's a HUGE difference between watching which minions are close to death and not stepping near them to stay out of her ideal engage (Q to minion, E when appropriate, have Q up for follow up when you start creating some distance) and force her into a not ideal one (Q-Q so it's not up when you create some distance).\nThird, there is a massive difference in engage range.\n3) Like you said, certain squishy champions can hide under tower, but what about all those that can't? What, we're just gonna expect them to never interact with the minon waves until it reaches their own tower? That's just as bad as saying ''Oh, you're melee? Go hide far away before I poke you down to 10% health''.\n4) I don't really think 20 seconds is all that big of a window, tbh. It's less than the respawn time of minions. I also think the true damage is kind of out of place, but mostly I think the problem with this summoner spell lies with the risk-free nature of it. When you miss a snowball you don't feel like it's a loss of a resource. You just try again in 20 seconds. When you miss a Flash, you feel like a complete fuck tard and you have to play differently for up to FIVE MINUTES. Now of course I'm NOT saying Mark/Dash should have a cooldown nearly as high as Flash's, but when you miss one you need to feel like you've fucked up. It shouldn't be about throwing a snowball and then hoping you can make something of what happens when it hits. You should have to put some thought into where to throw them.\nYesterday I played a game as Jarvan and I would just throw it out all the time. Oh, I hit them under tower and I can't engage? Bleh, who cares I'll throw another one in 20 seconds until something works out for me. IMO that's not how summoner spells should work.\n\nAs for the imbalance of ARAM, I think that a balance between champion CLASSES can be achieved without too much effort. Honestly I cannot for the life of me figure out why the mana regen aura has not been nerfed yet, for example. It's what makes poke such a problem in the first place. A semblance of balance should be a goal, IMO. It's a mode for fun. There's NOTHING fun about rolling a useless champion, whether they are melees living in a poke dominated world or ad carries living in an engage frenzy.\n\nAlso, last thing I wanna say is that I think it's sad that Mark/Dash was implemented without much thought. It obviously benefits champions who didn't need help in the first place ({{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:238}} ) more than champions who did ({{champion:122}} {{champion:86}}). I think that in itself is a sign that it needs more tuning or flat out be removed in favor of a summoner spell that actually does help those who need it most instead of those who just abuse it without needing help in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-05-05T16:50:57.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean, on each point.

All The snowball did is shift the balance of power. Even still, eve is stronger because of the snowball. Still bad, but not as bad. The playing field is more even with everyone being stronger here. Because it gives everyone counterplay, and everyone an engage. \n\nThere is no such thing as a single ability that will be balanced for everyone. What snowball did is brought a *lot* of trash tier champs up, even while elevating top tier ones slightly. It is beatable, it has counterplay, and (imo) makes aram fun as hell because there aren't really unbeatable comps anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-05-06T19:12:45.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo's primary role is Marksman and his secondary role is assassin\n\nStop using the trash system Riot has all but forgotten about and use your logic to determine which champions fill what roles.

Certain specific champions will always be weaker on the map, yes, but that doesn't mean that poke mages have to be overpowered (that could have been fixed a LONG time ago) or that tanks with snowballs have to be overpowered. Yes, it takes some work but since ARAM is NOT a temporary game mode I am of the opinion that it deserves more general balance efforts than ''Let's shift who is blatantly overpowered''. \n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again : ARAM is a mode for fun.
