There has to be a cutoff point lol\n\nIt doesn't have to be a specific rank, say 1700 MMR; if you're under it, you play with 4 other people. If you're above, you're the \"raid boss\". ( you can somewhat calculate MMR on op.gg and lolking right now, in case you're wondering )\n\nThere can be a formula for gold income: If 5 players' MMR is 3 times higher than the enemy, he gets 1.5x gold income.\n\nThis can be further balanced with experimentation, if the solo player winrate turns out to be low then they can buff the gold income number/multiplication cap from 3 -> 2.5 and so forth. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
