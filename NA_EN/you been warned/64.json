To list them:\n\nA)Old-Zilean could do 640 base damage plus 1.8 AP worth of damage of targeted damage as pure burst from 700 range in .25s.  Vladimir's Q 230 base and .6 AP worth of damage at 600 range.  At level 9.  One of these things is not like the other, man.\n\nB)Targeted spells become more toxic with range and less toxic with game time.  A targeted nuke in a teamfight is *WAY* less toxic than a proportionally relevant targeted nuke in the laning phase.  This is why Ryze had to be reworked.  Vladimir, unlike most, is very late-game oriented, and thus, his early game is focused around surviving and farming, not bullying, which is why he can be \"healthier\" with a targeted nuke than others.  His Q is also rather short ranged, a feature that means he opens himself up to a lot of gap-closers in order to use it offensively.\n\nC)Vladimir lacks decent burst at *EVERY* point in the game.  His 1s burst, even with a fully stacked E, is 616 base + 1.176 AP damage.  That's pathetic.  He'll never, ever, ever burst someone to death.  He needs *TIME* to kill people, and without, they either can kill him back or get to the safety of shields and peel before he finishes them off.  Even Ryze didn't suffer this problem, as old-Ryze could QWRQEQ someone and deal pretty respectable damage in the space of cast times plus 1.1s(between the 2nd and 3rd Q).\n\nI'm not saying Vladimir is 'healthy', but he's definitely more healthy than old-Zilean.","replies":[{"poster":"SUPER RQ INCOMIN","date":"2015-05-17T08:35:06.267+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"My ass, I'd play against old zilean a zillion times before playing against toxic ass vlad in lane.\n\nZilean's combo costs him 4 fucking spells, E->Q->W->Q Zilean is fucking oom if he has to do this all the time, not to mention he had one of the lowest hps and armors in the game back then.

Pick any of these champions {{champion:63}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:112}} or {{champion:154}}  The chose is really up to you, any of them will absolutely destroy Vlad. \n\n2. Take either {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}}  or {{summoner:14}}. If Vlad is any kind of decent he'll take Flash + Ghost (I used to say this was dumb until I tried it and lemme tell you, I'll never be going back with the exception of extreme cases like they're building a bd or early drag team and I need TP) That frees you to have the teleport advantage, bring ignite to wreck his already bad early game, or bring Flash and just flash away every time he tries to actually fight since he has no way to keep up with you. \n\n3. Build any of these items first. {{item:3153}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3211}} {{item:3155}}  or of course {{item:3165}}. I would bet money that at least half if not most of the people complaining about Vlad are the ones that build absolutely nothing to counter him. Are you a tank? Build {{item:3211}} first item and all your troubles are gone! Are you an AD champion? Good news! You've got multiple options with {{item:3155}}  and {{item:3153}}! A mage top? Awesome! You can either build {{item:3151}} or {{item:3165}} or both for maximum Vlad fucking! \n\n4. Play aggressive. The healing might be intimidating, but I assure you, it starts out on an extremely long cooldown. 10 seconds. That's 10 seconds you could be dealing damage while he can't. I'm sure you can do more than the 15-70 health his Q heals for early game. So be aggressive early on and see my next tip for why this doesn't always work for you.\n\n5. BUT MAOKAI, I LISTENED TO YOUR ADVICE AND WAS AGGRESSIVE AND IT WORKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT THEN HE CAME BACK AND WRECKED ME BECAUSE I COULDN'T DIVE HIM THIS TIME! Well children, that's because of tip number 5: Learn when you have to stop being aggressive. If you're like me, when you're ahead, you feel like nothing will stop you no matter how stupid you play. That shit doesn't fly against Vlad. He's got two peaks, level 9 and level 18 when he's full build. The one we're gonna talk about is level 9. This is when his Q is on its lowest CD, he should have his vamp item and maybe even his spirit visage by now, and this is his time to shine. But you're all hyped up because you went aggressive early on, you're 3/0 he's 0/3 and you guys even got a dragon all thanks to your ability to use teleport while he was unable. Things are going great! Let's keep it goi- oh no. Vlad just killed me. Wtf so broken I only tried to all in him while he was full health under his tower while building nothing to counter him! Wtf is this champion so dumb, I hate Vlad nerf pls. \n\nThis is basically half the people that play against Vlad. The other half don't go aggressive early on and just get tower dove because they let Vlad poke them down with no retaliation. You, the readers of this post, need to break the mold. Go aggressive early on, then when it gets to mid game and that Vlad has a couple items under his belt, do not try to fight him. Use your brains, draw him into fights he can't win, bait him, Hell, if you're playing any of those champions I mentioned and build any of the items I mentioned, you probably can beat him at his power spike, if that's the case, feel free to keep going as aggressive as you want. Just know your limit. Know when he can win the fight and know when you can't (and run using the mobility God gave you and took away from Vlad). \n\nSix. I believe this will be the final piece of advice I give you guys. Teamfighting against Vlad. Vlad may not bring CC, but he does bring quite a bit of damage, and the ability to stall off dying like no other. So, that being said there are a few ways to beat him in teamfights, the place where he excels. 1. Don't bunch up. If he can only get 1 or 2 of you with his ult, that significantly increases the chances of you winning the fight. If he gets all of you then you should see the next sentence of this paragraph. 2. If his ult hits a bunch of you, DISENGAGE, I REPEAT DISENGAGE. (I can't help but think of that one scene from The Incredibles when I say that, good times) Anyways, if a lot of you get hit with the ult, let's say 3 or more, just leave the fight. I don't know about the rest of Vlad's team, but Vlad sure as hell isn't going to catch up to you guys. Add Janna and Nami to the list of champions that beat Vlad just because of their ability to choose when fights happen. 3. Slap an ignite on Vlad (or if you built Morellos you don't even have to do that) and focus the hell out of him. Without his healing he dies pretty damn fast. 4. Backdoor, no one on their team has teleport. 5. Ward up and catch the enemy team while they're missing a champ, or catch that missing champ. \n\nThat's it folks, that's how you deal with Vlad. Very complicated I know, but it all starts with you picking just one of the like 30 champs that beat him in lane, and building the right items.","replies":[{"poster":"EffectFX","date":"2015-05-18T10:20:29.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You picked several champions that a competent **(and by incompetent I mean putting themselves into a position where they take poke/trades they can't heal back/Building pure glass cannon and expecting to survive some negative matchups)** vlad shouldn't have any problem dealing with or that are purely 50/50.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keyoshi","date":"2015-05-18T04:19:30.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we NEED point and click abilities, You know how much harder it would be to kill adcs in this game?
