It's better to have double cooldown and actually be able to cast spell than not even be able to do it. If heal would be left for use in solo lane, such long cooldown is justified, as that heal is quite strong, especially when you take into consideration Morde passive that is already giving him a lot of sustain (in such scenario, shorter cooldown would be a reward for using W on ally). But, if Riot decided to take away heal when self casting W (if they even decide to let Morde self cast it), then cooldown should not be doubled, with heal being reward for duo laning (with full exp and double damage Morde already gets when being duo).

The general idea, however, is that making a champion a sort of pseudo-ADC means you can weaken their early game, improve their scaling, and make them dependent on their team.  This allows them to build into their strengths later in the game and become the team's powerhouse, without being oppressive early on.  This is done in degrees, of course.  The hypercarries are much less effective early game, while the more bully ADC's fall off a little.  Still, ultimately, even late game, they will be doing a lot of the actual carrying, because they'll be the ones hurting the towers the most, and they still won't be able to stand toe-to-toe with the true early game bullies.\n\nThe Morde changes did effectively make him dependent on his team.  That is an absolute requirement to force someone into a duo lane, and so that is the aspect CertainlyT focused on primarily.  The changes to his W are very effective for their intended purpose.  The problem is that the rework failed on the other two aspects.  Morde's early game is still oppressive, and his late game is not, even with a good build.  His win rate in the ADC position on champion.gg shows that he is an extremely dominant force early, winning a whopping 60% of games that don't last much longer than the surrender timer.  His win rate late game is abysmal, however.\n\nI understand that, as a melee champion, he needs more help early than the ranged carries do, and the tradeoff for that is his late game efficacy, but the numbers suggest that both were taken to the extreme.  They should make him weaker early, improve his scaling a little, and see where that leaves him.  Putting more power into the dragon in later ranks of the ult would give a clear objective and window of power for both his team and the opponent to exploit.  The only thing that would really remain to be seen is if there is ANY point at which his early game still leaves him viable without being overpowered.\n\nThat is where the greatest concern lies, largely because it is the same problem old Morde had.  That line between viable and overpowered simply didn't exist for solo lane Morde.  If it also does not exist for duo bot Morde, he'll be in need of a full-blown rework.
