Maintaining the 90% slows until a teammate slows the target.\n\n-_-\n\nEdit 2: examples of the formula's implication to clarify: {{champion:29}} casts a rank 5 W on a target, he then auto attacks the target while he has a {{item:3022}}. The calculation to determine the root goes as follows: W = 45% slow debuff, {{item:3022}} = 30% slow debuff. 45% + 30% = 75%. 75% > 75% FALSE. \n\nTherefore the target is slowed as on live.\n\nanother example with a stronger slow: {{champion:21}} casts a rank 5 E on a target, she then auto attacks the target while she has an {{item:3025}}. The calculation to determine the root gives: E = 65% + {{item:3025}} = 30%. 65% + 30% = 95% > 75% TRUE, MERGE DEBUFFS INTO ROOT. USE LAST APPLIED DEBUFF.\n\nTherefore using the duration of {{item:3025}}, the target is rooted for .75 seconds.\n\n-_-\n\nEdit 3: created a post in the comments mentioning champions that can have abuse cases with the system, upvote so everyone can see :)\n\n\n\n-_-\n\n\n\n**CLARITY**: in order for players to understand and take advantage of proposed formula, a small visual change must be done.\n\nCurrently on live, when a champion is slowed they leave **Yellow tracks** beneath them as they walk. This formula can be further improved by changing the color of the tracks to **Red** when a target is \"_Critically Slowed_\", meaning that they have a 40%+ slow debuff applied to them.\n\nThis way both the slower and the slowed target understand that a root can be performed with a good slow followup.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-04-12T05:25:02.990+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why not just have slows reduce the speed of dashes? One of the big advantages of gapclosers in fights is that they grant temporary immunity to most kinds of CC, and having crowd control affect them as they would normal movement would allow champions dependent on their own crowd control to use it more reliably. Stacking slows into roots would give anyone with soft CC the ability to transition to hard CC, which has a completely different set of gameplay implications (soft CC only reduces movement, hard CC denies movement options outright).","replies":[{"poster":"mi ramfan","date":"2015-04-12T20:02:30.259+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doing this requires a ton of animation work, isn't visually clean, and just makes the game clunkier without much actual gain in terms of counterplay. \n\nI mean, let's say J4 is ulting you. Do you really think that slowing him mid gap closer will make a difference in whether you live or die? He's still jumping on top of you regardless of whether he's slowed or not, it just takes like 3 frames longer and looks jankier if you slow him mid jump. \n\nGap closers are so fast in general (in fact, that's the freaking point of them, they're faster than walking) that reducing their speed with slows would require an incredible amount of skill to do on reaction and only slow them down by a few frames. All this change would do is make the game clunkier without actually solving the issues you're unhappy with.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-04-12T20:40:49.269+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, having slows affect dashes would require dash animations to be fluid regardless of their speed, but then again, we have attack speed and movement speed in the game, both of which affect character animations, along with dashes that already scale with movement speed (on {{champion:54}}  and {{champion:157}} ). I also think that would offer valid opportunities for counterplay. Suppose you dash through a pool of Mega Adhesive or Glacial Storm: right now, you'd dash through them as if they didn't exist, but with the above change you'd be affected by the slow as you'd pass through it, which would reinforce the role of both those objects as persistent zones of crowd control. You'd be able to use the extra time offered by a slowed dash to jump out of the way (if they're dashing towards you) or catch up to them (if they're dashing away from you). I don't think Cataclysm is a good counter-example to this because {{champion:59}} is immune to crowd control while using it anyways. By contrast, {{champion:429}} would be a great example of how such a change could allow for more consistency: right now, her infinite dashes allow her to completely ignore slows when in effect, which makes her a pain to deal with when you're a kiteable champion with only soft CC ({{champion:2}}, for example). Having slows affect her Martial Poise would allow for CC to interact better with her, and offer low-mobility champions more opportunities to catch up to her.\n\nIn the end, gapclosers are basically another form of movement with a few cool bonuses (you get to move over walls and sometimes other units). Temporary CC immunity shouldn't be one of those bonuses, especially since it's applied pretty inconsistently (why is displacement the only form of crowd control that affects dashes?). Slowing someone mid-dash should offer feedback immediately, rather than after the dash ends, and would reduce the stigma of dashes as get-out-of-jail-free cards in fights against less mobile opponents.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"draqxqard","date":"2015-04-12T05:50:54.130+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think what you mentioned is a good idea, but it will have to slow speed of dashes significantly for it to be meaningful counterplay.\n\nI like both ideas a lot, slightly leaning towards the root because well; screw mobility creep.\n\nIf the slow -> root cap was reduced to 65%, nerfing outliers.
