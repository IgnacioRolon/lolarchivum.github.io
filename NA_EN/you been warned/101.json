Old champions were limited because of what the game could handle at the time of their creation. They are all more binary because there wasn't the ability to add these complex, interesting mechanics to them. I'd much rather have more unique abilities that we are getting instead of slightly different versions of a skill shot with an AoE ability and a big burst ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-01-04T21:17:52.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They sell overloaded kits so people buy them.

Jayce on the other hand can duel, siege and potentially splitpush.\n\n{{champion:99}}  is an AP sniper mage who can deal a substantial amount of damage to people at a distance roughly equal to about a quarter of the map. {{champion:126}} is an AD poke champion with the ability to dive targets at melee range. The two have very little in common in terms of strengths, weaknesses and abilities. {{champion:101}} , {{champion:115}} and {{champion:161}} would make better subjects for comparison with Lux, and you'd be better off comparing Jayce to the likes of {{champion:150}} , even though they still have a *huge* number of differences.\n\n\nWhile more recent champions tend to be better-designed than old ones, which makes sense as Riot builds upon previous experiences to try and improve future content, I don't think champions are designed to outperform previous ones. {{champion:412}} does more overall than {{champion:53}} , for example, but even the best Thresh hook combo doesn't kill targets as hard as a Blitz hook on the carry. {{champion:268}} has amazing utility in the form of his gapcloser, self-shield and literal wall of soldiers, but doesn't have {{champion:10}} 's heal, resistance shred and invincibility, or {{champion:61}} 's team knockup and allied shield. {{champion:236}} has massive mobility, but doesn't have {{champion:81}} 's range and poking power, or {{champion:104}} 's burst and tankiness. You're right that older champions generally tend to be picked for a few of their strongest abilities (Blitz's hook, {{champion:19}} 's ult, {{champion:39}} 's passive) than for their entire kit, but I think that just reflects an older design philosophy that put a lot of power into a champion's \"signature ability\" instead of spreading it across their whole kit. Despite this, newer champions, or even reworked champions, tend to fill a stronger niche, so they get picked more for their overall contribution to their team than just a few parts of their ability set.\n\nI think it's also worth mentioning that while newer champions do tend to have more mechanics, they're not overloaded, since they have clear strengths and weaknesses and fill a specific niche. In fact, the most overloaded or weakness-deprived kits tend to be on older champions ({{champion:64}} is the biggest offender, but there's also Irelia , {{champion:5}} and {{champion:60}}).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2015-01-04T18:18:15.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Azir is broken as fuck because of his magic damage scaling, not for his utility.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-01-04T21:14:57.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean being able to do a million things like lane bully top, siege and resurrect towers.
