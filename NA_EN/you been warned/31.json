But give it a much more useful build path. \nGenerally, the champions who rush tiamat also at least slight AP ratios. And the entire reason why atmas was never bought by people, was because it was armor+crit. Very champions would benefit from such a strange stat combo. \n\nAlso, keepers armguard is a great defensive item :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-02T00:51:30.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you want it to be broken and lose functionality, got it.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-04-02T01:50:41.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not broken, cleave proc to secondary targets deals 60% -> 100% of total damage.

If you're buying it, you're buying it on top of the botrk/{{item:3091}}. Which is a squishy/carryish build style with clear strengths & weaknesses.\n\nSure, it will give on-hitters more damage late game.
