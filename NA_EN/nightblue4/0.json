I still have to work on my mechanics, but can still crunch the numbers for all of you who don&#039;t want to do this yourself. This post is for you if you are looking to level up an account, improve your skills, and get rune pages as quickly as possible . . . all without paying a penny! All you need to do is follow these three easy steps. I&#039;ll give the TL;DR first, but if you want the real information then read the whole post.\n\nTL;DR\n1. Play \"Free to Play\" Champions\n2. Buy a couple of them that you enjoy playing, but remember to save your IP for\n3. Tier 3 Runes which you can start buying at level 20. You will need a minimum of 18450 IP to properly fill your two pre-given rune pages. Now for the real post . . .\n\n1. Play the \"Free to Play\" Champions to learn their mechanics and basic item builds. You do this by reading about the champion you choose before the game starts on a website such as http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki . It is good to keep in mind your damages and mobility at any stage in the game and this website has all the information you need. You can also look at pro player builds on http://www.lolpro.com/ . I highly recommend looking at these links before playing a champion. **Bonus points** if you open up a custom game and level your champion to 6 to practice your abilities and animations. You can quit the custom game with no repercussions. Then you are ready to take your champ to normals.\n\n2. After playing at least 20-25 champions, a few times, if you find one you like save the IP to buy it. You will enjoy the game a lot more if you know a champion inside and out and have fun with her kit. Keep on playing free to play champions, too. Just know that you have your trusty favorite to fall back on! Don&#039;t buy too many champions (no more than 4 or 5) until you have gotten enough IP for your rune pages; which brings us to our next section . . .\n\n3. For a basic, all-purpose Tier 3 rune setup you will need 18450 IP\nYou will need flat health and armor seals, magic resist glyphs, attack damage and magic penetration marks, and attack damage and ability power quintessences. Buy these runes.\n\nArmor Seals\t205x4\t= 820   IP\nHealth Seals\t820x5\t= 4100 IP\nMR Glyphs\t205x9\t= 1845 IP\nAD Marks\t205x9\t= 1845 IP\nAD Quints\t1025x3\t= 3075 IP\nM. Pen Marks\t410x9\t= 3690 IP\nAP Quints\t1025x3\t= 3075 IP\n\nTOTAL:\t\t\t\t   18 450 IP\n\nThis way, make two pages: Both of these pages should have your health, armor and MR seals; your page entitled \"Attack Damage,\" or \"AD\" should have all the attack damage marks and quints, while your \"Ability Power,\" or \"AP\" page should have all the magic pen marks and AP glyphs. You can buy more runes and rune pages as needed to optimize your pages for the champions you like to play. http://www.lolpro.com is also a good site to help figure this out.\n\nThat&#039;s all for today, Summoners.

Our focus is going to primarily be on the early game because if you're still learning the game it's better to have a more forgiving setup rather than a mid-late game oriented rune setup. So we’ll deal only with the flat HP and armor seals for simplicity.\n\n In order to address both of your points, we need to look at the definition of \"armor\" in league of legends.\n\n**1 point in armor --> 1% more effective HP against auto attacks and physical damage**\n\nNow let's take three examples:\n\n\nXerath (Mid lane Mage, Support)\nHealth: 514-1874; Armor: 21.9-81.4; MR: 30\nJinx (Marksman)\nHealth: 518-1912; Armor: 22.9-82.4; MR: 30\nCho'Gath (Mid lane Mage, Top lane Tank, Jungler)\nHealth: 574-1934 (Plus Feast Passive); Armor: 28.9-82.4; MR: 32.1-52.4\n\nNow we'll look at what happens if we use 9 seals of each:\n\nFlat Health: 81 Total HP\n\n\nFlat Armor: 9 Armor --> 9.37% increased HP against auto attacks and Physical Dmg.\n\nNow for the table below, we assume that we’re carrying 9x glyphs of flat Magic Resist. It lists the effective HP against different types of damage like this:\n\nChampion|Effective HP against Physical DMG (Armor Seals)|Effective HP against Magic DMG (Armor Seals)|Effective HP against Physical DMG (Flat HP Seals)|Effective HP against Magic DMG (Flat HP Seals)\n\n\nXerath Level 1\t | 699 | 781 | 740 | 904\nJinx Level 1 | 704 | 787 | 753 | 910\nCho'Gath Level 1 |\t781 | 872 | 873 | 995\nXerath Level 6 | 1603 | 1588 | 1593\nJinx Level 6 | 1644 | 1493 | 1627 | 1616\nCho'Gath Level 6 | 1789 | 1561 | 1765 | 1810","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WhiskerWow","date":"2015-04-28T14:00:59.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually remember why I bought all the armor runes was so I could jungle. :P And I remembered that armor seals got nerfed with the rune rework.\nThanks for answering!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2015-04-27T21:04:27.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shouldn't those be scaling health not flat health","replies":[{"poster":"nightblue4","date":"2015-04-27T22:57:37.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good point, Left for Zed. The answer is, it depends. Remember, this guide is for people who are just starting the game. Scaling health yellows are fantastic for zone control mages that can keep their distance at the beginning. Think, {{champion:101}} , {{champion:26}} , {{champion:115}}, {{champion:99}} etc. However, flat health will benefit **everyone** to some extent and, therefore are best for doing an initial rune page. You can add the scaling health runes to more specific, champion/role based pages later on after you grind out the IP for more rune pages. As stated before, this guide is mostly for people who are getting started, and/or don't have the funds to buy tons of rune pages {{item:3078}}  and IP boosts {{item:3301}} .","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-27T22:11:20.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends entirely on champ, which is why flat is safer for general pages. Some champs need early while others (or in specific matchups) can benefit more from scaling, this is just the safest and most cost efficient rune pages you can have. basically the jack of all trades rune pages.\n\n\nExample my rune pages for Jax/Irelia, one is 6 MR and 3 Mana regen while the other is 9 MR, same everything else, just for different lanes or purposes. Also depends on playstyle personally I am fine with having lower Hp and run scaling HP on almost all my rune pages.","replies":[{"poster":"nightblue4","date":"2015-04-27T23:00:39.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty Mezzie! :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Desmond Law","date":"2015-04-27T22:54:21.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheaper option to fill out one page:\nMovespeed Quints\nHybrid Pen Marks\nFlat MR Glyphs\nFlat armor seals\n\nIt has no focus on any class in particular, but provides stats that nearly everyone can use.","replies":[{"poster":"nightblue4","date":"2015-04-28T13:58:13.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The particular page that you mention is actually pretty well optimized for {{champion:4}} mid lane vs AP. The only change I would make for that particular rune page would be changing the flat armor seals to scaling health. However, even a flat AD page taken on an AP champion would be more efficient in terms of useful stats provided in general; ergo easier last hitting and auto-attack trading early, and therefore a better ability to get early items such as {{item:3027}} , {{item:3089}} , etc..\n\nRemember, though, that we're talking about getting the most efficient rune setup for the maximum number of champions for the least amount of IP as possible. I would never take that page as a marksman, for example. My early game would be so weak that I would lose lane as Jinx vs. Caitlyn on an opponent of equal skill. Your rune setup costs 16810, mine costs 18450. I daresay the more games you will win by having a stronger early game will more than likely offset the cost of runes unless you're a challenger smurf.
