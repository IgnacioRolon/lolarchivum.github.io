No answer in 20+ hours","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main account 'Suspicious Link' was hacked and transferred from NA to EUW by the hacker and changed my account name to 'SKT T1 IsSaOuI'. He changed my email, password, and charged $50 from my debit card (which the ccn didn't have to be verified because my email was verified, ironically) and has since played two ranked games on EUW with the new account name. I sent in a support ticket with obvious verification that this is my account but I still have no response and I desperately need help or else I'll need to cancel all of my debit cards and have to deal with bank overdrafts. My ticket number is #24071506.","replies":[{"poster":"Omastar","date":"2016-11-06T17:02:18.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are in the same boat brother.

We're definitely not leaving you out in the dust and will have an account specialist with you as soon as possible. We're pretty slammed with tickets due to the end of the season, therefore response times are a bit longer than normal. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1zNHSvcEYu","date":"2016-11-06T19:42:53.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's very unfortunate!\nI understand how frustrating this is but from my experience it takes them a few days to do anything. I had my smurf account hacked and saw it online playing Dominion (which I never played). Wouldn't of been a big deal if this smurf account didn't have the UFO Corki skin. You KNOW I contacted Riot as fast as I could. Gladly I didn't have any credit card info attached so I couldn't be charged, but it still took Riot about 3 days to recover the account for me. In the end though, I got it back and it is still secured and *mine*.\nThey've got a LOT of players to support, just kinda gotta be patient.","replies":[]}]}
