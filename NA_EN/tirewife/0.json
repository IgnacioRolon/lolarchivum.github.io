The one thing I think is the only problem in the alpha and the regular client, is that for me whenever i click on the store button, it always takes a really long time to load and I know it&#039;s not because of my wifi because everything else works perfectly, if you could just look into that it would be great","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-19T21:55:07.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great to hear you are loving it! Thank you for your support <3\n\nWe know the store is not as good as it could be, but we have a whole team dedicated to work on that. For the moment its going to be a little slow because we can't kill all of the old code yet. The store its trickier to move from the legacy client to the updated client and for now its shared by both. It is definitely something that is being worked on by several people.","replies":[]}]}
