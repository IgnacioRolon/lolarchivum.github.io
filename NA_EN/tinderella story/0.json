Don&#039;t tilt your team by making dumb excuses, blaming others, etc. Even if they aren&#039;t helping you (which is a valid concern), the fact of the matter remains the same: YOU DID LOSE YOUR LANE. How can you hope to improve your gameplay (or even win the current match) if you refuse to acknowledge your mistakes? It&#039;s absurd at how many people tilt off the planet when their team provides a mere tip (i.e. &quot;stop overextending&quot;). \r\n\r\nB-B-B-BUT SAYING &quot;WHAT A JOKE&quot; IS SOOOOOO NEGATIVE.\r\n\r\nActually?","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Lewd Witch","date":"2017-03-30T17:44:21.451+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Insults =/= Facts\n\n\"You're 0/6\" is a fact.\n\n\"What a joke\" is an insult,  and is unnecessary, plus it will never improve your games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-30T17:19:02.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"What a Joke\" is actually very negative.
