As for Varus builds, I've tried Lethality and crit and I gotta say, I prefer crit with him. MF is better with Lethality, and statistically other ADCs have better win rates with Lethality, but I still generally prefer crit builds.\n\nAs for \"people forget how strong his W is,\" his W is AP scaling. What are you building other than maybe Guinsoo's that would make that any stronger? Unless you're building full AP.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2017-03-05T20:04:28.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run scaling ap glpyhs and flat ad marks and quint is I think 1 scaling ap and 2 flat ad. Depends on what item sometimes it's essence, runaans , rage blade , rapid fire , boots aND nashors or blade of the ruined or lord dom as a build the last 3 items change at what you prefer. Other on hit I build nashors runaans rage blade cdr boots, blade of the ruined king and last item is either lord dom wits end(I rarely build this item) or hextech gun blade. With full stacks of rageblade and consumable your looking at 300 plus ad and 300 plus ap. Yah strong. Or you can switch last item to static shiv or rapid fire cannon. This item does double stack which is why I build it . \n\nEither build I always run same mastery and same runes. I always Max w first then it's your choice of q or e . Why w well for for on hit damage and boom 1 shot people for days. So yes the power of varus.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-03-04T23:01:10.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saltiny,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9ycbkVaU,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-03-04T21:11:42.063+0000)\n>\n> ADC's no longer utilize Autoattacks\n\nYou obviously haven't seen how powerful and scary a late game Vayne can get. Vayne can destroy any caster ADC with just a few AA's\n\nLook at other champions of the same class first before you make biased crap like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nipsahoy","date":"2017-03-04T21:48:48.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well he's not wrong actually.
