However, the focus here is your own negativity. There is no excuse for how you reacted, and we hold each player accountable for their own actions. Your general negativity ruins the game for other players and we cannot allow that. Giving up, verbal abuse, and being overly negative are reportable and bannable offenses. You displayed this attitude in the games you were flagged in.\r\n\r\n[21:39] ToxicShaco (Nocturne): if u dont play jg dont act like u know how to plz\r\n[21:41] ToxicShaco (Nocturne): its annoying\r\n\r\n[24:22] ToxicShaco (Nocturne): if it helps ur ego to blame me go ahead\r\n\r\nThis is all part of the general negativity that ruins the game for other players.\r\n\r\nThis restriction is the least severe penalty we give for this infraction, so you still have the chance to reform. However, if you continue to act in this manner, we will increase the magnitude of the punishment, up to and including a permanent suspension. If you find yourself in situations where you find that you want to engage other players who are being toxic, I seriously suggest you mute them instead. Alternatively, use the /muteall function at the start of the game to avoid any sort of toxicity in the first place. You can also grab the top of the chat box and completely drag it off the screen.\r\n\r\nIf you play through these restricted games before the season ends, you will still be able to earn season rewards, but you have to get through them before we turn off the queues! Good luck!\r\n\r\nIf you have any more questions, information, or concerns, please feel free to message me again and I will help you the best I can!\r\n\r\nKawaiiViking\r\nI wanna boop da snoot\r\nRiot Games Support","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-08T18:34:45.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am confused.
