After a match I just lost and tilted into oblivion in, the game refused to load the post-game stats. I had to restart the client. So I do and I get a login queue of seventeen THOUSAND. Normally login queue disappears immediately. Now I've been sitting here for 4 minutes-ish waiting for the thing to log me in. Is this for real? It feels like a gigantic bug, especially considering that it's Monday. Yes, it's a free day in many countries in Europe, still doesn't explain anything though. So, riot, what's going on? Bug or legit 17k people trying to log in? lmfao","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T21:05:47.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like we had a bit of a slip up behind the scenes, but the login queue should be fixed up now!

I'm in NA and called in sick but wanted to practice my Rakana and maybe try full tank instead of the usual ap shieldy Rakan. I can't login though. I just get this issue where it looks like it's about to log me in, I get the spinning wheel then it pops up saying cannot log in at this time. There's no login queue, just refuses to log me in. I've tried all 3 of my accounts, made sure my credentials are right, even changed the region and switched back to NA but no luck at all so far.\n\nEdit: Okay, so just after I posted this reply I see a warning icon saying they know people are having login issues xD I guess that answers the question.","replies":[]}]}
