After the 2nd match the stats screen wouldn't pop up, so I pressed skip stats, then I got disconnected from League entirely, and when restarting the client and trying to log in again, boom, \"Unable to connect to login queue\". \r\nBoth the client and the game are allowed through firewall, my antivirus, I've run as admin, tried the Riot support suggestions and did a full repair, too. And before anyone says connection issues, unable to connect to login queue to me sounds like the request to log user X into the service wasn't even processed because the moment the request reaches the server, the server spits an error back at the client. \r\nSo, if this ain't a server issue, can anyone help me out here?","replies":[{"poster":"VegetaZero","date":"2017-06-05T06:24:45.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm still getting this issue as well. League is allowed thru my firewall and antivirus, did the full uninstall and reinstall, repair, hard wired into my router (playing on my wireless hasn't been a problem ever but I gave it a shot anyway), ran it as admin and zilch. Been doing a back and forth with support for a while but their solutions aren't helping. I'm at my wits end. Haven't been able to play since the new client was crammed down my throat. I'm super frustrated. Can anyone offer a solution? I don't have ESSET btw so it's not that either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KumaraP","date":"2017-05-21T11:50:13.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also had the error: \"LoL new Client unable to connect to the login queue\". Even though i thought i did everything good and it was a Riot server issue it wasnt.\nAllready tried all Riot's solutions and they did'n work. After some debugging i did finaly resolved the problem myself..\n\nThe problem was with a configuration setting in the Esset Security Software. And it was a setting that did'n deactivate even while u fully disable the software (like temp. disable firewall).\n\nIn the Esset software you can enable Protocol Protection in the Advanced Settings menu. From then on the software starts controlling all SSL and TLS configuration's and every certificate that comes with it.\n\nI came to this while reading the Log: 2017-05-21T13-09-01_1968_LeagueClient.log\nI has the following line:\n000012.699| ERROR| lol-login| ALE-4C0F8C92 - FAILED_TO_COMMUNICATE_WITH_LOGIN_QUEUE - Plugin \"rcp-be-lol-login\" couldn't talk to \"https://lqak.euw1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queues/lol/authenticate\" because: 60 - \"Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates\".\n\nThis got me thinking that i let Certificates be mastered by the Esset Security software and not by Microsoft. And thus i started searching in the menu and found that i could deactivate that option. It's called Protocol Filtering and SSL/TLS-Protocol Filtering. Once i deactivated both of these settings. The issue was gone.\n\nSo this got me thinking, because at some point this did work. Even with the new client. Did something in security changed on the client? Remember the old client did work, new did 2 but after a certain change it didn. So i think Riot's higher level of security also needs attention in 3rd Security Software. \n\nHope this resolution can also help others with same kinda problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalfwayInsane","date":"2017-05-17T20:06:06.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been dealing with this issue for 3 days and I can't find any way of fixing it.
