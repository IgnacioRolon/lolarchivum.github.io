It's difficult to figure out what buttons do what. Is there a language pack available so I can play and understand what I'm doing while I'm over here on my new account? Or to transfer my current account and keep my english version of the client? Thank you for the support.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T18:42:14.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are language packs, but it's specific to that [region's supported language](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language).  If you are on NA, currently English is the only language available.  You would have to create a Japanese account and transfer specifically to that server in order to use a pack for that.  Japan does not support English, though.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Snipe I","date":"2017-10-10T07:27:54.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump. help?","replies":[]}]}
