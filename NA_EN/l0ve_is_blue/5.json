They are supposed to jump in and assassinate their target but by doing so they also expose themselves to danger.\n\nExamples of high risk/reward assassin would be {{champion:55}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:91}}  Let me explain why:\n\n{{champion:55}} Has to use her Shunpo (E) to get into the fight and burst someone down. If she succeed, she will be rewarded with refreshed cooldowns, and by the same occasion an opportunity to assassinate another target or shunpo out to safety. Because she took risks and succeeded, she is rewarded\n\n{{champion:121}} Just like Katarina, Kha&#039;zix has to use his mobility spell to get close to his target and he will get a reset if he succeeds.\n\n{{champion:91}}  Talon&#039;s blink is purely offensive and he has now way out if he uses it to go on an enemy. The only way for him to succeed is to out trade or kill his opponent, or else he puts himself in danger.\n\nThose are some example of assassins I love playing against because they need to take some sort of risk/decision making to be victorious.\n\nAnd then there is {{champion:238}} {{champion:7}} Those two can just burst you down and blink back to safety without you having time to react.\n\n{{champion:238}} Already has a great mobility skill, his W wich is a long range blink. And it&#039;s ok for an assassin to be mobile, it&#039;s something that defines them. But I don&#039;t understand why Zed should be able to blink to you, use his ult and then just blink back again because his ults has a recast?? This ability has: \n\n-A strong delayed burst damage\n-Immunity for 1 second\n-Empowers his abilities with shadows\n-Make him teleport to his target\n-Make him able to blink back at no cost.\n\nIsn&#039;t this a little too much? Why is Zed allowed to take no risk when he assassinate someone but for the 1 second it takes for him to use his Q+E+AA before he blinks back? What is the counterplay other than using Zhonya or being {{champion:127}} {{champion:105}} ? And even if he fails, he doesn&#039;t have any punishment! Yesterday I was playing {{champion:103}}  and was laning against a Zed. He ults me, and being the Faker I am, I charm him as soon as he appears behind me, but right after the charm ends he E+Q and blinks back to safety. He died because of the 2 turret shots he took and my ignite, but so did I. While I was almost full health under my turret. And this scenario is what happens to almost everyone laning against Zed since the most, if not all champions have only one hard CC ability (not counting ults) to try to stop him before he burst you down, and most of the time the CC isn&#039;t long enough for him to die since he can blink back right after it.\n\nLeblanc has the same concept, where she can burst/poke you and blink back in a second at no cost. Leblanc W is a dash, a blink and a high damage spell. And she can use it twice with her ult and blink back twice. What risk is she tanking when she W on you expect that you may hit her with one spell if you are lucky?\n\nI feel like those 2 propositions could help balance those champions:\n\nZed: Can&#039;t blink back with his ult. Make him chose if he wants to go in with his W or keep it to go out. His ult already brings him mobility in the form of a blink to his target over the huge burst damage it can bring. It shouldn&#039;t allow him to go back to safety considering he already has a blink in his kit.\n\nLeblanc: Give her a delay before she can W back, so that she has to be sure the wants to go on her enemy instead of just using her W without having to fear any retaliation.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Fuzzy Nugget","date":"2016-01-30T16:05:05.247+0000","up_votes":94,"down_votes":10,"body":"I dislike Assassins in general, but I agree with OP.","replies":[{"poster":"L0ve Is Blue","date":"2016-01-30T16:08:39.902+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":11,"body":"I'm ok with playing against assassins that require decision making, skills and dangerous gameplay like {{champion:103}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:76}} \n\nBut getting attacked by a {{champion:238}} or a {{champion:7}} and seeing them blink back to safety even if they failed makes me feel like whatever I do it will always be unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"IAMS4T4N","date":"2016-01-30T16:16:19.102+0000","up_votes":106,"down_votes":22,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lemon Graber,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=P6NE2hZQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-30T16:08:39.902+0000)\n>\n> I'm ok with playing against assassins that require decision making, skills and dangerous gameplay like {{champion:103}} \n\nhold it right there","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2016-01-30T17:50:46.264+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":10,"body":"People really need to stop comparing Ahri to Leblanc and Zed- Ahri is a mage first and an assassin second- she's not meant to be the same as the other assassins.\n\nAnd when did Ahri become such a bad thing?

The best assassins are good for their non assassin qualities, and the high risk, high reward model is counter intuitive for game health. \n\nTake Akali for example. She has almost no wave clear, and her dash was only good for engages and not disengages. Right now, she's considered complete trash. But I remember that she was considered broken or an auto win the very minute she reached level 6. \n\nThe reason I pick on Akali is partially due to the lack of wave clear. She's unable to catch up if behind because she can't farm fast enough. She's only good if she's able to farm champion kills. And that's inherantly a problem to game health, regardless of actual balance. But also the high risk, high reward model is extremely hard to balance across multiple levels of play. Akali was never widely picked in the LCS, (at least when I was watching) and yet, she was considered a complete pub stomper in YoloQ. As pro players understand how to make opportunities for such assassins extraordinarily risky, or completely non existent. \n\nNow when it comes to the likes of Zed and Leblanc. Give them a slight delay before you can return to your original position. (I think Zed already has this.) And shorten the window at which they can return to their position. Making them more vulnerable to CC.\n\nThough over all, I feel like Zed's ability to return to his shadows, is counterbalanced by the fact that he has to give up damaging you, and wasting his ult. And if he's doing that too often, all you would need to do in increase his Ult CD. \n\nLeblanc I think is the bigger problem. You don't really want to nerf her movement ability too much as it's also her primary wave clear ability. Though for her, I would decrease the speed of the dash. as that would also open more opportunities to CC her. I'm not sure, but for some reason, she feels binary in her tactics, despite the number of combos she can actually use. Her best combo is basically Distort into range, Q R, your opponent, and then throw you chain while you distort back.
