Time after time my client gets messed up, and in an attempt to repair it, I end up making the game unable to run. I think that the issue is fixed, so after champion select, I sit waiting for the game to load only to find that the game must be repaired. Does this happen to anyone else? I feel like there should be a way to detect if all your files are in order prior to loading into a ranked game.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Phil McGraw","date":"2018-01-12T08:59:23.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just happend to me.. Kinda pissing me off. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nI believe the reason is because i closed down the game before it finished downloading the other day. And now when i sat down to play it, it gave the bug splat and started repairing the game... But either way i wouldnt of' been able to play it if it didnt repair.. So i guess a Leave is imminent. Though it doesnt seem fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fær the shärk","date":"2017-12-04T03:41:04.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also want to play at my home like every body but i can't just because of BUG SPLATE and then when i try to connect to the game again another error tells me that i don't have internet connection and that makes many of my accounts got banned and i can't play at home any more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T23:30:56.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are your game files getting saved?  The patcher usually checks your files to make sure you're up to date, but might not discover a corruption until that specific asset is used.  It sucks this happened, though.  My suggestion would be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to perform a repair.  Test it in a custom game to make sure everything is in order, though!","replies":[{"poster":"TiltyMacTiltFace","date":"2017-08-19T16:53:19.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The repair tool does not stop this. It has happened more than 30 times to me and I have repaired MULTIPLE times.

Please look into an alternative that allows these things to NOT happen at the point of no return.

This issue happens over different computers that each meet the game requirements. What you fail to mention is that this happens to other users as well, and the frequency increases around your patches. Testing in custom? At what point? There is no predicting this crash. I could literally repair, go play 20 custom games and then a ranked game and I can't predict which one will crash. \nI fail to understand why I have to be my own computer hardware/software tech to solve a problem that follows support instructions and still experience a repeat of the same problem. \n\n> It sounds like game files might not be the culrprit in this case, so something else could be causing the bugsplat like bad drivers or hardware problems.\n\nBased on what evidence? Please elaborate what led you to that conclusion? I could easily say \"The problem sounds like it's on Riot's end\" and it would have the same meaning. Your solution once again is no solution at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TiltyMacTiltFace","date":"2017-08-19T16:52:32.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The repair tool does not stop this.
