Something must have messed up during your install.  I'd suggest downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and running a reinstall.  This will clear any old legacy files, add missing files, and get you to the most current version.

It did the same crap where it adds in this screen (even when I've been using the new client for a while now).    It also hasn't fixed the issue of not being able to use the Play button.
