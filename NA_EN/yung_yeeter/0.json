I already own Kayle and Riot Kayle so I was expecting the mystery skin. I was not able to see who I got before it disappeared and the game started. I checked my purchase history to see if I could find out that way, but it didn't show anything. What can I do to find out what I got?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T17:54:16.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The notification banner would have been for the anniversary icon.

I got the anniversary icon and i got the notification that I got a mystery skin. But before I could check who I got, I left champion select into the loading screen. That's why I think it glitched and I wasn't able to see who I got, or get one at all! Is there a last day that Riot is going to be sending out these mystery skins because I'm excited!","replies":[]}]}]}
