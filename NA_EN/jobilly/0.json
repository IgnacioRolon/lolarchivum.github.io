I mean not &quot;oh damn, xy is strong, I might be able to do this and that&quot; but &quot;HOLY FCK! Seriously, why is this champ allowed in free rotation? Yorick is banned there and yet, they are still in there regardless of how funkilling their kit is.&quot; The champs I describe here are what I see most often declared as imba/op or frustrating. If you want one added, tell me.\n\nThis post should serve as a collection of tips on how to deal with some of those champs. Those tips are general though and are aimed at Blindpick and Teambuilder, as you cannot counterpick in those. Now to begin. \n\n**If you also have tips, go on, comment on this, seriously, this collection should grow. If my tips are wrong, also tell them to be corrected _but also give a reason._**\n\n**In General:**\n\n* You are aware that your matchup is incredibly disfavourable for you like you are {{champion:27}} and your enemy a {{champion:67}}. But you also see that your midlaner is a {{champion:110}}  against a {{champion:157}} which is a tiny bit in disfavour of your friend. Think about trading lanes.  This will lead to both of you having a bit of a better time against both of them. Even if they trade too, they lose time traveling and you can too trade again.\n* Keep your wards up. I know pinks cost and you don't have greens anymore aswell as the ward trinket kinda scks right now (^^') but spending 75 g on something which might safe you and keep the enemy from making 450 g is worth it imo. There are spots you can put your pink in which hardly get visited by the enemy but still give you partly vision. You can also ward from behind walls into your bushes which makes it way safer for you.\n* LoL is and remains a teamgame. Communicate with your team and coordinate. Yes, you might be able to carry your team but don't rely on it and Rambo through this as you maybe hit the wall headfirst. Also try to keep the flame down in the chat as this will most likely down your teams motivation, get you on tilt and leading to you playing WAY worse than you usually do in a calm state of mind. Vent not through the chat if you need to.\n\n**Now to crack on with the specific lists:**\n\n{{champion:1}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* She can pretty much burst down any squishy with just Boots and a NlR.\n* Her stun comes in an instant and is 1.25 - 1.75 seconds long. (lvl 1/6/11)\n* Her spellrange surpasses any autoattackrange of any midlaner.\n* She has two possibilities to AoE Stun your team with ease.\n* She has low Cooldowns and has her stun up pretty fast if she farms with her Q.\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* You can see when the stun is up with a visible grey whirl around annie aswell as a buff icon in her statscreen when you have her highlighted. If she just used it or has stuff on cd aswell as only one charge on her stun, you have a small time window to exchange blows.\n* If you have a mobile jungler with cc, use that window to get to her as Annie is pretty immobile.\n* Don&#039;t attack from one side as she then will be able to stun and delete you both if she manages to pull a stun off.\n* In teamfights, try to not clump together too much or have tanks bait out the stuntibbers. (Tibbers Stunradius is roughly 300 units (290 but who knows))\n* Try to get her flash out of her. Be it through playing agressivly and applying pressure or baiting her flashtibbers BUT surviving it. Flash is one of her playmaking abilities like the infamous Flashtibbers. Flash has a 5 minute CD or 4 mins 15 seconds if she gets the distortion enchantment on her boots.\n* A {{item:3102}}  can block the stun if you're lucky so she has to \"waste\" an ability to pop your shield.\n\n{{champion:63}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* He has high damage and with the new deathfire keystone, he can wreak havoc on your team.\n* Extremely long ranged.\n* One of the longest singletarget stuns.\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* He has a bit longer CDs on his stuff, use that timeframe.\n* His only CC is his Q. Once he has wasted that or if you are not ablaze, you are possibly able to outtrade him.\n* He is immobile, thus weak to ganks and hard cc.\n* If he ults, don&#039;t stand close to anything it can jump to, if you manage that. Then it will lose a lot of damage.\n* You can {{item:3157}} his ult as it travels towards you to redirect it.\n* To take the priority of his ult on you out, as you might are ablaze, buy a {{item:3140}} to get rid of the blaze. This tip applies to AD champs.\n* Spellshields may block one bounce from his ult so {{item:3102}} is ok to buy as it also provides health to magicresist.\n\n{{champion:122}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* Tons of damage\n* Tons of tankyness\n* Tons of bleed\n* Tons of heals\n* Tons of slows\n* Tons of frustration\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Play passively, really. If you aren&#039;t 100% sure that you will outtrade him, which is pretty hard, don&#039;t engage him. You may wait out his Spin to win and then attack as this is pretty important in his rotation. (hue... the pun...)\n* Care hard as soon as he has phage, which will probably be his first/second item, because then his mobility increases as does his likelyness to hit his Q.\n* Apprehends range is 550 which is pretty much the AA range of most ADCs. It sometimes even doesn&#039;t have to touch you to hook you so, care hard.\n* If you are a bit tanky, build life over tons of Armor as he will penetrate most of it anyway. His ult also deals pretty much a set amount of damage which means it doesn&#039;t matter how much armor you have. That&#039;s why tons of life is more important than tons of armor against him.\n* If you decide to go to the shaft of dariuss Q, think about it beacuse then you WILL be i his zone of control which is roughly 500 units around him.\n* It isn&#039;t that hard for him to get 5 stacks onto you. So if he does, his tradepotential skyrockets and you will likely lose the trade. If you can, retaliate, if not, deal as much desperate damage to him as you can. Maybe one of your teammates can kill him off or you miraculously are able to kill him.\n* Get an {{item:3123}} if you AA every now and then or deal a bit of physical damage. It costs 800 gold and you can sell it later, but you will decrease his healing by a lot.\n* If you are an immobile meleechamp, I highly recommend freezing the wave in your favour if you can do that because you won't get away and true damage is true damage. His earlygame damage is high, his sustain is extreme. It is hard to get the best of him if he has his stuff up.\n\n{{champion:36}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His incredible sustain\n* His speed\n* His damage\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Get an early {{item:3123}} if you AA every now and then or deal a bit of physical damage. It costs 800 gold and you can sell it later, but you will decrease his healing by a lot and I mean a lot.\n* Poke him down\n* Get magicresist over life as his Q deals % current life damage with a minimum magic damage, like {{item:3155}}. \n* The less life he has, the more damage he deals with his E so be careful with that. His first hit will also deal increased damage. If you can wait or bait that out on a minion, you just evaded a hard punch/headbutt.\n\n{{champion:114}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her mobility.\n* She deals % life true damage with a &quot;minigame&quot;.\n* Her ult heals for a LOT of damage.\n* Her passive heals for a LOT of damage\n* She can literally riposte every single spell there is, even summonerspells.\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* She has relatively long CDs, but she gets half a reset on her Q if she hits something. Abuse this if she misses something.\n* She has relatively high mana costs on her and a pretty small manapool.\n* If you are a pokechamp, poke her... hard\n* She has no hard CC apart from her riposte so if you manage to bait this out somehow, you take a lot of threat out of her.\n* Be careful with hard CC as in turn she can use it against you with her riposte. If you are stunned against her, she has a high chance to damage you hard with your vitals.\n* Make her work hard for those vitals, meaning position yourself, so she has a hard time hitting them without risking too much. You can block them off by standing at a wall where the mark is when she tries to get it. She has to hit it directly for it to take effect.\n* If she hits a vital, she will gain movementspeed, making it easier to hit the other vitals or retaliate again. The vitals take about two seconds to reappear fully functionally. Use that time to move away or in the direction the mark is facing so it faces the opposite side of you from where Fiora stands.\n* The vitals will reset if you walk out of their range which is about 1300 units, which roughly covers about the distance between the edge of the top tower and the edge of the closest of the three bushes.\n* She doesn't have much waveclear before she gets her {{item:3074}}. After she gets this item, she will be harder to battle so use the time before she has it to battle her. Afterwards, contact your jungler to help you. Care that she won't get the double.\n* If she ults you you will be marked for 8 seconds. If you manage, get away from her as she will outdamage you. She will also gain movementspeed aswell as a heal if she manages to get all four vitals or if she gets one and you die. This is gamechanging as it will also heal her teammates and change a possible teamfight completely.\n* It is possible, if you're an AP champ, to {{item:3157}} about 1/3 of the time you are marked.\n* If you're an AD champ, get a {{item:3140}} to prevent the ult as it is a debuff on you aswell as resetting her passive.\n\n{{champion:105}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His mobility\n* His damage over time\n* His evasive nature\n* His damage in general\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* His Playful/Trixter (His E which deals tons of damage and makes him untargetable) has a relatively long cd at earlier levels but hets down to 8 seconds at lvl 5. If he wasted it, he lost tons of damage on one hand aswell as damage mitigation and mobility on the other.\n* His Q makes him dash a fixed distance which either helps him escape in a Yasuo fashion or engage you. You can use the fixed distance to anticipate a skillshot you have.\n* If he ults, you are able to flash into it to skip over it. It&#039;s risky as you get closer to him but you won&#039;t suffer the ult and the damage steroid Fizz will get if it connects. If you are hit by it, try your hardest not to involve your teammates into it.\n* Buy a {{item:3157}} if you&#039;re AP to occasionally evade his Ult. He doesn&#039;t deal a lot of physical damage but it helps you to mitigate more damage if you have this and evade his ult than stacking MR.\n* If you are an AD champ, get {{item:3140}}. It provides MR and its active gets rid of the ult. The bait will drop off of you but will remain active on the map. It will errupt normally as if it never hit someone. The item costs \"only\" 1.3 k g and can save your back a buncha times. It also builds into {{item:3139}} with its 75 AD being one of the highest scaling AD Items but at the hefty price of 3.7 k g also one of the most expensive ones.\n* Speaking of which, he is a magic damage monster so magicresist is really good against him. An {{item:3001}} can help you with that if you have AP scalings and you and/or your team deal a lot of magic damage. This will greatly benefit you in Teamfights too.\n* DoT or effects added before he makes his E still take effect while he is in his playful stuff.\n* {{item:3102}} may stop the ult from sticking to you but it won't destroy the bait. The shield will be popped by the ult and Fizz himself is able to pop it pretty reliably. It might still safe you as it still provides needed MR aswell as health and regeneration. \n* You can avoid his Q with a quick dash or flash, although you'll need some pretty swift reaction time.\n* There's a very very short timewindow where you can dash/flash out of the ult before it erupts. It is extremely close to when the bait gets eaten. Don't rely on this though as this is pretty hard to accomplish.\n* His E can cancel many ults (like syndra R) and still put them on cool down. Make sure his E is on CD or he is stunned before you use an ult like that.\n* Pre 6 he doesn't have anything ranged to get you and has to be in melee range. He also has somewhat longish CDs on his stuff which you can abuse to punish him.\n* He can't use his E immediately after his Q as he has a 0.5 s long recovery animation in which you are able to get him, if the E is off CD. Hard, but mentionable.\n\n{{champion:420}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her healing\n*Her poke\n* Her tentacle spamming minigame\n* Her damage\n* Her tankiness\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Her Soulgrab is blocked by minions, is relatively telegraphed, and can be dodged if you expect it. Always expect it if there are no minions between you.\n* If the E connects, start pummeling away at her. Every time you damage her the clone's lifetime is shortened by a second. If she keeps focusing the clone while you are focusing her, she deals 25-50% of her total damage to you while you deal your 100%. It's a win-win either way. Most Illaoi's will move away once you start attacking her since it is not worth it most of the time.\n* If she ults you, move out of the area as quickly as you can. She gains extreme strength if you and your allies are in the area since there are so many tentacles around. Move away, and her strength goes down. The same is with any area with tentacles. If she isn't around, destroy those tentacles to kill a lot of her damage.\n* Consider buying a {{item:3165}} or an {{item:3123}} down the line. Even if you don't build {{item:3123}} into the last stage, you can use it to dampen her heal.\n* If you can, poke her a lot.\n* If you manage to land a hard CC on her, she will lose a lot of damage potential as she is reliant on her abilities to do stuff.\n* Her Q is telegraphed and can be sidestepped to some extent. Care about other tentacles around.\n* If you get soultaken and your only choice is to run away, go under your tower. Before you backport, wait for at least one tentacle to spawn and hit. It won't hit a second time and you are able to disarm it. If a teammate is affected by the soul debuff, don't kill tentacles they are about to kill beacuse they need the kills to disarm the debuff.\n\n{{champion:40}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her ult gamechanging. Be it for or against your team.\n* Her CC\n* Her steroid Shield\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Her early manapool is pretty small and her abilities cost a lot of mana. Get her when she's low and out of position.\n* Her abilities have fairly long CDs and her Whirlwind takes some time to activate. You can also kinda anticipate where the wind blows to and evade it. It has a wide hitbox but isn't the fastest skillshot in the game.\n\n{{champion:24}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* The dodges\n* The damage\n* The mobility\n* The AS\n* The mixed damage\n* Guinsoos on him\n* The incredible snowball potential\n* The ability to splitpush like a madman\n* His tankyness\n* Fairly low CDs\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Pre 6 he is easier to kill than after that powerspike. Try to coordinate with your Jungler for a gank to stop him in his tracks.\n* If he uses his dodge ability, his damage will crank up with every AA you deal to him so don't attack him while he's spinning as it will only aid him and only bring you sorrow.\n* Because he deals mixed damage, you can't build that extremely against him. However, if you build a bit of health aswell as a {{item:3143}}  or {{item:3110}}, you can counter his AS to some extent. Pre 6 it's mostly physical damage he deals, after 6, the passive magic damage portion of his ult comes to the mix.\n* He will most likely buy {{item:3146}} as he will benefit from all stats about 200%. His ult allows him to get MR and AR from offensive stats, where his tankyness will come from. To stop his sustain, get a {{item:3123}} / {{item:3165}} depending on what sort of champ you are to stop this from happening.\n* He excells at 1 v 1 duels and pushes out a lot of damage. You and your jungler have a tiny window of time when he used his jump and stun to engage you to get him as he lacks mobility and defensives while those two abilities are on CD. If you are alone, paly passively as he will most likely outdo you.\n* While he can dodge AA, he can't do so with abilities. Use them to get him. If they are on hit abilities on basic attacks like nasus Q, the damage will be negated completely.\n* If he uses his dodge, he can't activate it for 1 second to stun you. Use this time to get out of range if you can.\n\n{{champion:43}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her surprising damage\n* Her spammy nature\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Karma relies on resets of her R by hitting you with her abilities or AA. AA work but take her longer to be efficient. Dodging her Q mean a lot of damage aswell resets prevented.\n* Her only form of hard CC is a successful tether with her W, which takes 2 seconds to complete. While it's on you it will deal damage three times over the duration. Try to run out of the tether or go in on her if you know you can't do it. She isn't a tank and without her ult, she doesn't have as much damage.\n* Her ult allows her to increase one abilities functions, which mean the other ones are much weaker. Try to bait out the ult, which is indicated clearly by a phrase you hear by Karma herself and a visible cue.\n* Her ulted tether heals her by 40% of her missing health if it's successful, 20% if she only manages the initial tether. Be careful engaging her on low life if she has her ult up as the tables might turn. You can buy {{item:3123}} / {{item:3165}} to reduce her healing to some extent.\n* She doesn't deal any physical damage with her kit and her main damage source is her Q. Buy MR to mitigate some damage she deals. Because she has no % life damage, apart from a possible {{item:3151}}, prioritize MR.\n* Her ulted Q explodes after reaching the maximum range or in general if it hits a unit. It can hit you even if you sidestep so be careful. You can walk diagonally in her direction to dodge the Q. \n* Karma is immobile and relies on others to be immobile too to survive. If you coordinate a gank from two directions, she will have a hard time stopping you both if you don't clump up together.\n* Do NOT keep standing in the circle after you got hit by a ulted Q as it will errupt and deal additional damage to you.\n* Her W puts her in \"kill-me\" range. A lot of people see this as an opportunity to go HAM on her - however, Karma is super sticky, so once she W's you and her ult and Q are up, consider yourself dead. Just run away from her W, it's extremely easy to break.\n\n{{champion:55}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her damage\n* Her incredible snowball potential even if she had a famined laningphase.\n* Her resets\n* Her mobility\n* Her lack of ressources to handle\n* Her low Cds\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Her Q means a comfortable damage boost for her but only jumps to units which are close enough. If you are ranged and farm from behind, make a gap between you and your minions as then the blade won&#039;t bounce to you.\n* Her combos can be interrupted hard by hard cc like silences, stuns or displacements. If she still has her ult, try to bait that out if you can take one or two hits from her and then stun her in her ult. The ult deals a lot of damage over the time it&#039;s active but if it doesn&#039;t connect, she has no powder left. This is hard to pull but if you can do it, it&#039;s nice.\n* Buy a {{item:3157}} if you&#039;re AP to occasionally mitigate her damage. Be careful though as your stasis gives her time to regain her CDs.\n* She deals TONS of magic damage so MR is good against her. She has no % life damage which can make life a valuable stat to buy.\n* An {{item:3001}} is pretty swell if you and/or your team have lots of magic damage and you have AP scalings.\n* A{{item:3026}}  on any of your teammates disrupts her passive and she won't get the resets from it. If she has no resets she relies so heavily on, she isn't as strong anymore.\n\n{{champion:203}} \n\n**What makes them frustrating?**\n\n* Their damage\n* Their incredible snowball potential.\n* Their mobility\n\n**How to play against them:**\n\n* A big part of their damage comes from farming marked monsters in your jungle and champions and that's where you slow their snowball down by a big amount. You can see which monster in your jungle is marked by them... and you kill it. That way the mark vanishes and they cannot gain their passive from that mark. Even if you aren't the jungler, go and kill the monsters to stop them.\n* If you have some sort of dispacement ability, you can push them out of her ult and outside of it, you can kill them.\n* Don't waste all your abilities when they're low and stand in the ult, you won't kill them while they're in there. When the ult is over, unleash hell upon them. Then it just depends on how much DPS either of you have. \n* Hard CC still works in the ult and you might stun them just when the ult ends so you can kill them right afterwards\n* Remember that the ult also prevents you from dieing. Use this to your advantage too to possibly attack other champs to get them low for your team to clean up after you.\n* Kindred has a big advantage in their Ws zone. Try not to fight them in there as the Q will have a reduced CD which allows the sheep kite you if you're kiteable.\n\n{{champion:7}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her incredible mobility\n* Her damage\n* Her low cds\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Most LB jump around to juke you. Sometimes they return to their second or first pad so don't waste a flash if you aren't 100% certain for a kill. Sometimes just waiting at a pad leads her right into your waiting arms.\n* Pay attention on what she used last as she kinda only has one shot per fight with what she will use her ult.\n* Pre 6 she is vulnerable to ganks if she used her W and she can't get away from you.\n* She has one skillshot which are her chains. If you evade them somehow, she loses a lot of damage potential as it's her only form of CC and it's singletarget.\n* She excells at singletarget damage with her sigil and chain so getting her as two isn't that off. But care about her distortion as it has a longer cd at earlier levels but gains a pretty low cd at lvl 5.\n* Her ults copies deal more damage than her basic abilities which means again, if she wastes an ult ability (you know if it's an ult ability if it's colored negative) she lost a lot of damage. Use that timeframe to punish her.\n* She deals lots of magic damage and that exclusively. Buy MR and health as she doesn't have % health damage.\n* An {{item:3001}} is pretty nice if you and/or your team have lots of magic damage and you have AP scalings.\n* Keep sufficient range so that she must use W to gap close. Thus she won't have the damage of her W on you. If you can do that, her one combo kill potential falls. Same goes for her E. Attempt to sidestep when she W's towards you. \n* She is a lane bully, so you will most likely miss some farm if you don't play too risky.\n\n{{champion:117}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her surprising high early damage and damage overall\n* Her form of cc\n* Her range\n* Her poke\n* Her Ult is comparable to Reneks, just a bit different.\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* If she lanes against you, try to farm safely and think hard about engaging her as she certainly is able to kite you if you are kiteable.\n* Her passive gives her bonus magic damage on AA, which are blockable by minions however.\n* She has very little mana to work with at low levels but will have a lot of it in later stages of the game.\n* As she deals exclusively magic damage, rush MR so she will tickle you later on as she will fall off a bit in lategame. She doesn't have % life damage which means you can also build life against her.\n* Because of the lot of CC she has in her kit, 2 of which being hard CC, {{item:3111}}  are very recommended against her as it will reduce the time you are CCd against her. The knockup from her ult won't be reduced, however her slow aswell as the polymorph which can disrupt you hard.\n* Be careful if she has her ult up and you engage her. It is comparable to Renektons ult as she will regain a lot of health, you will get knocked up if you're in range and slowed over the duration in its range. This can be dangerous if you're also getting ganked by the enemy jungler.\n* Do not clump up against one of them if her ult is up in a teamfight as the one focused will likely be the next target for her ult which can disrupt your whole team. Bait it out if you can to reduce a big risk against her.\n* Her Q Glitterlance always comes out from where Pixi is and from Lulu herself. If she transfers Pixi to you or a minion she gains a lot of range to the already long range of the spell. Be wary of the range.\n* If she's played as support the following applies.\n* If she places a shield on someone, don't engage, or hide behind something when possible. This buff not only gives her a shield, but also an AA buff to the ally. Unlike Janna's shield, the AA buff won't disappear as soon as the shield is destroyed, so be careful. Also, she may land really tricky glitterlances right upon shielding, so be prepared to dodge.\n* Try to bait her W. In a solo lane it isn't as important to her because she's more focused on poke there, but botlane, it is THE non-ultimate disable that screws anyone over. It has a 16 second CD at rank one. Abuse it if she missuses this spell.\n* Because she needs all 3 of her spells to do something and make cheesy plays botlane, try to punish her hard before she reaches level 3.\n* Look at her at the same threat level as you do the enemy adc. She can disrupt engages on her ADC pretty successful with her spells.\n* She is a fairly long ranged poker so poke yourself if you can.\n* In teamfights she is a priority target IF she is out of position.\n* Don't chase a her unless you know how to kill her ASAP and/or if she is OOM. She has the self-peel of a Janna.\n* If you see Pix, prepare for a Glitterlance and try to dodge it.\n* Most supports won't spam their Q as it quickly drains mana and she won't have anything else to peel for her ADC with afterwards.\n\n{{champion:90}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* \"Spaceaids\"\n* % life damage\n* AoE silence\n* His surpress ability\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Most malzahars use their E to farm and get mana back. Don't get too close to the affected minions as it will most likely jump to you if the minion dies. You could ofc also tank it to deny him farm but only do this if you don't take too much damage from it.\n* His silence gets telephoned pretty hard, so try to evade it.\n* Many malzahars try to puddle below you and then surpress you over it. If you don't stand in the puddle, you won't suffer that much damage.\n* He too excells at singletarget shutdowns and deals magic damage exclusively. As he will most likely buy {{item:3151}}  and/or {{item:3116}}, buy MR over health items.\n* A {{item:3140}} is a possible purchase and can also remove the surpression. It won't prevent the damage from the tether he will still have though. Walk out of range afterwards.\n* An {{item:3001}} is pretty swell if you and/or your team have lots of magic damage and you have AP scalings.\n* His ult is channeled which means it is interruptable by hard cc or interrupting abilities. While he makes the ult be basically roots/stuns himself for 2.5 seconds if he wants to fully utilize it. Time which your jungler or teammates can use to disrupt him somehow. In a 1 v 1 situation, he has the upper hand though so watch out for that.\n* Keep moving to mitigate damage from him through dodging. \n\n{{champion:11}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His insane snowball potential\n* Untargetability\n* Some are affected by him psychologically and tilt, thus play worse\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* While he has his ult active, he is immune to slows but not against other forms of hard CC. Also, if he's feared, he runs away with his full movementspeed, giving you more time to run away.\n* If he's their jungler, which is likely, invade him early on. His clear is bad compared to others and he is very squishy. Early and alone he isn't as dangerous as he is after 6 with a lanepartner. Scout on his blue buff side and Ward red to catch him off guard. As always with invades, be careful though.\n* When he Alpha Strikes he appears at the target he first used it on. Prepare your CC, if you have any, at the target he Qd first on to lock him down.\n* His meditate is a channel and thus disrupted by hard CC. While he meditates he takes less damage, so keep that in mind.\n* He is Attack speed reliant so getting {{item:3110}} or {{item:3143}} counters him to some extent. The last mentioned helps because he does a mix of True damage and Physical Damage\n* If his sword glows white prepare for some true damage, yellow means he has bonus AD ratios. No glow means he loses the bonus AD and true damage meaning he's slightly weaker. Engage him at that point.\n* If he is building lifesteal early, he will have more sustained damage but low burst, making himself vulnerable to burst. If he buys crits early, he would have a lot more burst in his attacks but wouldn't be too effective in a skirmish if focused down. Plan accordingly.\n* If yi is jungling, his ganks are fairly bad if his lane has little cc. If you know you can escape a gank from him fairly safely early on, try and force him to gank more often to weaken his presence, farm and power later on.\n* He would need his own team to engage for him (assuming he isn't snowballing at the moment) but can get pretty over extended in a teamfight when he fully commits, keep the tanks around him and make sure he doesn't get a reset kill to prevent him from being useful.\n* If he builds lots of lifesteal in late, get those grivious wounds on with {{item:3123}} or {{item:3165}} as this will hit him.\n* A {{item:3075}} can keep him at bay to some extent as his main damage comes from AA. He might sustain more than gets reflected to him. However, this is still better than him killing you without any damage.\n* He also benefits from resets on kill so a {{item:3026}} can disrupt his stomp through your team. A {{item:3157}} can also disrupt his damage as he won't be able to land his Q and he has less time for his true damage buff.\n\n{{champion:21}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her damage\n* Her snowball potential\n* Her slow\n* Her Movementspeed\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Her ult is channeled, thus can be chanceled by her walking away or you hard ccing her. It's safer to be close to her when she ults because the cone is less wide, thus sidestepable.\n* Her passive allows her to deal tons of damage to champs if she alternates between targets. If you are alone, she loses some of ther damage potential as she then also can't double up.\n* She is good to control one direction. If you start a multi directional attack, she won't be able to unleash hell upon all of you.\n* Try to stand behind healthy minions as they won't die that fast to her Q if she decides to poke you that way. If they die, you take more damage. However, if you have two minions in front of you, the second minion will most likely take the blow for you.\n\n{{champion:75}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His sustain\n* His tankyness\n* His damage if fed\n* He doesn't give a sht about your poke after some LS\n* His CC\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Poke him in the early stages. He doesn't have as much sustain in those stages like he has later.\n* Get a {{item:3123}} / {{item:3165}} to stop his insane sustain. It's really extreme how much sustain he can gain.\n* While he has his wither on you, you will lose attackspeed too. Use abilities to get away or damage him while he closes in on you.\n* Do your best to stop him from farming his Q up. It's hard to do but if he doesn't manage to get his stacks, he will lack damage later.\n\n{{champion:133}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Extreme damages\n* High mobility\n* Disruptive\n* \"Blind\"\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Her ult is cancelled if she takes damage, without that rain of arrows. While she's channeling, you will also able to disrupt her with damage.\n* Try to get out of her range when you have harrier on you. The mark stays for 4 seconds, then switches to another unit.\n* She has to go in to get to your backline, so having a huge tank and someone to peel is good for you in teamfights.\n* Quinn is a combo champion. Ult+E+Q. Avoid the Q if you're still alive, which is fairly likely if she isn't super far ahead. Her Q will win her 1v1s. That is her win condition for 1v1s so avoid that, even bust flash if you have to.\n* While she doesn't have any magic damage, a {{item:3102}} can disrupt her combo on you and give you some precious time.\n* If the enemy team has a lot of CC and you scale off of AD, get a {{item:3140}} as this will remove all debuffs, like the \"blind\" or slow aswell as harrier.\n* As she is purely physical damage without any % life damage, get armor and life. The more health the better. \n* She is AA reliant and builds crit usually so getting a {{item:3143}} is a very good item against her. A {{item:3110}} is also possible in some situations. A {{item:3075}} can also hurt Quinns damage to some extent.\n* She depends on her combo so if she 100-0s you she most likely blew everything she had out. A {{item:3026}} can revive you to a bulletless machinegun. But care as she still has some damage even if her stuff is on CD.\n* Her mark has CD if it's used up. 8 seconds to be precise. The CD gets lowered with crit chance to a possible ~3 seconds with 100% crit. Her Q and E will also apply the mark though.\n* If she uses her E she will jump back a set distance, making it possible for you to anticipate where she may land for a skillshot. You can also look that you position yourself that she jumps into a direction you want. She then may decide to walk past you to position herself for a successful E.\n\n{{champion:58}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His mobility\n* His extreme earlygame damage\n* His tankyness\n* His ability to soak damage and sustain\n* His ult which can turn duels against him into a nightmare\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Try to keep track of his fury. After 50 fury his abilities gain more damage and his w stuns for longer. At low fury his trades are worse.\n* Don't be baited by a low renekton after lvl 6. His ult gives instant hp and fury so he can stun and heal for a large amount.\n* If possible don't stand near minions. If his Slice hits an enemy he gets to dash again. By moving to the side he might miss the E and be without his escape.\n* Standing in your minions while engaging him is also disfavorable for you as he can Q and heal for a lot of damage. The more enemy units he hits with it, the bigger the heal. He heals more on champions so if your jungler engages, try to get him use the Q only on maximum one of you.\n* Renekton dives towers very well so be careful with low health. He can E in, stun, Q, ignite and then E out while only taking 2-3 tower hits.\n* Renekton has very long cool downs early on. Baiting out his E can lead to a good gank. Just remember he gets a second E if his first hits a unit.\n* His strongest phase is the earlygame. If you manage to survive this stage of the game, he mostly falls off lategame.\n* His stun is only singletarget so he has to commit to one target.\n\n{{champion:107}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His ability to just delete a champion\n* His possible omnipresence on the map\n* The paranoia he could be in any bush at any time\n* The appearent immortality and sustain with his cry\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Playing against Rengar is really difficult but still possible.\n* If you have some sort of hard CC, you can stop Rengars deletion on you. It takes serious reaction time to stop him, but if you take all necessary precautions then Rengar will have a difficult time getting you or your carry.\n* His only form of hard cc is a root which makes you unable to move but you will still be able to use abilities or attack him if he gets in your range.\n* Most Rengar players click forward repeatedly for good trajectory. Placing an abundance of wards next to your carry just might screw up his targeting. Not that reliable, but maybe it helps. This works better for grouping together so your hitboxes fuse, making your carry technically untargetable and making him miss.\n* {{item:3026}} and {{item:3102}} can hugely impair rengar. You can compare him to a Bazooka. Incredible damage but he takes time to reload. If you get a {{item:3026}} he will still blow you up but he won't have the 5 ferocity he needs to burst you down anymore. He relies heavily on those stacks and without them, he loses a LOT of damage. The {item:3102}} can disrupt a combo he will try to pull on you and he again loses damage.\n* If your team catches an enemy out and kills them, chances are that the next team fight or push will highly be in your favor. This makes diving someone in your team riskier since it would mean one possibly dead kitty. It doesn't make your carry magically immune but reduces the threat a bit.\n* Depending on what part of the game you are in, Rengar will be prowling for a specific set of time before going for the carry. As soon as you see the mark, group together and prepare your skillshots and CC, aim them around your carry or high priority target for him him like low lifers. If Rengar has Youmuu's, it's ~1.5 seconds to him jumping after seeing the warning. Boots and Youmuu's is ~.8 seconds. With 20 stacks, act fast as you have less than half a second beacuse of his movementspeed he gains through his passive.\n\n{{champion:92}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her mobility\n* Her damage\n* Her lack of any ressourcemanagent\n* Her low CDs in later stages of the game\n* Her ability to just execute people when they are low without even being there\n* Her insane snowballing potential\n* She's a bully\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Her ability cooldowns are all really long early, Q has a base CD of 13 and is NOT reduced by putting points in the skill. If she uses her skills to push the wave, go in and trade with her before they come back up.\n* The cooldown of Q starts as soon as Riven uses the first one, not when she uses the last. If you see a Riven spacing out her Qs, she is trying to either bait you into fighting her or is about to engage. \n* Her sustain is awful pre {{item:3074}}. Even with the recent buff, her HP per 5 is still among the worst. This means if you have poke, poke her down hard. \n* Her ultimate increases her bonus AD by 20%. DO NOT fight Riven unless you vastly outnumber or know you can beat her with her ult active.\n* Her 4 dashes make escaping a gank fairly easy. However, if you can use a displacement (Lee Sin ult or Quinn E) it will cancel that Qs movement. She has a time window of 4 seconds between each of her 3 jumps to use the next until the CD makes the ability unusable. Use this window to apply hard cc to her if you have that to possibly disrupt her.\n* A large portion of her early damage comes from her passive, which enhances her autos after using a skill. (stacks 3 times) However, this buff has a short duration so waiting it out is a good idea.\n* IF she kills you in lane, or is in any way ahead, DO NOT BUILD DAMAGE. She deals exclusively physical damage which means Armor is good against her aswell as life as she doesn't deal any % life damage. A {{item:3068}} or {{item:3742}} will help you against her in lane.\n* She has a 0.75 seconds AoE stun which is mostly used to disrupt you. Even if she doesn't deal any magic damage, a {{item:3111}} will reduce the stun by a lot. Some {{item:3047}} can increase your survivability against her by a bit, is only recommended against a high physical damage AA enemy team with little CC.\n* Be wary of Riven mid-game. Most Rivens will attempt to max out their CDR by this point, putting her abilities are fairly low cooldowns.\n* Her shield, while strong, only lasts 1.5 seconds. Bait it out, let it decay and then blow your combo and Riven will take way more damage than if she had it.\n* Due to her kit, she is prone to push her lane if she uses her abilities to farm. This way you can keep the minions in your half of the lane and deny her jungler a chance to get to you. It also helps your jungler as he has much more time to get to her.\n\n{{champion:35}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His snowball potential\n* His seemingly omnipresence on the map\n* His invisibility\n* His almost flash every few seconds\n* His damage\n* His boxes\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* He usually levels his box first and his two shiv poison second if he's jungling. This means he is vulnerable for counterganks at level 2, before he gets his Q, decieve. If you have a powerful counterjunglingchamp, think about delaying him. But again, be careful if you invade.\n* If you ping shaco before he uses his ultimate, the ping will remain on the real one.\n*If you keep switching directions when you think shaco is close to you, the shaco will be hard pressed to get his 20% bonus backstab damage, and could even discourage him from going in at all. This can also mitigate some damage if he still decides to hit you.\n* In the jungle he runs mostly ignite and smite because he's relying on his Q. This means that whenever his deceive is down he has no way to get away and he also doesn't do a lot of damage, so you should fight him if his Q is on CD.\n* A {{item:2043}} in your inventory can discourage a shaco from ganking you. Buy and place pinks anyway. Even if they get found and destroyed, you then still might have survived because of it. 75 g isn't that much anymore as you get more money anyway. There are bushes which give you great vision but aren't that much visited by the enemy anyway.\n* Be wary of your surroundings. You can see a puff of an orange cloud if he uses his Q. This way you know he has to be there somewhere.\n* Be careful if you kill the clone close to a low life enemy as this clone deals a hefty amount of damage, even if he doesn't have any AP items.\n* Because he deals a hefty amount of mixed damage, buy life and mixed ressistances. He doesn't have any % life damage, making life an important defensive stat against him.\n* Apart from his Q he is immobile. if you manage to CC him somehow, you have good chances to kill him\n* That said, be careful of baits after he his level 6 as it is likely that he goes in a bush, ults and uses the clone to bait you in a jackinabox infested bush which will most likely mean your end.\n\n{{champion:223}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His seemingly unkillable behind\n* You have to go through two healthbars\n* He scales off of tankstats, which makes him tanky... while dealing a lot of damage\n* He can safe anyone if they are in the need of it\n* He can troll\n* His incredible extreme damage potential while being \"just a support\"\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* While he is seemingly too tanky and heals appearently all the damage you aplly on him, you need to poke him, little by little. As a support, people rarely level his shield, so its recovery % is way lower than you think, plus he'll be saving the shield for heavy engages so he'll rarely activate it, even if he sees the poke coming.\n* He has no way to counter your poke without putting itself on a bad spot, he can either try to hit you with his Q that has low damage pre 6, or he can try to spit a minion on you. Both leave him open as both will stop at the first unit hit.\n* Tahm is immobile and vulnerable to CC. While he has a huge healthbar, he can be killed with the help fo your jungler.\n* Don't be afraid to engage and then disengage without killing anyone, if you can safe engage and take 20%~30% of his health, do it and then retreat back to farming.\n* Just don't go all-in when he's at 65~100% HP as you most likely won't kill him.\n* While he has one of your allies, be that a minion or champion, in his belly, he is slowed. This will mean he is vulnerable. In a 1 v 1 scenario he is able to outdamage you with his devour, be careful with that.\n* When he used his shield, the ability will be on CD for a long time in earlygame. This means he won't regain his grey healthbar and he is vulnerable. It doesn't matter if he took 10 or 1000 damage. If he chooses to use the shield, it will be decayed after 6 seconds.\n* A {{item:3140}} can get rid of the stacks and stuns on you but be careful. If you are in his belly already, he will spit you out and you will still take the full damage.\n* a {{item:3157}} could help you to to get rid of a few stacks or delay him from eating you. The stacks hold for 7 seconds and decay afterwards at a pace of 0.5 per second. It isn't that hard to stack on you as any damage from him will apply one stack.\n* Try to evade his Q as this is his means to close the gap between you and him. This means he loses a lot of potential damage if he misses.\n* His Manacost to Manapool Ratio is pretty bad in the earlier stages of the game. If you manage to get him to waste most of his abilities, he will have a hard time.\n* Tahm deals exclusively magic damage, which means MR is pretty good against him. Because he deals % life damage if he eats you, get MR over life.\n* A {{item:3151}} can help you decay his health little by little.\n\n{{champion:44}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His heal\n* His stun\n* His Steroids\n* His spammy nature\n* His tankyness\n* His surprising damage in lane\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* The thing with him is, he is extremely hard to kill in lategame and you might be surprised about just how much damage that gemknight can push out. Try to shut him down early to reduce his threat.\n* He is built around his spammy resetty playstyle. If he doesn't get to you, you are pretty safe... except if he dazzles you, then he will be able to get close to you. {{item:3111}} help you keep your distance if you need to as it will mitigate some of his damage aswell as reduce the stunduration by a nice amount.\n* His kit deals a lot of magicdamage, can be expanded by physical damage too though as he most likely will buy a {{item:3025}} and he needs to AA you to trade with you. This also will impair your ability to get away from him.\n* A good thing against him is {{item:3123}} / {{item:3165}} if he maxes his Q early, as this heal is extreme in the later stages.\n* After 40% CDR and reaching lvl 16, he is able to cycle through his abilities without a break, which means he has his stun ready about every 4-6 seconds, which means you only have a window of maybe 3-4 seconds to damage him efficiently.\n* Taric relies extremely on CDR and Mana. His early CDs are very long, even with his passive and he is pretty vulnerable to ganks because of his lack of mobility and waveclear pre sunfire cape (If you lane against him).\n* His spammy nature leads to him running out of mana fairly quickly. He is also only able to stun one target, while the other is able to get him. \n* A{{item:3110}} can seriosuly impair his burst on you as it will reduce his AS, thus delaying his resets.\n* Care about his ult as it will mean a massive brust from him and a massive boost for his combat stats. it also gives him a passive reset.\n* He won't be able to make much use of his passive as support so punish him if he comes in to get resets.\n\n{{champion:17}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His forms of CC (Blind, slow)\n* His power to control parts of the map with his shrooms\n* His global taunt\n* His poke\n* His DoT\n* The feeling that you are safe but NO! Shroom.\n* The feeling of powerlessness against his poke.\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* If your champ is heavily AA dependant, ask yourself if you don't want to trade with your midlaner, if they use more abilities than AAs. It might make your game easier. But then also look at if the enemy midlaner isn't worse than Teemo.\n* He is able to pick away a lot of life over the time he pokes you. If you have abilities to poke him with, poke him. He isn't a tank if not built that way and has no natural sustain which might eventually kill him.\n* Don't chase him into a bush or somewhere where he walks to with a real aim. Like if he runs down the river or in a bush rather than away from you in a straight line to his tower. Bushes are his domain.\n* A {{item:2043}} in one of the three bushes, if you're the toplaner, covers a lot of ground and can show you some shrooms or a teemoward. It will eventually be destroyed but you will have a slight advantage while the ward is active.\n* Think about getting an upgraded {{item:3364}} to scout out teemos and shrooms.\n* He deals a lot of and exclusively magic damage over time so build MR against him. {{item:3111}} are almost a must against him as it will reduce the time he has power over you by a great amount of time. Life is great too as it will take him longer to chip down your health. Be wary of a {{item:3151}} in his inventory though as this will take a high toll on you if you walk into a shroom.\n* He is weak to CC and his only means of mobility is his W which has a long CD. You can burst him down if your main damage ability isn't reliant on AAs. Else wait out the Blind and engage then.\n* His manapool is fairly small and his costs are high. If he's low on mana, you can engage him. Again, care about the shrooms he maybe layed out.\n\n{{champion:18}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her beastly damage in mid/lategame\n* Her snowball potential\n* Her jumps\n* Her resets\n* Her insane splitpush ability\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* She is prone to push the waves due to the explosive nature of her E passive. Use this to keep the waves in your half of the lane. This will reduce the risk of you being ganked and increases her risk of being ganked.\n* She will outrange you eventually but she is immobile apart from her rocketjump, which has a high CD if she doesn't get a reset.\n* Her rocketjump is just a long dash and can be interrupted by hard CC like knockups. She is also vulnerable to slows and migh has to use her ult to get you off of her.\n* She highly depends on resets on her abilities. Deny some of it by buying a {{item:3026}} as she will have blown all her abilities, putting them on CD.\n* A {{item:3157}} can safe you if you have a charge on your head. She will get a W reset if she manages to get the charge to explode.\n* She highly depends on AS, so getting a {{item:3143}} or {{item:3110}} can hurt her damage output.\n* She mostly deals physical damage but she does have magic damage in her kit with her W, E passive and Ult. Building life equal to defences is a good option to mitigate some of her damage.\n* Even a {{item:3102}} can safe you in the right moment. Be it blocking her ult or the E explosion. It is also depending on what the rest of the team is.\n\n{{champion:67}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Her mobility\n* Her damage\n* Her self peel with Condemn\n* Her true damage\n* Her ability to just 1 v 5 you and your team and getting a penta just like that\n* Her ability to snowball like... a snowball at the steep snowy peaks of the everest\n* Her disregard of your tankstats and feelings\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* She is extreme mid to lategame. Get her under control in the earlygame and try to keep her on a short leash during the game.\n* After she reaches level 6 don't try to engage her alone as she is a strong independent woman who don't need no support. Her ult means a giant powerspike for her dueling potential.\n* Her Q has a bit long CD at level 1 but gets lowered rapidly to 2 seconds at level 5. Be careful against her tumblering around like dunnowhat.\n* Her E Condemn has a very long CD (20 seconds at level 1 with no CDR) so make her waste it. It's her only way to peel for herself. One way is to threat her with your presence if you have a gapcloser and make her use her condemn on you before you close the gap. Be careful with this though as she will be able to poke you hard if you overextend.\n* She is able to kite pretty hard due to her mobility from her passive and her tumble so be careful.\n* A {{item:2043}} can prove pretty useful against her as you will be able to see her tumbling around with her ult. A {{item:3364}} doesn't reveal her to click on her, but will see where she goes. If you have skillshots, use them.\n* She is squishy to burst damage so if you have that, do it.\n* Do not engage her in the jungle or in narrow places such as the jungle as she will most likely have her E up and stun you against this narrow place. She has too look at her positioning, so do you. If she tries to stand in line through you to a wall be almost certain that she will try a condemn on you.\n* Items like {{item:3110}} and {{item:3143}} will decrease her ability to add stacks to you and it will take her longer to kill you. Even if it's just a bit, it is something.\n* A {{item:3157}} can disrupt her combo on you as she will have to wait 2.5 seconds until she can stack further on you. Time in which your team can also get shwifty and go against Vayne. But care, the stasis will give her time to reposition herself.\n* A {{item:3140}} can get rid of the silver stacks and the stun, thus delay the application of the 3 true damage stacks.\n\n{{champion:112}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His teamfight potential\n* His strength at chokepoints/narrow corridors\n* His lane bully nature\n* His extreme lategame damage\n* His zonepotential\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* He is an immobile mage who doesn't have a lot of burst early in the game. Pressure him by poking or asking your jungler to come every now and then. Hard CC can make hist life hard, even soft CC like slows can cripple him.\n* He excells at long range poke with his lazor. Most Viks will upgrade this ability first and poke with it. Its damage ramps up over the course of the game so try to dodge it as well as you can.\n* His only form of CC, the Static field takes 1.5 seconds to stun you if you stand in it. Enough time to dash out if you have a dash. This ability also has fairly long CD on it and gets maxed last by many players.\n* He gains mobility from his upgraded Q, which will most likely be his second upgrade, so then he will be a tiny bit harder to catch.\n* His earlygame suffers from longish CDs on his abilities, which allows you to poke him or engage him. Punish him if he overextends.\n* If your jungler ganks, care that you don't bulk up as this will allow Viktor to Death Ray you both, Ult both or CC you with his dome of doom.\n* His ult interrupts channels when it's summoned so don't start one if you're not sure that he won't engage you to punish you for that.\n* His trading patterns are binary and easy to read, if he is coming towards you most likely he is going for a trade. Keep in mind that Death Ray will not interrupt Viktor movement.\n* During teamfights avoid fighting in narrow areas, through his W he thrives in this environment.\n* If he has a {{item:3100}} he can do a lot of a damage to any champion.\n* His kit consists out of a lot of burst and sustained damage. However, you are able to build MR aswell as life against him, which dampens his damage output against you,\n* A {{item:3157}} can help you with his burst and give you some precious seconds.\n* A {{item:3102}} blocks the slow of his W but it will still stun you after the 1.5 seconds. You will also survive some his burst with this so it is recommended as a defensive choice.\n* His earlygame Manapool is fairly little. However, he will gain a lot of mana through his {{item:3200}} to {{item:3198}} aswell as AP, which makes him quite a force to be reckoned with.\n\n{{champion:8}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His lack of ressourcemanagement\n* His damage aswell as sustain in midgame\n* His poke/harass with low CD abilities\n* His untargetability\n* His spammy nature which seemingly doesn't need any thought behind it\n* His fairly long range\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* Watch for his E stacks, once he gets 4 he does a lot more damage than with none. Engaging him while he doesn't have those is a good choice. Early, maintaining those stacks costs him a lot of health.\n* Engage hard and early, he doesn't have very good sustain without spellvamp from items.\n* Don't let him shove you under tower as his Q and E both have the range of tower and he can get a combo off without taking any tower shots in return.\n* Because he deals exclusively magic damage, MR is good against him. Because he doesn't have any % life damage, life is a good choice against him.\n* To keep his sustain at a low rate, buy {{item:3123}} or {{item:3165}} respectively. You can sell the item later if you need but it will help keep him at a low flame in trades.\n* He lacks any form of hard or soft CC so get to him if you have the sustain for it. His only means of escape is his puddle which has a pretty long CD and costs 20% of his current life which is a lot. Try to not stand on it though as it will heal him. If you baited the puddle and he still remains in lane, your jungler can engage him without a lot of a problem.\n* After 6, he won't try to burst you down but chip away your health little by little.\n* Care in teamfights as his ults mark will increas all the damage dealt to you and your team by 12%. Don't clump together.\n* {{item:3102}} might block the ult or an ability from him. This is low priority though as he will be able to pop the shield fairly easy.\n* A {{item:3140}} can get rid of the Ult completely, this reducing a LOT of burst from him.\n* Even though he doesn't deal any physical damage apart from occasional AA, a {{item:3157}} can safe you from his ult. Be wary though as the stasis will allow him to regain some CDs.\n* A {{item:3155}} and later {{item:3156}} can help immensly against him.\n\n{{champion:157}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His lack of ressourcemanagement\n* His damage\n* His poke/harass with low CD abilities\n* His insane mobility\n* His spammy nature which seemingly doesn't need any thought behind it\n* His 100% critchance with just 1.5 items\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* His only form of CC is his knockup which is crucial from him to hit. It's obviousy but don't try to get hit ;D.  His Q doesn't give him windstacks if he doesn't hit anything. It is a telegraphed skillshot with maybe 0.25-0.5 reactiontime to sidestep it. It's hard to pull off but you dampen his damage if he misses his Q.\n* His Qs CD gets reduced by his AS which means {{item:3110}} and {{item:3143}} can hurt his damageoutput by a lot. Especially the last mentioned takes a toll on him because you get Armor, Healt aswell as critdamage reduction AND AS reduction. It isn't viable on every champ but it helps against him.\n* A {{item:3157}} can safe you but can also put you in danger because he will also regain his CDs and might go ham on your behind. Use this to dodge his Q if you're low and behind your tower for example.\n* His windwall while powerful, has a long CD on it and is usually maxed last. Bait it out somehow and try to position yourself that he has to reposition himself too. You can so remote control his movement to some extent.\n* If you have poke, use it in the early stages to keep his shield broken.\n* Try not to fight him in your minions because any enemy unit is a Yasuos turf to be used and abused. It has a static on unit CD of 10 down to 6 seconds on lvl 5.\n* Many Yasuos just dash to every minion to get to you or to farm them easier. Try to kinda predict where he moves to as it is a fixed distance he has to dash, regardless on how close he was to the target.\n* While being mobile if there are dashable things, he lacks it severely if there is nothing there to dash to. Coordinate with your jungler to attack inbetween waves or when he pushes in. He is still vulnerable to CC. Even slows cripple him if he can't dash to something.\n* If he has a windstack, he is able to knock you up by dashing into you so be careful anytime he has it up and keep your distance. This will zone you but you won't die.\n\n{{champion:238}} \n\n**What makes him frustrating?**\n\n* His Poke and Harass are also fairly long ranged\n* He can farm easily under tower due to his passive so you can't really punish him by pushing up\n* His damage\n* His mobility and outplay potential\n* Strong presence throughout the game\n* He can show a strong map presence in general\n* Low CD on his poke\n\n**How to play against him:**\n\n* While he doesn't have mana, he does have energy to manage. A shadow shuriken combo uses more than half of his energy in early and almost 3/4 if he uses everything.\n* His shurikens deal reduced damage after they hit one target. If you can't dodge well, hide behind your minions to mitigate some damage.\n* His passive allows him to deal a hefty amount of magic damage against you if you're below 50% of life. Buying life is a good choice against him.\n* Because the magicdamage isn't his main type of damage but physical, buy armor to mitigate some damage.\n* A {{item:3140}} removes his ult mark on you and you won't take the damage.\n* A {{item:3157}} can help you endure the ult. You will again give him time to regain cds though.\n* A {{item:3102}} will block the application of the mark and puts the ult on CD. If it returns while the mark is on you, it won't negate the ults damage though. He is also able to pop the shield fairly easily\n* His shadow has a long CD in early levels and costs a lot. Coordinate with your jungler to gank just when Zed engaged with a shadow. He will most likely try to juke you, be prepared.\n* He will appear behind you after his ults untargetability so aim your CC and abilities in general there. You have 0.5 seconds to apply your things before he is allowed to switch with his shadow.\n* If he runs away from you, he will most likely use his shadow to get away. Don't get too close to it as he will most likely spin and slow you.\n* Don't immediately dash/flash while he ults because then you will carry zed with you. Do it after he reappeared again.\n\n{{champion:143}} \n\n**What makes her frustrating?**\n\n* Lots of CC\n* Lots of harass and poke\n* High damage\n* Teamfightchanging Ult\n* Her burst and sustained damage\n* Her long range\n\n**How to play against her:**\n\n* Her plants are her main source of damage potential. Move away from her plants, or if she has summoned them far away from her position, use that opportunity to get into her face and damage her. If there are seeds and she isn't around, destroy them by stepping on them. But be careful as it could be a bait.\n* Don't underestimate her plats damage. Either be zoned out of their range or take the risk to destroy them. Don't do it if you don't have to. If they are out of position, get them for some gold. If they are attacking minions when summoned, they will attack those minions. If she AAs you, you will be marked and attacked though as this applies a mark on you. Evaluate if the risk and health is worth the 5 gold. \n* Zyra's ult has a lot of utility, damage, and buffs her plants summoned in the AoE. Her ult is fairly easy to dodge if you aren't caught in the center, but be wary of her plants. Although it may not seem like much, a 50% attack boost to them is huge and can thwart your chances of you being able to duel her. If she ults, get out as fast as possible to prevent being knocked up. If she bought a {{item:3116}} be extra careful as it then won't be that easy to evade the ult.\n* Her plants proc both, {{item:3151}} and {{item:3116}} which gets bought by pretty much every Zyra. This means, tanks also have a hard time. Prioritize MR, then get health as it takes her a while to farm for both of those items.\n* She has long CDs in the early stages of the game. If she wasted her E, she lost a lot of CC. This means, due to her low mobility, she is vulnerable to a gank and CC. Even slows can get dangerous for her as she lacks any mobility.\n* Don't forget her passive. After she dies she is able to throw a true damage thorn over a very long distance. Don't let your guard down after you killed her, it may cost your life. This passive takes a long time to react though and you might be able to dodge it as it is a slow skillshot.\n* All of her abilities have a short casttime allowing you to react.\n* Some {{item:3111}} help against her CC and damage in general. The root on her E is pretty short at level 1, but gets longer as she levels it.\n* A {{item:3102}} will block her ults damage OR the knockup, depending on if you walked on it after the damage portion or before. It isn't that hard to pop the shield though as her plants will proc it if the attack.\n* As with Blitzcrank, she can camp in bushes to surprise you with her extremely long ranged root. Keep wards up to prevent this.\n\n_**\n\nHoly... this took a while. Thanks for the feedback and suggestions.

Try to bait out her W, at which point you should be able to allin comfortably.  \n - Pay attention to your vitals. Fiora's passive places a marker on one of the four sides of enemy chamions, which she can hit for % health true damage, and a speed boost. Coupled with the surprising range of her sword after her Q appears to finish moving, this allows her to lane bully a good number of champions. Her ult also spawns 4 vitals, all at the same time, and she gets a good AOE heal if she hits all four of them. There are two great ways to counter this. When laning, if a vital spawns on you, move to a location that Fiora does not have vision of. This will reset her passive, despawning the vital, and when you return to lane, chances are that the vital that spawns won't be on the same side, and hopefully a side you can defend. On that note, Guard your vitals. If you are in top lane, and your vital spawns on the east side of you, walk towards one of the corners of the lane and river, and place your vital right up against the wall. There is literally no way that Fiora can hit these vitals, unless she flashes over said wall, and uses her W for a long range finish. On that note, when she ults you, pick a vita that you can defend, and place that against a wall too. That way, the only way she gets her AOE heal is after you're dead. Champions that can create their own walls help with this, especially Jarvan IV, because of the sheer difficulty it would take to move around a Jarvan when he ults.\n\nThe only other thing that I saw that I would add is this: A hard counter to darius, in almost every situation is simply this little guy:{{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"JoBilly","date":"2016-01-07T18:47:26.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are some really good points.

Because you are ranged, you are more likely to evade his Q, even if he runs after you as you also get movementspeed from it. \n\nFor items I recommend you build {{item:3022}} to kite your enemies down. It is a bit more expensive, but it helps you immensly. The defensive stats aid you against those two too. A {{item:3153}} helps with the much needed AS, to apply those stacks. Same goes with Riven. Poke her down, hard. If she closes in on you, you can toss a boomerang, AA twice and hop or run away with the MS you get.\n\nAlways look at your ragemeter as you might overextend and become an easy target because you become the immobile Mega Gnar way in their territory, or the squishy Mini Gnar right in their zones of control.","replies":[{"poster":"First Time Leona","date":"2016-01-08T13:32:18.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btrk in s6?

But possible. Here's how:\n\n1. Have some sort of CC that can stop Rengar in his tracks. It takes serious reaction time to stop him, but if you take all necessary precautions then Rengar will have a difficult time getting to your carry.\n\n2. Most Rengar players click forward repeatedly for good trajectory. Placing an abundance of wards next to your carry just might screw up his targeting. Not reliable, but hilarious. This works better for grouping together so your hitboxes fuse, making your carry technically untargetable.\n\n3. Have your carry get a GA or a Banshee's. GA is pretty good if Rengar does indeed kill them, and gives a good chunk of armor to deal wuth Rengo's burst. Banshee's, while MR, blocks Rengar's initial leap damage with the spell shield, negating a huge chunk of his damage and giving your team ample time to peel him off you.\n\n4. Picks. If your team catches an enemy out and kills them, chances are that the next team fight or push will highly be in your favor. This makes diving your carry not only fruitless, but risky since it would mean one dead kitty, one less member to defend base. It doesn't make your carry magically immune, but hey. The objective is to damage a gigantic crystal.\n\n5. Depending on what part of the game you are in, Rengar will be prowling for a specific set of time before going for the carry. Group together and prepare your skillshots and CC, aim them around your carry. If Rengar has Youmuu's, it's ~1.5 seconds to him jumping after seeing the warning.. Boots and Youmuu's is ~.8 seconds. With 20 stacks, act fast. You have less than half a second.\n\nHope this helped. If it didn't... please don't make me feel worse than I already do.

Tanky enough to withstand her poke, and tough enough to 100-0 her easily. If she is bullying you really hard at early levels, play safe, keep calm, keep farming, and ask for jungler ganks whenever possible. Rush MR so she will tickle you later on (since her damage is more focused on earlygame). Just as long you can farm and be useful later on, her point of being the \"lane bully\" will be redeemed useless. {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:421}} = good examples.\n> \n> For mid, pick a mage that outranges her, can easily 100-0 from safety, and/or outscale her support-level scalings. Like top, you either play super safe, or poke super hard. Literally any mage that is medium to long ranged works. **DO NOT PICK ASSASSINS, she will make your laning a living hell.** However, if you have no choice and have to face her as an assassin, roam as much as you can, and get early MR if you want to farm for a while. {{champion:45}} is actually one of her worst counters btw.\n> \n> In teamfights? Since 95% of Lulu top/mid players go full-AP build, just get one MR item and remove her from her team. Because she is now the enemy team's second support, you should give her the \"RPG healer\" treatment; CC her, kill her carries, then kill her. If she is doing damage, kill her first. If someone is diving, spread out so she can't land a good ult. If someone is getting caught and if she is in range, DON'T bunch, because she can turn failed grabs into a deadly \"grab the Amumu\" trick.\n> \n> -------------------------\n> \n> For support, she will either play like she's a Lulu mid/top player, or an actual support like Janna/Nami. If she plays like she's pretending to be mid/top then it will be VERY easy and predictable. Good Lulu supports will turn botlane into a really annoying lane. Because there's too many ways to play Lulu, I'll put up a general breakdown.\n> \n> ##In lane:\n> \n> * If she places a shield on someone, don't engage, or hide behind something when possible. This buff not only gives her a shield, but also an AA buff to the ally. Unlike Janna's shield, the AA buff would still be there even if the shield is destroyed (I mean think about it, Pix is still there), so be careful. Also, she may land really tricky glitterlances right upon shielding, so be prepared to dodge.\n> * **Bait her W, seriously.** In a solo lane it isn't as important to Lulu because she's more focused on poke there, but botlane, it is THE non-ultimate disable that screws anyone over. It has a 16 second CD at rank one, and somehow they don't max it despite being such a powerful spell. Beat her up if she ever misuses her W.\n> * Because Lulu needs all 3 of her spells to do something and make cheesy plays botlane, try to get a lead before she reaches level 3.\n> * Got a lockdown? Good idea to focus her instead of her ADC. If you focus her ADC her polymorph will screw up your engage, and her shield + her ADC can turn that into a nasty comeback. I have purposely \"baited\" the enemy botlane into focusing me, my ADC started shooting shit, and got a double kill before. This means, **do this only when you can kill her 100%**.\n> * If her ult is up, be prepared for her to use it on someone, especially if someone is close to dying. If you are focusing someone, don't bunch on that person, that is literally a free ult for her, and can turn the entire fight around.\n> * Because it is a LOT harder for Lulu to peel botlane, she is a lot easier to gank. Ganking Lulu becomes a lot easier when the support can lock someone down.\n> * Anyone against Lulu support works, just as long you can 1) have tons of damage whether if it's for extreme all-ins or just poke and/or 2) heal so much that her poke is pointless. Easy as that.\n> \n> ##Teamfights:\n> \n> Similar to Lulu top/mid, but is usually more peel-oriented.\n> \n> * Since she will be more likely to hide in the backlines, you're not going to have an easy time trying to fish her out. But if she DOES get in range and if your team can 100-0 her, kill her ASAP.\n> * Sometimes Lulu will purposely get caught to bait her teammates. Catch Lulu only when she's alone, or when her teammates are unable to fight.\n> * **DO NOT dive alone**, unless you can get out cleanly (doesn't happen often unless she is someone like me who has the reaction time of a potato). No, seriously, I have turned so many games around simply because some random enemy idiot went alone and think he can 100-0 someone, then made the entire rest of the 5 minutes a 4v5. Bring in at least ONE person with you and Lulu will have a harder time to stop someone.\n> * Don't chase a Lulu unless you know how to kill her ASAP and/or if she is OOM. She has the self-peel of a Janna's. I mean, you can't really catch a Janna; Lulu is just like that.\n> * **DO CC Lulu, but DO NOT waste your important spells on her.** If you are going to waste all of your important spells on her, bad news, you just got baited *so* hard. I also have won teamfights where I died because I ate 3 ults and 2 summoners, but my teammates cleaned up because they don't have to deal with those \"important spells\" anymore, and start killing shit. Though Lulu may have a near-Teemo-level global taunt, don't do it. Good Lulu supports will build tank instead of AP so she can bait AND get out alive.\n> \n> ---------------------\n> \n> Sorry, super long post, but hope I helped.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find a way to shorten it, though Lulu is often unpredictable especially when she is support.\n\nI'll leave the \"what makes her frustrating\" part up to you.","replies":[{"poster":"JoBilly","date":"2016-01-09T01:09:58.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this really long and elaborate text on lulu.

I've got 174K mastery points with Riven, so here is what I struggle with playing as her.\n> \n> 1) Her ability cooldowns are all really long early, Q has a base CD of 13 and is NOT reduced by putting points in the skill. If she uses her skills to push the wave, go in and trade with her before they come back up.\n> \n> 2) The cooldown of Q starts as soon as Riven uses the first one, not when she uses the last. If you see a Riven spacing out her Qs, she is trying to either bait you into fighting her or is about to engage. Be careful, as the CD of Q early will only be 3-4 seconds when she does this.\n> \n> 3) Her sustain is awful. Even with the recent buff, her HP per 5 is still among the worst. Any champion with good sustain (Garen, Renekton) or with decent poke (Gnar, Jayce) do fairly well against her. You mentioned she beat your Renekton. The best way to win that matchup is short trades with your stun, then healing off your Q.\n> \n> 4) Riven's ultimate increases her bonus AD by 20%. DO NOT fight Riven unless you vastly outnumber or know you can beat her with ult active. \n> \n> 5) Her 4 dashes make escaping a gank fairly easy. However, if you can use a displacement (Lee Sin ult or Quinn E) it will cancel that Qs movement. Also, if you can stun her for 3-4 seconds her Q duration will run out and she won't be able to use the charges she has left.\n> \n> 6) A large portion of her early damage comes from her passive, which enhances her autos after using a skill. (stacks 3 times) However, this buff has a short duration so waiting it out is the best idea.\n> \n> 7) IF Riven kills you in lane, or is in any way ahead, DO NOT BUILD DAMAGE. It is super easy to win lane when the enemy Gnar or Renekton build Black Cleaver or another damage item after you kill them. Build Armor, usually a Dead Man's or Sunfire is your best bet. \n> \n> 8) Riven struggles with bruisers and tanks. Her damage is all AD, and current HP items like BORK or not that useful since she is more ability based than auto attack reliant. Stacking HP and Armor will make it a lot harder for Riven to duel you.\n> \n> 9) Riven is balanced around her animation cancels. If the enemy Riven struggles with these, it will be a lot easier to trade with her.\n> \n> 10) Be wary of Riven mid-game. Most Rivens will attempt to max out their CDR by this point, putting her abilities are fairly low cooldowns. \n> \n> 11) Her shield, while strong, only lasts 1.5 seconds. Bait it out and then blow your combo and Riven will take way more damage than if she had it.\n> \n> Champions Riven struggles against:\n> {{champion:86}}: His silence makes trading her super easy, and he can just win through sustain with his passive.  \n> \n> {{champion:58}}: The stun helps him win trades, and the heal on his Q allows him to out sustain her. \n> \n> {{champion:126}}: His hammer E keeps Riven off him while he pokes with auto attacks and empowered Qs. \n> \n> {{champion:133}}: Quinn's E will outright cancel Riven's 3rd Q and push her away. Along with that, just poking Riven down with autos makes winning lane nearly impossible. NOTE: If Riven gets ahead in this matchup, she will burst Quinn down faster than Quinn can get away.\n> \n> {{champion:150}}: Like Quinn, his poke allows him to out trade her plus the bonus tank stats  and CC of Mega Gnar means Riven can't fight him in his melee form either. HOWEVER, like Quinn, Gnar's low base armor and HP makes it easy for Riven to burst down his mini form if she gets on top of him.\n> \n> Champions Riven excels against:\n> {{champion:75}}: Riven has 4 dashes, slows do nothing. She easily out trades him and can just bully him out of lane.\n> \n> {{champion:420}}: All of Illoai's skills are extremely slow and easy do dodge with Riven's E or Q. Riven damage also allows her to bully Illoai out of lane.\n> \n> {{champion:17}}: Riven being ability based rather than auto attack reliant, this guy is a free kill.\n> \n> {{champion:8}}: You'd think due to his built in sustain, and Riven's lack of it, Vlad would stomp this lane. Riven's early damage just shreds through Vlad's crappy early Q heal and will force him to spend health for using W before killing him. \n> \n> ------\n> Got anymore questions?

Move away from her plants, or if she has summoned them far away from her position, use that opportunity to get into her face and damage her.\n\n* Zyra's ult has a lot of utility, damage, and buffs her plants summoned in the AoE. Her ult is fairly easy to dodge if you aren't caught in the center, but be wary of her plants. Although it may not seem like much,  a 50% attack boost to them is huge and can thwart your chances of you being able to duel her. If she ults, get out as fast as possible to prevent being knocked up. This will stop her getting a few extra attacks on you while you are in the air.\n\n* She can do great damage, even to tanks if she builds {{item:3151}} and {{item:3116}} and becomes a lot more difficult to catch, as well as these also being proc'd on her plants. She can cover a whole lane with 2 Thorn Spitters, so try not to rush in to take her down as you will be heavily slowed, but wait for another opportunity to take her down. If you can assassinate her efficiently (e.g. {{champion:121}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:55}}) then go for it. She is extremely squishy and slow.\n\n* A lot of people seem to forget about her passive, which is a real annoyance. Never run in a straight line after she dies, or you have a higher chance on getting caught, especially when you are low health. Strafe when you run. But luckily to those players who don't like her, her passive is extremely telegraphed and takes forever to wind up (oh the pain). Just remember her passive, that's all.\n\n* All of Zyra's abilities are telegraphed except her W, which makes her abilities a little easier to dodge.\n\n* Build more health than magic resist against her. I'd say about 130 mr is enough to stump her damage against you, and a {{item:3111}} to lessen her E root (ha ha) duration. Fighters can go for {{item:3155}}, while tanks should go {{item:3065}}. Her plants will go straight through {{item:3102}} even with {{item:3116}}. Keep that in mind.\n\n* A support Zyra will most likely use her ult as peel for her team. If she uses it as damage, she is a LOT more vulnerable. If you can dodge the knock-up, and have enough health remaining, become the weed killer.\n\n* Zyra is a fantastic ambusher (oh more puns). Make sure to have vision of the bushes she goes into to see if she isn't going to entangle you into her trap.\n\n* Zyra's plants are still awkward on targeting enemies, even if you are in their range, making her weak in terms of fighting with a group of minions. But as soon as she summons her plants, their first target will always be a champ.\n\n* If she summons her plants in an incorrect position, kill them. It is worth it to sneak in an extra 5 gold.\n\n****\nIf anything is wrong or something you would like to add, just comment :)","replies":[{"poster":"JoBilly","date":"2016-01-09T03:18:02.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this in depth thing.

Furthermore picking assassins such as {{champion:238}}, {{champion:91}} or {{champion:105}} are good ways to counter Viktor due to his inability to fend them off early game. Picking long range such {{champion:101}} is also a good idea as they can punish him for farming while being safe during the early game. \n\n\n* Viktor laning phase comes through his strong short term trading through his Q Auto Attack combo and/or Death Ray. VIktor suffers from long term trading due to him having high cooldowns early, going someone who is good at long term trading can punish Viktor hard. Viktor's trading patterns are binary and easy to read, if he is coming towards you most likely he is going for a trade, atm best trading starter is Auto into a Q into a AA buffed attack. Unlike Death Ray, Viktor cannot do this while moving, so simply going back can deny him damage easily. Also keep in mind that Death Ray will not interrupt Viktor movement. \n\n* During teamfights avoid fighting Viktor in narrow areas, through his W he thrives in this environment. In teamfights having assassins such as {{champion:107}} or {{champion:91}} can make him non-existant in teamfights due to how hard and fast they can burst a squishy down. Hard Engage or Lockdown champions like {{champion:54}} can keep him in control as well. Also if Viktor has a Lich Bane he can do a lot of a damage to any champion with LB proc + Enhanced Q AA, so keep that in mind when playing squishies.","replies":[{"poster":"JoBilly","date":"2016-01-09T01:10:36.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I used some stuff :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-01-08T08:09:12.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc makes Viktor useless.
