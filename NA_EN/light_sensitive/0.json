My new computer has low storage space. I want to download league but 14 gb is impossible to free up on my new computer. If I go to my fully updated old computer's riot games folder and click properties, the size of everything is just over 6gb. I can manage 6gb on my new computer but can I actually download league of legends without having 14gb of storage?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-20T21:48:22.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the time being, the initial install is still set for 14gb. It's a little confusing, but after installing the client the latest patch will remove some unused files to reduce the overall size. Over the course of the next few patches that install size should be reduced, but I'm not 100% sure when that will be officially.","replies":[]}]}
