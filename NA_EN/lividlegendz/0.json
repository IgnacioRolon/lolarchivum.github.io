The amount of AD scales with level. 5~14 additional AD based on level. This effect stacks and is lost when you haven&#039;t landed a spell on a target within 6 seconds.\n\nQ:\nThrow a projectile in a line, cleaving through all enemies hit, dealing 10% less damage per subsequent target after the first, but only down to a minimum of 70% damage. This applies a mark to all targets that when broken with a basic attack, slows the target. Breaking one mark removes all marks on other targets.\n- Scales AD\n\nW:\nSlash furiously upward, sending out a shock wave that deals damage and knocks the first enemy champion hit up briefly, all other enemy champions are knocked adjacent to the first champion.\n- Scales AD\n\nE:\nStab at a select target, dealing damage and gain movement speed. If the target was a champion, gain 2 stacks of your passive instead of 1.\n- Scales AD\n\nR:\nWhenever you land a basic spell on an enemy, gain 1 charge of your ultimate. If this spell doesn't hit an enemy, all charges are lost and you cannot receive charges for the next 11/8/5/2 seconds. This spell is available at level 1.\nDash forward a large distance, attacking and stopping at the first enemy you come into contact with. Enemies in a semi-circle in front of you take a lesser damage. This ability has no cooldown and rests only on it's charges to be effective.\n- Scales AD\n\nThe character is designed to trade well in lane and be a constant bully but has minimal escapes, being as if you don't land your ult on something you can't use it again for some time. This gives him a balanced early game of pressure and risk while allowing a very effective late game, if he is allowed there.\n\nThe character would play and act much like a fighter. In the early game, focusing on quick burst when you don't have all your skills available, probably owning high cooldowns for the inherent burst the character would have from having an ult at level 1 and turning into an initiation and consistent damage into the mid and late game when he has cooldown rate.\n\nHaving the AD gaining passive allows him to build a more tanky or bruiser build while still dealing the damage needed to stay viable though the game. The biggest issue with the character is they have no inherent sustain and no means of getting a burst of health because none of his abilities proc life steal or on-hit effects. This can force the character out of all in trades in lane as well as being at that large disadvantage against other champions that have inherent sustain, such as Fiora or Renekton or Nasus or Darius. Though what makes up for this is the very reliable damage he provides. With the spells in his kit, initiating from a range with Q into dashing on them and getting the slow off level 1, procing TLD or gaining Fervor stacks (whichever one may choose, if you choose a more damage oriented route instead of a sustain keystone like Grasp), could make even the biggest lane bullies like Renekton have to shy away from the wave for a while.\n\nHis cooldowns, but only in the early game, would need to be fairly long so that they would suffer from long trades and fights early on to balance the character.\n\nThank you, if you got this far, and any feedback is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-20T05:31:56.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we'll call it braumkalizereal","replies":[{"poster":"LividLegendz","date":"2016-09-20T05:44:57.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took me a second, but it does seem like a Braumkalizereal.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-20T06:30:19.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh. either that or ted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T05:29:28.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"based on how hard it seems to even just have any thought of csing at level 1-3. let's name it fiora(1st rework that ended up at 2015 worlds) {{champion:114}} \n\nTbh, i think it could be name something like \"Despot\" ik doesn't sound fancy, but that kit screams lane dominance like a tyrant invading a small village with a large army.","replies":[{"poster":"LividLegendz","date":"2016-09-20T05:44:19.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering I have no idea what to call it, I can do Despot. Name don't have to be fancy to make the character menacing as it seems. And thank you, lol. I was going for lane dominance with the downside of 0 sustain, to set the character in line. So I am glad that got across.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T06:15:03.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's prob better the make his ult a level 6 thing, like how tahm kench's passive used to be on his ult, just so that the character isn't litterally able to blow you up pre 6. the idea is nice, but there's so much into the abilities that having no sustain is overclassed by the fact he/she has overwhelming damage. That or i assume abilities like his W have an extremely long cooldown like 15-20 seconds so it cant be spammed so early\n\nOther than that, the concept is wonderful, and would attract me to play toplane more.","replies":[{"poster":"LividLegendz","date":"2016-09-20T13:28:08.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should probably write some more specifics on it, but I would imagine if he had it level 1 that all of his abilities had comparably lower base damages than other character skills but still enough to prove he has a lane dominance. And yes, the cooldowns are suppose to be almost unbearably long in the early levels, down to normal into the higher levels to make the late game not awkward.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
