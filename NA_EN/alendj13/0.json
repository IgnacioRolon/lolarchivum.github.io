I got a bug splat and by the time i got into the game they had remade the game but it said i connected and it still remade. Please this should not be happening and I think it is very stupid that this happens to players that don't deserve it. please if you could do something about this that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T20:21:52.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may have been gone long enough to trigger the remake, even if you did reconnect.  It's really important to get whatever is causing you to crash fixed up; otherwise, you'll run into more penalties.  The bugsplat may be due to outdated drivers or game files, so I recommend going over each step in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) to rule out any possibilities.  Hopefully, that helps get you back in game iwthout issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Alendj13","date":"2016-10-05T02:21:17.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have my drivers and everything up to date and i havent had problems with it before and i didnt have problems after that game it was just that game. And i had gotten back into the game at the time when the vote for a remake came up and the game said it would do a revote and then the game ended and i lost lp and got the leaver buster. is there nothing i can do about the timers and LP?","replies":[]}]}]}
