I believe right now the pacing of League is starting to feel good again. However, league is at its best when teams/teammates can work together on creative combos, tactics, clever decision making, etc. Also the meta gets more boring when the least amount of champions are viable in pro play. I love playing and watching league, but will stop watching games for the day when I see the same 14-18 champions picked again and again. There is only so much trundle/sej jungle I can stand to watch. It's fun when creativity and daring choices can be viable, and honestly you can hear this in the crowd. Anytime a champion is hovered that hasn't been played in awhile the crowd gets excited, but then sighs with disappointment when it goes back to a safe meta pick. It's exciting when things get diverse. I know this can be hard to balance for, but with all of that being said I would be careful defining what a \"really slow/boring meta is.\" if the game becomes too fast, it moves into a twitch-reaction space that starts to resemble a mess, making it harder to pull off intended combinations and play. I think you have to give more credit to viewers who like being able to see intentionality. As a long time soccer player and spectator, it had a similar problem in the US early on. Some thought it was boring, until the game was explained to them more or they watched more than one game. The game opens up over time, and people start to see the ever going game, the choices being made, the back and forth, and risks, etc. Now most people I know enjoy watching soccer over other sports, even though the pace hasn't really changed. I agree it doesn't move at a snail's pace, but the moment it feels rushed or disjointed it's no longer fun to watch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dazerth","date":"2018-08-28T17:21:13.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about utility runes like Cdr and spell vamp?","replies":[{"poster":"Seer of Mind","date":"2018-08-29T04:51:58.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe that spell vamp will be returning, it was completely removed because of {{champion:8}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-08-29T17:52:59.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After Morgana's passive change it only exists in name in Lee Sin's W second cast and Maw.

I get that there were people who actually liked this season meta.  Anyone who was a big Lee Sin, Shaco, or other early game damage focused champion was loving it.\n\nThing is for the rest of us we basically felt like we didn't get to play what we wanted for almost an entire season because it was phased out.  I want to go back to playing more tanks for example, so I hope the last set of changes did enough to accomplish that.\n\nI still think scuttle crab changes were a mistake, primarily because they give big bonuses for things the player can't affect.  It forces people to play junglers that will win duels, and then move to the side of the map the scuttle happens to spawn on or lose it.  The other problem is that if one team is ahead that jungler just gets all the scuttles (and free vision + healing because of the plants) coming out with a gold and exp bonus.  Also, as a jungler there are other things I would rather be focusing on: towers, dragon, herald, baron, ganks, my red/blue buff and my enemies red/blue buff.  Adding scuttle to that list is one too many things to have to rotate on.\n\nOther stuff I'm relatively okay on.  I do believe duskblade and stormrazer probably give too much damage, but I like the idea of the items.  I also don't mind runes reforged even though I would like to see even more rune options added in.\n\nDecoupling stats from page choices is also a very good idea following the rune update and I'm glad to hear about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King I Rat","date":"2018-08-30T05:33:30.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=00xirEwa,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2018-08-28T16:55:24.442+0000)\n>\n> We talked about this a bit, and there&#x27;s another post coming on Friday, but during preseason we&#x27;re going to be splitting stats out from rune paths, and allowing you to select which ones you want.

Give people choices. The current Runes Reforged gives you the options of \"Damage, more damage, utility maybe\". If they want to go full glass-cannon then so be it. If they want to get some early resistrances to deal with an enemy assassin/burst mage then so be it.
