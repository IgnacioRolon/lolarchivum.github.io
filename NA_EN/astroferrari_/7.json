Longer than Akali's shroud. Once Zed uses his W, he's open since it's his only escape tool and damage amplifier. A good Zed never uses his W carelessly","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-12-17T16:28:14.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it's not.

I was an akali main. I hated the rework. I found it clunky and and difficult to use correctly. It just didnt flow well to me. I stopped playing her almost entirely. Plus she doesn't do anything for damage. Sure she can zip in and out, but her hits just arent anything compared to other assassins. Fizz ult can almost 1-shot you at level 6. Kayne can almost do the same. Akali has to hit like 4-6 times before killing a champ which is silly for a squish assassin. Her ult is good for finishing low health champs and escaping, but doesnt do anything near what other assassins can do right now for damage. Her win rate is crap because even though she is annoying to play against in lane, ultimately she is ineffective at winning games. I dont even know why people ban her, she isn't even a threat! When I see akali on the other team I know I'm going to win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l love Ahri","date":"2018-12-17T13:52:35.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatever CertainlyT makes will go through and make it to live.
