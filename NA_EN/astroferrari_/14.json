While I don&#039;t truly feel all that bad, it&#039;s hard to tell myself \"focus only on what I can do better and try very hard not to blame your team\". Today, an adc Vayne on my team when 0/18/0 and blamed the loss on me for not jungling well when he or she lost bot lane right out of the gate. Now what most people are telling me is to articulate this and tell myself \"this loss was no ones fault, I would&#039;ve won if I did my job better\". I&#039;m sorry but that&#039;s total garbage to be. Granted I&#039;m not the best player but I know I&#039;m halfway decent. While I am still learning to jungle, I can put 2 and 2 together and know that my ganks have to be at least somewhat coordinated, and they shouldnt be done when I&#039;m low on health from farming. All I&#039;m really learning from this losing streak that I&#039;m on is that the other team simply played better than my team did and probably had better coordination. In solo q, the communication is always lacking no matter how much I try to talk or people are just trolls. Should I only play with people on my friends list? \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-07-26T07:35:20.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am going to address the Vayne thing. What did you do change the pace of the game, when Vayne is losing? Yes the Vayne sounds terrible, but once behind it can be hard for a bot lane (with no chemistry) to make a come back. \n\nFirst you need to start off how did the bot lane get so out of controal. Was it enemy jungle pressue, wandering mid laner, teleporting top lane, or just getting out played? What ever the answer is; what did you do to help compensate? \n\nAre you trying to turn around the other lane intervention? Are you watching mid turn to leave so you can intercept and pick them off or push down the tower? Are you getting your other lanes ahead so they are big enough threat that vayne can try to farm up at deeper tower while you are 4v5?\n\nYeah Vayne did horrible and was looking for an escape goat, but that does not matter. What did you do when the problem started (Vayne dying) to try to fix the game. What ever it was it did not work and you should look to what you did and adjust your game play from there ( as jungler).","replies":[{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2015-07-26T20:22:07.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first, I told them at the beginning of the game, please communicate if you need ganks because I'm still getting used to reksai and I need to time my ganks to make them effective. The Vayne gave up one kill by accident and blame me for it while I was helping gank top (both of my top ganks were successful). It was funny because that game, my team barely saw the enemy jungler. I started to try and camp bot lane to help Vayne out but I told him to wait for me cause I still needed to farm up. He didn't listen and kept going in himself. He wasn't even really working with his support and started blaming the support too. Next thing you know he's already 0/5/0 at 11 minutes. So at that point I was lost on what to do and mid lane ( a Heimerdinger) was having some trouble too.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-07-26T21:52:44.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i was just trying to give you a starting point for reflection. Vayne tilted hard and probably blames everyone and their mother for his plays. \n\nSo from what you are saying the ganks (to correct bot lane) might of been to forced. It is one thing you ganking when you think you can solo a kill in a behind lane; compared to i can gank but i need the lane to help me. When the lane is behind with a tiliting laner, ganking could be the worse thing to do. You might of been better of rolling other lanes instead of helping bot. A lot of players seem to think it is the junglers job to correct lanes, it is not.\n\nYou just need to really look at what happened and say what did my actions accomplish and what mistakes you made in the gank. Next for self reflection is when i made the choice to go to X lane were there other choices, if the original plan failed.  This is just self reflection stuff to do after the game to see what you could of done, for personal improvement. When in game believe in your choices, just reexamine them later to learn what you can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iluvalar","date":"2015-07-26T14:37:06.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't agree with some comment here. If Vayne went 0/18/0 she was trash. Vayne is a range champion with a good escape. She can easily stay in EXP range and even CS at least at 40% without dying at all. Instead she chose to takes risk, she gave to her laner a equivalent of 270 extra CS with bad decisions and bad positioning.\n\nIf you can't every game learn from your small mistakes, at least those of Vayne are big enough to get a lesson from them.\n\n0/1/0 : play safe, the exp range is large you never have to walk into the opponent range, so you shouldn't die again.\n\n0/2/0 : Ok you played safish, but you got ganked. Buy a ward next time it wont happen again.\n\n0/3/0 : Oh gosh.. You wont do damage, you just give kills. So stop building damage, stop giving kills and maybe someone else in your team is less trash then you and will carry you.\n\n0/4/0 : Read 0/3/0  !\n0/5/0 : Read 0/3/0  !\n0/6/0 : Read 0/3/0  !\n0/7/0 : You still have no armor, you still walk into the opponents range, you still burn your thumble and not keep it for escaping. uninstall","replies":[{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2015-07-26T20:23:47.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha at 0/7/0 he started to intentionally feed :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-26T07:21:24.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll leave this bit of advice I found on a different post. Talk to yourself as you play, even just in your head, and say what you're doing and why. For example, \"I'm doing 'a' because 'b.'\" If you can find a reason to justify what you're doing, then do it. Otherwise, find something else. If you get good at this, you can get more complicated with an explanation of \"I'm doing 'a' because 'b.' I could be doing 'c,' but 'a' puts me more ahead because 'd.'\"\n\nSomething to tack onto this. If what you're doing isn't putting you or a teammate ahead, then it's not worth it. You want to always be doing something to get your team ahead. Got nothing better to do? Get a deep jungle ward. Steal a camp. Push a lane. Take Drag/Baron. If there's truly nothing else to do, group with the rest of your team. No matter what happens, your team is always stronger together.","replies":[{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2015-07-26T20:22:57.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually really, I'll take this to heart.

For instance I have a 75% winrate with jungle teemo on my gold smurf, but when I tried playing it in lower elo it was something like 55%. In lower elo you need to play champions who can make plays often and can turn things around easily ON THEIR OWN because your team is going to suck.\n\nExpect you solo laners never to roam and the enemies' will.\nYou bot lane will not be responsive to your ganks, but the enemies' will.\nThe enemy jungler will counter-jungle you and your team will usually make little effort to help you.\nYou will get blamed for everything because you are jungle; even if someone dies before you finish your first buff (has happened to me).\n\nUse champs like udyr or vi, who can do everything themselves if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2015-07-26T20:17:13.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah usually when I'm against xin zhao, udyr, or shaco their the ones who usually arent afraid to counter jungle or go in.
