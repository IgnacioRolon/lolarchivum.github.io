It has a high cooldown, and It does not do much damage. Its mostly used for ganks, or to get that adc azz. If you are saying vi's ult is Op then I feel bad for those who have to deal with you.","replies":[{"poster":"ibeturgood","date":"2015-05-30T03:44:20.504+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Quicksilver Sash should counter it like every other Suppression.

It's a knockup stun, so it's not reducable by Tenacity and cannot be cleansed.\n\nThe counterplay to Vi's ult is that she is forced to dive you to use it.  She also can't stop if it turns out diving you was a very bad idea.  She's immune to CC, but not damage.  And if you're near a tower, flashing under it is likely to kill her.\n\nIf you let yourself get poked down to the point where she can one-shot you with it, that's your fault.  There are plenty of champs who can delete a half-health ADC with one ability rotation (if not one ability), and most of them don't have to put themselves at the same kind of risk or have much better escapes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-05-30T03:59:19.288+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's not *supposed* to be easily countered.
