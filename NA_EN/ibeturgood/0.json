Most of his losses are from him not playing properly rather than problems with his kit.\n\nHe \"falls off\" because he usually has to build defense which he doesn't scale with NEARLY as well as straight AD. So he can't 1 shot people anymore if he gets the E->R->Q->Q off if he doesn't build straight AD/Armor Pen later into the game. Thus \"falling off\".\n\nHe is toxic because of his absurd damage with dat AD scaling.
