All other games I own does not lock up so it's definitely not a hardware issue or conflict. I do believe it's a sound issue on your end and it does not just affect Mac users.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T19:17:46.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should be able to take a look and see what is going on, but first I need to get a better understanding of your exact issue.  When you say that you \"lock up\", do you mean the entire game freezes and your entire computer locks up, forcing you to turn it off and restart?  Or does your screen not move, but you can hear all of the sounds in the game and can kick out and try to get back in?  \n\nReply back and I should be able to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Kid Kushi","date":"2016-06-06T21:27:03.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game stutters really hard, then will freeze, then play catch up, rinse & repeat. It starts to happen mostly in team fights then continues for the rest of the game.  I've tried alt tabbing to the desktop, and also ctrl alt tab to open the task manager, and that takes 3 to 5 minutes to even switch to.\n\nI can hear the sound of my music and sometimes the game when it's freezes. I've tried playing without Google music on and it doesn't fix the issue.
