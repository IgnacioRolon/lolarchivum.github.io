Know that we have a strict stance against consistent negativity, as it is offensive, and as it ruins other player's experience.\n\nLooking at your account's history it looks like you were warned about this behavior with a previous two-week suspension. Please understand that a two-week suspension puts an account on very thin ice, and all negative behavior will need to stop immediately or the account will be permanently suspended.\n\nI'm sorry that this game was so frustrating for you, and while it might feel like you are being singled out we will look into every player in this situation, and make sure that nothing was overlooked as it's not acceptable for players to harass you. We will look into it and take the actions we think are appropriate. You will never be told if an action has been taken against a specific player. You will from time to time receive a message stating that a player you reported has been dealt with, but that is a rare message to receive as it is random on whether or not the message is sent. However, this doesn't mean that nothing is being done about it.\n\nI understand how frustrating this game can be at times, but it's not acceptable to berate others or insult them. Understand that we treat this type of behavior strictly as it ruins the experience for others. While these single instances of negativity would not be enough to ban your account outright. You have been persistent in this type of behavior, so a discipline was applied.\n\nKnow that each player is held responsible for their own actions, so If players are flaming you or being offensive, it's never beneficial to respond to them with flame, whether it's in self-defense or if it's out of frustration. It's always best to mute negative players and report them in the post game lobby, so you don't get disciplined as well.\n\nPlease understand that once an account is justly suspended permanently, that there is no way to regain access to the account or any of its content. Our stance is strict because we want players to take the reform process seriously.\n\nI wish you luck moving forward on whatever game you decide to play from here.\n\nSkeletor\nRiot Games Player Support","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-02T00:27:01.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what's confusing about that?","replies":[{"poster":"kysifviktortop","date":"2019-02-02T00:30:45.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"absolutely everything I definitely should not be banned rn its ridiculous","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-02T00:34:34.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were given a very clear final warning and continued to be toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"kysifviktortop","date":"2019-02-02T00:38:21.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"wasnt toxic .","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-02T00:45:40.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You spent almost the entire game flaming people.\n\nIt doesn't matter if they started it.

It’s one of the options for reporting, as well as the fact that multiple other people have been banned/forced to change their username because of this.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if Viktor top is “op.” That doesn’t give you the right to make your username toxic like that","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-02-02T00:26:02.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly surprised that you weren't forced to change your name.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-02-02T00:36:10.799+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kysifviktortop,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ay8O8zUr,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-02-02T00:05:40.525+0000)\n> kysifviktortop: keep talking tard\n> kysifviktortop: im better than you\n> kysifviktortop: stupid\n> kysifviktortop: unintelligent waste of space and time\n\nWhen you insult other players (whether they started it or not), you are in violation of the rules.

The reason you got a _perma_ ban is not because of this one game. It’s the entirety of your toxic history that led to this outcome. That game just served as the trigger. Chat restrictions and 14-day bans don’t reset your history, they are just warnings that if you don’t stop being toxic you will get banned. \nLet’s say your history looked like this:\n1. 15 toxic chatlogs: 10 game CR\n2. 10 more toxic chatslogs after the restriction ended: 25 game CR\n3. After that, 5 more toxic chatlogs: 14-day ban\n4. 1 last toxic chatlog: permanent ban\nIn the example above you wouldn’t get permanentally banned for that 1 last toxic chatlog but for the 31 logs combined. \n\nThe chatlog you posted would, if even, probably only trigger a CR by itself but in combination with your history it resulted in a permanent suspension so saying “but this was a single game” is not a valid argument.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
