Spectate option is avaliable but every time i click it i get the loading circle instead of mouse button, and a black screen, after a while it says \"spectator mode failed\" or it simply does not respond.\r\n\r\nIn 80% of time i have to shut down the process thru task manager or force shutdown on it.\r\n\r\nIt's been hapening for a while and i was wondering am i the only one with this problem and how do i fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T19:42:09.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports on spectate this morning, but haven't had follow ups to look into it further.  Is on the updated or legacy client?  Does spectate work fine on the legacy?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nAlso, generally black screens like that can be caused by network issues blocking access to the game server.

Also i have a 94mbps speed so my connection problem is out of the way.\n\nEverything else working fine on my PC (google, youtube, etc), and i as well have a pretty solid PC so i doubt it's something related with that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SepharU","date":"2017-01-24T20:08:18.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the answer i got from Riot for 1 hour ago.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHello there,\n\nThanks for reaching out to me.
