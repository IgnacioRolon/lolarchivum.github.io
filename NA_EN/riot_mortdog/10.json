The item system is a key part of the game that creates a ton of cool decision points and exciting moments. But we’ve also heard your feedback that how we distribute items over the course of the game is not as good as it could be. In past communications we’ve been clear we’re not going to just give everyone the same amount of items as that leads to a flat and repetitive experience where you know exactly what to expect every game. We want there to be multiple paths to victory in TFT and one of the ways we want to do that is by keeping the item system variable. However, we’ve taken a look at how we can make improvements and have some exciting stuff coming to PBE.\r\n\r\n**What is changing?**\r\n\r\nFirst off, you'll notice that instead of just one type of box, there are now Common, Uncommon, and Shiny Rare boxes that can drop, each with their own distinct loot tables. Now when you get a higher quality box, you can get excited about what’s inside, and have a bit more expectations about what outcomes are possible. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are new drop possibilities. Items and gold can still drop just like before, but we’ve also added Champions and \"Neeko's Help\" (name pending). Champions that drop from the boxes will be added directly to your bench. (Note: If your bench is full, the units are just directly converted to gold instead. No tricky business with the bench and board!) We’re hoping that getting champs will pull you into unique build paths. And if not, you can simply sell them. Lastly, a new consumable item “Neeko’s Help” can also drop. This item allows you to make a 1* copy of any unit which then consumes the item. This should make your dreams of getting that 3* champion just a little easier.\r\n\r\nNow I already know what you’re thinking. “This sounds like a bunch of RNG!” Well it is and it isn’t. Behind the scenes we’ve done a LOT to control how we distribute the boxes, as well as what’s inside the boxes. Our goal is that games have a lot of variation, but that they also have some degree of fairness to them. So the amount of boxes are much more controlled across the entire game. The difference between the best and worst cases is now much more narrow than before.\r\n\r\nFor example, on live after first three PVE rounds you can get 9 gold &amp; 0 items, 3 gold &amp; 1 item, all the way up to 6 items. It’s a pretty wide spread. In the new system, after the first three PVE rounds every player is guaranteed at least 2 Uncommon boxes, then 1-3 additional boxes. In addition, the total number of boxes and items across the entire game is much more controlled. If you start off slow, there are more boxes and items coming. We also prevent the most extreme and wacky cases (no gold boxes before stage 2-6, no more than 3 gold boxes per person max, etc). There are a ton of tuning levers and controls in here to try to keep things fair and competitive, while also being varied and exciting. This also makes it easier for us in the future to make adjustments if our first values aren’t correct.\r\n\r\n**Why is it changing?**\r\n\r\nAgain, we think variety is important to the long term health of the game. One of the things that keeps Teamfight Tactics replayable is that every game is different and you experience new and exciting combinations. That being said, we need to achieve that goal in a way that feels fair and fun for everyone. We’re hoping this is a big step in that direction. With even more possible combinations, the variety should increase. But this way it’s more fair across the length of the game. No more 1 item 3 gold into 5 gold starts while your opponent has 6 items.\r\n\r\nNow you may get 2 items, a Kennen, and a Neeko to start, while your opponent gets 3 items and 2 gold. There are lots of unique possibilities and you can use them to your advantage to succeed. An early 2 star Kennen could for sure outperform 1 more item. The possibilities and paths to victory should be numerous now. We think that’s better for the game, and frankly more fun!\r\n\r\nThis is also why we’re talking about it now. If you have a PBE account give it a try, then let us know what you think (I know it’s tempting to assume without trying it). If we're wrong, and it feels worse, then we won’t ship it. We’re committed to making TFT as fun and high quality as possible, and we think this does it, but we’re not too proud to admit if we’re wrong.\r\n\r\n**When do we expect the changes to go through?**\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, and the change is feeling good, we’re hoping to ship it as part of our very large 9.18 patch. It will go out with the new item component, as well as some changes to the XP curve to make up for the slightly inflated rewards. This will be our biggest patch of the set, and should really shake things up for the better.\r\n\r\nAgain, looking forward to all your feedback, and I hope you keep enjoying TFT as much as I enjoy working on it.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uvpqAmu.png","replies":[{"poster":"Cräfty","date":"2019-08-29T19:31:05.668+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"Although I welcome your efforts to limit the influence of RNG on the items drop rate across the board, I need to say that TFT has a much larger problem that needs to be dealt with: **Pathfinding**.\n\n* Units, from when the game was still in PBE to this day, still go AFK randomly, costing us rounds, and even games!\n\n* Units, sometimes, don't follow the shortest path towards enemy units and get stuck in weird spots.\n\n* Units don't walk **smoothly** across the board. They move, hex by hex, stopping in each hex for a brief delay before continuing their movement, which cost us precious time during the fights, especially if the rest of the fight is happening on the other side of the board.\n\n* If the current target of my units die, while they were moving towards it, my units will stop, go AFK for a bit before resuming movement towards the nearest enemy available. This leads, in so many cases, to units going AFK permanently for the rest of the fight.\n\n* {{champion:102}}'s AI still sucks in patch 9.17. She still gets stuck mid transformation and goes AFK for a bit. This happens especially late game, when the board has too many units on it.\n\n* {{champion:63}}'s ability bounces more times than intended, on live servers right now, dealing too much unintended damage.\n\nAnd a lot of other problems that need immediate attention to them. So, instead of using your time on new additions to the game - which are always appreciated but not now - maybe you should work on the more urgent issues in the game, first.\n\nImho, your priority should be to fix the AI of all the units, the pathfinding and the tracking of certain abilities (like Brand's ult). Movement should feel smoothe across the board, units should move and attack as they're supposed to and abilities should track units as they're supposed to, etc.\n\nTrying to limit the RNG influence over the game is OK, but a lot of us have already adapted and learned to deal with it. The problems that I mentioned are much more game breaking and needs to be fixed ASAP before adding anything new to the game, since they constitute the core mechanics of TFT!","replies":[{"poster":"Razor Feather","date":"2019-08-29T21:02:07.449+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I 100% agree that the pathfinding/afk issues are a problem and fixing them should be a high priority, I feel the need to state that it is pretty unlikely that the changes stated here along with the new items being added actually conflict development wise with any pathfinding work. \n\nThe number of devs working on tft is large enough for a reasonable degree of specialization, and the tasks involved in making pathfinding work better and making new item mechanics are pretty different, as one requires lots of technical optimization and one requires lots of game rule design. That, combined with the fact that adding more people to a team that is already working on a particular task actually makes it take longer in many cases, as the people already on the team need to spend time helping the newcomers catch up, means that unless riot has literally no one working on pathfinding already then they can’t really make it go any faster by reallocating resources.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2019-08-29T22:27:29.699+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance for carrousel to be looked at too?

Allow me to educate you, in your argument u say that Negatron cloak is terrible. If it is, you should be on the lower end of HP for future carousels and should be in a position to obtain recurves or other items necessary. \n\nThere are a multitude of great items negatron can form for many comps.\n\nGunslingers - on hits like cursed blade/Hush/Disarm use it.\nProtecc the Jinx/Draven - BT or Dragons claw both amazing items for ensuring ur carry continues to dish out amazing damage.\nHyper carry jinx/draven(less protecc more attacc) - double ruunaans + RFC on a draven well positioned almost guarntees u 1st place in any game.\nShapeshifter/wild - every put a dragonsclaw on gnar? a 2nd line champion that doesnt eat front line physical aa's but eats a ton of splash ability dmg. it basically guarntees your gnar/shyvanna(without asol/panth) transforms which can decidely win matches.\n\nanti-assassin comp or anti hypercarry with zephyr. as someone who is D4 in TFT i can't tell you how many games ive guarnteed top 4 because of Zephyr. \nThat triple spear of shojin pyke spam during week 1 of release wouldnt destroy my team.\nThe exodia 3 yordle/2 demon/3 sorc of week 2 of release, that Kennen or AAtrox wouldnt touch my team till it was too late.\nThe crazy \"whoever gets karthus first wins\" meta on week 4-5 of release. zephyr would let me melt his sorc comp without him ulting.\n\nThe item ofc isnt a \"damage\" item but its still a useful item, much like any other.

Simply because you can't comprehend running anything other than a Draven/Jinx comp doesn't mean that Tears, Belts, Rod, etc are extremely useful for comps involving sorcs and elementalists. Components for GA are very valuable in any composition.\n\nNext, I hit D4 in less than a week after being away from the meta for 3 weeks, so I don't need any TFT advice (or advice of any kind for that matter) from someone that is actually Platinum 1 but feels the need to lie about their rank in a comment section and also begins a comment on an online forum with \"you must not be very smart\".\n\nThirdly, I still maintain despite your protests that Negatron Cloak is hands down the worst first item you can get on the first carousel. Since you didn't understand the first time, going on a lose streak for economy is not a winning strategy in this level 7 roll down after wolves. A Negatron Cloak start does not force you, but usually positions you to go on a lose streak.  It's obvious Dragon's Claw as a tech option against sorcerers/elementalists  but its value is extremely diminished early game, have you ever tried playing with Dragon's Claw as an item on one of your characters going into the first PvP round? It's not very good. How many times have you seen someone start with elementalists on the first three PvP rounds? Noone, because it is impossible to roll Brand that early. In your moral self-crusade, you just talk about items like Bloodthirster on Draven/Jinx, or instead, you could've just started with a B.F. Sword instead, giving the option to get Armour on the second carousel and make GA instead, building into any composition (or since you force Draven/Jinx every game, you can pick up a Negatron Cloak anyway and make BT).\n\nI suggested a solution for players like you who might want to take Negatron Cloak on the first carousel (but you don't, you're just arguing for the sake of arguing), only max 1 Negatron Cloak on the starting carousel and when given the option to random between the Negatron Cloak and any other item on the first carousel, give the player the other item.\n\nIn Hafu's AMA - https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/cw5btu/im_g2_hafu_challengerstreamer_ama/ey8zxob/ - she recommends to pick any item but Negatron Cloak on the first carousel  I agree with her because having a Negatron Cloak does not open up any options for compositions at all, if it was so flexible then you wouldn't have to reiterate BT/Dragon's Claw are the viable items that build out of Negatron Cloak when there are several other items that build into a) stronger items and b) more flexible items.\n\nGood luck climbing any higher when spamming two different \"protect the jinx/draven\" and \"hyper carry jinx/draven\" comps - in other words, you're the player that ran nobles Jinx/Draven the entirety of the last patch cycle. (P.S. You aren't amazing for switching your zephyr position last second to target their carry).
