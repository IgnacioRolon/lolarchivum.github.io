We've seen some questions about the speed you earn BE in the new system (compared to the earn rate on IP in the old system). We've always said that most players would earn champions either as quickly or faster than before. To prove it, let's look at the numbers. We want to be as transparent as possible about how everything works.\n\nFirst, a couple baselines to get us started.\nA Leveling Capsule contains champ shards with a BE value of either 720, 900, 960, or 1,240. (The average value is 910 based on drop rates)\nA Milestone Capsule (every 10 levels) contains champ shards valued at 1,980, 2,160, or 2,220. (The average value is 2,120 based on drop rates)\n\n* First win of the Day was worth 150 IP, and is now worth 575 XP.\n\n* A 37 Minute Game of PVP SR you WON was worth ~100 IP, and is now worth 251 XP.\n* A 37 Minute Game of PVP SR you LOST was worth ~67 IP, and is now worth 205 XP.\n\nSo with all this in mind, let’s look at two sample cases:\n\nCarl the Casual plays two games every night. He wins one and gets his First Win of the Day, and then loses the other.\nHenrietta the Hardcore plays 12 games every night. Wins six, Loses six, and gets First Win of the Day.\n\n* Carl will Level to 31 after 6 games and 3 Wins of the Day. In the old world, he would have earned ~801 IP. Now, he'll earn either 720 (The worst drop), 900, 960, or 1,240 blue essence. (EDIT: The 6th game, which is a win gives enough XP to level without the Win of the Day, which is why the math seems off. It technically was 6 games and 2 wins of the day of XP to level)\n\n* Henrietta will Level to 31 after 9 games and 1 Win of the Day. In the old world she would have earned ~885 IP. Now she'll earn either 720 (The worst drop), 900, 960, or 1,240 blue essence.\n\nLet's stick with Carl and Henrietta for a little bit longer. What happens when they play over a long period of time?\n\n* When Carl hits level 39, he would have earned a total of ~7,358 IP in the old system. Now he'll have 6,480 blue essence (if every roll was bad which is 0.005%), 8,190 blue essence (the average rolls), or 11,160 blue essence (if every roll was perfect)\n\n* When Henrietta hits level 39, she would have earned a total of ~8,381 IP in the old system. Now she'll have 6,480 blue essence (if every roll was bad which is 0.005%), 8,190 blue essence (the average rolls), or 11,160 blue essence (if every roll was perfect)\n\nBut now they are about to hit the milestone. At Level 40, they will get the much larger box. So:\n\n* When Carl hits level 40, he would have earned ~8,309 IP in the old system. Now he will have 8,460 blue essence (if every roll was bad which is 0.002%), 10,310 blue essence (the average rolls), or 13,380 blue essence (if every roll was perfect).\n\n* When Henrietta hits level 40, she would have earned ~9,383 IP. Now she will have 8,460 blue essence (if every roll was bad which is 0.002%), 10,310 blue essence (the average rolls), or 13,380 blue essence (if every roll was perfect).\n\nSo based on this, in the very unlikely event that every box you open is the worst case, you can end up a bit shorter in the new world. But **most players** will end up quite a bit better off.\n\nAnd this is BEFORE one more consideration. Let’s say you drop a Jinx shard which DE’s for 1,240 Blue Essence. If you need to unlock Jinx, you can use the Shard to get her for an extra 20% off. This means instead of paying 6,300 Blue Essence, you actually only pay 3,780 and use the shard. You basically get DOUBLE the BE value if you need that champ. So if you’re a new player who wants to unlock all the champions, each time you drop a champ you still need, we’ve greatly increased your IP/BE gain even more.\n\nHopefully this shines some light on what you can expect moving forward in the new system. As you can see, we honestly take want to make the best experience possible, and wanted to be sure things were an improvement. If you need champions, you are earning them a ton faster, and that’s not even including the new free runes. That being said, we also take feedback seriously. Reading all the feedback, and even triple checking our work, we see room for improvement. \n\n**The 720 drop from the leveling chest feels low to us, so we’re going to bump that up to 810 (This will change Henrietta’s worst case at level 40 to 9,270 blue essence, and the average to 10,580). This change will go live in the next 24 hours or so. **\n\nSo keep giving us feedback. We hope you really do enjoy the new leveling system, but if you don’t, let us know. Thanks, and have an awesome pre-season everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"jmp06281","date":"2017-11-08T20:32:28.675+0000","up_votes":255,"down_votes":6,"body":"My main issue with the new blue essence is that it is completely reliant on leveling up to gain rewards.\nFor example imagine if there was a champ you wanted to get and you just leveled up with the rewards from this level up giving you an amount of blue essence so that you are a single digit amount shy of having the champ.\nIn the old system you could just play a random game mode queue or an aram to just quickly get the ip needed. \nHowever, in the new system you can't do that and as a result you would have to grind out on average another 10 games to get just a small amount of blue essence.\nI can see this just being absolutely frustrating towards any parties involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-11-09T00:35:37.447+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":104,"body":"You're definitely not the only person who feels this way, so we hear you, and it's something we're talking about internally. \n\nWe always knew shit was gonna be crazy during preseason, so right now we’re just reading all the feedback and taking note of the problems like this that folks are pointing out.

And the higher you level the slower you lvl, so over time it just becomes a longer and longer and longer grind to get anything. The old system just gave you rewards gradually over time.\n\nAlso with this new system, you're basically punished for playing a lot. And rewarded for playing little.\n\nEither way, there was no reason for the new system, it makes people who play the game a lot feel worse off and people who play little better off. Which shouldn't be the case, BOTH types of players should be rewarded for the time they put in. \n\nYou very well could have done other things to improve the rate at which new players earn champions without making people who play a lot *feel* worse off. Yes your math may be correct and everything evens out. But its the *feel* of the system, it *feels* bad, EVEN with the math you provide. No one wants to earn stuff in big batchs, having to grind out several games upwards of 30, because they were 50 blue essence off buying a champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-11-09T04:44:31.263+0000","up_votes":133,"down_votes":5,"body":"This new system honestly kills my enthusiasm to play matches.

The ratio could be easily tuned away from 50/50.\n\nAs a further note to Rioters who may be lurking, this would make more sense psychologically. There is a direct and immediate reward after each game, as well as a sense of progression, as well as a goal for an even bigger reward, all while BE gains remain roughly the same.\n\nEDIT: Made a forum post about this that is getting no love \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/eb6v2FzE-a-better-solution-for-be-distribution","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArvDaBeast","date":"2017-11-09T15:44:00.441+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"They can had an easy solution.

If by the end of this year they won't do some big changes to the reward system, or even announce good changes that the community wants, player base will decline, since they will find other games. Plus, it's already too much for them to handle, people bashing them for the new runes. Imagine how on fire their office is now._\n\n- _Some of the devs talked about some BE changes and just spewed nonsensical numbers just to get to the decision to only add a 100 BE to the bad roll (but didn't take in cosideration that the old reward system already was extremely bad). But even a perfect roll is not even worth it now. People crave rewards, they will always crave it. Why do you think RPG games are so popular? They reward you with stuff. Riot doesn't even reward us with the champions that would allow us to have a full gameplay experience. So, even if I was ok with the old system, this now, what it is here, it's 100% pay to win._\n\n- _It doesn't have to be only accessible with money. Since imagine a game where you could only get that specific item in one year but they had the option to buy that item now. Isn't that pay to win? Will people wait to get that one item in one year? Never, people want constant rewards or their needs wont attract them to the game in the longer future._\n\n- _It's like being in a relationship with someone, but you only get satisfied once a year. Do you like that? No, no one will stay in such a toxic relationship._\n\nJust so you know, when I used \"spewed nonsensical numbers\" it's not to insult. It's the fact that people don't even read long texts that don't have to do with gameplay. Some of them didn't even read the new runes. Players want to see palpable rewards. Yet this does not make it feel that way. Makes it feel locked behind **100 doors** just to find out: **Oh, it's only that? Boooring**.\n\nYour target audience I think it's around, what? 10-30 year old players? Some have jobs, don't wanna grind all day and the young ones will just complain and not read, but they are those that let us see, hey, they didn't feel that it's ok, let's make it **FEEL** ok, not add more information that will eventually lead to total ignorance, since people are interested in the game, not other things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathe6","date":"2017-11-08T20:57:57.812+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ultimately the problem is that it feels really bad.  It's putting too much on leveling up.  Plus, BE is basically earned at the same rate as before, yet we now have more to use it on with champion mastery.  So, now you're forcing players to choose between champion mastery and getting new champions.  Psychologically, that just feels bad, probably because champion mastery feels like something we should just earn, not something we have to buy.  I don't like the idea that I'm good enough to have earned the level 7 tokens on a champion, but now I've got to make a choice between making that progress and picking up a new cool champion.  \n\nWhy is this different from buying runes before?  Probably ownership.  I 'bought' new runes before with IP, champion mastery isn't really ownership, it's status.  \n\nI understand a lot of this is just people complaining about change.

The quote that I wanna address goes as follows:  \"Carl the Casual plays two games every night. He wins one and gets his First Win of the Day, and then loses the other.\" What you are doing here is taking the statistical average of a 50% winrate and apply it to a small amount of games to make use it in an example, which is generally a valid thing to do. But then the assumption is made that for any given day you get at least one win, which is wrong as seen in the following:\n\n -the chance of winning a game is 0.5 for every single game that you play\n -the chance of winning 2 games per 2 played games is therefore 0.5*0.5=0.25,\n -the chance of winning one game and losing the other is 2*0.5*0.5=0.5 (because you can either win the first or the second game),\n -now the last case is losing 2 games which happens with a 0.5*0.5=0.25 chance\n\nYou can tell this is right because the percentages add up to a hundred (25%+50%+25%=100%).\nThe cases in which you do get the \"First win of the Day\" bonus are: one win, two wins.\nThe chances of one of them happening is equal to the sum of their percentages 0.5+0.25=0.75.\nSo the chance of you getting the \"First win of the Day\" bonus is 75% instead of the 100% that was used in your assumption.\n\nAs I was writing I noticed yet another flaw in the assumptions made. You say that the casual player plays ON AVERAGE two games per day which might be a number that comes from your database and seems pretty reasonable. The assumption made based on this is: the casual player plays two games per day.\nFrom experience I think a great majority of players would disagree with this statement since for example, we play more on weekends than during the week (which I am sure the aforementioned database contains proof of). So if you wanted to get statistically representable numbers in the BE calculations you would have to find out about, for example: how many days a week does the casual player play a game ?\n\nTo combine both of these corrections you would have to also figure out how many games the casual player plays on days when he does actually play the game. From there on you need to also find out what the chance is to get a win on that average day. For example: If the average number of games per \"playday\" would be 6 the chance to not win a single one of them is 0.5^6, so the chance of you getting at least one win on that day would be 1-0.5^6=63/64 which is about 98.44%. Let's suppose you only play once every three days (example number since I don't know the real number) this would lead to the same average of two games per day. Now to calculate the average amount of \"First win of the Day\" bonuses you get in a given amount of days you multiply 1/3 with the 98.44%. This would lead to a chance of 0.328 which I will round to 33%. Note that this is a statistical number that would express the chance of a casual player getting the first win of the day bonus on any given day, if you didn't know if the player would actually play.This is just for the given numbers I made up, but feel free to use your own, just keep in mind that you have to get to two games per day on average. In the example given in the article this number would be 100%. Now if you use your own numbers you will always get to a chance below 100%.\n\nNow I am done with the neutral part of explaining the mistakes made when trying to make statistical averages fit into an exemplary calculation and I wanna speculate as to why they were made. The first thing that comes to mind would be incompetence regarding maths, which I will not consider here since it would be insulting and, given the number of people working for Riot, highly unlikely. I mean someone must have checked this right? The second option is intentional miscalculation and misrepresentation of data to trick the consumers/players. And lastly I wanna mention that there is a third case of statistical cherrypicking: you calculate some number of blue essence players get until level 40, but as far as I know the amount of xp needed to level up is not constant but rather increases with later levels. This should not be disregarded in your \"oh so representative, statistically accurate calculations\". Sorry for the increasing anger but I don't believe that this can be brushed off as\"oh they just made a mistake whatever\". Honestly I hope I get a response like \"Seems like we did not do the calculations for the new system properly. We will look into this.\" but I just do not think it will happen.

Then by lvl 40, she would have 258 x 9 =  **2322 more IP then stated**. Meaning the average gain in the old system was in fact at least 9,383 + 2322 = **11705 IP**. So even if the average is **10580 BE**, it is still **9.6% less, then we got in season 7**.\n\nNote this is just a lower estimate, so the real difference is couple percent higher. (I cant give you exact numbers, since I dont know how much XP is needed for each lvl.)\n\nI thought about a reason, why are real numbers much higher than what you stated. One of them is probably matchmade IP bonus, which I remember being about 18 IP for shorter games (25 min), so that could be the difference, in case you didnt include that into your calculations.","replies":[]}]}
