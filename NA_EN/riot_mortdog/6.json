But i think you’re missing the point, for many of us, the greatest fun in urf was getting someone like helicopter hecarim and beyblade garen, when the community found out the e stacked on each other, it was great. People raced into the mode to try and pull something rare to absolutely dominate the competition, this is the reason for urf being one of, if not, the most asked for modes. With these nerfs and balance changes, you’re making an attempt to change it into a less chaotic mode. You need to understand that the mode is fun BECAUSE of this strength that players have with certain picks. Would love to see URF continue as a mode full of chaos and players getting a chance to truly, rapid fire cast their abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Gispry","date":"2019-02-01T14:40:56.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes I agree with this. Though I also understand why riot doesn't want to bring back old urf. However, I do want to see an iteration of urf where it is not all random. Maybe chaos urf where you start the game at level 6 with 5k gold and you get a increased gold per minute but no gold on champion kills thus decreasing the punishment for feeding, decreasing the game length and decreasing the amount people will get salty at the game mode while still giving people choice of what champ they want to play.

It's both a self-fulfilling prophecy and a vicious cycle to neglect a game mode because you expect it to be less popular, and then justify the neglect by the fact that the game mode is less popular. Players complain about Summoner's Rift feeling stale if the meta doesn't change for a few weeks/months.

The first one is to don't try to balance a fun gamemode and don't make it random, since most of the players are waiting for that 1 champ for 40-50-60 games to play it and they won't even enjoy that since the enemy is that much stronger or weaker. The second one is removing the baron/dragon, or give them something like baron buff is that your minions will permanently spam emotes and dragon is that your minion does some kind of taunt if they kill an enemy or something like that, be creative with that.The 3rd one is that you should add revive with like 80-100 second cooldown, since one of the worst thing in the game is waiting on the grey screen, so people would find more fun in it,and maybe reduce death timers.The next summoner spell which should be added is Clairvoyance since it helps things like lux r ezreal r sniping etc... i think thats about it, i hope you consider trying this out or just think about it, do a vote in the client or something. \n\nif you think this is a good idea, then upvote it, i would appreciate it.\n\n\n(a bonus, if you want to make ap ezreal good again, then give ap jg item back its s5 form so it would have a bit of waveclear, nerf this double tear build somehow, either don't allow to stack 2, or something, and then both ap mid ezreal and ad ezreal would be good. since i love ap ezreal, but now there is no way to play it right now, maybe in jungle, but thats not so good either. if he had some waveclear then it would be good, and it would be special to have a smite midlaner who is such fun, but you must not play him on ranked, since he is not that great but can oneshot. also same goes to rengar give him back his old ferocity working so ap rengar would be playable again)\n\n\nsorry for the bad english tho, but i think you can understand what i mean.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyler1hehexd1234","date":"2019-02-06T23:21:21.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about change ARURF to URF???? \n\nI'm tired of getting stupid in meta champs I never play.\n\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2019-02-02T16:46:11.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Base cannon still exists => I'm still not playing.\n\nIt's no fun playing a squishy champion when you can't siege towers for fear of a bruiser cannoning in behind you, so the only option is to kill them first.

Quite a few games, the first fight before minions spawned lasted for 3 minutes because people would die and come back up and get there so easy to continue the fight. Everyone just died and got items then rejoined the fight. It made it much more fun and fast paced. And most of the squishy champions would succeed the best because they have poke or low cd mobility. If a bruiser cannons in behind you, you most likely have the means to cc chain them to the ground or enough to run away. The cannon adds massive strategy and enables people to make some really good (and bad!) cannon plays. It enables you to have another sumoner spell instead of tp. {{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2019-02-05T19:28:24.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:13}} 's shield or root need addressed.
