I had been suspended because one night i got drunk and wrote the n word alot and i got 14 day suspension. Then a few months later i was in my promos and our carrying kindred went 1v5 and i got angry and that was the last game I ever played on this account. I did deserve the ban, but now that i have been playing half a year on my new account and have been playing fine and have not been flaming (i usually mute all now and just play the game). I believe that I am a different player that i used to be. The first month after the ban i was a bit mad but I tried to put it out on other players and I think i did quite well. I am thinking if someone can have another look on my case and give me a one more last chance. I am still a bit upset because i have spent 100+ euros on this game. All im asking is one last chance and i believe if im to get that chance it will all go out fine. I apologize for my toxic behaviors and wish you all the best!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T04:00:04.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah man, we've certainly all been there when we have our bad days in League.
