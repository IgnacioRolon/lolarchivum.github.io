They die quickly enough that outmaneuvering an opponent can take a turret but not so easily that you can kill a well guarded one.

You are probably fighting back expecting the damage of another player immediately when that isn't what you are going to get, nor what you should get.\n\nI kind of agree on the damage is too high, but that mainly stems from the issue that if a tank could take damage from 5 people reasonably well then there is no way a single person could outplay them to win, especially if they do something relevant besides taking damage.\n\nTrue balance is completely unachievable and would lead to very, very stale gameplay. What we have is asymmetric balance, which means that it is completely ok for a character to have statistics above other characters as long as they have counters that can defeat them. This leads to a situation where a lot of people play champion A until they realize that champion B beats that character, who is countered by champion C. Then it comes full circle as champion A counters champion C. As league has many more characters than that it is more complex but that is the idea. I have not played against Camille much but I would put money down that she is countered by somebody.\n\nRanked is perceived as poor because you have people on your team who lose to the opponent occasionally, generally due to him being slightly worse than the opponent, and then gets harassed for feeding. There are games where there are true intentional feeders and trolls but they are relatively uncommon in comparison, and the situation I described is completely avoidable if you just help the person. If you try to help him and fail then you are probably worse than the opponent as well and deserve the loss.\n\nThe general idea of adc's is that your team pumps gold into them so they can buy a bunch of expensive items and use them to tear a hole in the opponent's team through sustained damage. Due to this, most of them do not build defensive items, which means if you outplay them you can tear through them just as easily. I don't really see a problem with them to be honest.\n\nThe population of this game is rising and is still the most played game in the world.

They keep pushing the game in the same direction, failing to acknowledge the wrong turns they've taken and back track. \n\nThe best route to fix the game is to fix the current mobility and damage problems. Yet they will not do it because they don't view those two aspects to be as damaging to the health of the game as they actually are.

Towers need to do more.  A tank should be able to tank some tower shots, but not 10 shots from both nexus towers.  I've played a support Janna where I walk into tower range, auto the enemy champ, and stand on the edge of tower range while my ADC finishes off the enemy under there.  If you are properly juggling aggro between multiple tanky members, fine, that takes coordination.\n\nAt least add something that if an Ally champ is standing next to towers, the tower does more damage or has more attack speed or something.  There's no point trying to 1v5 under nexus towers if your team gets wiped cause the enemy tank just eat tower shots for days while everyone else kills you.  I would love to see attack speed on nexus towers like they have on Twisted Treeline if an ally is standing near them.  Screw the \"we want people to be able to CS under nexus towers\" bullshit.\n\nMaybe even tie the attack speed buff into Sightstone so supports feel important and can actually sorta defend towers vs minions.  Nothing more frustrating than playing Soraka and watching your team run to try and steal baron when your jungler is dead and you're trying to clear super minions killing your nexus.  \n\nNow it seems like if one super minions gets into your base, it will take out 1 nexus tower easy before dying.  That's just overkill.  Should it chunk the tower, yes, maybe by a 1/3 or so but not out right clear it without any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Faie","date":"2017-01-21T08:17:43.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't be able to 1v5 under _any_ circumstances, including under nexus towers.

Multiple waves of super minions, one after the other, can though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unicorn Emoji","date":"2017-01-21T07:22:40.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there are issues with Turret-targeting, however, the rest of the game really isn't that bad. You can't expect every champ to have the same statistics, as Zezockary stated, it would make for a very boring game. Also, the game has changed a lot, but the whole adc Ziggs thing will wear off. He fits in the lane because he can farm well, especially with a support. If I remember correctly, Fizz was released as a Jungler and evolved into a mid laner. Warwick, Jungler, sometimes played Top. Nasus, Top, sometimes played Jungle. The game is meant to be very flexible. Try it sometime. Lux ADC is tons of fun. Especially if you actually build her on-hit AD.
