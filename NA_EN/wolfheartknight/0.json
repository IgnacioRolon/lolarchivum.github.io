My friend and I PLOWED through the turrets. (we usually played top) But now, everytime i play with her, I can&#039;t seem to decide which place she&#039;s good at. I get killed numerous times and I always feed, sadly... So, I&#039;m asking where should I play her?? She seems okay bot, never tried mid, and I only can play top with my friend when she&#039;s Anivia. Maybe I&#039;m not using her &quot;correctly&quot;?","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-09-06T20:50:46.425+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"she is a jungler she is worthless everywhere else at the moment. specially now that they removed her auto resets","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-06T21:23:45.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-06T21:23:24.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was confused as hell by \"duo anivia top\" until i noticed OP is lv10.. lol.\n\nNidalee is an jungler that can be sort of played mid or top, in specific matchups.\n\nYou need to play with unlocked camera in order to use her effectively, which can be dificult for newer players.\n\nA lane nidalee build would be something like {{item:3165}}{{item:3020}} {{item:3285}}, or if you can safely waveclear in cat form, {{item:3285}}{{item:3020}}{{item:3089}}. \nHit spear or trap to increase the range of cat form pounce, switch forms > jump > E > Q > switch forms > repeat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-09-06T20:54:06.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee is typically played jg.
