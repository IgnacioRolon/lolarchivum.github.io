And this is even more important as a f2p game publisher.\n\nFor example:\nI am very dissatisfied about the bad customer service here in the boards (and NA board is really better than the EUW boards). I don't think that Riot really listen to the community and correct - for example - false decisions (Riot dislikes to confirm that they made a wrong decision).\n\nSo that's why I decided to not buy Riot Points any more.\nThat is around 400-500 USD per year less income for Riot Games. OK, that is not a lot of money for Riot. But if only 200 other players (with did the same, that ist 1 FTE (and we don't need 1 FTE to manage the board).\n\nSo it makes really sense that a f2p game publisher listen more to the community (if the feedback is factual).

After that, there are not so much threads left.\n\nAnd it is not necessary to answer with all details. It is OK to write an answer like \"Thank you for your suggestions. Our responsible team will check this.\" That is only 1 minute to write this post (after several minutes of reading the thread).\n\nAfter over 1 year, no one from the merch team of Riot even answer in one of the threads about the Ahri statue here in the NA board. Several players are very disappointed that the new version was limited and sold out at once (before I even known that there is a release). After 3 years waiting for this statue (which was first announced non-limited), it is very sad that Riot don't answer.\nAs a former Product Manager I have to say that was the worst decision in the history of Product Management. And it seems that Riot does not care about it, writes any statements or has a plan to correct this wrong decision.\n\n\nBut yes, in the German board it is even worse; no communication at all.\nYes, Riot is mainly active in the NA board. But it is also important to interact with the community in the other boards.\nThis month I saw an interesting thread in the German board. All other players wrote that no Rioter reads here and he should write this in the NA board. But he answered that he is not so good in English and asked if someone could translate this and write it in the NA board.\nSo It is important that Riot also interacts in the non-English boards because severals players - with good ideas - haven't the English skills to write in the NA board.\n\nAnd there are also topics that concern only the DACH region (DACH = Germany, Austria and (the german-speaking part of) Switzerland). So it makes sense to write these topics in the German board and not in the NA board. But no Rioter will read this topic. Contact the German Riot Support does not help because they answer that they are not responsible for this topic (and cannot trasmit this to the responsible team) and you should write this in the board (where you never get an answer).\nSo it is impossible to contact Riot for DACH-only topics.
