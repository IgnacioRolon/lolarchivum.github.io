But then they release the Universe Dev video detailing all the plans they have for lore this year and nothing was even mentioned about Jinx or Warwick, now all im asking Riot is that you just confirm that you have not forgotten about their story and all these teasers you put in the taunts are not just for show and that you truly are going to uncover the whole Zaun mystery, hopefully one day...please...Rito...\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/6GHRsAD\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/KO5inuD\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/gvVZlyi\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/itX7tFQ\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/gY7HLQs","replies":[{"poster":"sumerska","date":"2019-01-28T23:42:37.330+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd really like to know too, I love Zaun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Towboat421","date":"2019-01-29T00:49:56.123+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot seems realy content to tease and never reveal anything, I wouldnt hold your breath.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-01-29T02:38:27.876+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe warwick was in the same gang as jinx and vi when he was human.","replies":[{"poster":"Actually Cactus","date":"2019-01-29T03:22:02.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds pretty legit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-01-29T02:38:45.585+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you read all of their lores, something happened and Vi's father sent her away from where he was, however the container she was in is specifically noted to be able to fit two girls.

Only a disciplined eye could recognize the beast within, yearning for release. How could I refuse? For what is my work if not an attempt to reveal life's hidden truths through science? It required two doses to subdue him. Impressively resilient.''\n\n-Singed didn't ''reveal'' anything about a little girl at all as seen in this part of ''Engineering the Nightmare'':\n''An instant later, he was tearing into my face, reopening the old wounds and feeding the old rage. We struggled briefly, until he finally grew limp and collapsed: a single word escaped his throat.'' \nAfterwards Warwick returns to the lab to destroy it while Singed was away, Singed returns and decides to find where Warwick is hiding so he says: ''What was the word the subject said before it collapsed? A name, perhaps? I'll start there and see where the search leads me.''\nAs such even if the name that Warwick muttered was that of Jinx, Singed didn't know who the person was, so he couldn't have possibly had Jinx in the lab at the same time as Warwick was there.\n\nAdditionally you have a couple of points wrong:\n-There's not reference to Jinx having a ''far off stare'' anywhere\n-There's no indication of Vi's father ''sending her away'' anywhere\n-Vi was allegedly found in a bassinet large enough for 2 in the wreckage of a laboratory by someone who was insane, not on a container\n-Singed didn't ''mutilate and torture'' Warwick for years, Warwick's lore states that he spent days in Singed's lab, and if you read ''Engineering the Nightmare'' it makes it sound like the whole process was less than a month","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-01-29T07:01:53.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terozu,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BEHmEY5m,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-01-29T02:38:45.585+0000)\n>\n> If you read all of their lores, something happened and Vi&#x27;s father sent her away from where he was, however the container she was in is specifically noted to be able to fit two girls.

Nor does he care for torture, the warwick/singed story clearly shows him as calm and methodical. The pain is a part of the process, it's not the goal.

I've seen the singed, warwick, jinx theory refered to as fact a few times, sorry for the misunderstanding.\n\n> Also Jinx and View have similar facial structure and inverted color pallettes for their hair and eyes.\n\nthe inverted color palette is intended because they are rivals. Personally i see differences in their faces, this is somewhat objective i suppose. \ntheir overall build is alot different though. Jinx being small and rather \"frail\" looking, compared to vi being the complete opposite.\n\n> And WW's lore specifically states that he didn't believe that WW could get out of his life of crime and decided to test him via torture.\n\nI can see how you come to this understanding. We all take stories in differently, to me it's more so that warwick was the perfect \"ingredient\" for singed's experiment. Pain was supposed to be the catalyst though, which meant no sedation. I guess this could be seen as torture. I just don't think singed views it that way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QMighty","date":"2019-01-29T11:44:54.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that real or is it just a theory a game theory?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"excaliburate","date":"2019-01-29T12:34:09.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they've maybe already given us the answer!!!

They hired the most innovative scientists to use the rich chemical resources recently discovered in the area to create a massive waterway that would unite Valoran's major seas.''\n\n-City of Iron and Glass: ''Mama Elodie was the mistress of Hope House, a foundling home dedicated to the welfare of the many orphans created in the wake of the disaster that tore Zaun apart.\n\nInitially funded by the families who would go on to become Piltover’s clans, more than two hundred orphans had been cared for within its walls. But in the century or so since its opening, the institution’s fortunes had waned as the money from the newborn city on high stopped flowing. The wealthy upsider families eventually decided they’d assuaged their guilt with enough gold, and that was that.''\n\n\n\nI have a different theory but first here's a couple of facts:\n\n-Jinx's lore: ''A few of the old timers in Zaun remember a young girl who might fit Jinx's description, but the girl they speak of is a far cry from the one who became Piltover's bane. This girl was sweet and innocent, a tinkerer with big ideas, who never quite fit in and came to a bad end.''\n -Jinx was ''sweet and innocent'' and ''came to a bad end'', so she was gullible and something bad happened to her.\n\n-Vi's lore: ''None of the old timers from Vi's youth could tell her anything of her parents, with most assuming they had simply died in one of the industrial accidents that were, sadly, all too common in Zaun. A few vaguely claimed to remember her as one of the brats from Hope House, a crumbling orphanage cut into Zaun's cave-riddled cliffs. On his deathbed, a notoriously mad sump-scrapper claimed to have found Vi adrift in a bassinet large enough for two in the ruins of a collapsed chem-laboratory.''\n -Vi was found in the wreckage of a lab, and at the time she was very young, which could explain why she doesn't remember her past.\n\n-Warwick's lore: ''Though many think of Warwick as no more than a beast, buried beneath the fury lies the mind of a man - a gangster who put down his blade and took up a new name to live a better life. But no matter how hard he tried to move on, he could never escape the sins of his past.''\n -Warwick used to be a Gangster\n\n-Camille has the following line towards Vi: \"Ever wonder how you became an orphan?\"\n -In Camille's lore it's clear that she will do anything for the well being of her clan.\n\nHere's some assumptions:\n\n-Riot enjoys catering to the popular Reddit theory of Jinx and Vi being sisters (which was not the case in the original lore)\n\n-Taking the detail of ''bassinet large enough for two'' on Vi's lore, we could try a less literal interpretation and assume that at the time, Jinx was 5/6 years old and Vi was at most 1 years old.\n\nHere's my theory:\n\n-Jinx and Vi's parents used to be scientists working on Zaun, and they were developing something that would have shifted the power balance between Zaun and Piltover.\n-Camille doesn't want that to happen, so she needs someone to steal the invention or prevent it from being created, she hires Warwick (back when he was a gangster)\n-At some point Jinx met Warwick, being gullible she befriends him, Warwick on the other hand plans to use her to get inside her house\n-Jinx helps Warwick inside the house when her parents aren't around, however they then return\n-Jinx's parents were about to capture Warwick but he instead beats them and sets their house on fire by accident (since it was a lab it could have had volatile equipment)\n-Warwick escapes but decides that he has had enough of his life style as a thief and a killer (here's where the ''let me forget line'' comes in)\n-Jinx becomes horrified since she sees her parents burn alive and she can't help them, and is too scared to save her baby sister (that ends up surviving anyways)\n-Jinx runs away, in order to cope with what she caused she slowly adopts her current personality\n\nAS A SIDE NOTE: Ekko has the following towards Jinx line: \"I had a crush... until you started talking to the gun\", however this was before the Piltover and Zaun lore retcon of early 2017, so I didn't take it into consideration, specially because that would mean that Jinx was around 15 years old when she ''went insane'', and at 15 years I think it's reasonable to assume that she would have been a known person with some form of registry.","replies":[{"poster":"General Jinx","date":"2019-01-30T17:32:17.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\nIm so happy to see others as interested in this just as much as i am, your theory is quite compelling!
