I know its the right username and I also know the summoner name. I'm almost positive it is the right password. The reason I cannot simply recover it is because I don't know the email password. If I know the username and the summoner name is there some way to get it back?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-02-07T02:12:17.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey symystry!\n\nIt is entirely possible that you are simply entering the wrong password, since you are not 100% convinced it is the right one.  However, when talking about account security (even for an old account), we want to be very careful what information is provided in a public setting such as a Forum.  To that end, I strongly recommend that you submit a new Support Ticket to us here in Player Support.  When doing so, make sure to include as much information bout this account as possible, so that we can verify the exact account, and that you are the original owner of the account.  \n\nWe should be able to help you out fairly quickly! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Phorest","date":"2014-02-07T03:47:39.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm what exactly do you mean by including as much information as possible without giving anything away? Actually I am sure that that password was the right one but the only reason i question it was because it did not work. I can provide the username and the email but i don't know the email password.","replies":[{"poster":"Bubble Butt Lulu","date":"2014-02-08T02:44:55.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~Here is a Knowledge Base thread on what you'll need to do.~~\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22295644-Recovering-Your-Account\n\n**Edit:** Whoops, looks like you resolved the issue on your own.
