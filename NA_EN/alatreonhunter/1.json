Instead of playing defensive, you should bully him early on before he gets his e + w + q combo, so early on just harass him. Get like a long sword, i you're building into bork, and two health potions and a mana potion. Early game you just need to spam until he is forced to leave lane then get farm and get ahead. Remember to freeze lane more than pushing or he'll get too much XP under tower. But just poke him and put him behind before he gets too much of a lead. This is just my opinion, it's okay if you don't agree, but personally I think this way works with me on a renekton : just bully him and don't let him get combo early.\nAfter early game, you'll have more gold so sit back and don't let him stun you. It's kind of like some champions where if they just used one of their escape abilities, like Tristana's leap, feel free to harass her, renekton is one of those champions. Just my opinion on tips with Olaf vs Renekton.

Renekton, like most lane bullies, is the kind of champion that makes sure you can't do anything while in lane. Just play passively and CS as well as possible. Your number one priority is not to let him start snowballing by killing you early. Do this and he should begin to start falling off eventually. Until then, play passive and farm your way back to the powerhouse you should be.","replies":[{"poster":"AlatreonHunter","date":"2015-07-19T05:49:29.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I appreciate it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2015-07-19T03:35:09.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to be more specific. What champions are you playing? What specifically are you struggling with in the match-up? The champion match-up is important because your build and playstyle against renekton will depend on what champion you pick.\n\nA few general tips i can hand out:  \n1. Start cloth armor + 5 hp pots\n2. Ask for help from the jungler\n3. Let the minions push towards your ally turret. If hes tries attack you under your turret, he'll take turret aggro. \n4. Run armor seals in your rune page","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reslust","date":"2015-07-19T01:04:22.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm no top lane master, but ask for help from the jungler early on. Let renek push by playing extremely passive (use your q to cs, but dont overextend and give up a kill just to get one or two cs) and once you get a couple of successful ganks (and maybe build some life steal) you should be able to hold up in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"AlatreonHunter","date":"2015-07-19T05:51:57.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-07-19T06:54:49.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how skilled the Renek is.  Bad renek players will assume that because they're renek they auto win trades.  Slap him with E when he comes in, then Q and chop chop chop a bit... head out and use W to sustain back up.  Rush some lifesteal.  Bad renek often shove lane, so even if you end up taking a slight beatdown, you'll be able to sustain back up.  You probably won't kill him unless he's REALLY dumb, but try to force him to ult then back off... and he'll have to leave lane or risk dying.  Get a gold and exp lead and his bullying should slow down or stop.\n\nIf he's a DECENT renek... you're in trouble.  In this case you can't kill him and he'll avoid dumb trades... so YOU need to do all you can to keep him from freezing the lane near his tower.  If he can zone you away from farm and exp you're boned.  Get wards, retreat when he comes at you hard, rush armor and try like hell to just avoid death and keep up your CS as best you can.  He'll fall off a bit if you don't feed him.  If you have tele, try to gank for other lanes.  If not... good luck!  Ask the jungler to gank and even then, make sure it'll stick. Renek can turn around jungle ganks and win even 1v2 if he plays it well.","replies":[]}]}
