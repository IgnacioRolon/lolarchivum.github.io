Supposedly &quot;Lux is a counter to Ahri&quot; but I am not seeing it. How does one go about not dying, and maybe possibly even winning the lane? I am getting tired of this happening, so I would like some assistance.","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-16T02:19:17.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea is that while Ahri has mobility with Q and her ult, you've got some CC in your burst which locks her down. You also have an earlier power spike, which allows you to burst her down before you can (should, anyway). Lux is also something of a mana sink, so buy a mana regen item to keep yourself in lane longer (I suggest an early chalice of harmony).\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"AlatreonHunter","date":"2015-07-17T05:11:44.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, I appreciate it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"weeaboomer","date":"2015-07-14T06:11:55.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once she gets enough ap all she needs to do is w-r-r-r and she will kill you.","replies":[{"poster":"AlatreonHunter","date":"2015-07-14T06:41:09.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I sorta figured this out lol, but thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
