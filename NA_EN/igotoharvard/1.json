He had more scaling pre-rework on Q and W. The new W gained bonus AD scaling and lost AP scaling as well as got a longer cooldown and lost AOE,  and is far better for AD Ezreal as he can actually push in order to use the objective damage. AP Ezreal used to fill the niche of AOE teamfight damage with the old W that could have its cooldown dropped super low, and now AP Ezreal can only do the same things as AD Ezreal while being worse at all of them.\n\nHonestly the cooldown is the biggest hit to AP Ezreal's lategame dps. Used to be at 40% cdr you could potentially throw out an aoe w every 3 seconds, now its closer to 6 if you are lucky, dropping the damage of the spell over a ten second period for AP Ezreal by more than half in total.\n\nThe rework buffed AD Ezreal, made Hybrid slightly more viable, and nerfed AP Ezreal by exchanging the strengths he used to have for just having weaker versions of AD Ezreal's strengths.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2018-10-11T12:19:57.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"New ez is a straight buff dude.

Individual skill matters less in the last meta.  I felt the same way as you did when they reworked Veigar, who was my main, and I have mained AP ez too, I knew it would come RIOT cannot keep their fingers off old champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-10-11T05:31:47.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Um...how'd they destroy AP Ezreal? If anything his old W passing through multiple champions was few and far between(and his old W wasn't super powerful either, AP Ezreal does way more damage with E than with anything), and practically all of his abilities deal **more** damage than they did before this \"rework\". He also got more focused burst because now his E targets champions hit by his W. Giving it a bonus AD ratio also makes gunblade(which was pretty darn good on AP burst Ez anyways) makes his W do more damage than it would have previously.\n\nIf you build pure AP vs Pure AD you will do a LOT MORE damage than you will if you build AD on **every** ability. because the availability of high AP is much higher. High AD would get you about 350 whereas high AP is almost double that(and that's not building tear and mana, just pure fast AP. You could get a lot more with tear probably). I suppose the only difference would be Q because Trinity Force is basically 3x the damage on Q whereas Lich Bane + full AP is basically 2x damage on all of your abilities.\n\nThe one thing I don't understand is why they didn't change his passive. I've never felt like his passive was a big part of his kit or even really that important to his kit. It doesn't really make sense for a spellslinging champion either,","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2018-10-11T05:15:06.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ezreal support is no long realistic either.
