League of Legend is NO longer fun.\r\n\r\nHi, I have been an avid player of league of legends, maintaining diamond solo ranked in NA for the last three seasons. And now it is time that I stop playing the game. The reason is simple. The changes that were made to the game totally destroyed the gaming experience. Riot says that they are now listening to the players more and more, but the result is devastating. The games are simply not fun. Game = Fun. There is absolutely no reason to play the game if it is not fun. And that's exactly what League of Legend has become. It has failed so many people's expectation and it is losing loyal league of legend player like me.\r\n\r\nI will give you some examples how League of Legends used to be FUN. Mostly, it is because of the old champian designs which now riot has total revamped and destroyed.\r\n\r\nI loved playing the old Katarina and Leblanc. I found so much athletic thrills in playing the old Ryze that allowed me to play combos really fast. I loved playing Garen with my runes and mastery and create the unique play style that cannot be achieved with the narrow minded simple rune system which destroyed game diversity. I used to love playing vayne before she became crippled recently. I loved playing Jinxs before she becamed crippled some time ago. How much fun would it be if vayne and jinxs were both strong. Ryze is strong as it was too. Kat and LB are also strong like before. Games would be sooooo fun. Riot totally destroyed this. And there is no reason to play League of Legend anymore. It is a dead game where players play bored without fun or thrills.\r\n\r\nLeague of Legend is dead. So sad to admit this to the current state of the game. This is why the people you hire in a company is so important. The game has become ruined destroyed by the whoever has been pushing it to change what used to be a game with a lot of fun and excitements.\r\n\r\nI can pretty confident that no one who are loyal players like me can say out loud that the game has evolved and now it is better than ever. NO ONE CAN. It is pathetic how the changes did not make the game better but worse. Riot should be ashamed of themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2018-04-12T03:46:04.329+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would love to disagree with this, but honestly I cannot.  I actually liked a lot of the changes in 6 and some of 7.  There were always some parts of updates that I didn't agree with, but it was fine.  Season 8 has just been painful.  The rune system is pretty much what killed it for me.  Its much less adaptable and has made the meta/off-meta chasm too large.  If someone loves just playing the Rito flavor of the month meta champ then they may like it, but I for one do not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-04-12T03:44:04.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">  it is losing loyal league of legend player like me.\n\n> It is a dead game \n\n> League of Legend is dead.\n\n> loyal players like me\n\nI don't think you understand what loyalty means. Dead to you and some, not dead to others.

I could not extrapolate a single point from this. It sounds more like your champs aren't as strong as they have been and you're to burned out from playing for so long that you don't feel like learning a new champion. \n\nYou only gave specifics on a single complaint, that you use to be able to do sooo much to make you playstyle unique with garen? Like what? Whether to go more one resistance type than the other?? Go damage? I'd say the new system offers way more interesting ways to play garen than simple stat buffs would have added.","replies":[{"poster":"IGoToHarvard","date":"2018-04-13T01:54:24.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Garen with movement speed runes and mastery that allowed Garen to move as fast as possible was so fun to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Katheara","date":"2018-04-12T05:37:19.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've reached maxed ranks in games before and eventually you hit a point where you're maxed and you've experienced everything you could think of.

The game isn't fun anymore. I keep taking breaks hoping it will improve my *horrible mentality* about the game. Then I play again and it's literally, *immediately*, just misery. It feels like a virtual prison. I really wish I felt inspired in this game when I had a personal lead, but oh, press tab and see we have the 0/5 yasuo or 1/12 bot lane or whatever. Seeing this alone and **basic pattern recognition** is enough to completely demoralize a person from even trying.\n\nThis game doesn't reward the better player, it punishes the worst one. And guess what, almost half the time, they're on the same team! \"Carrying\" at the moment is either being a master level player or spamming an overpowered champion and playing the odds.\n\nI loved this game, and I hope Riot fixes it, but I have a feeling (sadly) that they won't or have reasons for why they won't. This is the exact same feeling I had many years ago quitting WoW, when I finally realized the game had removed/destroyed everything that made it great.\n\nAnd I'm sure baldcrawler is just a coincidence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-12T03:43:34.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Meanwhile the active population is still 8 digits, seems incredibly dead..","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-04-12T05:18:19.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The fact that something like this gets upvoted is exactly why nobody takes these boards seriously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakaPrase","date":"2020-01-27T16:30:54.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl:dr but from what I read on start, yes I agree, I play this game even tho I don't want, I'm not enjoying it, but I'm addicted I'd say, it became shit with whole bunch of broken champs and for quite a time I'm playing fun champs but lose ranked form people who play game for shorter period of time but play broken op champs that aren't so fun for me to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2018-04-12T04:38:10.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1UcEbu7_zEw/hqdefault.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireBlaze100","date":"2018-04-12T03:42:25.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"As older players leave newer players will fill in the gap so yeah league isn’t gonna be dying anytime soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-04-12T03:53:12.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Boring to read these kind of comments...\n\nDont like it anymore?
