He&#039;s a Nunu-Janna demon child who walks up to your camps and takes them right in front of you when invading. You can&#039;t even outsmite him. It&#039;s actually hard to be truly bad on Ivern and his average winrate is the highest of ANY CHAMPION IN THE GAME REGARDLESS OF ROLE at 56%+. Experienced players even in DIamond 1+ maintain nearly 60% winrates. The champion is STRAIGHT BUSTED by EVERY METRIC and it&#039;s not like his playrate is so small for that to be the reason for these obscene statistics. This has been the case CONSISTENTLY for multiple patches and it&#039;s unacceptable for a champion with a &gt;5% playrate. People don&#039;t see him one shot anyone like Rengar can so they don&#039;t understand how much subtle power he has. His kit is actually insanely overloaded and safe while suffocating the rest of the JG landscape besides a handful of picks. \n\nThis is NOT OK Riot. Even if it&#039;s not an assassin with a lot of burst damage, it is NOT fine for a champion to be this powerful for a team. Every metric suggests he&#039;s broken so what are you waiting for?
