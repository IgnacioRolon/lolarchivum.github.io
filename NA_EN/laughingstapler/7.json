This is more about you problem than ziggs. Ahri does have decent wave clear but that is because she has to roam a lot. She is a champ that has to rely on her team to carry her for how hard she is outscaled. Ziggs has a lot more consistent damage and range, he is similar to Lux for having a decent range to cs.

Ahri has a fine late game. She performs better than Ziggs and many other champions past 40 minutes (in Plat+ and Diamond+. Check lolalytics. It's hard to go wrong with her and she's always useful. If she can't get a late game pick, she can still poke well and play safe/waveclear. Late game scaling isn't just about raw damage.

I don't play Veigar and Annie so I wouldn't know about that but Ziggs is among the very highest skillcaps for mid.  Don't confuse ease of use for competent play with skillcap. Ezreal is also easy to pick up and play to a basic level but he's probably the hardest ADC to play optimally managing his Qs, jumping into his W exactly at the right time (without being too risky), hitting the abilities constantly, mindgaming for hitting Qs, cross map snipe predictions etc. Ezreal is an extremely high skillcap champion without a high skillfloor. Ziggs is the same way and in fact, it's exactly because his skill cap is so high (meaning high unreliability too and a lot of counterplay)  that he's rarely picked in Masters+. It's just too punishing to miss abilities/not predict their dodges well etc. \n\n\nHe's 100% skillshots (some of which are quite long range and weird) and requires auto weaving with good passive management to play optimally. His Q is also a very awkward super skinny ability which isn't a line skills hot like for most champions so you can miss someone right in front of you by having it bounce over their heads or too short. Remember his Q reacts differently based on how far your mouse is even if it's the same direction. Ezreal's Q is actually waaay easier to hit because of this and its speed as well. With Ezreal, you only need to manage direction to hit a target. Your exact mouse distance doesn't matter. Besides that, Ziggs has a lot of ways to combo abilties. You can use W to knock them against a wall and all-in, or run away over a wall if you place it well and know which walls work, or to last hit, or to knock them into your ult. or E etc. You even have more strategic diversity than most mids (with some exceptions like TF). Unlike most mages, you can abuse the potential escape with W to hard push deeper and take turrets fast. You have to know your limits really well to know how much you can get away with and make sure you don't overdo it (not pushing those limits would be suboptimal though). You can also choose to split push much more than other mages. You can decide to roam for a first turret. You need to know when to use ult. for a wave and when to keep it for something else etc. There are endless things you can do on Ziggs to get better. Most champions are FAR more binary strategically and less mechanically intensive when played optimally. \n\nZilean is also not easy at all to play optimally. His skillcap is probably lower than Ziggs but not by much. There are literally hundreds of ways to use his Q-W combos and many that you must know (I could paste hundreds of tips related to it right now). There's much more creativity with manipulation of the abilities than you realize. He's nowhere near as simple as he appears to just play to a basic level. You also need great reaction times to fully benefit from the power of his R (which you have to save till they're at a super low HP or you're potentially wasting it and having it not even proc. because they stop attacking the target) as well as from his E. Speed is only useful if you know how to utilize it well and exactly which of your allies needs it at which times and the same goes for that Q. There's so much decision making involved in teamfighting if you're trying to optimize. I can literally look at Faker, Bjerksen and others who play Zilean occasionally and even in a pro game I can highlight countless mechanical misplays (not just in terms of early CSing which everyone does poorly). The fact that your allies can use all your abilities as well makes you when playing Zilean have to think like a general managing 5 players not just 1. Exactly who do you speed up?, do you save the ult. for the carry and let the support die?, do you position riskier to attract pressure and then E away or double bomb in front or perhaps on your own tank?, do you use a double bomb to zone backline or go for a guaranteed target? do you use the Q on a low HP ally kiting away so that the damage has a chance to save him when the gap is closed or do you double bomb the JG and Top on the other side? Do you E yourself to get out or E an enemy champion and try to double bomb? I can go on nearly forever. Zilean allows you to manipulate 10 champions at the same time with all his abilities He's actually very hard to play optimally and I don't think I've ever seen it. Even if you had amazing scripts, the decision making is very complex to choose the absolute best path. Ziggs is MUCH simpler in regards to his teamfight decision making than Zilean. This is infinitely easier than for example Talon who has a very clear idea and defined execution. He stealths in and jumps into the fight on the most vulnerable carry then runs away and does some AoE. That's the gist of the decision making. It's straightforward. There are some mechanics of course but you have to think less than when playing Zilean if you're going to get the absolute maximum from both champions.\n\nMost of the decision making in League which makes a player good isn't about champion picks but Zilean and Ziggs are certainly both high skill cap champions. They are approachable but playing them optimally is something almost no one can do.
