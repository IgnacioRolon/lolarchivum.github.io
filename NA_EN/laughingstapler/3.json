Yes, it happens, even in Master/Challenger, but imo, it shouldn't be possible.\n\nThe champs you play likely aren't suited for solo carrying.  You also are likely picking champs that don't work well into the enemy team's comp.  I'd recommend maining a very versatile champ who can do 2+ roles.  Irelia is a VERY good example of this, and I carried myself from Bronze 5 to Bronze 1 in a week with her/Elise (then got hella busy irl and am only Silver 4, almost Silver 3 rn).  She defaults to building at the very least like a bruiser, she outputs a lot of damage, has inbuilt sustain, passive is gorgeous, has true damage to shred other tanks, has point-and-click hard cc, and a moderately low skill floor.  Elise is very similar, except true damage is % max HP damage, which is just as good.","replies":[{"poster":"Wimbledofy","date":"2016-03-27T07:14:53.298+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're very wrong in saying that it shouldn't be possible.

The team with the older person now has a big advantage and that one person will very likely \"carry\" the game.

They wouldn't listen to him. They would kick the ball away from him, out of bounds, at their own net. Meanwhile, they'd flame him for staying onsides (y don't u go stand right at the net wtf noob) or trying to lead a pass (im standing here y u pass it there wtf u troll). You'd also have to assume that even if the good player has control of the ball, there are 4 other balls somewhere else on the field.\n\nLeague is harder to solo carry purely due to skill difference than almost any other conceivable sport.

If Diana is one v five diving your team and not dying right away your team is really bad. I don't mean that as an insult but contrary to popular belief she is in fact still a glass cannon champion. The shield can buy her a few seconds if that but your team should be able to blow her up easily unless you are that far behind. But a full build Diana diving a team that isn't like 20k gold behind should die. You should stun her or all land at least one ability on her and then like one ult and kill her. \n\nShe doesn't get to be like Yi with these crazy tank builds dealing tons of damage. Have I hard carried some games yes. But it was only after getting at least another lane rolling. Also the enemy team not peeling me ever. Shes like Leblanc but with less freedom. I can pop someone but if you group I should never dive and get away with it unless your reflexes/vision control is bad. The second one is Riot's fault though. And if Diana doesn't land crescent strike and goes in Then she should at best kill one person and die.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2016-03-27T16:16:37.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue that it's actually extremely hard to carry with LB.

What wins in low elo is different.\n\nIn low elo, you win by shitting on your lane opponent and snowballing out of control. If you're not doing that, then someone else probably is (or is at least trying to) which means you only have a 4/9 chance of winning those games (since you're not trying to take large risks and snowball out of control).\n\nIn contrast, this very thing would make you lose in high elo. Taking those risks would result in you getting ganked at just that time (as in high elo your opponent wouldn't make so many mistakes to give up solo kills) and you'd be the one feeding and causing your team to lose. In low elo though, people are making those mistakes and you're capitalizing on them and snowballing. \n\nMeanwhile, what works in high elo (slowly building up a considerable CS lead, an XP advantage, having good rotations to get a slight turret lead, etc...) does still work in low elo but not well enough. Unless none of your allies/enemies are snowballing, it won't have much impact on the game. Snowballing is just so much stronger that someone being 6-0 at 15 minutes makes your 50cs and 1 level lead look pretty meaningless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M Schumacher","date":"2016-03-27T07:24:51.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"You can literally carry low elo with any champion in the game.\n\nPlay a split pushing champ, low elos have absolutely 0 concept of side wave control and will just continue grouping mid until you're about to kill their inhibitor.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyless","date":"2016-03-27T07:32:34.757+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=M Schumacher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zEq0UEEA,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2016-03-27T07:24:51.813+0000)\n>\n> You can literally carry low elo with any champion in the game.\n> \n> Play a split pushing champ, low elos have absolutely 0 concept of side wave control and will just continue grouping mid until you're about to kill their inhibitor.\n\nno you can't","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-03-27T11:13:31.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are Morphling and Faceless Void good carries to main right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-03-28T12:59:17.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morphling is always a good carry to main.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-03-28T16:55:39.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured, since I was the only one on the team that could get in and one shot the sniper","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"56552559_DEL","date":"2016-03-27T14:12:25.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Currently im in Elo hell.

No matter how hard I try to help my team, almost every match has people wanting to stay in their own lane like they are playing bots, And this happens in norms as well. People just dont want to help each other and cooperate.\n\nIn the first 20 minutes, the enemy jg will gank a certain lane a certain number of times while our jg either afk farms or tries to push the other 2 lanes out leaving the last lane to the wolves and then has the audacity to say its that lanes fault for falling behind despite that lane getting ganked 3-4 times because the other team knows the jg doesnt want to help that lane.\n\nI actually had to stop playing ranked because i was playing as an ADC main and most of the time i would get shit jg and shit support who never went after the adc, they always went after the support and we would always lose lane regardless. Then i get blamed for not doing my job. Well, its kinda hard to be an adc when i myself am getting chunked out by THEIR adc while my jg and support are focusing THEIR support.\n\nBut this is why i had to stop with ranked.
