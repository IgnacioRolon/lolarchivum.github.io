SpellBlade from IBG/TF has a 1.5 sec CD. I found this out the hard way using IBG and noticing that my 2nd Q offered no slow or bonus damage. I never thought I&#039;d say this, but there is a thing as too much CDR on Ezreal. It seems anything over 33% (4.5-4.5*.33-1.5 = 1.515) suffers from this issue. \n\nThis is yet another situation where ER is shown to have poor synergy with Ezreal. For one, his Q doesn&#039;t crit. so neither the mana return nor the crit. are as useful as one would expect. Of course, you still auto but not quite as much as other ADCs. ER is much more synergistic with nearly every other caster ADC (think Lucian, Corki, Graves). Now, because Ezreal gets a Sheen item to make his poke more potent, he already has 10% CDR and ER caps it to 40% after IE, creating the issue described. You could suggest not to get IE on Ezreal but that makes the whole build seem rather pointless. Why build 40% crit. chance and then fail to get the biggest crit. damage increase item in the game?\n\nEzreal has needed some buffs or tweaks for a while but I now dislike the latest Q changes and would much rather they buff his W to include an AD scaling or something of the sort. Alternatively, his Q could have a longer CD but some sort of crit. modifier etc. I&#039;m just brainstorming but I shouldn&#039;t have to worry about building too much CDR on a champion that seems so suited to it. It&#039;s strange enough for me, but just imagine for someone newer. They&#039;ll probably think IBG is bugged. Riot needs to really figure out what Ezreal is supposed to do best and how to get him to that state smoothly. I don't want something terrible and lackluster pigeonholed into essentially one build and playstyle like what happened to Kog'Maw.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2016-01-01T16:09:15.679+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ez's Q doesn't crit because no one wants crits from over 1k range on a fast skillshot that's on a sub-2 sec CD.","replies":[{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2016-01-01T17:21:52.886+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeolian Melodies,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=btAtKe1O,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-01T16:09:15.679+0000)\n>\n> Ez's Q doesn't crit because no one wants crits from over 1k range on a fast skillshot that's on a sub-2 sec CD.\n\nAt no point did I say Ezreal's Q should crit.

The thing is they reworked last whisper because of the ADC rework but that hurt assassins as well. Sorry but, with all those base stats late game and no % total armor pen you can't do your job as an AD assassin as effectively. What is your job? Blow up squishies and do over all good damage even to beefy but not kill blow them up. Thing is, now, late game, you can't blow up even a squishy with no % total armor pen. Ok, you have black cleaver but it's not good enough, cleaver needs stacking and that counter productive for an assassin who needs immediate access to his burst. Black cleaver is a bruiser item, not an assassin item. At least give an item that has the same % pen that the cleaver has in shred which is 30%. With the flat pen from current items, masteries and with 30% total pen, you are effective enough to blow up squishies and at the same time, you do not have enough % total pen to burst down tanks. They could do that with the new assassin item and make it melee only so that ADCs can't buy it. Seriously, it's far better for assassin in late game. Also, there is a distinct difference between armor and mr. Most champions have 30 flat mr that does not scale with level and others scale from 30 to 54 at level 18. So, with sorc boots, mpen in runes and masteries and void staff, you do true damage to everyone who didn't get an mr item while with armor, all champions scale from about 20 to 94 at lvl 18 with most common bas armor being around 80 and if you add runes to that you easily get a figure around 100. this is a lot more than 30 or 54 isn't it? So, with just this low flat armor pen and no % armor pen, how are you gonna assassinate??? You won't if your target knows what to do and if a support is always around. They must make an item with % total armor pen for assassins only. Black cleaver is not for assassins, it's for bruisers and tanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2016-01-02T15:17:51.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference is that ADCs do sustained damage while most mages are burst oriented.

Zed, Yasuo, Talon, Akali, Ahri, many more. AP ezreal is very hard to play to full potential but if you manage to pull it off, he has amazing damage output. Also, i am always confused in terms of builds with this guy. I always build 3 items that i never swap out, Luden's, Deathcap and lich Bane but for the rest of the build, there are so many options. Like, if you can go late game, if you get to stack fully your Seraph's and a rod of Ages combined with the other 3 items you get a ridiculous amount of AP but you don't really have any sustain like spellvamp and you will also lack the magic pen of void, so, what do you see as a better solution, to swap out RoA or Seraph's for void staff? It is hard to play AP ezreal effectively but if you play late scaling items and build like this {{item:3100}} , {{item:3285}} , {{item:3020}} , {{item:3089}} , {{item:3135}} {{item:3040}} or {{item:3029}} you will have insane power late in the game.
