My biggest problem with him was that he got fed early and was strong mid game. On 5-6 items, he tended to be unable to penetrate the flanking Malphite/Naut etc. diving him if they had equal items. He'd take like 1/2 their health in the best scenario but he'd have no more W and die easily after. This is even in comps. that were heavy on peel. I haven't tried baiting W but that sounds like a good idea.\n\nI think the biggest mistake people make vs him is diving head first instead of trying to flank. Since Kog gets Runaan's, he should be treated like a Twitch. He needs to be attacked from multiple angles so he can't just attack 3 people at the same time. The second big mistake is that they get scared of his damage instead of understanding his weaknesses. If he JUST chunked your Alistar to 1/2 it probably means his W is over and you SHOULD GO IN instead of or running from him scared after that massive damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2016-03-13T06:34:46.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He needs another rework.

Losing 2% HP on his R also made jungle a lot worse than before. I think some champions have \"nerf intertia\" and seem to be kicked while they're down out of fear. Viktor is a recent example of this and now has the worst mid lane winrate. He wasn't OP and he got nerfed despite PBE threads about it being totally unnecessary. However, this is all for another discussion!\n\nConsidering the Kog bug, we'll need more time to see his performance.","replies":[]}]}]}
