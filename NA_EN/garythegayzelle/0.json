Im looking at you 1200 dmg crits....\r\nWhat I am proposing is they do the same thing to lifesteal as they did to spellvamp, i.e confine it to specific items and remove it from low tier items. There is no feasible reason why an adc with just a dorans blade should be able to heal 200 dmg in an instant when they get their infinity edge and land a single crit.

In-fact, supports give these things that are desired like lifesteal / shields and survivability. A class that does extreme damage shouldn't also have extreme sustain.\n\nLifesteal should be removed Imho.

Let's get this straight though: Lifesteal isn't DEFENSE. It is utility. It's an unnecessary utility when somebody is running around doing 1K damage an auto attack, healing for 20% sometimes even more of the damage of that auto attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-04-29T06:17:20.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Death's Dance without Lifesteal is literally just a time bomb on your death.

Though, I know what bronze players think and feel like. People in bronze quite literally don't know every item or why they are built or how to lane, know about any sort of pressure or just basically don't know enough about the game to be in silver. That is the difference in bronze and silver, the game knowledge in most cases.\n\nSo in regard to your argument, in all honesty, I think that your argument is extremely lacking. First of all, you think that {{item:3151}} is defensive item because it has 300 HP, literally 1 auto attack 15 minutes in the game for the adc. You just got done saying yourself that what makes somebody tanky is resistances, not the HP; that item is purely an offensive choice.\n\nBut okay, that isn't the only item - right? I will give you that {{item:3102}} is a defensive item however it blows big donkey dick and is inferior to the AD version in everyday imaginable.\n\nThe next item ROA: the same argument applies to this as does the mask. HP does not = tanky. It's not a defensive item that is bought by champions purely for defensive value, actually, it's bought for champions that can stack it's value and need to face check you in order to do anything in the game. It's basically an item for champions that are badly designed, or severely outdated {{champion:1}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:136}} \n\nThe tear item takes about 20 minutes to stack up, by the time that item actually does become a defensive item; it is obsolete because adc's are doing around 600 damage per auto attack. It isn't bought for it's defensive value, it is bought for the significant mid and late game boom that stacks on other AP items.\n\nAlso you named a utiltiy item, not a defensive item. There is a difference. {{item:3152}} is not a defensive item. I know, HP, and you can use the item to ' run away ' but no, it's not a defensive item and it isn't built like a defensive item. Again, HP does not = defense, sir.\n\nMore items that are utiltiy, not defensive that you named. {{item:3174}} because it has . . . 30 . . . magic . . . resist . . . jesus, man. You're grabbing for something I can't even see. Who exactly builds this that is a mage, again? Exactly. It's a fucking UTILITY ITEM.\n\n{{item:2065}} 200 HP, good, that's like half an auto attack early mid game. But wait Suhbject phive, it gives you movement speed\n\n{{item:3100}} Is apparently a defensive item to you.\n\nWant to know what a defensive item looks like? {{item:3143}} Damage reduction\n{{item:3046}} Damage reduction\n{{item:3193}} Damage reduction in more ways than 1\n{{item:3190}} Damage reduction, also offers a shield based on your HP\n{{item:3222}} THIS is a utility item.
