I&#039;m not here to whine and say he&#039;s broken(though at the moment he might be slightly over tuned). I can&#039;t really because I&#039;ve always struggled to lane against Draven. I main Tristana, she&#039;s one of my best champions, but even after 700-800k mastery points on her, I have yet to figure out the best way to deal with Draven as her. I&#039;ve struggled against Draven since day one as her and have yet to figure out a viable way to deal with him. He out damages me massively, so going all in on him without a high CC support is sketch as fuck. But since he has so much damage and most of the highest cc supports are melee, all in&#039;ing him is hard because a good Draven is going to play aggro and be poking constantly.\n\nSo I&#039;m legitimately asking what there is I can do as a player to deal with Draven in lane? Because I see him and its pretty hard not to tilt.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-24T13:12:16.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven is a lane bully and will always get out ahead on straight fights. And because of his passive, even if you go 1 for 1 he will still get the better end of the deal because he'll come back with more items than you. Doesn't help that Tristana is a scaling hipercarry either with a mid-late game powerspike either. Your best bet is playing passive during lane and not give him kills to cash in his stacks. If possible getting a support with hard cc works well too, because his axe catching mechanics will always tell you where he'll go, making him an easier target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-05-24T13:30:30.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poke him.

As I said in my original post, I main Tristana and the only other ADC I play with any regularity is Cait and she's about to get massive dicked over by senseless nerfs. Its good in theory but doesn't help my particular situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-05-24T13:36:11.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean you asked how to deal with Draven in lane and I answered, lol. If you pick Tristana who only has basic attacks in her kit, against somebody who can outtrade any other ADC with basic attacks, you're counter picking yourself and there is no answer.

Furthermore, telling me to pick someone else just because their picking Draven doesn't really provide any constructive advice, especially since I literally just said the only AD's I'm functional at are Trist and Cait(who is about to get nerfed). I can't help but feel picking an AD I'm not used to against Draven is worse than picking one I am used to.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-05-24T16:01:01.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get counter picked there's not much you can do sadly.

I'm actually good at setting up freezes but Tristana as a champion doesn't allow for them. \n\nAs for learning Varus, I have him and I play him but its a very different style; it sounds troll but I only ever really play him AP which can work botlane but only if we have AD somewhere else. :/ I suppose I could try and learn to play him AD but he, like Caitlyn will be, was pretty heavily nerfed after the Lethality stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-05-26T15:25:01.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea Draven just stomps Tristana really hard in like every way.
