It happens randomly and it only started when Overcharge came out and it happens a lot in Overcharge itself. It was to the point where I had to stop playing the gamemode because every game I would crash.\r\nI've updated everything I can and I still crash every other game or so. I run GTA V at good settings and I don't crash and I can record at 1080p 60fps so I'm really confused about how League crashes me but not my more PC intensive games. \r\n\r\nHere's my specs:\r\nWindows 10\r\nAMD Radeon RX 470 \r\nIntel Core i5-4570\r\n8 Gb Memory GDDR5\r\n\r\nIts not an amazing computer but Overwatch runs at 80fps at high settings so I'm hella confused why League keeps crashing. I would post a video showing the problem but.... yeah... \r\n\r\nPlease help me soon because I really want to play League more but I don't want to play if I'm going to crash and put my teammates at a disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T22:27:45.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overcharge had a lot of really hardware intensive elements that actually gave a lot of players fps problems. I'd first check for graphics drivers of course, but also be sure to check out the steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) for some other basic troubleshooting. \n\nThose steps may not fix things 100%, but it's always good to cover the basics first. After that reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with some game logs so they can see what else might need to be done!","replies":[{"poster":"ßuttStallion","date":"2017-12-12T01:00:01.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I poorly explained myself.
