Id recommend updating all drivers,cleaning out PC fans and moving PC to a spot with good air flow and circulation. Keep ur comp as cool as possible. Test out other games for like an hour and so while monitoring your temperature with Speccy. If you crash in other games not just LoL then its a computer problem and you might need to look into a better cooling system or new video card","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T23:28:18.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PC's shutting down like this act as a safety precaution against overheating and hardware failure.
