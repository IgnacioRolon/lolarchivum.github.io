Many of you probably don't know how we work or why we think QA at Riot is an awesome place to work, though!  With that said, we would like to open the thread to any questions you have for us about QA at Riot Games. To start the thread off we want to hit on a few different  popular questions. (Other folks working in the QA department will probably chime in as they have something to say/answer)\n\n\n**1. What does QA do at Riot?**\n\nThe short answer is- “a bunch of things”. We have Game Analysts that live and breathe competitive League of Legends and work with our champion and gameplay design teams creating and modifying content. We have test engineers that build automation frameworks and assist us in driving on continuous delivery. We have QA leads that focus on the growth and mentorship of the analysts on the teams they work with. \n\n**2. What is your day like?**\n\nOur general day to day activities will depend on the team you’re working on. Our core work hours are 10am-7pm. If you’re working on the Events QA team you will be supporting one of our many global esports events. This would include trips to Europe, various locations around the US, or any other manner of locations. Almost all of the QA at Riot are embedded on the teams they work with. Someone working with the Skins team is going to have a very different day than an Analyst working with the Patcher team. Some things that you might be doing throughout the day: Playtesting new champions or live balance changes, combing through the forums or reddit to hunt down any escaped bugs, participating in long term team planning, and test plan creation/execution.\n\n**3. Do I need to be Challenger Tier to work at Riot?**\n\nNo, but that depends on what you want to do. Almost all of the QA Analysts  working with designers on live balance changes are platinum to challenger tier. Other positions don’t need to have mad League of Legends skills, but it never hurts. Almost all of the game focused QA positions are going to require a strong knowledge of the game. \n\n**4. Where is Riot Games?**\n\nWe’re lots of places, you can check out all the specific office locations on our careers page www.riotgames.com/careers . Our Headquarters are located in Santa Monica. We have open QA positions in Saint Louis, Santa Monica and a few other locations. If you’re interested in applying, please include this post and specifically reference “Dannamoth” in your cover letter, this will help us track those who apply!","replies":[{"poster":"IonCannonKarthus","date":"2014-05-15T21:31:54.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just need to know, for science reasons.  @Riot Ames, when did you first decide to take up the mantle of RP giver and ruin someones perfect score of Zero RP?","replies":[{"poster":"DadAmes","date":"2014-05-15T21:36:27.418+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"In an age long forgotten, full of twisted creatures and maddening geometries, before light and goodness had filled the world, I was summoned to my eternal mission by a lone summoner who thought he had 'won the game'.

As a matter of fact, there *are* opportunities to be a badass coder in QA!\n\nWe have a technical career path that leads up to being something known as a Test Engineer, or similarly a \"Software Developer in Test\" (SDET for short). These roles involve fun challengese such as \"How do we automated testing for League of Legends and the surrounding systems\"? It is a pretty critical role to reliably shipping LoL to players every 2 weeks.\n\nOther projects include writing awesome tools for our QA and Engineering folks that help improve their efficiency and workflow (examples: source control plugins, informational displays of internal development metrics, etc..).\n\nAn awesome part of this role is that there is a need for it in pretty much every area - Game, Platform/Backend, Web, Mobile... so you really get a lot of opportunities for learning different tech.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-15T22:20:16.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading through, I notice 'having a project to point to'  has been a consistent good bonus to any application.

For example, someone I recently interviewed for a team had a jungle simulator that allowed you to plug in certain champions/runes/masteries and gave you how long certain routes would take. This allowed me to see his software writing skills and how he solved problems. It also showed me an element of his passion for League of Legends. \n\nIf you think about it from the companies perspective we're trying to figure out if the person in the room with us has the skills to do the job we want to hire them for. For people who are working through or finished college, you might not have relevant work experience. How do you show you have experience? DO the thing you want to be doing for a company. If you want to work on live design? Break down champions/meta/design decisions and propose possible changes. Want to work on software?

What are some of the most active and engaged teams currently?\n\nAnd more specific, do you have any QA members working with the CB team and/or player relations? It's been an area of interest for me as I have been what I feel is very active on the CB and have (hopefully) a good reputation built up here among reds and players.","replies":[{"poster":"Dannamoth","date":"2014-05-15T23:23:23.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing! QA is embedded on the teams they work with. We don't have QA sequestered into some dark basement. We work super closely with developers and engineers to make sure that we're not only making objectively quality things, but subjectively awesome things. I just walked by a room with 2 champion designers and 2 QA bros working on a whiteboard over something. I believe the team working on skins/champions are super active when content they are working on first goes out to the PBE. I'm super active whenever a team I'm working with ships something. You will probably see me posting in the \"patch day bug mega thread\" every two weeks. \n\n\nInteracting with players is really up to everyone's discretion. No one is forced to post, but most everyone reads. I know we are pretty good about giving feedback to the team working on the CB boards. I'm pretty sure we have some Web QA folks working with the new site creation.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-15T23:32:20.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna lie that sounds pretty awesome. In that case, how is you guys determine internship positions? Do you have a slot saved on a team and look for \"the right intern\" or do you select interns based on a general \"best of the best\" criteria and try to place them where they would best fit?\n\nAlso, are there times when a single QA guy/gal works with multiple teams to make sure everything meshes? I consider myself very much a 'jack of all trades master of none' kind of guy. I write, design, critique, analyze, ideate and simply talk quite often and with a good amount of enthusiasm (espeically with League content) but I can't say I'm the best at any category.

What kind of culture fit are you? Are you an avid gamer, or at least do you play games on a semi consistent basis, do you work well with your team, can you kick ass on your own if need be? How do you handle conflict, and can you get results under ambiguous or sub optimal conditions. There are so many facets and areas we look for when considering someone for a position. While some of those have parallels across different positions, each position has different characteristics that the hiring manager is looking for, as noted by some of the examples above.\n\nIs having prior QA experience a plus? Most definitely, however, it’s not a deal break if you don’t. That said, you should have some solid amazing skills to make up for any lack of experience. For localization QA we want people that understand the needs of the local offices. Can you recognize that certain words, names, lore, etc may not be best suited for that area? How do players in that area identify with the content we intend to ship there? Localization is one of the most important aspects of connecting players to our game; it’s more than just a direct translation. Loc QA is about ensuring what goes out the door makes sense, is culturally relevant, non offensive, and delivers an amazing experience for the player. \n\nIn the long run, prior experience is a “great to have, not a must have”. People can be coached, mentored, and leveled up. Just because someone may lack a piece of the puzzle isn’t a reason for Riot to turn someone away. We always look for driven, amazing people that come from all different paths. \n\nWe have former lawyers, nurses, prior military, artists, etc that work in our QA organization, and each one of them brings an astounding set of skills that we need in order to deliver a product that truly works to achieve our vision of becoming the most player focused gaming company in the world. \n\nSorry this was a bit long-winded, but I wanted to try and capture the type of person we are looking for in any position we hire.

I've applied to internships for two years now, applied to a few job positions and, while nothing has come from it, I do have a few Rioter friends who do vouch for me when it comes to cultural references (\"Yeah he's definitely a fit here in terms of the kind of people Riot looks for!\")\n\nI'm primarily a writer but I'd love to help Riot in any capacity or way. So with that said, here are a few questions I have that will influence if I apply for this position or not:\n\n* 1.) How much experience or previous work do you feel applies to QA? Do you feel this is a great job that I can get with only a little-to-no experience or do you feel that I should have several, very specific qualifications?\n\n\n* 2.) As I said, I'm primarily a writer. Do you think there's a quality team that I can contribute to with this skill at all? \n\n\n* 3.) I'm a diehard league fan (Played since MF release) and decently ranked (Bronze/Silver/gold in Season 1/2/3, respectively). Does this meet expectations? Fall short? Go above and beyond in terms of Rioters?\n\n\n* 4.) I currently live in Florida and I'm a student, but as I said I am very serious in working at Riot. Would my position hurt in getting this job? Would Riot consider it bad that I am willing to forgo some education for the sake of working at Riot? (Not to say dropping 100% \"never going to school again\" but I'd certainly be taking less/no classes to dedicate myself to this position)\n\n\n* 5.) What do you consider the ideal candidate for any of these QA positions? Someone intelligent with a lot of experience? Someone who has an enormous drive to improve league and riot for the community? Someone who games day-and-night and lives n' breaths video games themselves?\n\n\n* 6.) Would it be possible to add you on the in-game client or in twitter to further discuss this along with a tad more personal information? As much as I'd like to, putting some more real-life info on the forums isn't the best.\n\n\nLike I said, I'm very serious about working at Riot and even if this position isn't right for me, I assure you that you -will- hear about me someday. Above all else, I owe it to both Riot and the community of League to make this game go even further and grander in scale.","replies":[{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2014-05-15T22:36:46.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to number 2, I did a lot of technical writing before I started at Riot and had a ton of writing samples that I was able to present during my interview process.\n\nThis experience has served me VERY well when I need to communicate with players or when we're looking to create a better experience for players when they contact us.\n\nThere are definitely teams that love people who can write very well.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-05-15T22:58:26.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technical writing as in papers and more professional samples/writing code or do you mean straight writing-writing (No rules anything goes.ooavi)\n\nNice seeing you at Riot vs. Community, btw!","replies":[{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2014-05-15T23:24:49.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straight-up writing.

If you want to be working in the art emphasis, spend time building a portfolio (this is mostly out of my wheelhouse)\n\n\nWhatelse:\n\nI would find and digest books about the software development life cycle. Books like \"How google Tests code\" and \"Crucial Conversations\" are both decent reads. It is also incredibly helpful to have work you have completed. Work on a side project outside of normal classes. This gives you great topics to talk about during an interview and shows you can accomplish things.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
