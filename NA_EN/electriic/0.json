Is Udyr good for lanes?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;m really new to LoL and I just wanted to know which of these 2 champions is better. I played Kha&#039;Zix when he was free to play up to lvl 6 and I really liked him because of the damage he does and is by far my best champ. I haven&#039;t used Pantheon but am considering buying him since he is cheaper and has more or less the same stats as Kha&#039;Zix. I used Olaf but I don&#039;t like him that much. I also want to buy Udyr as tank but I read that he is a jungle champ. I know it all depends on how you build him but is he good for lanes in general?  Any champ recommendation would be appreciated. Preferably Tanks/Fighters/Assassin. I don&#039;t spell casters. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"supes the lost","date":"2015-06-12T22:42:43.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"take this from someone who plays a decent amount of Kha'zix, he's extremely reliant on the enemy messing up and is almost completely shoehorned into being a jungler, you should get Pantheon, he is an amazing top laner and works well and a jungler too. Also, from what I've seen, full AD tiger Udyr seems to be the popular build for top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Electriic","date":"2015-06-16T03:06:31.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.

So it comes down to play style, deleting your target and being squishy? Go with Kha'Zix. Lower damage but able to live longer, go with Pantheon. Kha'Zix is generally a jungler too. Pantheon I've seen about 50/50 between top lane and jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Panwar","date":"2015-06-16T04:55:01.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both Pantheon and Udyr are going to be highly match up dependent in top lane. Some champs they will just destroy and then others they will be destroyed by. Kha'zix has more options and while being more complicated to play is going to be better off in lanes without a favorable match up. That being said because he is low on the utility side his usefulness to a team when behind is fairly limited. Where as Pan and Udyr can at least stun folks(though if they are behind they will likely die right after.)","replies":[]}]}
