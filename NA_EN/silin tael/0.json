I recommend going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot any snags, and test it in a custom game.\n\nIf the issue persist, run a traceroute so we can see where the hiccup is coming from.  Do this by downloading [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and routing to EUNE game server: 31.186.224.42.  Run it for about 5 minutes, remove the IP on the first two rows, and let me know what you find.","replies":[]}]}
