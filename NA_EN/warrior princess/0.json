As for the idea that Riot should just perma-mute accounts instead of permabanning them, Riot tried that before and it didn't work. From [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this &#x27;large restriction&#x27; category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nIf someone isn't gonna interact with others in a mature and respectful manner despite getting multiple chances to do so then why shouldn't they be removed from the community?","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-03-13T04:51:26.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I believe the \"method\" is at fault here.

These are just a couple of examples, the whole idea behind &quot;limiting messages&quot; is a bad strategy.\n\nI have never received any form of punishment in this game, but that's not to say I've never gotten angry at people, oh no. However, I don't use chat to abuse or harass other players, instead keeping it focused on mostly gameplay related stuff or stuff like \"gj\" whenever a successful play is made. What I do instead is just yell and rage at the screen to vent my anger and frustration. Now I understand that that's not an option for everyone, hence why I suggest that those people hit a pillow or squeeze a stress ball-something that's not raging at people via chat.\n\nAlso, the purpose of chat restrictions is to encourage people to use chat for mostly gameplay related things such as \"fid flashless\" rather than get into a heated argument (or worse a flame war) with someone else. While I do get what you're saying about the annoyance about having limited messages to send at any given time (especially in situations like your example), it does beg the question though that if one is getting chat restricted allot then perhaps that means that there's a problem with that particular player rather than the nature of chat restrictions themselves.\n\n> If Riot wants to truly obtain REAL DATA, they need to quit looking at their unrealistic dream of &quot;reforming&quot; players and completely remove ALL communication ability for the players who are consistently being aggressive with communication. If a player cannot ping, see any other players talking, or talk in the chat, the only thing they will be capable of doing is focusing on themselves. \n\nSome people reform, some don't. At least Riot is giving people the opportunity to reform when most other companies would just outright ban players right away. For some people a simple reminder/notice that \"hey, your behavior has been pretty unsportsmanlike lately. Try taking a break to regroup and cool off\" is all it takes to get them [back] on the right track. As for removing all forms of communication in a game like this I feel that's a bad idea. Besides, Riot has stated numerous times in the past that they will not remove features just because some players would abuse them to be jerks to others, opting instead to remove the jerks abusing said features.\n \n> Sure, you cannot remove all forms of trolling.. some people just want to watch the world burn. They&#x27;ll get angry at a failed gank and blow their summoner spells or ultimate for no reason, or even begin intentionally feeding, but to me that&#x27;s the level where players deserve to be banned.

Communication in A GAME (yes, A GAME, a form of entertainment) should not be a focal point for removing players. Abusing the systems in place (aka feeding, trolling, cheating, etc.), should be the only reason an account is ever permanently banned.\n\nTechnically Riot is doing exactly what you think they should be doing, removing players who frequently abuse the systems in place, with chat being one such system.\n\nAlso from my experience when it comes to chat related offenses people are only punished for fighting with and harassing people, not necessarily for miscommunication. You're right in that this is a game and like all games it's meant to be enjoyed. You know what's not enjoyable? Having to deal with and listen to people argue, fight with and harass others. Why should Riot allow someone to keep playing when they have repeatedly proven that they aren't gonna change their behavior enough to consistently interact with others in a neutral or positive manner even if they've spent money on the game?

Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\nYes Riot can't stop people from making new accounts but the chronic misbehavers will eventually find that their newer accounts also punished as well if they continue to misbehave.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-03-13T02:56:09.845+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep seeing players saying they were banned for telling people to ward, then they post their logs and it is always like \"Holy fuck, you piece of shit, why don't you ward %%%?\" or something like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Onecimus","date":"2018-03-13T04:31:03.975+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warrior Princess,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tlBOeeMG,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-13T02:37:13.960+0000)\n>\n> All because there are snowflakes that are crying about being told to ward and having their e-feelings hurt when there is a mute button not being used.
