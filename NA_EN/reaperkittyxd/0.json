If your MMR is below the average, you gain less LP and lose more LP, and if it's higher than the average, you gain more LP and lose less LP. This is to help players in rankings below their skill level to rank faster and slows boosting. Also, though I'm not sure, I'd imagine the b4 MMR average is quite a bit higher than the b5, since b5 is as low as you can go.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T04:21:29.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might have something to do with it.

Due to many losses in a row, your MMR is below average. However, if you go on a winning streak, your MMR will balance out and the amount of LP gained will increase and vice versa.","replies":[]}]}]}
