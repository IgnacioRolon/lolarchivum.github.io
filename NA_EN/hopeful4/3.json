Doesnt it stand against of many of Riot's principles?\n\n1. Its uninteractive. The moment that both midlaners complete their first or second item, they merely take turns at destroying waves in 2-3 seconds.\n\n2. It creates balance problems. Pretty much every midlaner needs insant waveclear in order to compete.\n\n3. It creates rigid and predictable games. \n\n4. It makes the games hard to close. Yes, turtling and waveclearing is awful. Awful to play and awful to watch. Its one thing if a team makes a comeback based on a big play. Another if they just turtle to the point that gold doesnt matter anymore because everyone is at 4-5 items.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-01T21:23:05.982+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> why Riot never speaks about it?\n\nIt's hard to talk with players about problems you don't have clear answers to.

So it adds a level of complexity to pro game where you have to control who is stacking massive CS in order to wave clear while balancing the power of wave clear in an easy way (add more or less resistance to and season to flavor).

REALLY desperately hoping you'll see this.\n\nThe PBE change you've implemented permanently ruins Zilean outside of support.  Of course, most mages with cooldown gating  would be hit hard by changing waveclear thresholds (so, ironically, the ones who DON'T have sustained DPS suffer, rather than the strong waveclear mages like Azir, Taliyah etc.)\n\nThe reason is because ever since he was released in his reworked form _three years ago,_ hitting rank 5 on his Q was enough for a bomb to 1-shot the caster creeps.\nOne of Zilean's core, most important gameplay mechanics is double-bombing a caster creep that an enemy recklessly stands too close to.  Because the first bomb's detonation kills the creep, both bombs actually detonate simultaneously.  It's Zilean's only kill pressure in solo lanes, his only way of surprising the enemy, the only way to land bombs reliably above ~silver-gold MMR.\n\nNow with the caster's HP change, his bombs never reach a threshold where they can 1-shot the caster creeps.  Ever.  It permanently removes one of his most core mechanics.\n\nI understand you may not care or may think it insignificant since he's an unpopular champion _and_ his less popular role, but please, please don't do this to him.  This mechanic is as critical on Zilean as MF's Q bouncing off of minions is to her.  Imagine if you did a minion change that one day made MF's Q stop bouncing off of them.  It'd remove her most fundamental killing/poking mechanic.  That's what Zilean is face.  (And there are a LOT of us us passionate solo lane Zilean mains!)\n\nI appreciate that you said yourself this change is probably too restrictive, but I've heard similar things before and they still went through, so I'm worried.\n\nI've played over 3,000 mid/toplane Zilean games over the past 3 years, I'm known as the solo lane Zilean one trick at my university, I've reached diamond twice and I'm involved in an active community of quirky Zilean mains with unique usernames across all ELOs in the in-client Zileanmains Club in NA.  I cannot understate how devastating doing this to Zilean would be.  It isn't just a 'tiny bit of collateral damage', for some chunk of at least a few tens of thousands of mid/top Zilean lovers, you'd be effectively deleting their champion from the game.\n\nPlease keep this in mind before you finalize any waveclear changes on the PBE.  <3\n\n~ Off Meta Zilean/ Splitpush Zilean / Be Kind Rewind / Pentakillean\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}} \n\nP.S.\n\nIt's my strong opinion that the actual offenders (Azir, Sivir, other ADCs?) should have their waveclear hit rather, than ubiquitously nerfing the entire system for every innocent spellcaster in the game.

But I will say it anyway.  You guys could go look back to your data over the course of your history to look and compare a few of the times you think it was the best versions of wave clear and use that to see what the damage ratio for champs vs minion health was or what ever else you need to just get a good idea to work towards.

The first is the non-interactive lane, where Malz or whoever just spams his spells, clears the wave and walks away.  Repeat ad nauseum.  The second problem is where a team tries to siege a tower and the creep wave gets one-shot, meaning you have to wait 30sec for the next wave to roll up ... only to get one-shot.  In other words, turtling.  The only to get around this is baron buff, and if there is no baron available, it's wait 8min for next Baron.  \n\nI don't have an easy solution to the first one, as it's really certain champions abusing certain mechanics, but the second one seems like it could be easier.  Have it so that after 20min or so, champions can buff up minion defence just with their pressence, and it stacks.  If you have five people seiging down mid, the bonus is more effective than only having three.  The boost makes it so that the wave takes more than 0.5 second to get deleted, meaning the defending team needs to either expend more resources or pick a fight or do anything besides just sit behind the turret and let Cait use Shiv to clear everything.\n\nThis punishes turtling without hurting farming.  That is, if you are alone in a sidelane, you can push and farm easily.  That becomes less effective when five enemy champs are there knocking on your turrets.  Doesn't change anything else about the game, and it only applies after laning phase.  Likely not even noticeable in low elo, where most of us are, but it could speed up competitive.  Worth a thought, if nothing else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-01T20:28:39.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is an issue that cant be fixed.
