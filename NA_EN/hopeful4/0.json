Found some interesting concepts that we'll probably explore again at some point, didn't hit on anything we felt was ready to be shipped though. Part of the reason for that is that there are a lot of objectives on the map already at this point, so the bar for adding another one has to be pretty high. \n\nWe'll probably change kits so that some abilities do reveal invisible champs (unreliable ones, or those with long CD) and some only give red trinket style reveal (can see the silhouette, still can't target). We're fine with some champs being better choices than others against invisibility users, don't want to make them too strong a counter though.\n\nNo current plans for changes to regular wards (SightStone/yellow trinket/Trackers) or blue trinket wards. \n\nMachete/Talisman still build into the jungle items (PVP smites still exist).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2016-10-19T02:43:38.530+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you not have a Pink Ward/Control Ward Trinket for us sups? \nPls, we want to have 6 itemslots, too!

He's never a bad pick which means if a stealth champ is picked he straight up becomes the best pick.\n\nIf you're looking at champs where this is an appropriate strength you'd want to look at champs who aren't already the best at what they do and are specialists. The champ who springs to my mind would be TF, who's currently just a bad A-Sol. If TF counters stealth then it gives you a reason to want him over A-Sol, but he's still not the undisputed best midlane pick into stealth, because he's a specialist and sometimes his strengths just aren't applicable, unlike Lee Sin's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hopeful4","date":"2016-10-19T02:39:06.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your response.
