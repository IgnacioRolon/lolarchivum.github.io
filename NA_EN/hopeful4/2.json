That&#039;s not new to preseason, being something we saw as a trend toward the end of 2015, particularly in the World Championships. We&#039;re currently exploring changes here to put more value on Dragon, which would potentially include making the second buff stack more appealing.\r\n\r\n Nearly a month passed and still nothing, i hope you didnt cancel them. \r\n\r\n Oh, and a new buff for Herald would be nice too. Its useless in both soloQ and competitive","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-29T18:54:28.014+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe we'll have some dragon changes on the PBE today. \n\nFor Rift Herald we reduced the damage it dealt recently in 6.1 because from what we'd seen the cost of taking the buff was significantly higher than the benefit it often offered. So far we haven't seen much change in its attractiveness. It does take a little while for effects like that to get revalued, so we're holding off on further changes for a bit. If it's still underutilized in a patch or two though we'll look at additional changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-01-29T06:43:29.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, I want to argue Herald isn't useless, but unless you have tele, you're wasting about 25% of its duration getting back to lane because you're forced to back.\nThen if you're forced to fight, you still don't get too much of an advantage - especially if you're behind. It doesn't buff minions too strongly, either.","replies":[]}]}
