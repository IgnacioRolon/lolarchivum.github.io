In general you just have to ignore that it exists while building your team and then simply cross your fingers that the stars align and you get a sequence of dragon buffs that benefit your team the most.\n\nWhat I would LOVE to see is having dragons reduced to two types per game (chosen randomly), have them alternate on spawn, and some kind of system where in champion select teams would be shown which dragons would be spawning in that game (maybe even which one is first).\n\nYes it would remove some of the unpredictability from the game, but I'm personally not a fan of the randomness in the current system. Getting to see teams have the choice to decide between making a dragon focused comp or a team that would work well against it, etc. would be really interesting. \n\nThis would somewhat unlock the dragon-altering-the-strategic-game that you've been looking for while still letting a bit of randomness/unpredictability exist between different games.\n\nImagine if teams were told \"the two dragon types this game will be earth/ocean\", they could opt to go for a heavy seiging comp to fully benefit from the buffs - or their opponents could pick a heavy engage team and hope to win because they know their enemies are clearly going to be repeatedly grouping around to pressure for dragon. If it were fire/air then maybe a team could opt to form more of a split push team,etc.\n\nTL;DR: I think the new dragons are awesome conceptually but the heavy randomness, unpredictability, and not knowing about the game's state during champ select greatly limit the new system from flourishing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blossora","date":"2016-05-16T08:07:11.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elite4Runner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OgKdk80g,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-05-10T19:17:21.525+0000)\n> If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea for the cloud dragon buff, maybe it could work as a new champion passive?
