You have to know your champ, how others affect your champ, what situations your champ can survive, how best to use your abilities in certain situations as well as the most effective rotation of said abilities.

With Yorick, most people just don't see him often enough to learn how to deal with him.  When people see a Yorick for the first time in 300+ games, chances are that they don't know what do with the matchup.  When people don't understand a matchup, they will be disadvantaged and will often become frustrated.  But, since they probably won't see another Yorick for 300+ more games, they aren't likely to remember any of the lessons they learned next time around.\n\nOutside of his ultimate, his kit is extremely similar to Darius, except Yorick has worse all-ins, slightly better ability ranges, is more mana hungry, and you can remove his DOT (ghoul aggro) unlike Darius's Hemorrhage bleed.  He is actually a far more forgiving lane opponent than Darius is, since he doesn't snowball nearly as hard and he can be counterbuilt with some sustain.  Nine times out of ten when people do badly against a top lane Yorick, it's because they expect Yorick to be a trash pick so they don't respect his space like they would laning against Darius.\n\nThe idea that Yorick is worthless after laning is another Yorick myth.  His Q + W + E is as powerful as Darius's after laning and his finished {{item:3042}} is a nice lategame powerspike.  Yorick doesn't snowball like Darius at the end of laning because he doesn't have Darius's midgame kill potential, but Yorick's ultimate lets him fill his niche as the utility/teamplay juggernaut perfectly after laning.  I can guarantee you that most people who actually play Yorick feel that he is plenty rewarding and useful after laning.  His ultimate definitely has a lot of flexibility and non-selfish power after laning, but the rest of his kit still packs a punch all game long.  I personally love how he transitions into a supportive carry lategame, rather than greedily hogging all of the team's kills like some Darius players will do with their ultimate, because I enjoy helping my teammates succeed.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-03-12T22:58:07.882+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realize that statement about Yorick was a lot more negative than I had intended, so I apologize, what I had meant was Yorick at least won't be bullying you outside of the lane as much.
