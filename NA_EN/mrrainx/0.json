He has a finite supply of magic that he takes. So, if he went to Mt. Targon and took some magical powers and used them, they would run out pretty quickly. If he wanted to have continued use of their power, he would have to remain at Mt. Targon. Also, the trip to the top of mountains is dangerous. Going back and forth would prove difficult. Also, I believe the aspects have to bless him with access to the magical properties of the mountain. \n\nHe'd be far better off finding Morgana, Kayle, Zoe, etc. and getting their powers directly instead of trying to climb the mountain several times over and over again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2020-01-21T00:58:22.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze is human, I think you mean Xerath.\n\nRyze is fight/ becoming corrupted by the world runes.  \n\nBut since you bring up Ryze, would Sylas absorb pre world rune magic, or post world rune magic.

I know drinking Petricite elixirs/potions causes pain to mages, but for example, in Flesh and Stone, Lux touched Petricite and didnt feel pain:\n> Lux approached the plinth where the colossus stood, all alone in the stillness of night. She cautiously placed her hand on the cold petricite foundation. Wonder what it tastes like. I bet it’s really bitter, she reckoned. She supposed she would find out soon enough, unless her plan worked.\n\nAnd Sylas isnt in constant pain just by wearing the shackles(and they do absorb his magic since he lost part of his magical sigth on prision, he just absorbs it back). And it makes sense that Petricite elixirs would hurt since well, you're basically drinking concrete.\n\nSo can you clarify? Petricite absorbing magic making mages feel pain doesnt seem to fit what the lore currently says, save for potions.\n\nAlso what do you exactly mean when saying he cant absorb magic? In Demacian Heart he seemed to pretty clearly absorb a girl's magic   without Petricite even if he couldnt keep it for long: \n> The boy rushed toward the girl, throwing himself between the heavy quarterstaff and the flaring streams of light. The hairs on his arms singed and his fingers blistered as he touched the little mage.\n> \n> A twisting arc of lightning pierced his hand, and a blazing current rushed through his flesh, contorting his entire body. The boy's heart clenched and all the air inside him rushed out. He gasped for breath but drew only emptiness.\n> ...\n> His heart raced, pumping a numbing calmness throughout his body. The blaze inside him remained, but no longer threatened to consume him. Instead, it flowed calmly throughout, and for the briefest moments it felt malleable to his thoughts. Then it suddenly sparked and flared hotter until he could no longer contain it inside.\n> \n> Light erupted from his hands, and the world disappeared.\n> \n> Sylas opened his eyes. Three smoldering husks lay strewn on the scorched ground. One of them held a warped and splintered staff in hand. The other two had fallen near each other, their arms splayed and reaching, but forever apart.

The man tore off one of his gloves and grabbed her by the arm, and even as Thorva tried to summon her gods-given power, she felt it ripped out of her, forcibly drained from the core of her being.
