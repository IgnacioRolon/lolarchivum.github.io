And it doesn&#039;t have to be a Marksman with a Support, it can be _any two Champs_. Like Singed and Taliyah, for example (though to be honest, I don&#039;t think anyone would want to try _that_ clusterfuck anytime soon). You can list more than one combo as well, if you want to share them. I&#039;ll list two, as an example.\r\nMy first is called Siondrome, and it&#039;s a Kalista and Sion pairing. Sion gets bound to Kalista, and the two level up until they get their Ults. When you see a good time to do so, have Sion ult in. Immediately AFTER (not during or before) his ult hits, have Kalista use her Ult to pull him back. Sion clicks on the destination he wants her Ult to land, and immediately after he knocks the opponents up he does his Q. The CC is amazing if you pull it off correctly.\r\nThe second is called ThreshCrank, which is obviously a Thresh and Blitzcrank pairing -- and it&#039;s obviously not viable for Ranked, but it still looks pretty awesome. Have Thresh and Blitzcrank get their basic abilities; it&#039;s even better if you have their ults ready too, but if you can synergize well enough you won&#039;t need them. Have Thresh lay down his lantern, preferably in a bush, and have Blitzcrank stand in it so as he gets the shield (not important, but you DO need to stand in it). Have Blitz use his Q and, before the hook lands on a target, click the lantern so Blitz goes to Thresh&#039;s location -- Thresh should be under your tower, and the victim of Blitz&#039;s Q should be there as well. Use your CC abilities to likely kill the opponent dumb enough to fall for the obvious strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2016-12-17T08:27:16.124+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean and sion/alistar/syndra.

Yasuo can farm easily till level 6 due to his and Janna's shield (also his own shield only procs if he would take HP damage - meaning that it will activate only after Janna's shield gets broken for some absurd survivability) and AD boost even vs ranged champions. From level 6 it's a slaughterfest; a good tornado or Monsoon is usually a death sentence. And God help you if he manages to snag a kill or two before that.\n\nSecond, Kalista and Nautilus. I don't think I have to expain why Nautilus getting a free gapcloser and another AoE hard CC is both hilarious and extremely painful for poor sods on the receiving end.\n\nHonorable mention to the combo that is no longer possible: Twitch and Zilean, aka \"Stealth Bomber\" lane.

I can definitely see the potential in that, though it looks very weak to Early Game poke/harass.\nNautilus gets Kalista-Ulted, then after he lands he Qs and/or Ults. Very deadly, especially when your team is ganking.\nThat last one would have been so broken if it was around.

It's always refreshing to discuss unusual builds.\n\nWith Janna/Yasuo we only have problems against really poke heavy lanes; the worst we faced till now is Sona/MF; I don't think we've ever had our assess whooped that bad. Sona/Cait is almost as deadly; Cait deals slightly less damage and Headshot can be windwalled but due to her net she is much harder to kill. Otherwise with two shields, Windwall and Yas's Q being like a pseudo-ranged AA for last hits he is surprisingly resilient to poke. Even more so if he takes Heal, but he usually runs Ignite for pre-6 cheese kills; with maxing E first and Janna's AD boost it works more often than not.\nLong story short, if you have a decent premade partner for bot, i strongly recommend it for one of the most fun experiences you'll have in League.\n\nAnd one really nice thing about Naut/Kali is how easily you can towerdive starting from level 6. Naut engages with Q and R and if he takes too much damage gets pulled by Kali to drop tower aggro and then either shot out back into the fight or behind. The ease with which you can juggle aggro can really make towers look like a joke.\n\nAnd another combo I forgot, try this one only if you have an ADC mid/top/jungle or you will severely lack in damage later: {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}}. Leona E's, Braum jumps to Leona and they become able to move next time when their death timer runs out.","replies":[{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-12-19T01:16:26.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I do my best to have discussions with people about things we both enjoy :)\nWith Janna/Yasuo, I can also see a problem with Taric and Vayne. Vayne has a lot of power and mobility, and that makes Taric's E so much easier to land. If the stun hits, Vayne can completely isolate Yasuo from Janna and absolutely destroy his early game. Tristana, like Cait, is also very hard on these two, since she has a slow which affects Yasuo's E and her long-range AAs can force out Yasuo's W. I've solo'd against a few good Yasuos and won handily because they just couldn't do anything against my poke, though I'd love to have a fight with a Janna supporting him and see how that goes. And I think I'll try doing Januo (Yasna? Windy Windwall? What's this pairing supposed to be called?) later on.\nI main Tristana, Lux, Sona, and Nautilus as my mains, and boy you're right about Naut having lots of body. It's pretty much exactly Siondrome but with more safety and A LOT more CC thanks to Naut. You're absolutely guaranteed a kill if you and Kalista are working together, especially if you have a mobile Jungler like Rengar or Yi ganking. Once I can find a Kalista I'm definitely trying this.\nFor the last one, it looks like you're throwing away damage for max CC, with around the same effect as Thresh's W. I like it, though it's hard to tell what you should build because you have to think about how much damage you want to do each burst. I can see Leona building more AS and CDR to help proc Braum's passive, and Braum goes full AP Tank and takes turret aggro while the roaming/ganking Carry comes and seals the kills. It also helps that you can build the Hydras with Braum and Leona, so the AoE helps clear lanes a lot faster so you can bring down turrets (which lets you roam, which lets your team get ahead because both Braum and Leona are stunning/slowing your opponents to oblivion).","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2016-12-19T22:09:27.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't played vs a Taric/Vayne matchup so I can't say for sure... now that I think about it I saw Taric like twice in the first week following his rework and that's about it. However I see how a between a multi-direction stun and Condemn at least one of them is bound to bypass the Windwall. \nAnd isn't Tristana's slow bound to her jump? And if she actually jumps in Yasuo's face... well, let's just say the slow isn't helping her much. However, she is a problem mostly because Yas is a melee champions and we all know what you get for getting close to minions agains Tristana.\nAnd I haven't really thought about what is the pairing supposed to be called, so I'll leave it to your imagination. One thing is certain though: I'd probably sell my soul for Project Janna.\n\nAnd good luck finding a Kalista. Nowadays dedicated mains are basically the only ones playing her because sadly she's just so weak only thing that can make her shine are cheesy combos like this.\n\nAnd that's basically it for Braum/Leona. They may not have as much damage as other duos, but they can keep you in place for much longer. Our builds vary (hell, we even went with full AP assassin Leona for the lulz a few times), but Braum is the one who usually gets at least one AS item; unlike Leona who can just help to proc his passive, Braum continues to deal additional damage once max stacks are reached and it's also his job to proc Leona's passive. We are starting almost always with double shield, and from there anything goes, but a few things are almost always there: one of us gets Sightstone, most often we both pick up a Sheen item since it really helps with lack of damage; IBG is an option but Trinity is preferred due to attack speed synergizing with their passives and generally adding more stickiness. From there it's usually a mix bag of standard tank items with a Hydra tossed in somewhere. \nFor best results use with a jungler who can really (ab)use insane lockdown the duo provides and snowball of it; Rengar, Yi and Twitch are my favourites.","replies":[{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-12-21T06:03:30.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trist's slow is bound to her jump, but it's an AoE at the end so as long as you land it right you don't have to get irreversibly close. Plus, if she manages to kill/assist on Janna her W's cooldown resets so she can jump right back out. It's one of the reasons you'll never see a Rengar gank a Tristana when he's less-than-full health, because him dying to her can give her instant means of escaping. And minions are one thing, but Trist's passive gives her increased range on her AAs and abilities every level and when you have to get close to even scratch her it's bound to end badly. Even if she can get maybe one or two AAs in, that's still enough to come out even in a trade; you'll never win a trade against a smart Tristana.\nAP Assassin Leona sounds really fun. And I see what you mean about Braum getting the AS item, it makes more sense than my thought. I could see you guys doing well with an ADC Jungle Camille on your side; Braum starts his passive with a slow, Camille ults your slowed target, by the time the ult ends they're already stunned by Braum's passive, then Leona comes in and stuns. Add that with having an AP Nasus and it'd just be cancer; nothing except Veigar and/or Rumble could take advantage of that get-together.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-12-19T01:52:36.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far every time I've gone support {{champion:164}} and adc {{champion:133}} with my bf we've crushed our enemy botlane...it's hilarious\n\n\nBut before anyone asks, I'm a support main, and I build support on her so we good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Borbland","date":"2016-12-17T11:11:20.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}} {{champion:111}} \n\nEven works in Plat level Rankeds ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-12-17T21:45:33.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That CC omg\nIt looks like Siondrome but with more CC with less burst (until you get the Naut Ult chain-stunning into the Vel'Koz Ult absolutely melting those unfortunates).
