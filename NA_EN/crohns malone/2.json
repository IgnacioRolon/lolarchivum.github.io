I was playing varus and half of q's wouldn't even go off and it took me 5 seconds every time i changed a moving direction. Also as a side note, my team (who all went super negative) blamed the whole lose of the game on me even though I didn't die, got a kill, and few assists. Did i contribute to the lose, yes. Was it intentional, no. Could we have won that game, not even close. Also when I said I was lagging my talon said \"zero deaths and you're lagging, yea sure\", so I have to die before I can claim lag? That being said, **is there anyway to fix this lag with low ping and high fps**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T00:55:12.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be experiencing some nasty bursts of [*Packet Loss*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss), which typically occurs if there are issues between your PC and our servers.
