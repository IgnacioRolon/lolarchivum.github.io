I currently don't have a chat restriction and my account was never actually banned from playing games. Will I still be able to get end of season awards. This is the first season I've been able to hit plat and it'd be a real bummer if I couldn't even get the border :/. Also I have a lock on the level if that matters at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-08T21:01:24.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat restrictions will only disqualify you if it's active on the day that the season ends!

I was wondering of that means I will be ineligible for this year’s rewards? Also I’d like to know if there is a way to see how much you get reported because I did not get any warnings and had a solid level 4 honor. I understand that you cannot be unbanned but I believe in this case it wasn’t entirely justified. \nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Notørious","date":"2017-10-21T13:48:19.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwagnemiteNuke,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=yzA6pmvw,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-10-21T13:24:29.042+0000)\n>\n> Hello, \n> \n> So I got banned for two weeks yesterday  for joking with a friend and I think someone took offence, anyway the ban will be active until November 3rd.
