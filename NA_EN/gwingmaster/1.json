I&#039;m not on PBE so obviously i can&#039;t play this skin as is. I know it was just announced but looking at the video preview of the skin i had a question for KateyKhaos if she sees this. The skin is really beautiful - the animation on the Q is fantastic. As a Morg lover, I really enjoy the look and feel of this thematic and think it suits her very well. That said, at 1350 I was expecting some level of voice processing. Given that she&#039;s supposed to be a &quot;wraith&quot; wouldn&#039;t it have been appropriate to give her a little bit of a ghostly echo or something? I realize not all 1350 skins get this treatment, but for a thematic that seems to specifically want her to be ethereal and creepy, I would&#039;ve thought this would be a very clear opportunity to enhance the them with a voice filter. Can you shine any light on this decision?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-04T23:07:39.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GwingMaster,\n\nFor this particular skin, we felt her base VO fit appropriately with this skin.

As I said before, I think it's a cool thematic for her so i'm excited!!\n\nI find it interesting that her primary theme point is \"darkness\". To me, the term \"Lunar\" doesn't imply darkness, so much as a different kind of light. Sort of how I've always felt about Diana vs Leona - Diana isn't darkness the way, say, Nocturne is, but rather a different side of the same coin. \"Lunar Wraith\" to me implies something more akin to a sly, or mischievous spirit with ill intentions - contrasting to \"Radiant' which sounds stalwart, bold, and honorable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2016-01-05T22:57:47.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the price went down, the skin on the pbe now costs 975 rp instead of 1350. \n\nSo there's that, she's not gonna have a VO filter for sure now.","replies":[]}]}
