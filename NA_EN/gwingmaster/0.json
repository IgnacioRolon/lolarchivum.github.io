I promise this post IS NOT ABOUT HIS GAMEPLAY UPDATE. Good? Good. \r\n\r\nSo we all know that Mordekaiser&#039;s model is old. It doesn&#039;t look good and he&#039;s probably not gonna be up for a full visual rework for at least a few months at this rate. Instead of complaining about that, I wanted to just take a moment to offer my opinion on what is holding his skins back and how they can be improved upon in the future.\r\n\r\nThe basic knock on his skins is that most of them feel more like elaborate recolors than actual alternative versions of the character. This isn&#039;t to say that they don&#039;t have unique qualities, but more so that they simply don&#039;t offer the player a version of the character that feels noticeably different from the base form.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, let&#039;s take **Zyra** as an example of a character with a small but very solid skin selection. When we look at Zyra&#039;s skins what do we see? For the moment, let&#039;s look past the fact that her skins tend towards the more elaborate end of things given the complexity of her particles and models.\r\n\r\nBase Zyra is the awesome, Poison Ivy-style plant lady we all love. Wildfire is great - she&#039;s burning, she&#039;s molten, and she looks very intimidating. Cool. Then we get Haunted - a wonderfully macabre take on the character with great-looking demonic &#039;plants&#039; and a fantastic, zombie-esque take on Zyra&#039;s model. Her lowest end skin, SKT, still manages to give the player a slick, modern-looking character that offers a fun, lighter version of the champion (and she doesn&#039;t even need new particles to do it!).\r\n\r\nAll of these version of Zyra feel like Zyra, but offer something genuinely different and engaging players. When you pick Haunted Zyra, it feels like a totally distinct experience compared to base Zyra. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow let&#039;s look at Morde. He has Dragon Knight, Infernal Morde, Lord Morde, Pentakill, and King of Clubs. Looking just at Dragon Knight, Lord, and Infernal for a moment, we see that these are really just sligthly different versions of what is essentially the same big dude in armor. When you pick these, you&#039;re not getting a unique experience - you&#039;re just getting Morde in slightly different armor. They have none of that flair that makes each Zyra skin so satisfying. You&#039;re not filling a new fantasy or paradigm for the character, you&#039;re just making his armor red, or a little purple.\r\n\r\nPentakill Morde IS a different version of the character. He&#039;s got less armor, he&#039;s carrying an axe guitar, stuff is happening here. The major gripe with this one is mostly just that it&#039;s so damn obvious - i mean, OF COURSE Morde, the guy with all the heavy metal references, had to have this skin. It&#039;s fun, but still a but uninspiried.\r\n\r\nI hold King of Clubs apart fromt he others because at least in this case the skin attempted to use some new materials and shake up his look a bit. You see some yellow on his costume, there&#039;s a cool cape, the club is different. It&#039;s still basically just Morde in a new suit of armor, but at least there&#039;s an effort her to make him feel different.\r\n\r\nNow look - i KNOW that Morde&#039;s armor is a big part of what makes him who he is. Obviously. But look at **Leona** - her skins manage to retain the armored look while still giving her some unique feels (bathing suit Pool Party, the ornate Valkyrie, the dark grey parrots of Iron Solari). It can be done, you just need to be a little more imaginative!\r\n\r\nMorde with the new update has zero new particles on any of his skins right now. You might respond that none of his skins seem to really call for new particles now that the maces are removed from his E and his Q particle has changed. You know what? **You&#039;re right**. But that&#039;s a problem with the skins - none of them fill a different enough creative space to demand new particles. They&#039;re mostly pretty much the same thing.\r\n\r\n**There are so many creative and interesting things you could do for Morde skin. There are tons of community ideas out there. You guys are too talented and too creative to settle on just changing his armor of little bit. Morde&#039;s problem is that his skin concepts don&#039;t take him to radically new places, and as such never feel distinct or unique from one another. You guys can do better, I know it! For the next Morde skin, whenever that is, please consider really taking him somewhere new! Otherwise, the same complaints will always persist.

I agree that some of his older skins (as well as older skins for other champions) don't really fulfill a different fantasy, or really push a different thematic for a champion. I think we've come a long way in terms of improving the kind of skins we can create, and in a lot of cases, have managed to think outside the box.

It's still basically just Morde in a new suit of armor, but at least there's an effort her to make him feel different.\n\nLet's take a step back and take a look at Mordekaiser's catalog of skins. Prior to King of Clubs, his last skin was in 2011. As mentioned before, older skins didn't really push a champion into another space, but instead, gave them more of a costume change. \n\nKing of Clubs Mordekaiser was the first time we've worked on a skin for him recently (holy crap, it'd been a while). \n\nHe's in a similar place as Eve when it comes to skins. His model and rig aren't fantastic, which leaves us with some limitations as to what we can do when it comes to a skin. In Eve's case, we gave her Safecracker Eve because she a. fit in well with the thematic we wanted, and b. it was a 750 RP skin (new model and texture) that accepted the limitations of her rig. \n\nMordekaiser is in a similar spot - we wanted to give him a skin, and we felt the card skins were a great opportunity. (We went with clubs and not spades due to shape language. I know, I know, Mace of Spades though.) This skin was different than some of his others, like you'd mentioned, but at the end of the day, he's a dude in metal. \n\n> Now look - i KNOW that Morde's armor is a big part of what makes him who he is. Obviously. But look at Leona - her skins manage to retain the armored look while still giving her some unique feels (bathing suit Pool Party, the ornate Valkyrie, the dark grey parrots of Iron Solari). It can be done, you just need to be a little more imaginative!\n\nYup! Mordekaiser is a big dude in some pretty heavy armor, but you're right - other champions, such as Leona - have a wider catalog of armor styles, and even some without their base armor, and it works well. In regards to Mordekaiser, Pentakill is the furthest we've pushed him so far. I agree that it's something that can be done! \n\n> Morde with the new update has zero new particles on any of his skins right now.

D:\n\n\nWow, thanks so much for the long response Katey (seriously, you're the most reliable Rioter on these boards bar none and it's really really appreciated). Dont' hate the pizza feet - praise them :-D\n\nYou're absolutely right in saying that there's definitely something to be said for how long ago a lot of his skins were made - truthfully, it IS a bit unfair to expect them to be up to the quality of what you guys are producing these days. My post was more of an attempt to open up a discussion on the skins issue because Morde's skins aren't really talked about too much and he's one of the champs notorious for having an underwhelming assortment.\n\nTo be fair about King of Clubs - I actually like that skin. At 750 RP it's a reasonably good skin with a nice alternative take on Morde. It is somewhat clear that his rig is a major limitation, but it's good for what it is. That said, the 750 RP line doesn't necessarily mean the skin needs to be limited - just look at those awesome April Fool's skins (seriously, Nami in a urf suit is just glorious). Once his rig is updated (rito PLZ), there's still a LOT you could do with his shape.\n\nOne thing I wanted to mention - you point out that he's a bit particle-light at the moment which makes high-end skins hard on him. I would somewhat disagree - I think his particles are distinct enough that you could get some mileage out of them. Beyond this, however, i wonder if your sound guys could perhaps get in on the act? Morde's abilities have REALLY distinctive and satisfying sound effects associate with them - I would love to see future skins play with this creative space a bit. He seems like a champ uniquely suited to this kind of change.\n\n\nSince you were nice enough to ask, here are a few concepts for fun Morde thematics:\n\n\n**Thor-dekaiser** - Who's heavily armored and hits people with a big heavy smashing thing? uh, Thor does! Obviously you probably couldn't use Thor specifically but how cool would it be to see Morde decked out in the outfit of the Norse god of thunder and wielding a big-ass hammer? His Q could get some subtle lightning bolt effects and when he lands his Ult you could have a big thunder clap sound out. Perhaps his W causes him and his partner to be surrounded with static electricity? Works really well as a 975 or higher level skin with some minor particle changes and a fun new fantasy. This could be an awesome high-end skin for someone like Morde.\n\n**Voodoo Morde** - Morde becomes a master of the voodoo arts. His armor becomes tribal adornments, cobbled-together wooden plates, and occult items. His helmet could be a ceremonial mask. Instead of a mace he has a big skull on a stick that he whacks people with. This one could work without particle changes, although I could imagine his E getting some kind of color change.\n\n**Bioforge Morde** - Perhaps a bit of a stretch, but I thought it might be interesting to use the bioforge darius concept as inspiration for something similar on Morde. The idea of having bright neon colors and weird, chemically infused sci-fi elements on his model sounds cool.\n\n**Dia De Los Muertekaiser** - This is obvioulsy NOT my idea. Actually versions of this particular idea have been circling the community for a long time so you've almost certainly seen it before. I love this concept cause it takes him away from relying on metal armor exclusively but retains his shape language in a fun, creative way. It's also another skin you could likely accomplish without major particle changes, although it would almost certainly demand a unique recall animation to really push it over the top.\nhttp://lolskinconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dia_de_los_muertekaiser_by_scodo-d598uyt.jpg\n\n**Shogun Morde** - Found this one on the internets - still heavily armored, but a very different style and material to what we're used to seeing. Unique weapon, definitely a radical new look for the champ.\nhttp://img14.deviantart.net/50d5/i/2015/108/2/e/shogun_mordekaiser_by_forrestanthony-d774rmf.jpg\n\n**PROJECT: Mordekaiser** - Another internet find, but one I'm taking as more of a general aim towards a sci-fi theme for morde. This is skin idea that leaves you a lot of room to give the particles a new texture and sound effects. Definitely something on the more expensive side, but it would be really fun to see Morde as a sci-fi robot destruction machine. Perhaps somethign similar to Full Metal Jayce.\nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1420787898069/projectmordekaiser2.jpg\n\n\nThanks so much for letting us know you're listening. Honestly it's just nice to know that you guys are aware that his skin assortment isn't terribly attractive right now. It's a bit sad that we'll have to wait a while to see him visually update, but on the bright side, you guys still have a ton of great ideas out there to try on him so there should be space for some great skins somewhere down the road.

That said, an update would do wonders for the guy, and would absolutely open to door to more opportunities for a badass skin. \n\nNami is my bae, and I was fortunate enough to work on that skin. ^-^ Her water particles fit in really well with the thematic, which made it a really strong 750 RP, imo. \n\n> One thing I wanted to mention - you point out that he's a bit particle-light at the moment which makes high-end skins hard on him.

I do like your focus on the SFX, that's a really interesting way to look at a Mordekaiser skin, and potentially particle lighter champions in the future. Of course, there is also the option of the happy medium, but I think one may favor the other, depending on the thematic. \n\n> Since you were nice enough to ask, here are a few concepts for fun Morde thematics:\n\nCan't tell if you've had these saved, or if you're super passionate and wrote this out just now. Either way, this is awesome. \n\nIt's funny, whenever I ask someone who's said 'x champion needs a skin' what skin they'd like to see, many don't have an answer. I see you've thought about this one and have come prepared. :P\n\nThese are all really cool ideas - they're all unique and have their own vibe to them, and like you've suggested, really push him out of the armor space that he's come to know, aaand probably not love all that much. \n\nOut of all of them, I'm drawn to Voodoo Morde myself. *(I don't think Bioforge is half bad either.)~*\n\n> Thanks so much for letting us know you're listening.

The theme being that this Mordekaiser is a lava guardian of sorts that rises up from a pit, sent to stop you from entering the dungeon (think d&d) and will enjoy breaking you and your team with fire and metal.\n\n**Deep Terror Mordekaiser**: An anchor or a piece of a ship (maybe a whole ship like the boat-sword from pacific rim?) as his mace, weeds and sediment cover parts of his body, an creepy green glow from under his armor, and maybe some water particles? People who die at sea are sent down to Davy Jones's locker, maybe Deep Terror Mordekaiser is the locker? Would be an interesting challenge to try to differ him from base Naut, but if you guys could pull that off I think it could become a real success.\n\n**Blackfrost Mordekaiser**: Think Arthas from WoW (the lich king). Some blackfrost here (such as his mace), a pelt from volibear there, some creative thinking over here, and we got ourselves a death knight! The main idea here is that since Lissandra won the war, Mordekaiser was brought over to her side and has become a leader of an army for her. Should this become a legendary, could even have taunt lines of him against her that he plans to dethrown her. Plus I'm sure Ghostcrawler would love this skin :p\n\n**Lil Slugger Mordekaiser**: Trundle can't be the only on the field now can he? Maybe do this at around baseball championships, and have some other champions be prepared to swing a home run?\n\n**Risen Mordekaiser**: To pair with Risen Fiddlesticks. Add some sandy features to his Q, W, and R. Maybe he has a swam of locusts as well? Theme him as Shurima (this will take some creativitity because even I have no clue how to start this just merely the particles). I'm sure this skin could be a fun challenge for you guys and become a greater success.\n\n**Void Mordekaiser**: Two words- Bioorganic armour. Our master of metal has become a commander of the ~~swarm~~ Void. Flesh him out, literally. Dragon ghost could become a corrupted version of the dragon that shortly dies soon after. This skin could instead become a theme of Darkin skins if you guys ever wondered what other champions would look like if they were Darkin like Aatrox. Void or Darkin, you guys choose. Bioorganic armour is the goal here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eggstealer","date":"2015-08-19T22:59:42.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even care for mord that much, just wanted to tell you katey that I think you're the most active red on the boards and it's great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shíny","date":"2015-08-19T22:56:45.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Morde skins, would it be possible for his ult particle to be changed?\nIt seems like something that should changed when his new model's head is different from his classic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-20T00:23:01.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that before his update, he (currently) has different colours on his W.

Similar to Diablo in Heroes of the Storm. Demonic armor could be outfitted on his wrists, arms, and legs, but his hands, feet, and head are all exposed. His horns could be styled to match his base skin's helmet, and he could wield a giant, fiery axe (Titanic Hydra, anyone?)\n\n**Dragon Knight Mordekaiser**: This one fits really well with his new shtick of enslaving the dragon. His armor could be similar to base, with different colors and all, but it would shine in it's spell effects, which would be draconic and fiery. A wing flap for E. Swirling dragon scales for W. And his ult makes a dragon head above his foe instead of a helmet. And when he enslaves the dragon, it's ghost can be orange and firey instead of spectral!\n\n**Lord Mordekaiser**: I see this one as sort of a 'super Mordekaiser'. Very similar to base Mordekaiser, which I feel champions should have. I wouldn't change much here except his color scheme.\n\n**Pentakill Mordekaiser**: Self explanatory. If he got a new voice over, you could do what you did with Pentakill Karthus and add in music references, and Pentakill song lines for his ultimate.
