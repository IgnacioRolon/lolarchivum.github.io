Will this have bad effect to my account?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-22T00:11:57.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't support third party programs, and using them can be at your own risk.  We don't know what hidden or malicious content might be hiding inside them, and we also wouldn't be able to provide support if something went wrong.  We won't suspend a player for changing language outside of their region's supported language.  Still, be wary!","replies":[{"poster":"Ult√Æma","date":"2017-01-22T17:29:58.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question - as someone from Quebec, I find it a bit unfortunate that I can't change the language of the game in French to play in NA, even though French localization already exists in Europe. I'm sure that a lot of people the U.S. feel similarly about Spanish. Why aren't there various options to change written or spoken language in the game at all? It seems like the translation work is already done, and the only worry would be implementation. Have there been talks about incorporating this feature into League? I'm sure there's a lot of value to be had in bringing LoL in each player's preferred language in every region.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gold2Stun","date":"2017-01-21T13:07:42.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it won't. Just that you can't read the options anymore when it's on japanese...\n\nAnd btw you don't have to install the voicepacks. Just go in the league package content and search for locale.cfg. Then open it with a text editor and change en_gb to ja_jp\n\nlike in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeGs9fZ-kUo\n","replies":[]}]}
