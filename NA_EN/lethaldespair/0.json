It's so annoying in team fights, and when i'm not in game, it takes so much time to get to profile or the store, i mean the response from the server is bad or something..\r\nI have repaired the client and i got a fresh windows.. I got a stable ping at 38. I don't know what the problem could be. I don't think its my connection.\r\n\r\nDo you guys have had the same problem? \r\nWhat should i do?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"subZero879","date":"2017-04-09T21:03:31.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happening with me :(\nStable ping but get lag of 2-3 seconds sometimes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-08T04:42:36.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm so the client itself is laggy as well as when you're in-game?
