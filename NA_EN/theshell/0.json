To me i believe that Low Priority queue shouldn't even be in Co-op vs Ai like that are the odds of you losing to Ai's with one person afk most people use it for practice when they purchase a new champ and they don't want to go to norms and fail. Do you guys think it's fair ?","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-08-07T06:50:47.014+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"AI and premade 5s should be exempt from leaverbuster. Why? Because if someone disconnects from a bot game, the game shuts off a bot as well. Thus leaving the game still fair. And in a premade 5, it should be up to the team to punish you, not Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BuyMeSkinsPls","date":"2015-08-07T00:28:23.455+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the world we live in now, where trash like TraakSC can post comments like that.

Punishing leavers is about reinforcing the idea that its not ok to leave and measuring things like disconnect rate that are both going to carry over to other modes when you play them. On the other hand, leaving doesn't have near the same impact on an AI game since they are both much easier and an opponent bot leaves too. So a leave creates a 4v4 rather than a 4v5.\n\nI think its also important to point out that leaverbuster doesn't hand out punishments for a single leave. You weren't punished for leaving 1 coop game. You were punished for having an unacceptable leave rate across all games. You should have at least had the warning that you had to type \"I agree\" for your first leave and probably at least 1 more leave before this.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-08-07T06:55:33.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC a week after Leaverbuster change there were servers problems so big, that half of the people playing that day had to type \"I agree\", even if it was 100% game's fault.\n\nOn the other hand:\n>You were punished for having an unacceptable leave rate across all games. \n\nThis is bullshit. You might not notice the first AFK and the second is outright punished. You don't need to AFK 10 times in a row. Just two.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TraakSC","date":"2015-08-07T00:21:41.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So you admit you went AFK after reconnecting and you are mad for being punished for it?

I believe that Everyone who plays League has been toxic at least once or twice either because they are having a bad day and people are making it worse by trolling  or their client is crashing constantly  and they can't connect to any games and its frustrating {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} .","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-08-07T19:57:58.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't seem to understand that leaverbuster is there for people who WILLINGLY afk from games, or \"rage quit\".
