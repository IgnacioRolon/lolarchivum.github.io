It was fair when rengar and kha zix were almost in every game on every lane possible and game was exciting back then, and one of my favourite when poppy, sion, maokai and almost every single tank could kill alone half of the enemy team, nobody complained. \r\n\r\nIt was possible to carry games alone even with bad team, because fed enemies did not get gold from their kills and every your kill gave you bonus 100 ad, ap, reset of cd and 5.0 attack speed limit for 30 days. Carrying alone your team when everybody fed was never easier than few years ago, nobody complained. \r\n\r\nEveryone in every single league was playing like a mad man, faker back then would be in gold. Nobody was feeding, games were not lost in 10 minutes because it is 10/0 for your enemies and every single player was winning, thanks to great matchmaking system from the past that was created by Zuckerberg himself, nobody complained. \r\n\r\nA few years ago people was not trolling, even though nobody had their lane picked by the system, there was no such a thing like a pick order, &quot;the last one picks support&quot;   or &quot;I have written first in my chat, so mid or troll&quot;. People were good teammates and honoring system was just not necessary, because everyone was a lovely person to his teammates and his enemies, nobody complained.  \r\n\r\nYou may say that items, items were great. Yeah, that was the reason they had to delete lantern from the game, because jax, Warwick and so on were just perfectly fine with it, that&#039;s why nobody complained. \r\n\r\nAlso, my favourite one, champion diversity was so much better, I mean there was no time in a history of league that the only bans were blitz, shen, malphite and kassadin for a fcking year or more I guess. Every. Single. Game. \r\n\r\n#######################\r\n\r\nI know league can be frustrating, unfair or even stupid but it is just like it has been all the time. And every other game with PvP has the same problems. This game have changed but less than most of the people here are trying to show. It was not better in the past and I am pretty sure that it was much worse but people used to remember old days as a great time. Grow up and stop complaining about everything or at least stop saying that league was greater back then, because it wasn&#039;t. Enjoy the game how it is, say what should be changed or just end the journay with it and keep only  the good memories but don&#039;t wish old league to come back, it won&#039;t and I am so fucking glad about that. \r\nPeace.","replies":[{"poster":"PICKLE RICK REEE","date":"2018-09-12T21:42:23.008+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"before it was 1 or 2 champs with a particular ability that was op\n\nnow it's every champion with every ability being a blink, %hp dmg, true dmg, %dmg amp, AS steroid, invisibility  and a \"unique\" mechanic that no other champion in the game has","replies":[{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2018-09-13T00:02:22.697+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus, runes and {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalizard","date":"2018-09-13T07:44:18.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Win rates now are closer to 50% for all champions than it used to be, there were always meta in which some champions were op and some were weak, just like it is now.

The massive focus on balancing everything by pro play (As if everyone is a pro.). The toxic community, no item variation, unbalanced runes (either useless or overpowered.), champion priority, and unstable meta.\n\nLeague has improved, but that doesn't mean that it's fun. The main reason for my leave is the horrible, random, and unpolished buffs and nerfs, champion priority, and unstable meta.\n\nMy all-time favorite champ Zoe got gutted. Though her play-style is very easily countered and champions more or as cancerous exist, but never got the same treatment, as Zoe. Too many, one type champions are prioritized, such as ADC, Tanks, Mages, Fighters, and Assassins without a balance of champion priority. ADC or Tanks are the main choices of priority, which is fucking annoying. Which then lead into meta. Tank meta, ADC meta, for fuck sack make a stable meta, where all can have some form of play priority. It's annoying to see that my Zoe got gutted because she can one-shot a mage or ADC.\nAt least Quinn got some QoL, but then she got gutted because of ADC and bruiser mains cried.\nRyze is weak unless if your good.\nShen got nerfed for no sensible reason except for Pro Play as an excuse, same with Braum.\nYi got buffed even though pros and lower agreed that it's a bad idea.\nAnd so on.\nIf the bot isn't the main priority, they will cry. You know what? I'm fed up with depending on you fuckers to do anything and have hope that you will do good so I can win. When I saw your ADC's got nerfed, I was so happy. Now we are back to ADC meta, FUCK ME.\nHey Riot, at least we mage, tank, and support mains don't complain about our champions being weak all the fucking time, but it seems you only listen to crybabies. \n\nThat why I left.\n\nI loved S5, 6, and 7. S8 not as much.\n\nYou can keep playing the game, I won't stop you. But telling me that they are doing sensible changes when it comes to balancing at the moment is misguiding.\n\nYou can also read my post, \"My Biased Farewell\": https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/MOzEdnVJ-my-biased-farewell","replies":[{"poster":"Chalizard","date":"2018-09-13T07:38:44.512+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at my acc, do I look like a guy that plays adcs?

I think this game is better because of some changes, at least for me, but for sure it doesn't have good ballance and it never had and never will. \n\nZoe was just op and annoying for every player, not only for adcs and that's good they nerfed her so now only really good players are capable of having high win rate with her. Maybe they made it a bit too far but still I have seen a great zoe players in my and my enemies team. \n\nShen is still strong imo and me and my friend had a great time playing him on support or top, he still is able to have a huge impact on the game. \n\nI hate that almost every meta must be around adcs, supports or tanks, because most of their mains, aspecially adc mains, are crying that they champions are not hypercarrys anymore and I really liked meta with heimer, swain etc. on bot as an adc.
