Modifying your permissions can get this fixed up to allow game files to be scanned, accessed, or downloaded.  Your OS has a security measure to keep you safe, which is pretty great!  We can definitely help provide some assistance in granting that access, and suggest going over our [Permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide as a first step to fix this up.
