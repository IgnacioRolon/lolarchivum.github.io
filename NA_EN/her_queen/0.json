So, feel free to share a little bit about yourself, some fun facts or even some stories. The more participation the better. :3\n\nI'll go first,\n\nI'm 20 years old, my hobbies include drawing and my style of drawing is mainly black and white pencil drawings. I like drawing characters mainly OC's created in various universes and role playing games I’ve done with IRL friends. I also really enjoy writing; I mainly write poetry, character backgrounds and character sketches. Short stories and fan-fic are things that I have recently getting into and finding lots of fun. I am usually not one to share a whole lot of my work, nor do I take requests. \n\nI am naturally very shy and modest in person and like to stick to a small group of close friends that I’ve\nmet throughout my years. I am genuinely happy and positive as things are and I am happily engaged to my best friend of nearly 8 years. \n\nThat is all I'll share for now, and I hope to see some replies. \n\nBai~\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI turned 21\n\nI work at a nursing home now\n\nI recently got a sexy gaming PC and having been enjoying playing games that are not league (on steam)\n\nI realized there are a bunch of new faces around so I wanted to bump and see some new replies : )\n","replies":[]}
