For a while there&#039;s someone who hadn&#039;t bought a single item so I said &quot;brb&quot;\r\nI wasn&#039;t away for long and came back to game just having started. I wouldn&#039;t AFK if the other person didn&#039;t take long to buy items.\r\n\r\nThen there&#039;s this player who never went to kill anything. Just ran around and kept himself alive to keep the game longer. They didn&#039;t realize I just said &quot;be right back&quot; because someone hasn&#039;t even bought an item yet, and it means I WILL be back. But hey they just had to be the better ahole and waste everyone&#039;s time.\r\n\r\nThey didn&#039;t think that the person who took a looong time to buy an item was the real culprit. Also rejected all the /ff others did. There&#039;s two of them. I just played.\r\n\r\nSo why do I even play this game? Joke&#039;s on me I guess","replies":[{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2018-09-19T12:02:13.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this feels like a repost....","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-09-19T15:35:41.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a repost.","replies":[]}]}]}
