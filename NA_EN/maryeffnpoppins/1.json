When I swap out my AMD R9 290 with a Nvidia GTX 660 the problem goes away.  been playing for weeks with the Nvidia card with not one error.  If I reinstall the AMD card, the error pops up 50% of the time.  Playing with the config folders and different versions of drivers were only  temporary fixes.  I'm not too happy about having to use the slower GTX 660, but it's the only way to play League at this time.  So until Riot and AMD work out this compatibility issue, AMD card owners are out of luck.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T04:23:47.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I'm not entirely sure why using OBS to stream would start this odd DirectX error, but most likely what's happening is some sort of faulty interaction between League, OBS, and your graphics/directX drivers.
