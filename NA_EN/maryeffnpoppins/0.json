I followed all the steps to fix it given the riot support, like downloading the CCleaner and all... It fixed the problem for like 3 days now it's happening again. Help?","replies":[{"poster":"AyyyLmaos","date":"2017-03-16T16:48:07.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When will you stop giving us bullshit about the standard \"fps issues troubleshooting\"? My rig was always able to run League at a minimum constant of 60 fps, there are plenty of people on your boards having good gaming computers that are dealing with the same problems lately. I wasn't able to play one game of League without dropping to 10 fps at random times in the last three patches. There are a lot of posts about this, and a lot of people saying replying and saying the same thing. Just look into it for fucks sake, stop telling everyone to reinstall/go on minimum video settings ( which I've seen everyone doing already without fixing anything by the way).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T20:36:52.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your could have some bad files our driver issues causing frame drops while in-game.  The client is independent of the actually game so it shouldn't impact your in-game experience.  Cleaning apps won't necessarily resolve fps issues, so instead i suggest going over the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to troubleshoot.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"tuckerthekidd","date":"2017-03-15T07:55:58.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Download adwcleaner, run it, it will clear your viruses and malwares. Helped me a lot. Also try cleaning your registry in your ccleaner. \n\nAlso enable vsync so it will cap your fps to your monitor's refresh rate. After doing so, open your nvidia control panel, or amd catalyst depends which card you are using. And select the vsync to adaptive to minimize drops and stuttering. Also you can try experimenting with nvidia inspector (if having nvidia gpu).\n\nCheers\n\n*EDIT* Make sure you run adwcleaner as administrator","replies":[]},{"poster":"Don Szechuan","date":"2017-03-15T04:24:47.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an issue in a single game earlier.
