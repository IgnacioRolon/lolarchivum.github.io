I'm receiving my new Laptop soon and I wanted to get back into League of Legends, one of my favorite games. I was wondering @Lyte if chat logs could be posted for me from the time of my ban, and if you could give some constructive feedback to help me improve my actions? I love League of Legends, and I truly do want to reform.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n-A misguided summoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Edit- I realized I may have posted this in the wrong spot. Reposting here.","replies":[]}
