She probably thinks she is at the same level of Xerath.\n\nThis likely extends beyond just her abilty to throw tiny black balls(speaking of which...that's the best you can come up with Riot?) around, but she sees herself as perfect in regards to mind and body as well. She considers herself deserving of freedom and liberation as she holds so much more power than others in Ionia, hence why she is okay with killing her master and practice her art without restraint. She has no problem showing off just how awesome she is as shown by the fact that she constantly quotes about how amazing her power is when unleashed, and how she floats around with her tiny black balls(you can do better Riot...).\n\nA person with her ego would also view her perfect body(and let's face it, her body IS perfect) as something to behold as well. If you have something magnificent, and you also have the same ego as Syndra, would you dress like a monk and hide your body from other's sight? Or would you let others behold the magnificence of your perfect form?\n\n\n\nAs for why she isn't buck naked then, well...this isn't an AO game.\n---------------\nPS - as for your idea of what Syndra should be wearing rather than her current attire. It'd be more fitting of a monk, a politician, a utilitarian mage in the military, etc.\n\nSyndra is none of that.

That discredits the complexity of her motivations and character.\n\nIf I was something magnificent like Syndra, as you suppose, I would concern myself with finery and jewels unlike anyone else. Flaunting the body is a pointless affair when everyone has one - especially in a society that emphasizes training or exercise. Jewels and luxuries is something not everyone has, and that would showcase excellence more than anything else. This is generally in line with our own societies as well - high ruler culture emphasized the grandeur of wealth and scantly bothered with exposure of the flesh, generally speaking. Again, Syndra's design is almost in line with this, but drops the ball with her torso garments.\n\nAs to my suggestions, well, this is our fundamental divide. You see her as a child with insane power. I see a ruler of her own fate and power. Yet, mysteriously, the Dark Sovereign's aesthetic is closer to a stripper than the nobility the Emperor of the Sands possesses.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thanotos Omega","date":"2014-09-27T12:45:28.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> In regards to Syndra's {{champion:134}} base skin, as a whole:\n> \n> Over all, I don't understand the inconsistent design behind her original look.

Specifically, her skin tone looks... wrong.  Just very very wrong.  Her new skin up on the PBE has a skin tone that looks pretty much perfect, could you just apply that colour to her base and the rest of her skins? Also, could you just take another pass at Prestigious skin specifically?  For a skin based on a flamboyant, colourful profession like stage magician, it now looks really, really drab and dull.\n\nSecond, I JUST posted a [thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/HWheZi1r-ironstylus-concerning-evelynns-tuvu) about {{champion:28}}'s TU, literally like a minute ago. Evelynn's update clearly goes beyond the realm of texture rebalancing into straight up texture update. My understanding though is that TUs are reserved for champs that already have solid rigs that hold up well, while Evelynn's rig is so bad that it's been stated she will never get a new skin until she gets a full on VU. Isn't all the work on the TU going to go to waste?  Or is her VU just THAT far away?\n**EDIT:** In hindsight, the bit about Evelynn might actually be more appropriate in it's own thread rather than this one, but I'm not certain so I left it in anyways.\n\nThird, Championship {{champion:102}}.  Once again, just made [a thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/VEkdmhsU-championship-shyvana) about this yesterday. Short version: really excited she's getting the championship skin, but her dragon form seems a bit too heavy on the blue and feels like it needs a bit more of another colour for contrast, while her human form's face is kinda wonky looking.  In the thread I made, [SirSkillshotz](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/SirSkillshotz) made some VERY in-depth posts detailing just what feels wrong about her face.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2014-09-26T00:47:16.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the Shyvana{{champion:102}} one, I must add that the head of the dragon form seems abit much.

Well I suppose telling me to dump it there to be abandoned works in Riots favor. So now where am I supposed to put my thread, in the Summoners Rift board? Oh wait its called Maps and Modes but is url'd as Summoners Rift. So seriously where am I supposed to post it cause there is no place that Riot would care anymore. Remember something is only as good as its weakest link and if abandoning Dominion and leaving it as a Bot haven is Riots choice then it seriously needs to reevaluate its priorities. I along with many others have given ideas and option to improve it and promote it so people will actually play the mode but if Riot doesn't want to get the help the community and myself are willing to give then when the walls come crashing down don't say you didn't see it coming. I am willing to SINGLE HANDEDLY work on the Crystal Scar VU if necessary, if MWAB is the only person in charge of TT, ARAM, and DOM then there is a serious lack of manpower that a company of Riots size needs to address. \n\nI want Riot to succeed but fighting or abandoning what you created just because you don't like it isnt the approach to take. I am very critical of Riot as I see them slowly going the way of EA in terms of actually listening on most subjects. I dont want you to become the Next EA and just out right not care what the players think (Hello the C&C players) which is what the dom community is feeling and you ARE losing paying long term customers and even short term customers that are finding the alt modes more engaging or fun than Classic SR. I don't even play Dominion but I care because thats what a person is supposed to do is care for others hardships and try to help them if possible. I'll say it again I'll do the CS rework myself if needed, I'm not even skilled in modeling or animation but I am skilled in level design. Most people are scared their talents won't meet their own expectation so they are scared to even try, this is why I havent applied to Riot is I don't think I have the experience or skills that Riot wants, but I have the drive to get it done which seems more than Riot wants to commit to Dominion.\n\nIn closing i'll ask a few questions, \nWhat is the plan for CS visual wise?\nWhy has Riot abandoned Dominion?\nWhy is there only MWAB on the Alt maps team?\nWhy has there been zero promotion for Dominion?\nWhy would you tell me to put a thread somewhere knowing that the forums would be closed soon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"topgunLT1","date":"2014-10-01T04:03:03.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i'l be making a lot of request/feedback\n\n\nMAP related ( SR update )\n\n\n#1 : Add a visual animation for the tower hits just like how the champions have hit animations\n\nThe tower needs an attack animation like champions since it already has a break between each of its attack making it possible for utilizing its down time to harass the enemy under the tower while the player is also within the towers attack range. Its kind of pointless for experienced players as they know the timing but for newcomers it'l make sense as they would be wondering as to why the tower didn't attack the enemy champion while the player was being damaged by the enemy under the his own tower. The particle effects and the sound indicator you guys added in 2013 was a nice addition but now adding this extra tower hit animation will make it even more clearer. Just like how champions move their arms to indicate an incoming attack,the  towers also needs them too since they deal a lot of damage. \n\n\n#2 : clouds/fog/mist/flying creatures as fog of war\n\ni would love to see a different approach towards showing fog of war than just with shadows that's being used currently. Can u guys use some smoke/fog effects in certain areas since already there r regions where it rains. So instead of using the same shadow everywhere u can use different effects based on different parts of the map, like how you guys did with the rain effects on the new SR map. \nHow about some clouds too to go along with this. I've always liked how in the old/current SR map and in the SR update we can see the shadows of moving clouds on the ground. So i thought since we players view the map from top it would be better to have some clouds to go along with it too. Just make them transparent but still visible. But alas this has a problem of disturbing the players vision :(\n\n\n#3: Add more details to make the sky come alive along with the cloud I mentioned in the 2nd point.\n\nI love how the map is more alive than before with non interactive creatures (clearer and better than those flies,ants of the current SR map). The rain makes it more organic and alive than pure virtual look, but why its always raining only in that same red side blue buff spot ??? :(\nHow about adding some shadow of flying birds/dragons etc just like how its done with the clouds that's there on current and updated SR. Also make some of unique animations or things pop up once a while when the player plays the game, these objects should occur rarely/randomly but never for all the matches.\nThis kinda makes the map last more fresh as the player keeps finding new stuff. Just yesterday when i was playing the SR update on custom i noticed the creature standing next to the middle tier 3 tower's stairs, and as i walked towards it with my champion trying to see it more clearly zoomed in it ran off :(. Would love to interact with those creatures like how we can do with the\nporos on Howling Abyss. \n\n\n#4 : requesting to hide the fog of war areas completely by using clouds {This is not a repetition of my 2nd point} \n\nThe problem of playing games with this view is that we loose the sense of exploration and remembering areas that we can't see. 3rd person games and 1st person games all have that unique feel making it really fun to explore the hidden areas of the map and remember the terrain structures. \nHiding the terrain and the rest of the map that's in fog of war is possible by using the clouds like i mentioned earlier. This also increases the skill cap of the players as they r now required to remember the terrain of a distant location from his champions/visible area's current location. \nIts not necessary to completely hide the areas hidden by the fog of war but its good to have certain parts being blocked by some obstruction like clouds if its in fog of war.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-09-30T16:04:30.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the name Summoner's RIFT never made mouch sense it being in a forest, but why did you decide to now make it into a mountain peak of all things?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2014-09-30T15:44:45.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may still be early in the game to say, but I was playing on Howling Abyss the other day and I noticed as I was using Iron Solari Leona, her model appeared very dark. There were heavy shadows over large parts of her body, making her color scheme feel very different.\n\nI wasn't sure if this was part of a new dynamic lighting algorithm for champs so I'm not calling it a bug. I just felt that the lighting I experienced on Howling Abyss reduced some of the clarity about Leona. It was harder to pick up on her exact location as the shadowy lighting made her blend a bit with the darker portions of the bridge.\n\nI also bring it up because it seemed a significant change in feel from when there was no dynamic lighting and from any angle her armor gleamed brilliantly, like a champion of the sun. The new texture feels very soft, and pastelle like the new SR, but it seems to have come at the cost of her radiant color scheme to some degree.\n\nAnyway, not a complaint, just an observation and a general feeling from someone who loves Iron Solari Leona.

Some champions like Ashe and Tryndamere never really had any big changes, but you guys gave them spruced up icons, which was a nice little touch. While you're doing all these texture rebalancing, why not do a mass icon rebalance for champions like Rammus and Mundo too?\n\nHowever, it's totally understandable to not update the icons of someone who is bound to get a more comprehensive rework like Poppy.\n\nI'd also categorize **item icons** as a similar low cost improvement.

But who creates it? If Rioters are okay with sharing their blogs, websites, portfolios... I would love to get some links because I need to feast my eyes on pretty and badass art.\n\n* Shurima event: I can't say this enough, but really I LOVE LOVE LOVE what you did with the videos. The visual storytelling was amazing, I loved the graphical style of it, I can't tell how many screenshots I took to get myself a new wallpaper. The animation, the transitions, everything was perfect and I loved it so much (also, Reddit thought the way the story was told was pretty bad: i thought it was great, like Nasus was telling an old legend or something, and it fit perfectly. And old legends aren't made to be super detailed with everything explained.) Great job guys!\n\n* Splash art updates: THIS IS SO AMAZING\n\n* Recent texture updates: I'm not sure I'm a big fan of Orianna's. The \"skirt\" looks great, i love the effect on max quality graphics, but her hair isn't quite as shiny and it looks really weird with the darker grey skin tone. I loved her previous metallic skin, it really looked like chrome or something- the new one doesn't give that feel, and it doesn't match the hair. Most TU are awesome though, particularly Leblanc's who finally looks like her splash (and she's beautiful).\n\n* Summoner's Rift VU: It's super cool! But... I kinda wish it was closer to the live SR's light/saturation (not necessarily as super-green but at least a little less darker, and maybe yeah, more saturated. I know you want clarity but actual SR doesn't bother me, I'd miss the \"cartoony\" & colorful look).\n\nOther than that, I don't have much to say. I just want to thank everyone at Riot for making such diverse characters, amazing visuals and so much great content overall.
