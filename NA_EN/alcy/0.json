I have no idea what i causing this i checked if my cpu is over heating as im O.C it by nearly .8ghz  but nope its at a steady 40c. next i thought it could be a graphics issue but again temps are fine and it plays other games fine.  Can anyone maybe suggest something i could do? league is the one game i play the most and yet its the only game that i get this severe lag on. thanks in advance ):\r\n\r\nMy rig:\r\nAMD FX-8320 Vishera 8-Core 3.5GHz (oc to 4.2)\r\nEVGA GeForce GTX 660 SUPERCLOCKED 2048MB\r\nPatriot Viper Xtreme 8GB Desktop Module Kit - DDR3, 2 x 4GB, 1600MHz\r\nASUS M5A78L-M LX PLUS AMD 760G Motherboard\r\nSeagate Desktop 2 TB Solid State Hybrid Drive SATA 6 GB with NCQ 64 MB\r\nCooler Master Seidon 120V â€“ Compact All-In-One CPU Liquid Water Cooling System","replies":[]}
