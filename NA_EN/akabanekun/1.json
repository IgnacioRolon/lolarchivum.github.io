Delete it and start anew\".\n\n\"The Game Mode we almost completely abandoned isn't getting any new players, and Lord knows it can't be because we were incredibly incompetent at actually promote it. Delete it.\"\n\nAt least the lore travesty was softened by the introduction of new lore. What do you plan to introduce, hein Riot? Should you also scrape the Twisted Treeline? Oh, who am I kidding, you'll probably will.\n\n\nAs a player who always defended you in almost everything non-lore related, go fuck yourselves. There's no justification for this, and nothing you'll give us to soften the blow. Fuck... you.\n\n\nEDIT: And you're not even gonna let us have the Crystal Scar in customs? I repeat: Fuck. You. You were only created because of custom games to begin with. Guess Riot doesn't like the idea of creating its own competition.
