Every new champion and champion rework is so overloaded in their kit.. Miss half your stuff, still get rewarded for a kill. There isn't any skill in that.. \n\nThat being said, and I know I'm going to be down voted for this... That makes Akali one of the most balanced champs in the game. She is one of the few champs and assassins that need to hit everything perfectly if she wants to do her job. (yes I know it sucks getting blown up by a fed akali, but ANY champ fed can do that so lets stop the stupid hyperbole arguments). She is vulnerable if she uses them to clear lanes, or help cs, and she's melee allowing exchanges in damage in lane to happen while she's trying to cs. It actually takes some skill to work around all that and use her effectively.\n\nMeanwhile Zed for example (even with his nerfs), only has to land less than half hsi stuff to blow you up. His shadow allows him to farm extremely safely while behind, something which akali cannot do very safely (She can use her shroud, but she's still very susceptible to skillshot damage, and aoe's), and he's easy to get back into the game with because all the safety, utility, and damage steroids he gets. \n\nEven talon again, point and click mass damage assassin. \n\nOf course these are assassins, but even mages, and bruisers are the same thing now.
