You're a burden and that's that. The only way you can learn to be less of a burden is by learning to get carried when behind or actually take frequent breaks between your games.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying If you're tilted, don't start a game.\r\nIf you're tilted not only are you losing your own hard earned points but also causing others to lose theirs. Not to mention tilting others and killing their entire day's enthusiasm to rank up.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-10T00:11:51.123+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> lv7\n\nSounds like you flame a lot, hope that account was not valuable.","replies":[]}]}
