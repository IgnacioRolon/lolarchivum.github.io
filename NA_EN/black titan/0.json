I guess his hype max Ws are easier for him to land in aram after he ults.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revech","date":"2020-02-06T21:48:35.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're too busy nerfing Yuumi to nurf Aphelios and Sett lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"RIP my 13900","date":"2020-01-30T09:34:16.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should also nerf Veigar and Sona for being so broken in ARAM, kappa.\n\n\nNo, just no.

Sett does not. He's new though and as now people are realising he's good, his win rate has gone up everywhere. Sett in ARAM is reaching levels Sona did before the nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salty Mc Feed","date":"2020-01-30T09:48:41.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pointless and you should consider yourself lucky if you roll strong teamfight champions but then again Riot also put oracle elixir in the shop which really fucks Teemo and basically makes him a champion without ult that is a squishy money bag and they added the global healing debuff that really fucks Soraka and Yuumi. Overall the balance in aram would be better and games would be more fun if Riot would just stop making these ridiculous bandaid fixes. It's actually so stupid.\nAnd the  biggest joke is you can buy grievous wounds items on top of the global debuff, so in combat Soraka heals almost zero and out of combat also heavily reduced. \n\nFor some reason wombo combo  champions like Sett get to be really powerful and Riot doesn't seem to mind that. Also Mages and ADC's are really strong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salty Mc Feed","date":"2020-01-30T09:52:17.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He will get nerfed soon but he will still do roughly the same thing so better get used to it...","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Am the War","date":"2020-01-30T09:50:25.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not just make the argument that he's incredibly strong in solo que, which he is. :^ )","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-30T10:19:17.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A balance complaint based on ARAM WR?
