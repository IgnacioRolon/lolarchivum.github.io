As such, we&rsquo;re taking this opportunity to go under the hood and retune her base stats to be more in line with others in her weight class.

Vi is strong regardless of how she got to be there.  \n\nTbh I commend riots approach to balancing vi.   They realize they have a pretty well designed champion that is only in flavor because of the meta game shift (even if it is thier own damned fault).

Riot doesn't *plan* on reverting game mechanics when they implement them in the first place. Riot didn't *plan* on nerfing cinderhulk when they implemented it, knowing in advance that Sejuani and other champs were going to abuse the shit out of it- just like they didn't *plan* on removing devourer when they put it in the game.\n\nSo as far as Riot is concerned CotC is here to stay, and going by the latest PBE notes they don't plan on touching it for awhile, if ever again. Thus your tacit implication that instead of addressing the specific outliers (in this case, Vi) they should instead attack the tool being abused (in this case CotC) and making it weaker for everyone else that uses it in addition to Vi, is dumb. The hyper-majority of champions that use the same game mechanics that Vi uses (CotC, the new jungle changes etc) are fairly healthy. Punishing *all* of them instead of the small handful of abusers is nonsensical.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-02-08T18:13:49.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Ridiculous nonsense.

That doesn't mean you don't alter things when they do change. Did you know Nocturne had his ult range reverted several patches ago to what it was on-release and subsequently nerfed? Because _the game changed around Nocturne and new releases made his original ult more in-line_. I wouldn't care nearly as much if Riot reverted things after the game changes. But they don't in the majority of situations.\n\n>So as far as Riot is concerned CotC is here to stay, and going by the latest PBE notes they don't plan on touching it for awhile, if ever again.

Other junglers in the previous season got nerfed because SotA was \"Here to stay\". Pardon my skepticism but for a balance team that argues about things being a permanent addition, a lot of them aren't. Hell, we already heard rumors that they want to expand mastery trees further and divert them from three-to-five. Do you think Vi will get stuff back when the game changes around her? Do you think Sejuani has received even momentary buffs due to Cinderhulk's changes leaving her in a weaker spot?\n\nAgain: This is something repeated over and over. But when it's a damage dealer it's ok to happen (Vi is the latest in a long line of damage-dealing champs abusing something defensive) but god forbid it's a tank, otherwise we invent the term Sejuani to make sure that this never happens again...~~at least to tanks because tanks are precious babies who must be protected and bottlefed~~.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-08T09:59:48.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she's freewin with ivern and lee sin and you're telling me that she's not overpowered?\n\nshe's a mobile darius, as tanky as him except that she has hard ccs+mobility+can kill a squishy in 1.5 sec \nplease, she had to be nerfed","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-02-08T18:07:49.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't see these arguments before the game changed around her and the buffs she received before (Back in late Season 6) didn't push her over the edge at all. \n\nGame changes, Vi is suddenly really good.
