It ties in with the new Targon champs lore changes/updates (possible event upcoming, it's been a while since the harrowing now.) and could possibly be accompanied by a Lunari skin for Leona. And, if we're lucky, the Baker Pantheon skin we've all been waiting for since his release.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2016-02-10T20:02:12.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you going to make this a Legacy skin?
