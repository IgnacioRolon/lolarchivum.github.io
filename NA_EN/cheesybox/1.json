But, with decreased health means Tanks become less powerful and more vulnerable because of their low ratio's and how the kits are.\n\nFor someone like {{champion:119}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:222}} or {{champion:64}}, they deal a lot of damage with little effort.

Especially when all critical items give either bonus AS or AD (1 gives Armor Penetration). \n\nSo, as much as sarcasm is lovable, please understand that damage will always deal damage. But Tanks should be able to take the damage and still continue living. \n\nWhy is it that when I get a lot of HP and MR and Armor and yet, I still died because the enemy Jinx decided to get some critical and Armor Penetration? Why is it, that every Tank's early game starts out squishy? Why is it that Tanks are needed, but only as shields to take all the damage?

That's the point of having two different damage types(Three including True Damage) in the game, if your team is entirely one stat and somebody counterbuilds it, you SHOULD have a shit ton of problems dealing with them.

Being a tank means you break the front line, take the hard cc the enemy gives you, and let the rest of your team attack the enemy.

There's this misconception that just because you are tanky you're supposed to survive everything when, in reality, if a team invests all of their resources into taking you down then you should die--but that would still be worth it because all of their abilities are now on cooldown and the rest of your team can mop them up with ease. Tanks are there to soak up damage so it doesn't land on your squishies and to disrupt the enemy team by forcing their carries away from the fight.\n\nTanks are strongest right after the laning phase when the carries haven't built their penetration items yet and by late game you should be transitioning into at least one damage item. Most tanks without reliable hard CC these days need to have at least one damage item by late game so they can chunk enemy carries before they're killed, then your own carries will hopefully be able to finish the enemy off. If you build pure tank then you should at least have some form of hard CC to keep them from dumping on you right away and give your carries the chance to delete them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2015-01-18T21:52:37.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that tanks (especially health stackers) haven't been feeling especially tanky for a while now, which is kind of a loss of fantasy for players of champs like Nautilus, Dr. Mundo, Singed, Zac, etc.  \nHow would you guys feel about...\n> {{item:3153}} Blade of the Ruined King \nCost: 3200 (900)\n> ~~+25 Attack Damage~~ -> +20 Attack Damage\n> ~~+40% Attack Speed~~ -> +35% Attack Speed\n> ~~+10% Life Steal~~ -> 8% Life Steal\n> \n> UNIQUE Passive: Basic attacks deal 8% of the target's current Health in bonus physical damage (max 60 vs. monsters and minions) on hit.\n> UNIQUE Active (90 second cooldown): Deals 10% of target champion's maximum Health (min. ~~100~~ -> **150**) as physical damage, heals for the same amount, and steals the target's Movement Speed for 3 seconds **(melee champions steal 25% Movement Speed, ranged champions steal 15% Movement Speed)**.\n\n|\n\n> {{item:3144}} Bilgewater Cutlass \nCost: 1400 (240)\n> ~~+25 Attack Damage~~ -> +20 Attack Damage\n> +8% Life Steal\n> \n> UNIQUE Active (90 second cooldown): Deals ~~100~~ -> **150** magic damage and slows the target champion's Movement Speed for 2 seconds **(melee champions slow 25% Movement Speed, ranged champions slow 15% Movement Speed)**.\n\nWould this be a potentially healthy tweak?  It would remove some of the extra power on BOTRK to make it clear that the health shredding is **the** reason to upgrade it from its components, with slot efficiency and other tacked on bonuses just being icing.  With these changes, it *might* become less of a must buy, especially on ADCs, and more of a strategic counter against heavy health stackers.  All in all, this wouldn't change much, but I think it would probably be a healthy nudge and it is slight enough that it wouldn't require other major rebalancing alongside it...\n\n|\n\nAlso, here is an idea for a change in defense masteries:\n> ~~Runic Blessing: Start the game with a 50 Health Shield.  The shield regenerates each time after respawning~~ -> Mastery removed; Legendary Guardian shifted into its position on skill tree.\n\n|\n\n> Tenacious: Reduces the duration of crowd control effects by 15% -> Effect unchanged but mastery moved down a tier in the skill tree (into Legendary Guardian's previous position).  **Requires 1 point in Swiftness.**\n\n|\n\n> **\\*NEW\\*** Unbreakable: Reduces the effectiveness of Armor and Magic penetration effects by 25%.  Requires 20 points in Defense.\n\n\nI feel this would be a much more suitable final mastery for Defense (I don't think many people will mind Runic Blessing being phased out either) while providing a much needed buff to one of the non-offense trees.  Obviously, players using this mastery would need to be quite invested in defense (IE., a real tank) for this to be effective due to the 20 Defense mastery points requirement.  \n\nHere are examples of how this would play out in a game:\n\nPlayer A -\n300 Armor (no Unbreakable mastery)\n\nPlayer B - \n300 Armor (with Unbreakable mastery)\n\nPlayer C -\nLast Whisper [35% armor negation] + Brutalizer [10 flat armor pen]\n\n\nExample 1 -\nPlayer A is attacked by Player C -> 300 Armor - (300 * 0.35 [Last Whisper] + 10 [Brutalizer]) = 185 effective armor on Player A\n\nExample 2 -\nPlayer B is attacked by Player C -> 300 Armor - ((300 * 0.35 [Last Whisper] + 10 [Brutalizer]) * 0.75 [Unbreakable]) = 213.75 effective armor on Player B.  \n\nIn this case, this is equivalent to Last Whisper's armor penetration effect being reduced from 0.35 to 0.2625 and Brutalizer's flat pen being reduced from 10 to 7.5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-01-18T19:02:54.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"if {{item:3035}}  and {{item:3135}}  provided a % increase (pre-resistance) in (physical/magic) damage instead for providing %penetration it would make the situation a bit more managable. \n\nthey could be valuable early game, as the affordability should reflect, and dull down as tanks mass resistance","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-01-19T00:27:12.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good idea.\n\nAlthough, squishies dying *even faster* may not be the most desirable consequence.","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-01-19T17:50:12.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i didnt think this through far enough. im fine with squishies dying faster, but it would make tanks incredibly OP. not only would it reduce the potential damage aimed at them, they could build it to amplify high base damages for cheap.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-01-19T16:23:40.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two major problems with tanks:\n\n1) Bruisers have slightly less survivability (they die in four seconds instead of five) while bringing significantly more damage than tanks.
