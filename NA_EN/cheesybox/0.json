Like, really high. He currently has the fifth highest ban rate in the game, at a whopping 42%. Once people started rushing tank stats on him, and figured out how to manage his rage, he pretty much took off. At this point, anyone who thinks that Gnar is bad hasn't seen a good one. And a lot of people are already asking for nerfs on the boards. \n\nAs someone who plays a lot of Gnar, and who really enjoys him, I do think his kit is overloaded. He's not wildly overpowered (he might be a little overtuned...), but he's \"overloaded\" in the sense that he has a ton of stuff he clearly doesn't need. Like an AS steroid and slow on hop. It's a mobility spell--why does it need to deal damage, slow targets, increase his attack speed, and stack hyperactive?","replies":[{"poster":"Eapenator","date":"2014-11-05T16:23:28.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a frequent gnar player, \n\nI also agree that he may be too powerful at the moment. Any champion who can win any match up in the top lane easily is too good. However, I do not think he is overloaded, rather. his mini form is just too good. \n\nI think mega gnar is in a great place at the moment, but when the opponent is facing mini gnar, he is able to bully and farm till he is able to reach mega gnar again and apply kill pressure. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, mega gnar should scare opponents and force them to play defensively, and mini gnar should have you trying to engage on him and put some pressure on him. Currently, mega gnar satisfies his role, but mini gnar is able duel really well with minimal skill/trade off and at maximum safety for a lot of damage. By hitting some of these areas in mini form, gnar should become more manageable.","replies":[{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2014-11-05T16:56:52.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with a lot of what you say. I also think Mini Gnar is going to prove very difficult to balance in the long run.\n\nThe problem with mini gnar is that virtually *all* of his power is loaded into hyperactive. He has no ult. His Q scales poorly unless you are building tons of AD--late game, you mostly just use it to slow targets and stack hyperactive. His E is a small jump, and its only offensive use is to increase your attack speed (which lets you stack hyperactive faster) and to apply a stack of hyperactive. His entire mini form is totally based around kiting targets while stacking hyperactive. And hyperactive itself has no active--it's just a passive with a massive damage proc that remains high throughout the entire game without building any damage. \n\nI agree that mini gnar's dueling potential is overpowered at the moment. But the problem with nerfing Mini Gnar's dueling is that dueling is pretty much all he brings to the table. He has what is essentially a single target slow (unless enemies are grouped incredibly close together in a line) and a bunch of single target damage--that's pretty much it. If you reduce mini gnar's dueling potential, you're reducing the only thing Mini Gnar does, and thus removing the only reason a player wants to be in mini form.\n\nThe champion was designed to have obvious strengths and weaknesses in both forms. Gnar is supposed to reward players for managing rage well by creative specific incentives and disincentives to be in either form. If mini gnar can't duel well, players are never going to want to be in mini gnar--gnar changes from a transform champion with tradeoffs to a champion with a weak base form who is always trying to build rage and go mega. \n\nI think Riot has basically two options:\n\n1) make mini gnar more vulnerable without reducing his damage. Gnar players still have a reason to be in mini form, but mini form isn't as oppressive in lane, particularly against melees. A start would be to reduce boomerang toss's max range (it's unnecessarily long right now) and reduce either the duration or the power of the slow. This might end up totally screwing Gnar's ability to lane against champions with targeted dashes (fiora, Jax, Irelia) but maybe that's fair. Riot could also experiment with attaching the %health damage on his W to an active buff--i.e., three procs always gives him the speed boost, but three procs only does the % health damage for a specific window of time with a CD. This would give Gnar access to the damage when he needs it, while creating windows of time where melees might actually be able to efficiently trade with him. \n\n2) Give gnar another reason to be in mini form. As I stated above, all mini gnar has right now is hyperactive. If they gave him some utility, they could nerf hyperactive without removing the only reason to be in mini form. The most radical way to do this would be to give mini gnar a separate ult that shares a CD with his current ult, and brings some different form of power to duels, skirmishes, and team fights.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-11-05T09:39:36.117+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"my first though \"another ADC?\" second tought \"did they learn nothing from Lucian?\".\nAnd my third though was your exact thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2014-11-05T18:22:28.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first thought was \"Wow, she looks like a really interesting support\"\nMy second thought was \"wait, she's supposed to be an ADC?!?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-11-05T18:33:27.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well yea.
