Until he has a few points in his Q and his ult up his ganks are weak, and his damage in 1v1s is meh at best. The only hope Nocturne has of winning against a Yi is if he can get Yi to Q into his spellshield. A smart Yi will enter the duel with the Q, or just save it for after Nocturne has used his shield, in which case Yi beats Nocturne.\n\nVolibear isn't strong early. He requires a significant health investment to make his execute deal any considerable damage, and the only way to make him strong early when it comes to dueling is to give up early health in favor of a Devourer's enchant to supplement his auto attack damage. But given that he lacks significant sustain in the jungle outside of his passive, attempting to counter jungle a Yi with him is asking for trouble because a Yi, even pre 6, would have no issues tearing a half health Volibear to pieces. And if he builds a Devourer instead of Juggernaut, Yi can shred him from full health without much more trouble. Until he hits level 6, Volibear's single target damage is meh at best. So if you're level 6, so is Yi. Skipped his touchy early game.\n\nAmumu certainly isn't strong early in dueling situations. He lacks mana to keep his tears up or spam his tantrum, and he isn't doing a whole lot of damage with them early on in the first place. By the time Amumu's in a position to actually be a threat 1v1, you're in the mid game.\n\nJarvan isn't going to keep up with a fleeing Yi, even popping his slow on him, and he has no way to trap him pre6 to keep him within range for a beating. Even then, Yi's Q is up faster than Jarvan's spear, so you aren't going to win that trade either.\n\nKha'Zix isn't strong in 1v1 situation until after he has a few more points in his Q, in which time Yi's been running around in his own jungle maxing his Q, which deals more damage and is up not quite as much as Kha's but still insanely fast, and has also been clearing his jungle quicker so he has a gold and level advantage. In fact, in order to beat out a Yi early on, a Kha'Zix has to sacrifice early ganking potential by evolving his Q first at level 6. Which means Yi is at level 6 as well, which once more means that Yi has been able to farm to 6, proving my point.\n\nLee Sin I'll give you. The extra durability, movement options, and the % health execute will let him beat out a Yi if the Yi isn't smart enough to tank most of Lee Sin's burst with meditate.\n\nMantheon might defeat a Yi, but only if he gets the drop on him. And even then, Yi can probably still run away or vision hop over a wall with a ward and a Q to a minion camp. But yeah, the Speedo'd Wonder could probably pull it off.\n\nRammus isn't going to counter jungle a Yi successfully. His own clear is abysmal during the early game, and he is not going to deal enough damage, nor mitigate enough damage, from Yi's attacks to let him survive. Even if you rush a Thornmail, Yi's true damage doesn't care about your armor and he's going to be dealing more damage to you than you can do back to him even with your W active. Rammus doesn't gain the potential to counterjungle until after maxing E, putting points into W, and building at least a Sunfire Cape on top of Juggernaut. The early phase of the game is over, Yi is fine.\n\nRengar? You pop your initial burst on him, which is pretty weak all things considered early on before building Warrior or Devourer, and then he just hits meditate while you keep trying to auto attack, and once meditate is down his Q and his E are back up. You lose.\n\nRek'Sai's damage early is terrible. She needs Devourer's before her damage can even begin to matter, and Hydra before she can safely start trying to 1v1 people. By which point, again, Yi is no longer in his early game either. My point once again proven.\n\nShyvana? Quite possibly. If Yi is low, and if he doesn't meditate through the duration of your W to reduce how much damage you can deal to him after it's finished.\n\nSkarner gets chopped to pieces. Don't get me wrong, I love Skarner and all, but he has to powerfarm for a Devourer's before he can even try to be relevant, and his ganks are weak pre 6 because his passive stun is meh at best early on. Once again, Yi safely emerges from the early game phase.\n\nUdyr? Maybe, depending on your skill order. Chances are you have to reduce your damage output by leveling turtle form first, or gamble on increasing damage output by leveling tiger form first. In either case, you're taking a risk even trying.\n\nWarwick isn't counterjungling Yi. Yi is counterjungling Warwick.\n\nWukong might be able to do something, if you can get him to waste his Q on the clone. But once your E Q combo is blown, and his armor returns to normal while your attack speed drops, Yi takes the win because his autos are hitting faster, and every fifth is hitting harder. Wukong needs his ult to put the finishing touches on Yi, meaning that once *again* Yi survives pre6 without an issue.\n\nXin Xiao tries to go ham on Yi. Yi presses W. Xin wastes his burst, Yi returns the favor in spades. Until Xin has his ult, his single target burst isn't high enough to counter how much Yi just flat doesn't care.\n\nNone of the champions that you've listed off can shut a Yi down in the early game. He simply deals too much damage through his Q, E, passive, and natural attack speed, reduces too much through his W, for him to be stopped by any one champion specifically in the early game race for 6. And keep in mind that during the time you're wasting traipsing around his jungle trying to find camps that he hasn't already cleared yet, or to try and find him, you aren't farming while he still is. So the more you try to counterjungle someone who's clear speeds are pretty high, the more advantage you're giving him in gold and xp because you aren't getting any.\n\nMy point stands. By taking Yi into the jungle, he doesn't have to worry about his early game, and by trying to 1v1 him if you do manage to catch him, he's more than likely going to take the kill, taunt on your body, and spam \"ez\" in the all chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-12-15T00:13:08.965+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You vastly overestimate Yi' early game.\nAny one of those champs can force Yi out of his jungle and proceed to take camps.

It's becoming even more clear to me that you don't understand the concept of counterjungling or how to to do it at all. Counter-jungling is all about understanding the respawn times of camps, and what buffs the enemy jungler is going to start. For example, in the new jungle you can almost always except Yi to go Krugs because of how good the buff is on him. Because of this he will probably try for red immediately after. If I was to try and counterjungle I would ward his blue take krugs or toad to get to lvl 2 and immediately go for his blue. This allows a pretty easy buff steal because of how long it takes Yi to take red without a smite.\n\nAlso, even if Yi were to catch you at his blue, or red in some circumstances, pre-6 he has to reliable chasing ability as Alpha strike just isn't low cooldown enough yet. Lee, Vi,  and Shaco are all good counterjunglers. Yi has no chance against champs like them.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-15T03:29:13.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, because you can control when and where the enemy jungler is, right?

And no there is not just an equal chance of being caught by the enemy jungler. If you understand jungle paths and mechanics the majority of the time an AS jungler will start krugs because of the strong buff it gives. If counterjungling was that risky then noone would do it because 50% of the time it would be unsuccessful. Also there is this thing known as warding as a stated earlier. If you ward the buffs you can tell the right time to counterjungle and the wrong times. And when playing some champions your health is not always low due to clearing jungle monsters. If you have trailblazers smite on a jungler with good sustain often times he doesn't have to worry about losing a lot of health.\n\nIt's been understood for a long time that handling Yi is incredibly easy. If he were so strong than he would be played in high elo. Only in low elo is he such a problem due to the fact that noone knows how to focus him. Because of how squishy he is one hard CC is all it takes to destroy him. If that weren't true you would see him in MANY pro and high elo games.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-15T04:31:58.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yi isn't stronger in the late game. But the advantages he gives in the mid game are my issue with him, because he passes those advantages on to the rest of his team when they get fed just from him being nearby.\n\nBut you cannot guarantee. In general, I'll usually start blue myself when I'm jungling regardless of who I'm playing, because even if they're manaless the CDR still helps my initial clear time by letting me use more abilities over the course of my first clear. You cannot 100% certain say where any jungler is going to start, because you do not see where they are or where their teammates are going. You have to guess, and you have to hope you guess right.\n\nYou aren't going to be buying wards in the early game outside of your initial trinket. So you aren't going to get anywhere near the sort of coverage that you're trying to make it seem like before either of you hit level 6 and the ganks start raining down from above. And the time it takes you to go to his jungle, find that he's already cleared a camp, and leave a ward in a critical location before going back to your own jungle is more time that you aren't making money or gaining a level that he is.\n\nYou really aren't paying attention. I'm talking about your initial clears. Before you've gone back for Pathfinder, or Stalker, or whatever item you're buying. Before you've had the time to buy wards, or to even wander into his jungle to place them. \n\nContinuously backing for wards and going into his jungle hoping to find his camps will only put you behind, and then the issue becomes that the enemy jungler already has an enchant when you're no more than a third of the way to building your own. You've invested so much time into roaming his jungle, and so much gold into getting ward coverage, during the early stages of the game that you're now behind on your build, behind by a level or two, and behind in farm. \n\nThe reason that Yi isn't played in high elo games very much is because his late game contributions to a team are complete and utter shit. He's just damage, that's it, and he doesn't generally do well when he has to dive into 5 people to do it. But in most cases a Yi is going hyper carry by the mid game, much less letting a match last to the end game. And even if it does, his teammates are so fed off of assists from his 20 to nothing killing spree that even as he falls off they start hitting their stride.\n\nGet it now?\n\nCounterjungling remains and will always be half a guessing game.\n\nMy issue with Yi isn't his late game, or even his middle game, as a solo champion. It's that a Yi can farm with relatively safety for a Devourer's, R out of river and Q E a double bottom lane without it requiring any effort at all.\n\nMy issue with Yi is that there is no risk involved with the sheer amount of reward you get for playing him no matter how hard he falls off in the late game, or how susceptible to hard CC he is. Especially when hard CC is a common denominator for almost all champs, so that shouldn't be stated as a weakness that he specifically carries. Yi pays for all of his power with almost no compensation aside from being squishy, which only makes him an assassin. But getting kills with him takes almost zero positioning knowledge, and even if they survive your initial burst chances are your auto attacks are enough to kill them, if not you can just meditate until your Q comes back a few moments later.\n\nHis playstyle is too simple. It's too straightforwards. And because of that it's stupidly effective. There is no counterplay to a Yi who runs at you for a gank. Most top laners lack hard CC, the only ADCs who have any are notoriously touchy to try and hit it with for full effect, which means that the only members of a team that might be able to stop them are the friendly jungler, possibly the support, and hopefully the midlaner. Not to mention that blowing all your hard CC on a Yi during a gank does nothing to stop the other laners that are bearing down on you as well. He's such a high priority target for CC that you choose between stopping him and taking fire from the enemy laner, or stopping the enemy laner and giving yourself over to Yi.\n\nIt's cancerous. He requires no skill, and should not have the sort of potential that he carries no matter how little utility he's bringing when it's easier to get multi kills with Yi than with Katarina.","replies":[{"poster":"Alëk","date":"2014-12-15T05:48:28.296+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cale017,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5FFNtWyX,comment-id=00020003000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-15T04:31:58.372+0000)\n> Yi isn't stronger in the late game.

In general, I'll usually start blue myself when I'm jungling regardless of who I'm playing, because even if they're manaless the CDR still helps my initial clear time by letting me use more abilities over the course of my first clear. You cannot 100% certain say where any jungler is going to start, because you do not see where they are or where their teammates are going. You have to guess, and you have to hope you guess right.\n> \n> You aren't going to be buying wards in the early game outside of your initial trinket. So you aren't going to get anywhere near the sort of coverage that you're trying to make it seem like before either of you hit level 6 and the ganks start raining down from above. And the time it takes you to go to his jungle, find that he's already cleared a camp, and leave a ward in a critical location before going back to your own jungle is more time that you aren't making money or gaining a level that he is.\n> \n> You really aren't paying attention. I'm talking about your initial clears. Before you've gone back for Pathfinder, or Stalker, or whatever item you're buying. Before you've had the time to buy wards, or to even wander into his jungle to place them. \n> \n> Continuously backing for wards and going into his jungle hoping to find his camps will only put you behind, and then the issue becomes that the enemy jungler already has an enchant when you're no more than a third of the way to building your own. You've invested so much time into roaming his jungle, and so much gold into getting ward coverage, during the early stages of the game that you're now behind on your build, behind by a level or two, and behind in farm. \n> \n> The reason that Yi isn't played in high elo games very much is because his late game contributions to a team are complete and utter shit. He's just damage, that's it, and he doesn't generally do well when he has to dive into 5 people to do it. But in most cases a Yi is going hyper carry by the mid game, much less letting a match last to the end game. And even if it does, his teammates are so fed off of assists from his 20 to nothing killing spree that even as he falls off they start hitting their stride.\n> \n> Get it now?\n> \n> Counterjungling remains and will always be half a guessing game.\n> \n> My issue with Yi isn't his late game, or even his middle game, as a solo champion. It's that a Yi can farm with relatively safety for a Devourer's, R out of river and Q E a double bottom lane without it requiring any effort at all.\n> \n> My issue with Yi is that there is no risk involved with the sheer amount of reward you get for playing him no matter how hard he falls off in the late game, or how susceptible to hard CC he is. Especially when hard CC is a common denominator for almost all champs, so that shouldn't be stated as a weakness that he specifically carries. Yi pays for all of his power with almost no compensation aside from being squishy, which only makes him an assassin. But getting kills with him takes almost zero positioning knowledge, and even if they survive your initial burst chances are your auto attacks are enough to kill them, if not you can just meditate until your Q comes back a few moments later.\n> \n> His playstyle is too simple. It's too straightforwards. And because of that it's stupidly effective. There is no counterplay to a Yi who runs at you for a gank. Most top laners lack hard CC, the only ADCs who have any are notoriously touchy to try and hit it with for full effect, which means that the only members of a team that might be able to stop them are the friendly jungler, possibly the support, and hopefully the midlaner. Not to mention that blowing all your hard CC on a Yi during a gank does nothing to stop the other laners that are bearing down on you as well. He's such a high priority target for CC that you choose between stopping him and taking fire from the enemy laner, or stopping the enemy laner and giving yourself over to Yi.\n> \n> It's cancerous. He requires no skill, and should not have the sort of potential that he carries no matter how little utility he's bringing when it's easier to get multi kills with Yi than with Katarina.\n\nI'm not gonna try to read this Wall of China. But from what I gather you think that Yi is toxic because he requires no amount of skill, to deal massive amounts of damage. Yi is not important right now because he is a noob champion. Until the effect he has hits the high level scene, he won't ever truly be addressed. He's too easy to handle in any other game. We are talking about champions that are strong at almost all levels of play. Their playstyles effect everyone. Their kits are TRULY problematic. As far as anyone is concerned, Yi is a roflstomp noob level champion that does not need changes because he doesn't affect anyone except those noob level players. There are numerous ways to stop him and he's meant as a hump for low level players to get over.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KOSHER TACO","date":"2014-12-14T12:33:06.644+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Being able to dodge 5 people diving him and then one shotting anyone he pleases is perfectly reasonable.\n\n{{champion:105}} Nice ult u got there hecarim, even though the AoE is wider than the distance I can playful trickster away, you just arent fabulous to touch me.\n{{champion:11}} wtf how did you kill me with your ult while in mid alpha strike, hecarim?\n{{champion:105}} maybe if you mastered something other than sucking\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheesybox","date":"2014-12-14T09:36:55.145+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm fully aware he does.
