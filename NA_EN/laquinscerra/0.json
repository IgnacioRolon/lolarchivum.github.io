For example, you can't see Pantheon's face, but it fits because the art style, and its the same with old Kayle. This just looks very off. I think it takes a certain type of art style to pull off and the art style of Kayle and Morgana isn't a good fit for a \"faceless\" helmet. The eyes gave an identity.

I don’t think a lot of the freaking out has anything to do with old kayle or the story, it’s just that the face was there and now it wasn’t. Old kayle didn’t have a face in her original splash, so it’s just how she always looked. People freaked when they saw her with the face and other people freaked when they saw her without it.
