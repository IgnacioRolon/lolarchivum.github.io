I proceed to force log out of the game and re-open my client which happens often, seems like black screens are quite common. Then the client decides to check my files? For about 800 files and causes my team to remake and me to lose 17 LP. Seems a little unjust and something riot should fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T17:31:47.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen is usually due to a network problem that's failing to connect to the game server, so it can't download any assets.  It seems that force quitting may have jarred the client to scan for corrupted game files.  It's important to let the scan finish, otherwise closing it will cause the process to start all over again.
