Figured it was a corruption of some sort so after trying to get it open for about an hour, I figured my game needed either repair or straight up to be reinstalled. I uninstalled, re-downloaded the downloader file and attempted to install the client. Hasn't worked.\r\n\r\nRight now after double clicking the League Icon on my desktop, the League Logo shows up for about 15 seconds then goes away. I thought it was crashing, so I clicked it again, it tells me that there's an instance of it open already. So from here I figured it was downloading essential things that are needed to actually RUN the downloader, I left it alone for roughly 30 minutes, then got a \"Bugsplat\" error...\r\n\r\nSo now Im lost on what to do... Anyone got any ideas? Or had this happen to them before?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T01:06:58.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like your OS doesn't have the right permissions in place to let League launch the way it's supposed to.

The main problem might be lying elsewhere, and for some reason, it's just causing the same symptoms of permission issues.

Amongst others oddly enough surfacing at the same time. My Blizzard Launcher and Steam were also not launching, starting or even operable.. Weird right? Either way, problem solved, System Restore saved me. I can update and download now :) Thanks for the help Broporo!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T01:19:34.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heeeeey I'm glad things got figured out with or without my help xD!\n\nAlso, thanks very much for the input on how you ended up fixing it.
