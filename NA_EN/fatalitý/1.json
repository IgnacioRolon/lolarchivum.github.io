From my experiences so far, it seems like the relatively small amount of upfront damage she lost in the immediate burst combo is made up for by tibbers wailing on the person he's summoned on while they're still stunned. She's probably ended up a bit too strong as a result. Design-wise though, great change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2016-05-05T06:27:16.510+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like I'm in the minority, but I love this new change.
