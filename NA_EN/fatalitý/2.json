The insane ar-pen is what makes his tank build so lethal, any bruiser with that build is going to be an issue for a squishy.  You can build those items on ANY champion and a squishy is going to need peel.  The problem is, he was a tank bruiser with 50% ar-pen without building an ar-pen item. Now it only effects crits, and a Yasuo building the way he SHOULD be, is going to have 100%  crit anyways so it doesn't effect Yasuo whatsoever, IF he's building the intended way.  This takes away and nerfs tank Yas.  I like it, very smart and decisive way to nerf something without effecting the other.  Honestly wish Riot were able to nerf aspects of champions in this precise of a way without effecting other play styles.
