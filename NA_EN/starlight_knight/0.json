So Excited!","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Never thought I'd actually reach my promotional series for Gold. Was a grind, but here I am! I'm nervous and excited! Going to play a few Aram's before I do my promos to relax a bit. Wish me luck!!!!\n\n\nUpdate: Unfortunately, I failed! Three losses in a row. The 2nd game was quite nasty x.x! Time to grind to promos again, but at least I get 1 free win this time! \n\nUpdate 2: I won my 2nd promotional series to Gold! :) Thanks to everyone who cheered me on and thanks to my new friend who duo'd with me! I appreciate it all so much! https://i.imgur.com/FBE9vbj.png  \n","replies":[]}
