I don't know anything on recording/camcorders so If anyone has a recommendation, that'd be great. He'll be doing videos on reloading, hunting and vlogs. So, thanks in advance for any help! It'll make my father's day. Pretty sure price isn't an issue as well. \n\n\nEdit: If anyone has any good recommendations for editing software for videos, that'd be great too.\nThanks!\n","replies":[]}
