It's really weird as I've been with my ISP for the past half decade, and nothing had changed on my computer except the patch. I loaded up my logs and it didn't even show that my ping had leaped that high even though I kept attempting to reconnect for a good portion of the game. Is this happening to others as well or is it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-18T02:03:09.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been seeing too many reports of server issues, but this doesn't mean that you're having internet problems either. Sometimes your network can have a hard time communicating with certain servers, ours in this case. \n\nThere are a few different things that can cause those lag spikes such as out of date drivers or certain network settings.

It's \"fine\" some games with just 1-2 mins of spiking ping (400ms). Last game I was disconnecting and reconnecting over and over, and experienced ping from 50-900ms within 40 seconds. As fast as the game was finished everything was as usual.","replies":[]}]}
