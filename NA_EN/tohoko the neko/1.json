I remember the burial of DFG like it was yesterday, Morde and {{champion:45}} had specific buffs that made them more in line with their current theme and identities rather than have them taken away completely because of a gimmicky puppet of lead or something else. I also recall that AD Morde was not a thing. When has the change of mentality taken place? Fuck the thought process, the philosophy of diversity that Riot has been preeching about for what seems like a year now is irreperably broken and shattered if the new morde goes anywhere NEAR live.(even with a reverse on the changes, the extensively deep damage will be done.)\r\n\r\nDisrespecting you&#039;re own ideas is one thing, but BS&#039;ing the community you work so hard to gain the approuval of that you even make a behind the scenes blog post after annoucing these changes? That crosses a line I didn&#039;t think would ever get crossed, let alone existed until a few hours ago when I saw the news.\r\n\r\nIf AD morde was never a thing to begin with after patch 5.7, then why the sudden decision to make it real by experimenting with the idea? Is it so ludicrous that it might just work? I honestly think not. I have varying degrees of success with mordekaiser but to deprive me of the lane bullying power I have because you want to see if this champion can be a potential carry in a duo lane is an outright, thinly veiled, disrespectful and hurtful insult to me as a player that you claim to care about and have as you&#039;re top priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I understand that Mordekaiser is oppressive to the point that he needs constant attention from the enemy team, I should know since I draw a lot of focus from the jungler in about 60% of my games regardless of lane opponent(but making him have ad ratios and forcing him into a duo lane is NOT the way to go about this at all) while the rest of my team is free to do whatever they want. I can see the problem of a match being decided in champion select, I get it, but it doesn&#039;t give anyone any right to simply rip the soul straight out of a champion and enslave it into a role he/she/it has no affinity with in his original kit to begin with. Ever saw an ahri as a support in a victorious game? me neither, and I played one earlier today(she was on my team and said she was getting acknowledged in ranked queue as a good support; we all thought she was full of shit and turned out to be just that)\r\n\r\nI tried a lot of things with morde; different builds, different runes &amp;masteries, different roles, different summoner spells, etc. If you can name it, I probably tried it already so I know that enslaving mordekaiser into a duo lane isn&#039;t healthy for anyone, it is downright stupid to think that he can be an ad carry when his strongest and well established role is a solo one.\r\n\r\nThe W change is beyond stupid, it&#039;s downright retarded. Kinda makes me think of the atari days when the devs were all doing drugs and coming up with shittier and shittier ideas to make as much money as they could selling crap in a cartridge. And frighteningly enough, I feel those changes aren&#039;t drug induced because then there&#039;d be something intangible to blame, but there isn&#039;t any drugs and it got greened for the PBE to boot. This..... &quot;**_THING_**&quot; is scary as fuck because I will lose all interest to play league ever again and I will tell everyone I know what has happened if this gets to live and it&#039;ll be known as the metal plane crash. DISCLAIMER: the previous comment is not a threat directed to anyone in specific even though it may be perceived as such but rather a prediction based on my fears of what could happen if the Riot employees responsible for the rework of mordekaiser went ahead and made him a disfunctional ad carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n* How to &quot;actually&quot; and &quot;factually&quot; improve Mordekaiser while keeping him healthy and his identity whole:\r\n1 . Implementing  interactions that allow for counterplay in a behavioral playstyle. \r\n2 . Increasing his health costs and/or his cooldowns.\r\n3 . By lightly shaving off some power away from his passive shield gained on minions or increase the shield&#039;s potency against damaging abilities and spells.\r\n4 . Include some form of soft crowd control into his kit that can be easily out-maneuvered.\r\n5 . Giving valid and rewarding incentives for marginaly thinking outside the box.(going in the jungle for example)\r\n6 . Having specific effects based on missing/current/max/stealed/shield health is in play for Mordekaiser upon kill or assist for X seconds (movement speed boost, bonus ap, bonus health, bonus HP5, etc)\r\n7 .  Conceive an inderect counter champion to mordekaiser.\r\n\r\nThese are my ideas to replace the trash can rework on the PBE. And while I will not go into extensive details for all of them, I will give context to the more pre-dominant ones that I find are the best courses of action.\r\n\r\nFor starts, a hard/soft counter champion is self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nReducing his passive by a meager 5% will greatly lower his durability through his shield and increasing his health cost will significantly widen the window of relief the lane opponent gets to play around with to set up a gank or go in for the killing blow. I oftenly get below half my health by simply farming in the top lane, regardless of who I&#039;m up against and I still haven&#039;t  backed or used my initial potion, and that&#039;s for most of the time the first ten minutes. More often than not, I back only to put more pressure onto my lane opponent and deny him even more farm because I can poke him down to a mear 240 hp and either go in for the kill or just push my minion wave to his tower and chunk it out of about 1/3 before my opponent gets back to lane. I have to physicaly stop myself from being overly greedy because I have unimaginably strong wave control from the champ&#039;s kit. It&#039;s not just the wave clear that is insane but the wave management itself. It rivals Ziggs wave clear and he&#039;s got mana to manage. I can probably farm better than any other ziggs can with mordekaiser because of his E.\r\n\r\nThe recent item buffs have greatly widen his versatility and given him so much more power than what was thought possible. He still can&#039;t be an adc though, because well... phylosophy of diversity can&#039;t apply to him if you want him to be one thing and do another at the same time. Morde is a strong mage and a pretty solid tank because of his inherant sustain. But for him to have to rely on a duo lane to factually work is impossible. So unless he gets some form of CC, much better AD ratios than his AP ratios currently are, he&#039;s not going to have a lane buddy. PERIOD!\r\n\r\nOpening his playstyle into the jungle isn&#039;t something I feel is underwhelming nor fully mapped out. The jungle is just starting to become appealing to mages again and taking the mage part out of Morde&#039;s kit is an essantial part in making him unplayable and unviable and cancerous. We&#039;re not simply talking about unhealthy gameplay here but down right negative changes in every possible way, shape and form for the champion which, i believe, is unheard of. It&#039;d make the champion litteraly unplayable as anything. No niche, no actual build order and will definetly make for bland and boring gameplay interactions with lane opponents. There are champions that have little interactions to them and I&#039;m not just saying that or anything. I really mean it. They aren&#039;t really doing what is intended of them but you don&#039;t treat them because they are in a situation you feel is &quot;**OK**&quot; in your fancy shmancy diversity paradygm theory or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnticing the morde player to go for more dives isn&#039;t something that is entirely out of the realm of possibility. For example, his ultimate could steal health from a given target and heal one or more of his allies next to him for a fraction of the percentage he steals over time, it could also reveal the cursed target to help with focusing proper enemies. I oftenly ult a teemo in hopes he&#039;ll stay visible and I can kill him but he pops into stealth inbetween ticks. That said, sometimes his ult simply won&#039;t get casted and go on cooldown because the target enters fog of war or a brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not trying to bash senselessly the idea of a rework for morde nor am I against it, in fact I&#039;m ok with the idea, but when it&#039;s as bad as the one currently proposed on the PBE, I have to speak out and try to actually make the rework worth the while. You simply can&#039;t just rip a champion out of his comfort zone to make him something he can&#039;t be and expect it to work. Not on the first try, not on the 207th time, not on the 126479584523th time. Champions evolve and grow into specific and clearly determined role as the game around them evolves. Those changes don&#039;t change the meta at all, the don&#039;t even break it, they simply take morde out for a stroll before leading him into a ditch that has radioactive waste and slamming the cover on his death barrel and throwing him into oblivion. I don&#039;t care if you want to lose 2 or 3 million players in total but if you REALLY do want to, go ahead and ignore the community&#039;s reactions and proceed as plan to destroy one of League&#039;s most unique and oppressive champion in the game because you want him to be a duo lane carry.(after several years of solo&#039;ing it no less)\r\n\r\nHave you even asked the pros if they would like seeing a morde bot lane as an adc?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-06T14:14:03.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll poke the bear on this one.  May i ask just what builds/runes/spells you used?  Just saying you have tried everything doesnt help me see these issues you feel are killing the character.  I see quite a bit of potential in this new Mordekaiser as a split pusher with monstrously high objective control if not dealt with properly.\n\nAs a small side note I actualy asked for most of these changes and am quite happy to see it being tested on PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-06T20:24:02.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that I have or haven't tried everything possible on mordekaiser, but rather the fact that if these changes occur, it opens up a path that is incredibly more dangerous for the game as an entity that is evolving in a constant fashion with patches, reworks, new champions and items being thrown out on a fairly regular basis but it also means that the principles that have been cimented through countless amounts of games in the pre-season and season 1 period is now up on the chopping block. It would be like hitting the reset button on just about everything that is League of Legends and what it means to play a consistent and dependable champion that will always bring what was set out for her/him/it.\n\nI feel that most of the people who are for the rework have never played as a mordekaiser and/or can't find ways of being safe against him. I might be biased in saying that it isn't an ill-intended work in progress but it definetly isn't received as a welcome set of changes his niche deserves.\n\nMorde's current objective control is stupidly good if you have the shot calling to back it up as well as the mechanical and positional awareness required to bring out most of his deadly power. He stays relevant throughout the entire game even if he's getting ganked constantly and feeds 13/22/10 after 45 minutes. The PBE morde is basically like a {{champion:238}} but without the kill potential an assassin has inherently built-in.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-06T22:02:35.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A fair assumption, though I have played quite a bit of Morde when I first started League.  His bursty style is/was fun when I played him and for the longest time I was content with how he played.  Lately however I just cant seem to find a satisfying way to play him and I feel that stems from his lack of survivability around mid game.  This PBE update looks to curb that hard if you know what to build and I think we haven't yet cracked the mystery of this wonderful new champion. \n\nOn that note I'm looking forward to trying a full set of scaleing runes on him with a 5/25/0 page to see just how tanky he can go without gimping my damage.  A Triforce and that new Deadmans plate seem to be good enough to keep his damage right where it needs to stay so you can dump the last of your gold on a thornmail.  Aside from that I think Taric support would make Morde a bit more scary than a Zed ever could be.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-07T02:39:00.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His damage is already gimped within the rework, going tanky further takes away any sort of damage his kit has left and can't really be anything but as useful as a wet tissue used to blow your nose or otherwise in terms of damage or power spikes.\n\nHis live kit gives him plenty of sustain and survivability throughout the entire game because all of his damage scales really well into the late game. He has a much better early to mid game than the rework gives him, dragon or not. Taking away most of his ranged and aoe damage so that he focuses onto a single target in a weak and sluggishly slow fashion isn't either satisfying nor rewarding to play as.\n\nI've played a few games with Morde today to see how the rework is and well.... solo lane is near impossible, bot lane requires a support that is willing to commit to tower dives every time, good positioning in order to farm is now useless because the lack of base damage hurts incredibly hard his wave clear which on live is one of the strongest in the game no matter what itemization you're going for. He hasn't had any significantly big changes since DFG got removed or even before then.\n\nMaking mordekaiser become an AD piece of dog poo is not something that is even remotely healthy. If this rework goes live, he'll need to either have a revert to his current kit or have his fan base be force to play him as a shade of his former glory, and not even a good one at that. The rework guts, neutur, decapitates and gimps everything that is satisfying from Mordekaiser and he will need another rework in two years time because no one wants to play him bot lane and his solo lane will be impossible.\n\nWhat I think really inspired this \"update\" to even hit the PBE is because of his recent win rate spiking way up way fast. The only thing that changed in his playstyle is the itemization, there was no buffs or nerfs to him that would or could adress that issue. Instead, we have this garbage rework that leaves him with no DPS because his spell rotation no longer keeps him in a fight. His identity is expressed in how much he pain/damage he can take and still give a piece of the opponent's own medicine. I've been a regular morde player for a very long time now and I'm finally starting to have fun going for items I wouldn't usually build on him because his power spikes would be all off for me. Does it mean I need a stiffled gameplay to the point that I require someone else to enable me to do any sort of damage? I think that the answer is self-evident in the rework itself. The new AD ratios simply can't compensate, let alone give him any sort of equilibrium in any given role.\n\nHis identity is crystalized around how much pain can he gives in order to keep himself alive and when enough is too much. He's a tanky tank buster thanks to his ultimate that sucks out the life force from his enemy in order to sustain his self-destructive behavior and dominate his lane. Having to manage his health and shield is a core design, not everyone is able to use it as a top level mechanic but it sure as hell beats having to rely on auto attacks to have some sort of sustain because everything else is taken out in order to focus that single aspect while springkling some gimmicky bs centered around a global objective or two.\n\nThe rework simply cannot go live with the intention of keeping him the same op son of a bitch that he is on live while changing everything about him so that he fits into a group of champions wrongly called juggernauts. If by the off chance that \"juggernaut\" is a euphemism for champions that are easy to butcher apart, then I agree, Mordekaiser is a juggernaut in his own right. Any other definition of Juggernaut that takes into account the reworked Mordekaiser is simply impossible to exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-07T03:45:05.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All valid arguments so it seems we will have to agree to disagree until I get my turn with him.\n\nWhile I'm not able to play him I've been digging into a few youtube videos of his game play, just finished the one from a guy called Pants are Dragon and I must say I'm very impressed with how much wave clear his W now has.  Not to offend but just watching that makes me question if your actually playing Garen by mistake but I'm sure thats not the case.\n\nI'm honestly curious to see how you build him in your games.  I feel like we as a whole are missing alot of potential with the single minded quest of 'just build damage' that seems to be the norm for all champs any more.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-07T11:28:36.959+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sarcasm won't change my mind. I also looked at the same video and well.... He's a challenger and he's probably spent a douzen or so games getting to know his new mechanics and getting someone to enable him as a support.(the support is annie and we all know what she can do)\n\nThat said, ADC morde has never been a thing and I don't think it ever will be, for me anyways. For the most part, morde is still built ap in order to be strong but all of his new itemization choices make him feel like he has to rely on others to unlock the last portion of power in his kit. Yes he's more focused on a 5v5/6v4 teamfight point in the game but there isn't enough to justify him being treated as a bot lane carry, let alone a duo lane.\n\nOn live, I build some defense and damage to get the best results based on the enemy comp.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-07T13:44:02.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds to me that all we would need is some practice to get the best out of Mordekaiser, just like any other champ.  It's the same conclusion to the support argument, once they practice and find out what Mordekaiser does then they will be able to capitalize on what he realy brings to the table.\n\nI agree with you here, Mordekaiser is not an ADC.  Its because he isnt ment to be one.  Juggernaut to me means an overwhelming, near unstoppable force able to shrug off damage easily.  Try building him like that and I'm sure good things will follow.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-07T14:35:20.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then we agree that he never belonged in the bottom lane then?\n\nI already build him to be unstoppable and overwhelmingly oppressive, it doesn't mean he should be downgraded to second rate with a useless ability on it's own and an AA burst that simply cannot be realisticly manageable in a chaotic teamfight around dragon or baron or in a siege situation.\n\nThe big problem I can see for the live mordekaiser is that he can deal as much damage as he wants and never get punished for it unless he gets greedy and tower dives an enemy that can cc him to death and still not die.\n\nI had a few games against a jax/volibear in the top lane with interchanged roles and more often than not, I survived a 1v2 and dealt tremendous amounts of damage that kept me healthy enough to walk away with less than 300 health and no shield. The thing is, morde's damage output in live kit is too strong as a top laner but can be more respectable in the mid lane while the rework has him rely on items even more than before for a fraction of the dps he can have on paper.\n\nIt's not a smart or soundly good rework. It fixes some of his problems but creates a whole bunch more in the process and I can't /won't tolerate the current changes to go live.\n\nThe rework needs a rework, it barely scratches the surface of what a good morde kit is and what it should feel like.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-07T14:59:38.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the point i disagree with you on.

The fact that he's gutted out of most of his MS to render him even slower than he already is live means that he has no way of sticking to enemies or be able to deal damage to anyone without the entire team having to heavily commit to a tower dive for almost no accomplishment whatsoever.\n\nHe's not surviving being out traded, he's getting kited trying to deal one spell's worth of damage with nothing to show for it afterwards. His E should be his best farming and poking ability regardless of what he builds, instead it's base damage is greatly diminished with an AD ration slapped on top in hopes to compensate but making it a disfunctional hybrid scaling magic damage ability instead. His live E can clear a minion wave no problem in the mid to late game, his heavily nerfed E doesn't even do a third of it regardless of ratios­.\n\nNow tell me that he's a good bot lane carry after reading this.

Playing him with intent to chase is wrong for this Morde and I approve the fact that you get punished for it with that \"I'll get you next time!\" feeling.  Mordekaiser needs to be played with purpose and forethought, positioning between enemies and the direction they need to go.  Make them choose living or that next dragon/baron.  Make them commit 4 people to defend your splitpush or give up 2 towers.\n\nIn the end i feel this new Mordekaiser will reward this sort of planning instead of the kneejerk reactions Live Morde seems to thrive on.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-07T17:51:24.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get the tactical argument but, when it comes to playing him in a duo lane, it is quite restrictive to not be with someone else.\n\nIf the intention is to make him more of a teamfight oriented fighter that can still solo lane when he wants to without losing any of his live overall damage output, I'll reconsider his playstyle. But when a champion has to be played in a much more passively behavioral pattern in order to draw out opportunities that are more risks than rewards that require godlike execution on all sides instead of actively working to create the same opportunities with equal risks and rewards is not what I think should be considered as a healthy or sound design choice.\n\nHis MS nerf basically means that he's a ball and chain to the rest of his team. Do you see a riven or a master yi having to wait for the sluggish slowpoke to get his ass up with the others to engage a teamfight for dragon or baron? His tactical and strategic plays are skewered because he has to blatantly tell the enemy team where he's going and what he's going to get by doing it. He'll get read and caught out in the jungle so much more without any hope of either dealing enough damage to win the trade or have enough resiliance to reach a teammate he can W on and hopefully get a probable life saving heal that may or more likely may not matter a few seconds later because of a global ult spiked his ass or he got hard CC'd upon.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-07T18:48:41.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you expand upon how you feel i will restrict him?

If you cant be aggressive things can suffer a bit but getting back in the game with his wave clear is simple enough if you can find time to be left alone.\n\nDo you not feel his item selection is broad enough to allow him to make his own kill opportunities? With his base damage alone on his W it seems he can clear out caster minions at level one. Clean up the melee minions and you are already aggressively pushing tower, almost oppressively if they cant farm under tower easily.\n\nI'd like to propose that what Mordekaiser Rework lacks isnt CC to get kills, but minion control to get the most out of his shield. His purpose isnt to kill his opponent over and over like Live Morde but to oppressively liquify minions and deny gold to his opponents by forcing the tower to steal all of your own minions. Can you imagine how much panic in lower ranked that might be to have such an overwhelming force shoving you to turret because his wave clear and defense keep you from fighting him face to face?\n\nYour anger is understandable, I would have been the same if I had not waited and studied what this Rework was really doing for him. I still see alot of aggressiveness, I still see plenty of kill potential but I also see that Burst Mage isnt how he needs to be played any more to be effective and that alone has me giddy to try a nice tanky build, scaling runes and vastly different summoner spells than I normally would have run on him 2-3 weeks ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-07T22:07:47.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry for skipping parts, I'm not in great sleeping shape lately, been having a lot of trouble sleeping and that has somewhat affected my ability to carry out any sort of reasoning.\n\nWhat I meant is that morde, in his live kit and how I play him at the least, is a very aggressive bully that makes his own kill opportunities. Having a lane partner to enable the full extent of his kit damage and utility in order to even farm being a requirement is not an active way of patiently creating opportunities but rather hope to god the support's CC lands when mordekaiser is close enough for his Q to hit three times and deal a full spell rotation of damage by the off chance it'll be enough before the unfortunate squishy can use his escape so that morde can't chase because he doesn't have the items to sustain movement impairement or have enough movement speed to finish the job properly for himself. In most cases, the support will already be out of W's cast range and the speed boost is unavailable to him. And even if it was available, the support would most likely be behind him which doesn't help him go faster since the two have to move toward one another to apply in a satisfying and rewarding manner.\n\nMaybe passive play pattern isn't the right term but it sure doesn't feel like it'd be the same as on live. I don't mind patiently waiting for a kill opportunity, but morde's major form of playstyle and consequently his identity is to be aggressively farming and deny farm from his lane opponent. A kill or two in the midst of that is simply bonus for him and punished mistakes by his lane opponent. Granted it downhillingly snowballs him out of control much earlier than any other champion in a similar situation and playstyle, but to remove that whole aspect of his stylized identity as a major league bully by making a whole 1/5th of his kit unavailable unless someone is around to enable it for him. It's an unnecessary dependancie that I feel is slapped on because it should make sense to have that kind of utility in the bot lane. While it DOES make sense, Mordekaiser isn't the champion that can or would display/use it in an optimal way for his playstyle and how the bottom lane has always been centered around two champions working together, one has ranged AA and the other has hard CC.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, the concepts shown in the rework are sound and reasonable design choices but most of the anger and bad mouthing of it stems directly from the decision of shaking up player habits into a champion like Mordekaiser. It isn't a bad direction to explore but he is most definetly the wrong champ to explore and experiment within those design paths.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-08-07T15:38:13.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Lately however I just cant seem to find a satisfying way to play him and I feel that stems from his lack of survivability around mid game.\n\nHave you tried Mpen bruiser Morde? It seems to be what you're looking for.\nCore: {{item:3020}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3068}} - A good mix of damage from penetration and a burn aura, shield tankiness from resistances, and even a little HP/AP to help your early game. Try to get 20% CDR from runes and masteries.\n\nAfter that, you can pick the item you need more of:\n{{item:3075}} - For more armor.\n{{item:3135}} - For more damage.\n{{item:3285}} - For more AoE.\n{{item:3102}} - For more MR.\n{{item:3512}} - For more splitpushing.\n{{item:3146}} - For more sustain.\n\nThe whole idea behind the build is that Morde doesn't need a lot of AP due to his crappy ratios. What he does have is insanely high base damages that can remain relevant even late game. This is what Mpen takes advantage of, and it allows you to build tankier at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-07T22:41:33.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the problem with that build is that his wave clear isn't as effective.

And if you round it out with a zhonya, he'll have even more sustain coupled with durability instead of just defensive stats. The other items, except for gunblade, are situational but overall quite effective. {{item:3152}} is a much better alternative for sustain, in my opinion, as well as {{item:3065}} for the increased heal received passive which cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the problems for morde is that he cannot be considered as a traditional tank like Singed or Nasus or Maokai are because of how their kit allow them to have scaling damage and durable sustain in one way or another. That build fits much better on Singed than it can for Mordekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-08-08T00:00:52.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heavily disagree with just about everything you said.\n\nAP is not as important on Morde. AP stacking Morde died with DFG. His ratios are low, .6 on his E and .4 on his Q. That's bad for a mage, and it's horrible for stacking AP. Morde does high damage because his base damages are tank-level high. For example:\nE base damage at rank 5: 250 damage\nE AP ratio: 0.6\nAmount of AP needed for E's ratio damage to equal the base damage: 417\nMorde needs 417 AP to double the damage with his E. It's much more efficient to buy Mpen and take advantage of his high base damages than try to build a bunch of AP on him.\n\nSince most of Morde's damage comes from his bases, he'll wave clear and duel just fine with low AP. If you build Mpen, he'll actually be doing more damage to enemy champions, quicker, since Mpen items aren't as expensive as AP items.\n\n{{item:3151}} and {{item:3116}} are actually only okay for Morde. The slow is great, and the burn and Mpen are great, but the AP and HP aren't as useful as other stats. Don't get me wrong, HP and AP will benefit Morde, but he shouldn't be putting a large portion of his gold into them. Instead, he should be buying resistances. Resistances actually decrease the amount of damage your shield takes, so you end up scaling better with them defensively than health. Your shield should be the thing primarily keeping you alive, not your HP bar.\n\n{{item:3152}} actually got worse for Morde after it's recent change. AP stacking won't increase his damage all that much up to a point, and all of his abilities outside of his ult are AoE, making the item even worse on him. The only stat Wota offers that Morde really likes is CDR. {{item:3146}} is a better item for sustain now, since not only does it grant traditional spellvamp, it also gives AD for your Q (Q scales better with AD than AP) and the gun offers a slow which Morde really likes as well.\n\n> One of the problems for morde is that he cannot be considered as a traditional tank like Singed or Nasus or Maokai are because of how their kit allow them to have scaling damage and durable sustain in one way or another.\n\nMorde is not even close to a tank. Most tanks have things like initiation, peel, and a generous helping of CC. Morde has none of those. If built correctly, Morde can absorb damage _like_ a tank. But he should never be played like one. He can also deal out damage better than a tank at the same time. You just have to not waste tons of gold on AP, and invest in stats he scales better with like Mpen and resists.","replies":[{"poster":"Tohoko the Neko","date":"2015-08-08T01:39:28.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't going to end well I feel... you have your working build and I have mine, let's leave it at that.\n\nBut you're right when you talk about magic penetration being great on him. But see, his overall damage output is not any worse with {{item:3152}} than {{item:3146}} if you've already gotten a {{item:3116}} because of the slow. And while gunblade's slow is somewhat better than rylai's, it isn't a quickly repeatable slow because of the cooldown and in order to effectively use the item's passives, you have to hit champions with basic attacks or single target abilities. Since Morde's kit is mostly aoe spells, the cdr passive of gunblade is pretty much non-applicable. It serves a champion like {{champion:84}} much better because of the very nature of her kit including both ad and ap damage as well as basic attacks to maximize her damage output.\n\n_EDIT_: I said \"**TRADITIONAL** tank\" for the exact reasons you mentioned.

If this is true, then why has he been put into the lowest movement speed bracket when he also has no form of CC? Seems a but much, and I don't think that Riot have any plans to revert anything like this. They could have changed it yesterday with the other changes, but chose not to, so I don't think they're going to go back on it. The new Q has space to be powerful because of how difficult it would be to actually use effectively. My only concern is that the proposed changes would see him get bullied quite hard in the bot lane for the most part, with the lower move speed and base HP being dropped quite sharply. Doesn't help that his waveclear got hit hard aswell (but that is acceptable for the potential of the changes).

Does it warrant him a full on rework so that he's solely a duo laner?\n\nThe base stats gut a lot of his survivability in an even lane match up, gaining more experience than anyone else in the match up only adds more to his already problematic counter playability since he'll hit the entirety of his kit power a full level, if not 2, ahead of the enemy, meaning that once he's level 6, all hell breaks loose from the bottom lane because Dragon gets taken and then the next closest objective is the bottom lane tower, and if the duo lane down there has the bright idea of defending it, they potentially give two kills to an already heavily farmed melee adc that will rip through just about anything thanks to the insane boost the dragon gives as a ghost for an absurdely large amount of time. If by the off chance the dragon expires before the turret is down, or is just about, he can recast it onto a champion, giving him even MORE kill potential and sustain because of it.\n\nGutting out a spell's functionnality and utility out of a kit is in no way a compensation for such a shoved down your throat kind of change. With DFG out of the game, he got some much needed utility and a clarity pass on his ultimate which the ghost no longer gains bonus AD but flat AD and a much more significant health boost when killing off the correct target. Targeting a squishy used to be his nefarious go to play making ulti usage because he was chunking or bursting down an adc or a mage with a single spell rotation when timed properly. After the departure of DFG into the next realm and out of Runterra, Morde received changes that rectified his target priority. An adc ghost could chip away at a tank from the front line, effectively killing off any sort of escape by the enemy team. 6V4 is a very scary thing to face. Now, having his ult give more bonus health and flat AD means that morde players have to think more in terms of keeping his team alive for as long as possible, any way possible at any cost which makes him an underestimated and undervalued tank if he gets ganked a lot in the laning phase.\n\nIt's not because something makes sense that it is necessarily the better way to go about changing. Will you see mundo as an adc if his kit is reworked so that he becomes one and still holds true to his identity? I personnaly think not and I certainly don't want to see something like that ever happening.\n\nOne of the few big problems Mordekaiser has in his current live state is that no one really knows how to stop him from being a renekton'esque lane bully that has no escape, cc or high mobility outside of ganking the living hell out of him. They are probably designs flaws that have come into light because of the current tanky meta and all of the item changes that is going on. He's in a very volatile landscape right now but he still fills his role as a durable sustain damage tanky mage. If anything, he's probably just strong enough to warrant a rework that will solidify his playstyle while giving his lane opponent more room to breathe and keep his bursty mage identity in a more than tolerable state.\n\nIf approached adequately, he'll be more of a glass cannon than a bursty tanker. I'm not saying that there isn't any positive changes in his PBE rework but bringing him almost forceably into a duo lane or otherwise be 1/4 short of a kit that is mildly functionnal at best and an utter throw at worse isn't healthy in any shape, way or form. if CertainlyT has an alternative kit for the rework, I'll gladly welcome it over a disfunctional wrecked piece of work like that any day. BUT on the other hand, IF he goes through with the changes regardless of the feedback the community gives him, he'll not only break the meta by not making morde a juggernaut but in fact will perpetuate a behavior within Riot Games that has gone on for far too long.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-08-06T21:06:34.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tohoko the Neko,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TpRt4pJZ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T21:03:00.694+0000)\n>\n> Teemo has a similar play style in the top lane.
