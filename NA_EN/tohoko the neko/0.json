Why I'm excited, but also worried.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm super excited to see Morde getting an update that _I hope_ will make his gameplay feel less ADC'ish because of AD ratios where they simply don't belong. If AD morde was never meant to be a thing, why have the ghost receive bonus AD then? I would not be in the least upset if that no longer was on his ultimate, which is said to receive the biggest changes. Does that mean it'll give vision of the enemy if they flashed over a wall? Increased damage per tick the longer it lasts? Can be {{summoner:1}}?(bad idea overall)\r\n\r\nBut I'm also worried because of how his Juggernaut update/rework was a couple of changes to basic abilities that felt familiar, yet constrained the item variety his kit always encouraged experimenting with.  The new Q was clearly unbalanced, while not a skillshot felt and acted like one. Drake ghost is a nice gimmick to have and I would be quite surprised to see it gone. Gating a basic ability behind a teammate only sort of removed not only kit versatility but killed established successful playstyles like top lane split pushing, which was eventually allowed again, but not without complaints about how it was BS for lack of a better term.\r\n\r\nA direction I'd like this VGU to take is one that actually feels like a VGU instead of just updating the visuals halfway before cutting 35%-40% of the kit's overall base damage in favor of tacked on mechanics and interactions, compensated with mediocre ratios. Maybe this VGU will make me give a damn about the game again.","replies":[]}
