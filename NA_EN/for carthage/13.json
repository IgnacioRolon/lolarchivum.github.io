{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-02-18T01:20:16.683+0000","title":"Just admit the mistakes, Riot","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":62,"down_votes":18,"body":"Look, as a kid you are taught that trying to cover up your mistakes only makes matters worse - you are eventually caught in an endless trail of covering and re-covering and re-re-covering the major cockup you made, and in the end, when you can't keep it up any longer, the result is far worse than if you had just said \"Yeah, my bad. I'll fix that.\"\r\n\r\nYou've nerfed Syndra.  She didn't need a nerf.  She is now completely unviable.  You've nerfed Fizz, who needed a nerf, but it's pretty clear you've overshot his damage quite a bit to the point that his primary role is no longer his actually viable role (AD Bruiser Fizz is apparently now about the only thing you can reliably build on him).  You've given Ahri a power shift that gave her a new identity, but to such an extreme as never seen before (for those who don't know this, the speed boost Ahri gets on her Q throw is a flat 200+ MS at level 1, which is almost unreal in terms of just speed).  You are making mistakes left and right and are refusing to concede that maybe, just maybe, the mistake lies in the action you just took rather than something that was already existent in the champ.\r\nIt's admirable to stick to your guns sometimes.  Sure, it shows you're going to judge the merits of your actions on your own and aren't going to be dictated or controlled.  That's lovely.  But I'm going to take a wild guess and say that, out of the champs that your team plays at Riot, Urgot isn't exactly regularly picked up for that hour or two of mandatory play testing you have every day, or both teams aren't packing a Lee Sin in the jungle and so you wouldn't have an iota of a clue as to what it's like to be an out-of-the-meta champ facing the titan of the jungle.  Sometimes you're simply overlooking the parts that, while they aren't played by the vast majority, are played by that small minority that feel the ripples of the impact from your nerfs, and it's because you're not paying them any mind.\r\nWell, here we are.  We're telling you what's wrong right now.  A lot of people here play your game far more in a month than you have time to within a year.  And while there are certainly the raging few that will complain about whatever is completely obnoxious to play against (I know I've done it once or twice), when there's post after post after post after post of what is absolutely unbearable in your game, ignoring the advice isn't \"sticking to your guns\".  That is just blatant, stubborn stupidity.  And right now, all signs point to the primary problem right now - some very, very, very mobile champs are being overbearing in the context of the game, and what you're doing is bringing the hammer down on champions that are already struggling, trying to bring them into a line that you drew on the opposite end of the spectrum - you are breaking champs by making them unviable, or just straight breaking champs.  Before you move to outright commit to something, why don't you take a bit longer time to just hold tight, observe, and see where that change will go?\r\nAnd sometimes the change doesn't work out, and that's unfortunate.  But at not point should you feel that you can't just go \"Yeah, that's not going to fly.  We're going to have to revert for a moment.\"  If you feel that you can't ever do that on something - that you straight just can't revert the changes you made - it's either A) because the champion was more broken before the change and you've made some legitimate progress, or B) you're just trying to sweep what you did away and pretend that it's all fine.\r\nIt isn't.  It isn't all fine.  Please own up to your bloody mistakes because you have been making a lot of them lately and are paying them about as much mind as my dog pays mind whenever he piddles on the carpet - clearly you're aware you've done something wrong, but the face you give makes you seem like you just don't want to admit it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-02-18T01:25:58.538+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"Reasons like this are why I could never get into game design, while there are people in the community who might know about one side of the situation, there are plenty they don't look after and at time don't really care about overall balance, they only care about what they care about.

Instead they shit out more champions with more overloaded kits to compensate against irelia for she isn't god tier every season instead of reworking her to a new kit design. Its like the rengar rework as a example. \n\n\"riot games says\" we want rengar to not just 1 shot people from his ult. What happens rengar still one shots people from ult but now he can snare you at a farther distance and can now double snare you to make sure his early game is better then before. Only advantage to rework is he can miss the skill shot that is the only real change that happened to it. But rengar is still a better design then irelia. But this just goes to show you that riot should of been prioritizing reworks instead of shitting out more champions. Poppy should of had a complete rework done already. Example remove passive for new one. Give new ult keep q and e interactions with reduction in mana, change base stats as needed and probably rework w or keep it same depending how rework on passive and ult goes. Bam with new rework do a update to the model and create some new skins for the champion. Look you just created a way to make profit and allowed a existing champion to not be a piece of shit the entire time in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2015-02-19T04:51:50.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, but some people enjoy playing several different champs in several different classes\n\nyet their balance ideas are kicked to the curb since they are low elo scrubs (all high elos play 1 champ)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-19T03:33:42.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kicker too are the people who complain that Riot doesn't respond, and when a Red does respond, they don't listen to them.
