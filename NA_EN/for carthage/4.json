It explains a lot of the inconsistencies you're pointed out in the counterarguments you summarily posted.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-11-06T11:17:59.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Holy shit, somebody with an actual argument (on either side) that also speaks several times more intelligently than I ever bother to.\n\n... It's like.  A ray of hope.\n\nA beacon of promise.\n\nThe magical rejuvenation of my faith in the community.\n\nYou sir. You.  And I'm not even being facetious or sarcastic.  Thank you.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b0/54/5c/b0545ca90b8c59dbdf198b2e194bd211.jpg\n\nSo to your point... yes, I've noticed this since the ADC's rise in ability from season 4 to 5.\n\nWhile people complained about them doing no damage (which, early game, entirely true due to them being very much item reliant), in season 4 it was an entirely different side of the same problem - that they did no damage only because they basically exploded every fight thanks to assassins.\n\nWhile Jinx was still relatively strong in season 4, she was outdone by her colleagues Caitlyn and Tristana who, on top of very long ranges, had relatively high safety in comparison to Jinx, meaning if they did get jumped they could still bail out in order to survive to start taking towers.  Honestly, if we look at the habits of ADC's, while doing a large amount of the damage in the game in a fair number of games, their by-and-large use has been consistently to tear down the opposing side's towers.  The meta since then has shifted, though, to where a lot of the current ADC's can actually stand to fight without being nuked by assassins immediately, which means that instead of focusing solely on the ability to bail out of a fight, the favorite ADC's have been those that can dish out reliable damage while staying alive (explaining Tristana's and Jinx's popularity in the LCS).  The thing with Tristana and Jinx being that both have very high ranged safety, very high damage, and very high tower-taking potential that can lead to very easy snowballing.  Where Jinx fell short before was that she had no innate \"gtfo\" button - all of her safety was built into her passive, which means that now that she can survive long enough to see it take effect (thanks to the item changes bumping assassins out of the meta), she's demonstrating far more safety than ever before.\n\nIt's why if you have a Zed or a Fizz in the game, Jinx tends to perform more poorly - because you've actually grabbed champions meant to counter her.  The balance not favoring these champs, however, means that even if Jinx is performing more poorly, your team will also suffer due to you having a champion that is not complimented by existing itemization.  For example, Morell is not really meant to be for burst champs since the idea is to 100-0 in a matter of seconds, yet it's favored amongst them now simply because more is required for assassins to accomplish their objectives - 20% cooldown means more ability spamming, and the grievous wounds finally means more since it'll take that extra few seconds to ensure that you secure the kill - and that extra few seconds can be more than enough for somebody to shield back up or lifesteal themselves back into a fight.\n\nIf AP items start showing some more favoritism towards bursting people down, we could very well see Jinx become \"balanced\" in her own right again - as it stands, though, in the current meta and likely in the upcoming one, Jinx is going to be a lot of trouble until people accept the shift of meta in her favor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-11-06T02:05:06.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://robleane.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gooooood.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2015-11-06T03:35:28.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=For Carthage,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qtmbT0I4,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-06T02:03:16.508+0000)\n>\n> As we all should know, Jinx right now is an atrociously oppressive, high damage and over-range ADC that&#039;s only beaten in range by Kog&#039;Maw (who has 10 more range for 8 seconds on a 17 second cooldown) and Twitch (on his ultimate which has over 80 seconds on cooldown generally and requires an ambush set-up to get the most out of it, on top of lasting only 7 seconds).\n\n{{champion:51}} Im sorry, what?\n\nalso:\n\nAhri, Brand, Cassiopeia, Corki, Draven, Elise, Ezreal, Heimerdinger, Kalista, Kennen, Lissandra, Lulu, Lux, Malzahar, Miss Fortune, Nami, Ryze, Sona, Soraka, Syndra, Tristana (with Draw a Bead at level 1), Twitch, Vayne, Ziggs, Zilean, Annie, Varus, Zyra, Anivia, Ashe\n\nall of those champions have a longer range then jinx (without rockets), and her rockets have been nerfed pretty hard to REDUCE her attack speed by 15%.  meaniing you cant even buy attack speed items to compensate becuase its 15% of your attack speed regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-11-06T03:58:29.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"So a bunch of champs out-range her minigun while none of them having the attack-speed steroid inherent in that ability?  Oh wow, stop my beating heart.\n\nWithout rockets goes without saying that she's outranged (honestly you're just so insightful, especially when I explicitly state that she has **low base range in the bullet points**. Are you _really_ this dense that even when I simplify everything for you you can't find the fucking information?).  But her 700 range is matching multiple champion's abilities and then some while being point-and-click.\n\nCaitlyn now only outranges Jinx with her own stipulations - if an enemy has stepped on a trap or is hit by a net (the worst part being the Net doesn't even have over 1300 range to make her passive range matter).  She has poke - that is the extent.  Jinx has reliable, consistent range on Cait otherwise along with several times the damage output.\n\nAs for your second point, you're just wrong.  You can buy AS to compensate it and the % decrease on her rockets is subtracted from the total bonus amount.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Attack_speed\n\nFor your viewing pleasure.  Or displeasure depending on how you take being wrong as.\n\nNow, if Riot had increased her AA-delay instead of just lowering her attack speed as a \"bonus\" amount, _then_ it'd be a much more noticeable - and harder to cure - nerf.  As it stands, it's a minor annoyance while she then stacks the same bonus on her passive lasting 6 seconds each time she gets a stack - so if she killed somebody, took a tower, killed another champ, took an inhib, and then killed somebody else, welcome to 75% bonus attack speed.  I guess minus the 15% on her rockets - because that's such a meaningful nerf.  So only 60% bonus attack speed stacked right there and focused on now ripping apart anybody else who'd like to come close to her while she's now bringing your turrets down from 700 range because at that point it hardly matters if she uses her minigun or not.\n\nSo would you _please_ give a reason for _why Jinx is actually balanced_ you circle-jerking mouth-breather?\n\nEdit: Figures you don't have a reason.

Only one team built like this failed to do this for her, and she was facing Leona/Vi/Maokai/Graves/Karthus - which unless you're packing Braum, Naut, Galio, and Lulu, you're not about to protect your squishies from that onslaught of terror.  Not to mention Leona/Graves has been the most notorious all-in level 2 pairing since they were added, and a snowball on those two in a professional setting just means a full-game snowball.\n\nDigressing, Vayne on the other hand had teams that did things.  Not really teams built around her - just teams that did things and stuff.  The difference between Jinx and Vayne - and why people have the same failure of realization about Jinx as they do about Azir - is that Vayne is an ADC that largely can be left alone with an enemy champ and trusted to not bend over and take it up the backside.  She's a great duelist and self-peeler, so unless she's absolutely dogpiled and bursted in the blink of an eye she's going to be fine - Jinx only has the stipulation that you as a team will have to see her through the first kill.  That's it.  Afterwards, she basically outruns every single champ in the game and outranges them to boot, so if she was in trouble before, a kill will see her not in it anymore.  People continue to underestimate the value of basic movement speed in getting away and staying positioned and I can't for the life of me understand how this concept is so difficult to grasp.\n\nShe's literally an artillery cannon in this game - no shit it's going to do nothing if you allow the enemy to just run up and hit it with rocks, but it'll completely annihilate enemies if you give it more attention than you give to your hair growing.","replies":[{"poster":"KonohanaSakuya23","date":"2015-11-07T21:13:31.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point but it seems her passive is her greatest asset compaired to other adc's which makes her almost untargetable and out of reach when she uses her rockets.

Guess I'll go ahead and throw my two cents in with numbers.\n\nJinx as of the PBE update has a 15% AS slow on her Rockets, 17% AS at level 18, a base of .625 AA's per sec.\n\nSince this thread is about her Rockets, or at least that's what three of the first 4 issues are about, we'll go ahead and stare at her attack speed with Rockets overall.\n\nBasic ADC build is IE+Shiv/PD+BT/DD/Mercurial+LW+Defensive. All the AS/Crit items max at 40% AS, so she'll have 65% from items (Zerker Grieves since... well... AS OP?) and 17% from leveling. That's 82% bonus. 82% on .625 is 1.1375 AA's per sec, now we reduce that by the 15% since it takes place AFTER, so she's at .966875, which is about .97ish attacks per sec. If the enemy gets... Okay, we know they WILL bet getting a Randuin's since it's a pretty damn good item now with 450 health and 60 armor plus a 15% AS slow and 10% less crit. Shiny stuff, right? So .97 now becomes .82 (You minus 15% of the .97 since AS slows are multiplicative and all), sooooo she's hitting at half speed of most ADC's, but she gains 10% more damage and her AA's are AoE. Honestly? That's a pretty good trade off. \n\nI suppose I should also note the mass AoE from Fishbones doesn't proc on-hits, only the main target hit will be hit by on-hit effects. This means the AoE doesn't proc lifesteal. Most probably already know that though, or at least Jinx players do. Funny enough, the AoE damage does proc things like Rylai's, but not Lifesteal. Death's Deal will be changing that since it heals for 12% of all physical damage rather than just normal life steal.\n\nShe's got pretty high DPS when popping her minigun, but with being 525 range with no escape? Yeeaaah, she better get something for being that short of range. \n\nHonestly, her harass in lane isn't going to be all that strong in comparison with most Marksman now. Every ADC but Vayne, Twitch, and Ez will be able to trade off given she stands behind minions or side steps well. She might be able to poke Graves, but if he E's at her, she's a dead woman because those AA's at all points in the game hit like a truuuuuuuck.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-11-06T15:21:40.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this has a solid focus on her early game and concentrating on what she's getting stat-wise - what I'm asking is how she stacks up later against her competition. Currently, she blows everyone out of the water in basically all points of the game - with the PBE update, the 15% AS slow affects her early game face-tanking while throwing around her power solidly - however, jump to later in the game when her passive starts coming more and more invasive in combat, and she's been proving to be terrifyingly oppressive with any sort of peel whatsoever since 2 kills/assists under her belt makes her fire 15% faster than live, and if at any point she live to see three people die, you might as well cut your loses then and leave - you can't out range her on autos other than with the handcannon (given she's not procing the same thing) and she's basically firing at speed with the standard ADC now. You'd find yourself exploding before you could reach her.\n\nThis is even ignoring the end-game Jinx-on-baron horror that results if she gets a tower down while buffed - suddenly she's able to rip down your tower and inhib for bonus AS before turning her AS steroid on your team. Or, if her team has a suitable tank, now she can have them soak up the turret aggro to quickly stack some more.\n\nYou're either about to be forced into a fight you're not prepared for and lose all of your towers soon after, or you're about to let them take your towers while you cower because should you even try to interfere you'll be nuked faster than you can say \"Nagasaki\". The AS decrease on her Q was a good move - adding a buff to her passive that stacks finitely in only that there's an AS cap was just compensation she never needed, and any kind of coordination or teamwork is going to see this abused to high heaven on live if it reaches that far (and dear god we can only hope it won't).","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-07T00:33:50.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh. The whole AS steroid after getting a kill won't be all that powerful when you think about it. 15% of total sounds like a lot, but her scaling per level is near non-existent, so she'd need the Shiv or PD to make it work. I'd personally guess she'd get the new range increaser so she'd become a turret like Kog. \n\nThe AS boost per kill just makes her seem like she's going to be stronger than she actually will be. The entire point of people using the rockets is more than just for safety. When you think about it, the minigun ends up getting to an AS where you CAN'T orb walk or stutter step. You'll be stopping too quickly to actually get anywhere. While the Minigun lets her shred towers, it gives so much AS and most of it is completely and utterly wasted unless you're taking a tower or you're hitting some one who's CC'd for days.\n\nThis is similar to Kog's 5APS when pressing W. It'll be super powerful in a 'all defend the Kog Turret' and in 1v1's with other ADC's, but virtually worthless against Assassins and Bruisers who can murder a 2k health target in a couple key strokes. If Kog didn't gain range when pressing W though, he wouldn't even be considered decent since you gotta stand still to make use of that AS.\n\nHonestly though, this is a pretty good nerf to her early and mid game while it'll even out or count as a buff to her late game. Currently, she gets IE+Shiv, then she snowballs to high heaven, but this will reduce her snowball potential, reduce her lane poke, and make it to where unless she gets a kill or assist, she's at a large loss of DPS. With Kog now getting the ability to do what Jinx does on top of Trist as well, Jinx is going to lose out in the long run.\n\nNow, I'm not saying any nerf would ever reduce Jinx's play rate. Her kit is FUN. She has two weapons to AA with, one fast for objective shred and dueling, the other slow, but powerful and long ranged for kiting and team fights on top of having that adrenaline rush of a speed boost AND an executing global ulti. She's got things that even if their numbers were crushed, as long as she had her passive and R, she'd still be really fun to play as. She's not a freelo by any means currently, though she is incredibly fun to play as and facing her isn't as oppressive as the old Urgot, current Morde, old Lucian, or the old Sivir back when her W was a toggle. I shudder at the thought of the old Sivir W with Tiamat, IE, and a PD....

He's a clusterfuck of design mistakes, not even just number-wise.\n\nBut even the Juggernaut reign when they were all considered broken as hell doesn't compare to old champion balance issues - might as well justify all balance by their predecessors then.  Thank god Feral Flare wasn't as bad as Xin Zhao, eh?  Don't know why they nerfed it - never so much of a problem (see the point here?).\n\nShe isn't \"freelo\" because the community's basically accepted that ADC's cannot be a source of \"freelo\" since they generally require a team to be centered around them - if you go a team of assassins and then have one ADC, of course they're going to suck absolute shit on buttered toast because the weakness of range is you're supposed to stay at range, and no assassin is about to keep the enemy team from steamrolling over you as an ADC.\n\nI'm entirely aware her kit is an enjoyable one, but so is apparently Yasuo's - doesn't mean she doesn't have some form of balance issues.  There's a reason she's been nearing 40% winrates lately - a part of it because Vayne got a small bump. Even before then she had been outperforming Vayne, though, in everything but playrates, and her 20+% playrates were nothing to scoff at.  Fact is she legitimately bumps out her competition, the worst part being this AS nerf she's looking at doesn't even really harm her early game so much other than her initial rocket-dueling, which she wasn't supposed to be doing in the first place.  Her poke hardly took a hit at all, and her passive applies to her rockets as well, meaning a single kill puts her back where she started - a second kill or assist puts her above where she started.  A third one and now we're looking at a significant boost to her damage and a one-sided battle no matter if the rest of her team is dead or not.  Not to mention the duration was again raised to 6 seconds - so she practically has a self-centered Sivir ult on her passive at that point.  They exasperated the main issue of her right now which is her ability to - as a freaking _late-game_ hypercarry - snowball the ever-loving shit out of a game by the sheer amount of self-utility her passive hands to her.  It's one of the things that made Vayne such a piss-off champ - once it starts raining, it'll pour, and once you start losing the fight and she gets a reset, the ability for enemies to ditch out of a fight are slim to none.  You either have to hard CC her from 700 units with her firing 500+ crits at the back of your head and having all the speed in the world to sprint around your skillshots (this just speaking midgame even), or you're going to have to stick it out for the rest of the fight because there's no possible way for you to outrun **175% bonus movement speed**, so 2.75x her 325-388 MS (doesn't matter too much where you land on that spectrum, it outspeeds every champ in the game without ghost or homeguards).\n\nIt's not even really so much the attack speed buff to her passive that's frustrating about it the most - it's that it's stacking, and it's really easy to stack it up and up and out of control.  Defending against a siege with her will be a nightmare at this point, and without action it's just going to be a ramping snowball of destruction that'll see her end games multitudes faster than she did before.
