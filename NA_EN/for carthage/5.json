He&#039;s lost over 250 health total in this.\n\nWell, let&#039;s look at some other things.  Armor scaling was reduced to 3 from 3.9.  So punching that in... over 16 armor lost.\nOo. Not looking so good here. At least he naturally builds a lot of armor in his building path.  Let&#039;s look at some other things.\n\nQ&#039;s passive cooldown reduction has been moved to his ultimate, and scales up to 30% CDR at max level.\nCalculating this with Ryze&#039;s normal build path, la la la... hmm... we&#039;re already 10% over just off of his Frozen Heart... what the...\n\nOkay, okay.  Let&#039;s not worry about that too much.  I&#039;m sure his abilities are packing a ton of power just like old times. Let&#039;s look at scaling in there!\nO-oh... his mana scaling is down all across the board except for his E...  And even with that considered, if E did the max damage, it&#039;d still be the same scaling...  But his AP scaling has increased on... his Q... but went down on the other skills...\nOkay, okay. I&#039;m sure that that&#039;s just because otherwise, since he can undoubtedly crazy spam his abilities, they wouldn&#039;t want him doing a ton of immediate damage if he&#039;s going to be doing a lot of heavy sustained damage.  I mean, let&#039;s just look at that new passive and ult.\n\nOh... they&#039;ve reduced the duration by 1 second at each level... o-okay... but at least his passive gives him a shield for... like, 355 at 3000 mana... and he can&#039;t even really crazy spam his abilities because in order to overcharge himself, he needs to cast 5 spells unaffected by the bonus CDR in his passive and then once it&#039;s active it&#039;s only there for 6 seconds, and he still has to go through all of his normal spell animations (each takes about the normal .5-ish seconds), so throwing out his Q is .5 seconds off that timer, then using his E is another .5, and his Q again is .5, then his W is .5... so the max amount of spells you can cast in a single go of his passive is 6 at max level, 7 if you count his ultimate.  And that&#039;s not even me getting a precise timer on his spells.  Could be 7 and 8.  To be fair, he can cast a lot more spells now without a break so long as his passive&#039;s up - without it, that&#039;s a no, though.  You can basically jump him and kill him if he hasn&#039;t prepared beforehand...\n\nSo, uh... how is this going to help Ryze&#039;s current standing exactly...?  You&#039;ve taken out a lot of his essential bulk to survive long enough to do his job and given it to a lot of just about nothing - unnecessary CDR, a shield up for 6 seconds at max level that will only do him good if he&#039;s fed enough to have the mana... Granted, you&#039;ve certainly now packed a ridiculous amount of power into that E of his that can be used to bully in lane like no other - but then again, you guys will probably just wind up nerfing that and then he&#039;ll have... nothing.\n\nWhaaaaaaaaat exactly are you doing, Riot?\n\nUpdate: Apparently they're reverting the health changes (for now).  Huzzah.\nStill cut out a ton of damage from his other abilities and packed it into his E.  I fear the day they nerf that upon release.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-04-13T00:40:23.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will be waiting to see how well the kit does when it is released.\nIf it ends wells and is a healthy kit that is both fun to play and still effective, I well feel much better, but if it ends up on the same level as Tristana's remake, it would be more accurate to call remakes a nerf-fest and lose further confidence in the balance/remake team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-04-12T23:58:02.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it comes to Ryze and his tankiness, he's honestly got too much base tankiness, plus the fact he goes a tanky build that his shield will work well with. It's similar to Singed with a Frozen Heart. You look at him and see nothing but armor, but in reality, he's got health too because of his passive. While neither passives are hug, especially when compared to Vlad's own AP to health passive, but it's still noticeable. \n\nThere's also the fact RoA gives health AND mana, plus the introduction of Righteous Glory, and of course there's the shield Seraph's gives. He's got a lot of item choices to give him damage and they're all tanky, so him being innately tanky would just be silly. To compensate for the fact he goes so tanky, they had to reduce some of his mana ratios and give more AP ratios since he does have a lot of AP from Seraph's and RoA, plus Seraph's passive with his mana items. \n\nI do agree with the CDR though. It's overkill. Two of the most popular items, heck, there's three that you'll see Ryze with that give him a total of 40% CDR by themselves, that being FH, SV, and WotA. To overkill his kit with 30% base is just insane. They thought Zyra's W having 20% was too much and it was the last thing she leveled and they even removed Heimer's CDR from his R. I don't understand why they'd overkill the CDR for Ryze. He is a CDR hungry bastard, but by 16, he's already got a FH and has his ult at 2 with 20%, so getting a 3rd point would be for the vamp. It's... a bit weird.","replies":[]}]}
