Please stop by our team speak as well.\n\nFifth Dimension is an active Gaming Community Looking for League Players From all skill levels to have fun with and do competitive Rank games with as well.\nMultiple games are supported in a diverse laid back Community.\nWe are a mature community and only Receive players that are 18+ in age.\nActive Team Speak and Website. Stable, longstanding leadership. No dues or drama, only fun.\nHop on over and join us on our TS. Division up and play.\nDon&#039;t make any final decisions until you check us out.\nTS: 63.210.145.160:9102\nWebsite: www.5DClan.com\nContact Info: Zerken, 5D NickTheGamer, Rohan15, TenjiCraft.\n\nWe are looking to make serious teams for Rank play. All ranks are available and positions. Our community will be making multiple teams soon and now.\n\n** Looking for people who main the role that they play. I&#039;m wanting people who actually put forth an effort to play the role that they want to main, not people who &quot; play every role&quot; and are just mediocre at them.\n\n** Your current rank means a lot less to me than stats do. I WILL be looking at everyone&#039;s stats who I&#039;m interested in. I&#039;d rather have a Silver 5 mid with great stats over a Gold 1 mid who averages 10 deaths a game every game.\n\n** Date and time will have to be decided on, as a placeholder, it&#039;ll most likely be afternoon/ evenings. I expect every member of the team to play ranked in their free time when they get a chance. \n\n**Criticism is a great thing, it helps people get better, but; MOST people do not know how to give constructive criticism. If you are the type who spends more time asking people on your team why they&#039;re playing a champion, or why they are building a specific item, this is not the team for you. Trust is the most important thing in a team atmosphere.\n\n** Know how to lose your lane graciously, it is one thing to lose your lane, it happens to literally everyone. But there&#039;s a difference between losing your lane, and feeding them to the point that you make it very hard for our team to win.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PLAY THE MAIN ROLE !!!!ONLY!!! PLEASE  HAVE  5 CHAMPS DOWN WELL AND WORK WITH COUNTER PICKING CHAMPS AS WELL.\n\nPRACTICE MATCHES WILL BE PLAYED AT LEAST 3 TIMES A WEEK (WITH THE MAIN ROSTER) AND 5V5 TEAM RANKED AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK (WITH THE MAIN ROSTER)\n\nFirst we will be filling in for the main roster after we are settled with that we will start looking for subs.\n\n----Here is the application----\nSUMMONER NAME:\n\nYour
