I'm assuming you live in a relatively populated area to experience the increase in ping.\n\nAre you currently using an ethernet cable, rather than getting your internet wirelessly? An ethernet cable helps tremendously with making your ping stable, though it may not necessarily decrease it. Another idea is to try resetting your router, as they occasionally malfunction and need to be reset. If none of the above works, try following the instructions on here from Riot on fixing any connection issues: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nYou could also try submitting a help and support ticket, but prepare for some frustrating interactions with them; they are going to ask you for a lot of files that you'll need to be able to obtain, and frankly it's pretty damn confusing. By all means though, if nothing else seems to be working, you might as well try it.","replies":[{"poster":"Cornelia Street","date":"2017-01-03T22:38:30.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks its back to 49-55 now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cornelia Street","date":"2016-12-23T19:35:36.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone?{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}
