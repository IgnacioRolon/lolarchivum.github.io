Let me know, and I&#x27;d be happy to help!\n\nI can't really describe what happens, there usually is a brief period where the champion select screen ends to the loading screen. but the loading screen just doesnt pop up. I see a riot game bar in the bottom right of my taskbar thing (Where my internet, volume etc is) I Click on that, the client pops up in the screen as you've left a game with a \"Reconnect\" button. I spam that button and it doesn't do anything.\n\nI've tried Reinstalling, the repair tool, the hexatech repair tool.\n\nEdit: I have a puuush screenshot of the screen that pops up after I click the riot icon in the right\nhttp://puu.sh/t2Nxz/0472c7bf4c.jpg\n\nIs there a way we can communicate in live time on the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T21:19:50.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This information is great, thank you!

The first game always takes forever to load and I have to wait about 8 minutes before I can manually close the client, using task manager does nothing. Another thing I noticed is a freeze when somebody drops a ward, but for now the only thing that helps the initial issue is to run a custom before I jump into a real game.","replies":[]}]}
