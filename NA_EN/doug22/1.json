I've restarted the client, tried many different tips and tricks. Done the repair tool. Nothing has worked.\r\nI haven't done anything different then usual.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know a fix for this without reinstalling the entire game.\r\nI feel like it can be fixed without that.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T01:11:06.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is downloading the latest patch that recently came out. This is normal as we do regular updates and game balances in the form of patches. \n\nThere really isn't any way to work around this without downloading the patch, since the game needs these updated files to be able to work correctly. If it's getting stuck at 33%, there could be an issue between your network and our servers. If that's the case, check out our [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can smooth out that connection.","replies":[]}]}
