Keeping a sportsmanlike attitude will help you win more games overall. When you find toxicity, don&#039;t reply to it! Do not fight fire with fire! Just mute and report the abusive players.\n&gt; Be mindful of other players even when talking among your friends in chat. Your friends may know that you&#039;re just joking and that you mean no harm, but other players who don&#039;t have the full context might get offended by what you say.\n&gt; League is a team game, so good communication between you and your teammates is the key. Focus on team play and working together with your team to win - this would allow everyone to have a more pleasant game experience.\nIm happy with what i got tbh, i wasn&#039;t too much of a good teammate neither was i extremely toxic, and thus i think i do deserve that chat restriction.\nPlus it didnt take the support team much time to investigate the matter and come back with an answer.\nSadly tho since the punishment got changed i lost two honor levels instead of one, hopefully the support team can help me with that ^^","replies":[{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2018-01-07T14:17:10.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Lol. I got into the same situation, and it was because I said \"Go f*** yourself\" to a nidalee that was trolling.\nI tried to understand why I didn't receive a chat restriction like usually happens, and they basicly refused to tell me. I found the support that they provided to me totally useless and just gave up.\nKnowing your case, I should've keep insisting, idk.\n\nEDIT: This thread isn't my case, and neither I do care now. I'll stop answearing any replys from now on, it's pointless. It won't change the situation, and the replys are always like:\n\n'you expected not be banned? lmao'\nNo, I never said that. I expected a chat restrict before a 14 days ban.\n\n'are you OP?'\nNo, I just commented my case and somehow got many replys.\n\n'shame on you! evil creature trashtalking someone and using excuse that the other guy was trolling'\nIndeed, he was and somehow he didn't got punished. I'm fine, I've never used trollers as excuse to flame. Just to clarify:\nI deserved to be punished, I just don't agree with it being a insta 14-day ban without me having any punisments before. This was 2 months ago, and since then I barely write in chat at all.\nHumans make mistakes, and that's how I am, Human. I may had lost my mind once, yes happens. Probably not entirely because of the other playing feeding on my game, but because of real life problems or so on, I don't remenber exactly. But I take responsibility for my acts and stop misjudging my comments, proclaming that I'm saying that my 'flame was right because Nida was trolling'. No, I've never said that.

There is no justification for flaming someone.\n\nSecond, the punishment system works in tiers. You get a 10 game chat restrict, a 25 day chat restrict, a 14 day suspension, then a permanent suspension.\n\nIf you had already be punished then you would be moved up the ladder. If you had not had one then you could make a thread in the player behavior with your logs and we can go over them there to see what might have caused you to skip tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2018-01-07T14:57:12.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2018-01-07T15:18:47.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\n> \n> About making a thread, I didn&#x27;t even know it would change anything.\n\nStart your own thread please.\n\nEdit: I didn't mean to quote that chat log.
