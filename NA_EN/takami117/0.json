This should not be a permanent solution, but only a temporary fix until all of this gets sorted out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GW Overdose","date":"2018-01-20T22:47:08.070+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"friend and I had the exact same issue... we average 29 ping and it jumped to 132-136 average... nothing we did to reset it would fix it...
