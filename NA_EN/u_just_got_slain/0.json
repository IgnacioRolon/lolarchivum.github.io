While I am glad to see buffs, I don&#039;t think increasing the ratio by 20% on his spammable ability is the right way.\n\nI agree with the Q needing a slight buff (maybe 70% instead of the proposed 80%) to just give it a little extra oomph, but Vel&#039;Koz&#039;s main problem is the lack of reliability he has for hitting his skills AND his lack of mobility. Both are healthy areas to have weaknesses in, but when a majority of the champion pool has a way to gap close or dash, it puts Vel&#039;Koz in a very weak spot. I think an appropriate buff would be to increase the missile speed on his E (suspension) **or** duration on the suspension (since it can be reduced by tenacity). I can understand the hesitance on buffing a hard cc, but as League has grown, so has the amount of mobility and the danger of missing the only hard cc in his kit. Just buffing damage won&#039;t solve any of his core problems.\n\n**tldr; **Buff Vel&#039;Koz&#039;s E to increase his self-peel and combo set up instead of solely increasing his damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanic998","date":"2018-07-11T00:26:59.655+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Exactly. As I always said, Vel’Koz has all the damage he needs. His issue is he’s not reliable at dealing it because of his shitty e. His e is **THE WORST SKILLSHOT IN THE GAME.** I really wanted riot to increase his suspension duration by at least .25 sec from .75 sec to 1 sec. I also said recently that I’d be pissed if they buffed his damage. His q is also the worst ability to increase damage. W Would have been the best place to increase damage since it’s useless without e. Q is actually Vel’Koz’s best ability. It’s the last ability that needs buffing. I really hope riot changes the buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-07-11T18:09:55.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> His e is THE WORST SKILLSHOT IN THE GAME.\n\nIt's already quite funny it's missile skillshot in the first place.
