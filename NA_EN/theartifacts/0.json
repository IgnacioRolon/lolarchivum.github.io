It's a regular chest. You get no candies and no chance at the poro king loot drop. Is this intended? Did I waste those gemstones? (I have Hextech Annie so I was okay with converting them to chests if I got snowdown stuffs). \r\n\r\n2) Can you get the poro king loot drops in ANY type of chest? Or just the Snowdown Chests ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T16:53:37.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gemstones have only provided normal chests when fused, and not currently intended to provide themed chests.

Or only the higher priced ones(Legacy and Snowdown)?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T19:37:09.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The poro king chest fragments should have a chance to drop in any snowdown chest.","replies":[{"poster":"theArtifacts","date":"2016-12-17T20:08:19.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=YwPT0QAU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-17T19:37:09.123+0000)\n>\n> The poro king chest fragments should have a chance to drop in any snowdown chest.\n\nWell I got the Poro King chest..\nAnd I'm disappointed to find out that it is ANY skin permanent.. not a snowdown skin :(\n\nSigh.
