I've seen some threads with no comments or upvotes that gets a red-comment agreeing with the post and that a change is on it's way. The point remains that it's more likely to slip through the cracks if it's a post not being acknowledged by our community.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mama Mayhem","date":"2016-11-09T17:42:43.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be a pain but is there an option to find the first thread and take the ones that are similar then make a sub-post within that that links everyone to said threads?\n\nYou are not deleting the repeats but combining threads under the main one?\n\nIDK in my roleplay sites that's what I usually do.","replies":[]}]}
