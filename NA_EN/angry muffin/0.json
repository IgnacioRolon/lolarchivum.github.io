However, in the last couple of weeks, the ping goes crazy high while ingame (especially where there is a lot of action out of a sudden- a teamfight, for instance), from 200 (minimum) to even as high as 8k. It's unplayable, and this affects Normal, ARAM, and to a lesser extent, vs. CO-op games.  I have not installed any other software recently, and the internet connection works perfectly fine for everything else (watching videos, playing other games, etc). Anyone else experiencing this? Any fix?\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"bish33","date":"2017-06-24T07:04:50.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i have no choice now just to uninstall the game cos i cant play this game too much laggs and fps drop BB League Of legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"SufferMeNow","date":"2017-06-24T06:29:06.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT servers are fuked up i have lagg so hard in this patch 7.12 at patch 7.1 i had very good fps and no laggs and it got worse and worse now in patch 7.12 it takes 2 min to log in to client and it has terrible laggs in game and drop fps i cant play this game anymore and i have 3mbs/internet speed i can watch hd videos in youtube very fast so my internet its just fine but the game is getting fuked up","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamTwerks","date":"2017-06-22T14:06:22.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same to me and couple of friends, we're unable to play, we love to play aram, we cant. sumoners rift? works fine... while dead... i tired of this black and white simulator","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T21:45:52.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a chance your network might be having some issues with packet loss.

Too bad my \"friends\", enemies, and apparently Riot itself for that matter don't give a crap considering they are promoting more people to play their game. Patch 7.11-7.12 are screwed up. And ignoring a minority of players that are experiencing ping spikes right at the worst times is not right. \n\nHaha, not only that, but if you go back to base to be away from keyboard to HELP YOUR TEAM by not feeding, the game gives you some bs about how it is not fair for your team AND PENALIZES YOU WHILE YOU ARE ALREADY SUFFERING. Why did I have to log in to see the comments below is also beyond me.\n \nAnd by the way, I decided to be penalized on purpose considering that I should give this game some alone time. You know, if something has an problem, and your help is not working, it is best to let it overcome its alcohol addiction I mean ping spikes to itself.\n\nOh and I even ran the hextech repair tool AFTER reinstalling. Still nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olley 8","date":"2017-06-20T19:50:08.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Angry Muffin, I have had higher ping than usual aswell the last two days; mine is stable at 100-110ms tho.
