It never works and only leads to toxicity. Because you dont know who is getting paired against who in lane. You're also not able to factor in how some roles are inherently more important than others in terms of ability to solo carry. So that gold assassin in mid lane up against a bronze enemy is going to autowin the entire game off snowball power alone, especially if the gold player on the enemy team is only playing support. \n\nOnly matchmaking where every single player is the same mmr will result in fair games. \n\nThis is exactly what faker was saying about challenger tier. Its no longer a real measure of skill when you're getting diamonds on teams. \n\nOne of the reasons I didnt like playing HotS was their obession with having the fastest possible queue times, so who won or lost a match often came down simply to which team got stuck with more newbs on it.

Now, i don't believe that matchmaking is the best that it can be, but I don't believe the solution that everyone is asking for is possible.\n\nIf we are comparing prior to season 6 and season 6 onward (disregarding season 8 because I believe the problems we are experiencing this season, in silver and gold MMR, have nothing to do with matchmaking but rather with game design and balance, but that's a discussion for another thread), matchmaking in silver and gold was leaps and bounds better after the introduction of role selection in season 6.  My opponents recieved the role they wanted and thus everyone was more evenly matched.  Every single one of my games were higher quality (disregarding balance) because everyone was playing what they were good at. \n\nNow I understand that this doesn't work the same way in diamond+ because of the significant numbers difference between the two cases, but I don't believe that extending queue times will help.  It's not that extending queue times won't increase the quality of the games, but by offering infinite time to find an evenly matched game, the games are most certainly going to be higher quality, but if you take into account that challenger games prior to role selection were already unbearably long, if you wanted evenly matched challenger games with role selection included, with no autofill because obviously with autofill said person won't be playing at their best and thus not the most even game, the queue times will be beyond unbearable not to mention the impact that might have on challenger streamers.\n\nIn the end, the question shouldn't be whether we want riot to make matchmaking better by increasing queue time, but whether we are willing to sacrifice role selection in order to have higher quality games.  \n\nOf course, this is just a high MMR issue and these issues don't particularly plague the lower portion of the spectrum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2018-06-08T14:35:32.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely.
