Not looking for anything crazy just the normal 50-60fps. I have a choice between two laptops and I'lll leave the specs down below:\n\n1. Lenovo Laptop Windows 10\n\nAMD A-12 Series\nAMD Radeon R7\n8 GB Ram\n2.7 GHz\nSATA Hard Drive\n\n2. Lenovo Laptop Windows 10\n\nAMD A6-7310 accelerated processor (Quad-Core)\nAMD Radeon R4\n4 GB Ram\n2.0 GHz\nSATA Hard Drive\n\nThe only part throwing me off from getting the first one is the quad-core accelerated processor in the second one. I don't know much about how the graphics cards work with AMD therefore I seek advice from the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-22T16:04:28.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't make that decision for you, but I can offer our[ recommended specs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements) guide.
