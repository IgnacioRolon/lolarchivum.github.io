This was diamond, and the Thresh, who built no attack items, thought it best to auto attack rather than Q, which DOES damage + momentarily stunning her, and giving time to use flay (E). If you want to argue that his Q was on CD, it was a good 15 seconds later from his first Q, and as long as he leveled it up, as he should be, it would have enough time. Next, why did Varus go back in close to death when there were no minions? He should have just Q'd over the wall.\n\nI will admit though, Leona handled that dive very well, but Varus and Thresh just failed.","replies":[{"poster":"Alexsdaman","date":"2014-08-22T20:56:09.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":24,"body":"No, he used Q mid-dive and missed, you should of pointed out that thresh missed his flay when Leona was extremely low, it would of surely killed her and saved both their lives, also Leona should of ulted the Thresh to kill him as proper calculations and execution would have resulted in thresh killing Leona with his flay before Leona killed him. It was an amazing gamble for Leona to save his ult in hopes that Thresh would miss his flay in order to save his ult for Varus.

After Varus' ult, she was damn low on HP. If they'd backed off, she might have returned to heal, at which point they could leverage the pushed up minion wave to take bot turret. Or they could have stagnated the minions and drawn her out away from the turret. Their failure to take Leona or bot Turret is a result of greed for the kill. There is always an option to how you play. This Leona player capitalized on their unwillingness to let her escape and their ignorance of the threat of her turret.\n\nThey're thinking \"It's 3v1, so what if she has a turret, our damage output will lay her out before we take a hit!\" They attacked her under the turret, drawing fire and she just locked them up.
