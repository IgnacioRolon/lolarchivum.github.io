The spells hit, waiting another second opens another can of worms, maybe waiting that extra second would have allowed the other team to position themselves in a manner the play would not have happened. They didnt need a better opportunity to delete amumu, the play was successful in netting them the fight. Honestly if I was Zed i wouldnt have engaged at that point, many players don't know when to fight and when its better to just let a team-mate die. My group of friends I constantly stress to them that you have to pick your battles, dying sucks but why give the team anymore kills than you have to? I have seen people yell and scream in randoms because I didnt go into a 1v5 that killed them.. Feed more or Hold a tower?

That, in any mildly-high level game, is the dumbest thing you could ever do - especially with a hyper carry like vayne.\n\nI am 100% sure that the enemy team was blind face checking. Otherwise, Amumu would have Q'd in to that Akali, and/or Leona would have ulted them. If Zed was decently in position to engage the vayne as soon as that Janna wasted her ult, and Janna's team wasn't so far ahead in gold, this fight would have gone extremely poorly for her team.\n\nThere was no big play here, it was just Janna being random as hell with her flash ultimate and it happened to work because of how far ahead her team was. There was a much cleaner engage opportunity (charged Q) which didn't totally expose her AD carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Navarune","date":"2014-11-08T03:27:44.172+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Who's to say the Janna didn't understand the power of her team's lead at this point? All we can do is speculate about whether he had evaluated his team's buff and/or gold advantage, his opponents' ult CDs, or the opponents' vision, but whether or not it was wisdom, intuition, or dumb luck that guided the player to flash-ult here doesn't really matter in this venue.

Janna Mechanics is one of the top Janna mains out there. and I've spectated them many times (I, too, am a Janna main).  And it's true, flash ult is 99% of the time a bad idea that leaves you exposed and gets you killed for little benefit.  Yes, it has its uses and it's a flashy play, but they're right that predicted, charged Qs are Janna's bread and butter.  They're not as flashy or obvious, but you'll see them in high level Janna play where they understand Q as a zoning tool.\n\nJanna is a fun, clutch champion.  And watching this was fun, because I always love to see Janna win, so I don't want to take away from what this guy did, but Janna Mechanics has a good point here.","replies":[{"poster":"Sokina","date":"2014-11-08T23:39:25.041+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just throwing this in, but being a top Janna main doesn't make anyone right 100% of the time about Janna. Anyone can watch a video and go \"If they would have done this, it would have been better.\"  And if they didn't do it, it could have been worse. And if they did it badly, it could have gone less good. And if the enemy team did this, then that wouldn't have happened. And if enemy ADC was in this position, this wouldn't  have worked. \n\nSeems to me like Janna was going to charge her Q to inhibit the enemy team, saw how Lucian was lagging behind, and immediately responded to flash-ult breaking up the team. It's easy to watch a video and point out all the things that weren't needed, it's another thing to be in that exact same position, and stop to analyze every aspect of the game at that given moment and not waste any energy, or cooldowns, or anything else. Shit happens, sometimes people use spells when they're not needed. That's part of the game. The point of the matter, is Janna was there, and she made big plays. That's what this is about. Not \"The best Janna player ever making the best play ever.\" No, it's about big plays.\n\nIt was a play that probably resulted in winning the game. No \"Doesn't matter, they were so far ahead.\" No \"If she did this differently she would have achieved the same result.\"  What she did, at that moment, worked, and it probably resulted in winning the game.  She has a good point about what could have been done for 100% maximum Janna efficiency, but she's completely wrong about it not being a big play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SetMeFreeFTW","date":"2014-11-08T02:20:45.267+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"You are right.
