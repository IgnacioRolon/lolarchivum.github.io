Trust me, many Rioters (myself included) are East coast transfers. We intimately understand the frustration of missing out on things like Prime, Blizzcon and many other amazing con experiences due to financial constraints or simple geographic proximity.\n\nThis year we hit up PAX East in Boston, Momocon in Atlanta and are still slated to revisit Atlanta for Dragoncon and Toronto for Fan Expo. While that's technically 4 cons on or near the East Coast, you're right in that it still doesn't provide an easily accessible con for everyone and our work is far from done.\n\nWith all that said I think this is an extremely valuable conversation to have and the feedback is very welcome. One of the things that makes the League of Legends community unique is how passionate we all our when it comes to meeting in real life to celebrate the game. Whether it be at a Con, an LCS viewing party, as a member of a collegiate club or even participating in a tournament, finding ways to offer these experiences in some shape or form to every player in North America is something we're always working towards.  \n\n- Rom","replies":[{"poster":"Ant4warchief","date":"2014-07-02T21:21:58.824+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"South? <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dean Damazo","date":"2014-07-02T21:50:47.888+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey they could come to Texas too, but no.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Wizpig","date":"2014-07-01T23:54:26.698+0000","up_votes":102,"down_votes":5,"body":"FFS riot.
