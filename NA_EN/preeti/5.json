Gnar towerdives Katarina making himself low and then ignites Kat when she wouldn't survive 2 ticks, but continues to chase dispite Kat's certain death. Kat uses the opportunity to jump on Gnar and kill him but misclicks and dies to ignite and Gnar's reflexes would've been too slow if Kat hadn't misclicked, you can see he activates his ult to transform a split second after Kat used her combo. The only thing that took skill there was looking at the rage bar and saying, it's 80% full, I can get full rage soon and I doubt he planned to transform as the last tower shot came to him. It's not a bad play (i'll still say gj to the Gnar if I was his teammate), but it was the mistakes that got him into that clutch position and the Kat's mistakes that saved him. Plus i've healed off dmg with manual tranform as well so many times. I probably sound like a hater right now, but I was quite disappointed when I saw the video and I just think this is an everyday play, not a big play.","replies":[{"poster":"Souel","date":"2014-08-30T01:37:50.191+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":5,"body":"I normally love the big plays, but I agree that this was just poor playing. Any bronze can tower dive like that. I don't really see any big outcome from diving a tower and a half deep and taking five shots then blowing ult to just barely survive that fifth hit with the hp boost. He could've used W to get the same hp with a lower cooldown. Normally I love the big plays spotlight, but this one doesn't belong here.\nNot flaming, and I'm sorry for being critical.

It wasn't a misclick. I agree though that Kat should've killed Gnar. If she had just tried to fight under the tower she *probably* could've won. I also agree that this is a good play, albeit a little lucky and really risky (facechecking the brush is bad, facechecking the enemy jungle is worse), but not something that I would call a big play.
