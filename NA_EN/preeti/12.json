Is not balanced. Lee Sin is possibly the single most poorly balanced champion over a course of several years, compared to all other champions who've suffered from similar issues (Riot's balance team underestimating mobility as a factor of strength), such as Talon or LeBlanc, who they've accordingly nerfed into a respectable position by deleting their one reliable form of crowd control in both cases.\n\nThis guy? For whatever reason, his ultimate repositions the target by more than he is even capable of repositioning himself, and as we should be well-aware of by now (Blitzcrank, Alistar) repositioning is the hardest form of crowd control.\n\nSo, what gives, Riot? Mind explaining what's going on with this guy, or if you plan on changing anything to help him along in the seasons to come? \nThanks for taking the time to read my post expressing a sum of the community's concerns for this champion and why we weren't as impressed with this Big Plays clip as we have been with the others.","replies":[{"poster":"Sacchi Hikaru","date":"2014-11-16T11:25:12.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They left Lee alone for a long time because they didn't exactly know how to nerf him without killing him, but people started crying for Lee Sin nerfs real badly, then they made a massive list of patch notes to rework him, and the resulting public outcry was even greater, so they pulled the changes back and made several smaller changes to him accross several patches... And people are still complaining.\n\nI agree that Lee Sin isn't exactly \"the most balanced champion ever\", but Riot has been trying hard to get the guy into a decent spot without gutting him, they are very aware of his problems and have been trying to fix him for a loooong time. If it was that easy, they would've done it already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DriftSideways","date":"2014-11-15T02:54:00.166+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee sin uses 3 skills in this video... and is under half life.....\nAlso 3 people focused down a half life Irelia.\n\nHalf life 3 confirmed","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForFoxSakes","date":"2014-11-14T23:12:31.312+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"so...

People have been pretending he's like 3x harder than he is to justify his ridiculously overloaded kit since his release. Saying it doesn't make it so. \n\nHe's still a ridiculously overpowered champion (he's been in the top 3 junglers, usually *the* top jungler, since his release years ago for a *reason*), but that's not to say people aren't skilled users of him. I just think the *overwhelming* majority of the work is done by the champ itself. He's got a disgusting amount of mobility and a disgusting amount of answers to any situation. A good Lee Sin ***never*** has to fight a battle he doesn't want to, and that's just plain bad. \n\nAgain, the player's reaction speeds and quick thinking are definitely commendable, the fact that this \"big play\" is even possible is not, and is evidence of a distinct balance problem with Lee Sin. The player didn't bait around the Irelia, or manipulate cooldowns or damage in a meaningful way, he just did basic Lee Sin stuff as fast as he could and got way more results than he should have from it. \n\nA trend amongst the Lee Sin community: literally anything they do utilizing even the most basic part of his way overloaded, over-mobile kit is \"outplaying\" someone. You don't see Caitlyn's saying \"outplayed\" for landing their Qs, or Nasus saying \"outplayed\" for farming his Q. It's a unique trait of Lee Sin mains to think just ***using*** his skills is indicative of major skill, and, while it's annoying, it's not the fault of the players. It's the fault of a champion design with way, ***WAY*** more tools than almost any other champion, and flashy, fight-changing ones at that. Thats what I'm getting at. \n\nI in no way meant to imply the player lacked skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Fading Alone","date":"2014-11-15T02:00:42.995+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"I believe the last paragraph applies to Master Yi users as well. :q","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2014-11-15T09:34:39.642+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"True enough, but I don't think anyone deludes themselves into believing that Master Yi does many \"plays\" (said from someone who has Yi in his top 5 most played champs).

Lee Sin isn't nearly as hard as they pretend, and most people past a few games can do things like this guy did (provided they're decent players as a whole).  \n\nHe's not a hard champion, he's just a flashy one. He gets more bang for his buck out of EVERY one of his skills compared to most/all champions, and frankly isn't that hard to play.\n\nSo yeah, I'll talk crap about it. Like I said, the player reacted quickly which is cool and all, but nothing particularly special besides \"He played Lee Sin the way only Lee Sin is OP enough to be played\". No ill-will at all meant to the player.
