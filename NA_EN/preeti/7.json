Lee sin has some of the highest AD ratios in the game, an engage and disengage, a shield that he can give to himself and others, able to boost his own sustain, an attack speed and movement speed slow, and a massive knock back that deals Tons of Damage™ to more than just the original target and disabling any other person hit. Does he take more skill than the average champion in the game? Yes he does but that is by no means a tradeoff for what he has. There are many champions in the game that require a high level of skill but of them lee has an incredible advantage with how outrageously fast he snowballs. The ONLY reason that he hasn't been overhauled is the fact that his late game does fall off incredibly hard due to the fact that, unlike the other melee attack damage carries, he doesn't have an ability that makes him untargetable or invulnerable. If he builds all damage he can get picked off easily once he engages on a target. That still does not give enough tradeoff for the outrageous amount of power he has in the early game. A snowballed Lee Sin can easily 2v1 and even 3v1 if the person playing him is skillful enough. While other champs can do this in the late game where it is appropriate, Lee can do this in the extremely early game where it isn't.\n\nDo I think this game should be catered to the bronze V and new players just starting the game, heck no. No matter how they alter Lee he will still take a great deal of skill to be successful with and I do not think that should change. What NEEDS to change is his ability to take more than a mile when his opponent only gives up an inch. The proposed changes were going to do that, and the one small change he got instead did next to nothing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LazyPhilosopher","date":"2014-05-30T19:39:14.022+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of these days, I'll be that OP >:O","replies":[{"poster":"ZedStrokes","date":"2014-05-30T20:05:37.583+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"but then you will be blind >8U","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXxLightSpeedxXx","date":"2014-05-30T20:04:49.238+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:39}} did not {{champion:64}} to her heart :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valkyriem","date":"2014-05-30T22:20:02.075+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"are u kidding me?? that's not high risk play, lee had op irelia backing him up.. if he died she would have got the pentakill anyways","replies":[]}]}
