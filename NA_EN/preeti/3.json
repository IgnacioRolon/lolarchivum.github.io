For how bad the stats are and how the play started/ended this could of easily been a bot.  I know people (because they told me and because they are horrid at the actual game) that have a macro that when they push a certain button when playing katarina it instantly works as the video did, using all the \"instant\" type of abilities on the enemies that can be killed by that lower damage amount in quick repetition after getting the next target low enough.  The macro calculates and runs it all itself with no actual work done by the player.\nNote though, I am not accusing that this was a bot/macro being used.  I am only saying that for the elo that it is and the stats beforehand make it a simple conclusion to come to.\nThe two biggest points in the play that make me think this is how kat ultis to the point in which she could jump to syndra and combo her (who was at that time behind mundo) and when she used her E and W randomly after lucian died.\nThrough repeated watching (over 30 times) I can see where this is perfectly doable.  At the same time I am still saying that bots/macros for this DO exist.
