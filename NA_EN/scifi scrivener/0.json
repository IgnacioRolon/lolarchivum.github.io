One piece of the new system that I feel is getting little attention is the challenger series. Each LCS team is required to maintain a full challenger roster, as sort of farm system for new talent.\r\n\r\nWill the CS be streamed? What is the CS schedule for competitions? What are the names for the CS teams?\r\n\r\nI hope Riot gives us more information and fully covers the CS. Seeing talent grow and then seeing those players in the LCS will be a great way to expand the fan base.","replies":[{"poster":"Grza","date":"2017-12-14T07:40:51.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are into that too - I think the story lines that the Academy League creates are going to be great.
