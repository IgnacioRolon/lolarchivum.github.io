It runs much more graphics intensive games like witcher 3 at 100+ FPS. No issues. However in the last month of league, my computer non stop crashes (up to 5 times in one game). I have been trying many different troubleshooting techniques i have seen on the forum in the past, like uninstalling programs like plays.tv, full cleaning my computer, but no matter what, it over heats. I have all the fans in my pc running 100% (is that bad for it? power isnt an issue but idk if having it all running max is bad). \n\nIdle my cpu heat is ~30 (celsius), which isnt the best but then it jumps to 60+ in game. \n\nI've had this cpu for a good part of two years and this has never been an issue until the last month.\n\nShould I look into fixing computer parts or try to get even more fans. \n\nA good note is that this tends to happen during team fights where particles are flying everywhere. \n\nI tried the in-client repair tool to no luck. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions, I am open to any and all.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFeelg00d","date":"2017-07-15T21:22:41.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's quite easy, to be honest...costs like $3 and some of your time, but if very easy. Technically, it's recommended that you do it every 6 months or so, although most people don't do it -ever- during the life of the PC these days.\n\nI had a similar issue, though, and spent DAYS trying to figure out wtf was going on. Thought I had to have a Virus or something, hogging resources in the background, bla bla bla...then just happened to DL open hardware monitor and noticed the temps getting pretty hot, but was like eh....\n\nOh wait...that's CELCIUS...lmao\n\nI should've realized it sooner, since I am familiar with what overheating does from back in my SUPER-gamer days when I used to OC everything...but just never thought of it.\n\nLike I said, it may not be what's wrong with yours, though, as you said you are still running other games just fine...even ones with more gfx/processing requirements/usage, right? =\\\n\nHopefully the rito techs can help you get it figured out, my friend. If you do decide to try reseating your fan/heat-sink and reapplying the thermal paste, but a talk-through, I'd be more than happy to help get you through it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-15T17:11:04.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Checked for dust clogging yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Czyki","date":"2017-07-15T17:12:27.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

Is it a stock heat sink or one of the big fancy gaming ones?\n\nIf you havent done this before find a computer guy or shop to help you out. Ill bet that this is the issue based on my past experience.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrFeelg00d","date":"2017-07-15T16:25:39.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you are overheating.\n\nTwo years\n\nWhen is the last time you pulled your processor fan off and re-applied the thermal paste?","replies":[{"poster":"MrFeelg00d","date":"2017-07-15T16:27:06.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although you did kinda imply that the temps only soar that high when running League?\n\nVery odd indeed\n\nHave you tried resetting your video card's settings?
