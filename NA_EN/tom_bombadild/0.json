I can play the game fine from an external hard drive once I have installed a version that has already been patched.  I am really not sure what to do and would love any help that I can get.  Again it literally just freezes my entire computer upon starting up the client.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Dezn","date":"2017-12-05T12:22:54.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.

It's not really possible to run League from an external drive or even usb, so the client will attempt to scan your game files and download them to your PC temporarily then go away.  It's really interesting that it works almost opposite in your case.  I'm also curious if there is some anti-virus or safety software blocking you from installing on your local drive.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll work with you individually.
