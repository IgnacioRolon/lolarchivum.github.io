I know that if its a series going for plat or higher u do not get the free win, but i just lost my Gold 2 promos and went down to 26 lp. I got back up to the promo a month later with 3 straight wins (i didnt play ranked in that month) and I do not have my free win.\n\nIs this because of the patch? Or did I just time out for my free promo win?\n\nOh i did accidently dodge que once cuz i forgot to lock in during my promo's would that have something to do with it as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2016-02-12T17:53:48.863+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dodging a game in a series will disallow you from getting a free promo helper game in the next series.

Even though I can't change the way it works, I can try to give you the context I have.\n\nDodging (intentional or not) isn't a good experience for anyone.  It slows down getting into a game, which can at times be a lengthy process to begin with.  From my experience a lot of the time people dodge because they don't get the position or champion that they want (the new champ select experience has helped with that, but it still happens).  Most people only see themselves as being the only ones punished by their dodge, but in reality the wait time that others have to go through to get into a game again is also a pain.  Once or twice I've had people dodge multiple times in a row, and because of that I decided that I didn't want to play that night because of the amount of time that was already sunk doing nothing.  We look at overall pain when designing systems, not only the pain that occurs to that single individual because of their actions.\n\nUnintentionally dodging is still dodging, and if we were to remove or lessen the punishments on it even more people would dodge because there would be no fear of losing something (time, LP, promo series).\n\nAs far as I'm aware, there isn't a really good way to tell if someone dodged on purpose or because of issues.  Giving out a free win in a promo series is meant to be a helper for people who go through a series normally and lose, not dodge (intentionally or not).  We'll likely never make a change to that part of the system - mostly due to the fact that it could be abused so heavily if we did have the system set up that way.\n\nThis probably isn't an overly satisfying answer - but I hope it at least helps you to understand the reasoning the Leagues team took when creating that part of promo helper. :)","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-02-12T22:50:55.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I completely understand your point about others being punished when someone dodges, and why the system cannot and should not differentiate between intentional and unintentional dodges. But it has nothing to do with my initial point.\n\nWhat I meant was: if you dodge (intentionally or not) a \"standard\" game, you only lose 3 LP and suffer a 5 min penalty. It's far from being as punishing as a full loss.*\nOn the other hand, if you dodge during a promo series, you suffer a full loss for this series. It's obviously to avoid tricking the system and only choosing to play easy games for your series, and no one's complaining about that. But if you do dodge during your series, you are already dealing with a harsher than usual penalty. So if in addition to that, you also suffer from losing the free win for your next series, it really feels like a triple punishment, and it doesn't seem fair. Plus, as you stated yourself, it's not very intuitive and it's not written in the tooltip that pops in-game about dodges (yet?).\n\nI hope it's clearer now, and I'm sorry for the misunderstanding earlier. Could you relay my concerns to whomever seems appropriate?\n\nThanks :)\n\n*(If I remember correctly, someone from Riot once said that the first dodge wasn't very punishing because there are legitimate reasons to dodge (intentionally), but that's not the point here.)","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2016-02-12T23:54:50.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll make sure someone on the League team sees this suggestion - but I do want to stress that this likely won't change because it's built to be part of the dodging punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-02-13T00:31:48.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand, no promise attached, of course.
