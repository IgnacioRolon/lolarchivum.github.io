Meanwhile in bot lane, i had an Ezreal support who refused to do anything else but adc. So we had 2 ADC.  On top of that, we lost.  I simply asked my team and the other to report these two, and they proceeded to verbally harass me and be toxic the whole game and tell me how i suck and how what i say means nothing. \n\nI said nothing toxic and i did nothing to receive a 14 day suspend. \n\nRiot, you seriously need to fix your ban and suspend tribunal, because honest good players, that love this game and will be a team player till the end like myself just got a 14 suspend, for pointing out an issue, i also have twitch proof in video for this whole matter. and asking for a report on these two toxic unsportman like players who verbally harassed me the whole game and refused to play correctly. . I never threw a game, cheated, verbally harassed anyone, nor did i go AFK.\nI will be quitting league completely and going to Dota 2, leaving behind my diamond 3 main account and all of my alts, just because the tribunal is unfair unless this suspend is lifted. \n\nI literally got screwed both ways on this and its unacceptable that riot allows for this to take place.\n\nPlease lift my ban, or say goodbye to a player since 2011. thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"IronHeadK1d","date":"2017-08-01T12:22:02.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my account is suspended for almost same kinda reason too. I guess riot is too busy making money to care about how trash their reporting systems is. They don't understand that most low elo players in league are toxic and 99 percent of the reports are largely biased because the players who submit the reports are toxic themselves.   I am sure if Riot doesn't fix this soon, no one will play this game since it has became trash. And riot is not punishing the real trolls but the good players who have been contributing so much for its success. I hope riot go down someday since the game it made millions ppl spend money on is now painful to play because of all the negativity in the game and the reporting system itself is a joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T21:36:08.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this is regarding a suspension, you'll need to reach out to our specialists via a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can provide further context on this.
