Ashe, Sejuani, and Lissandra have a mini-game which is supposed to \"determine who rules the Freljord\". Now we have one of the best opportunities for a mini-game for Pantheon and... Riot missed a golden opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn his lore, Atreus is deemed unworthy by the gods and is basically a spectator to what the Pantheon does with his body. Aatrox and the Pantheon fight and Pantheon is killed. He has lines in his kit which he only uses when Aatrox is on the field. Give us a mini-game...\r\n\r\nI call it \"the Rematch\". Atreus must kill Aatrox to prove his worth to the gods and to prove the Aspects wrong about his worthiness. If Atreus wins, he gains a heavenly glow signalling that Targon finally acknowledges his worthiness. Aatrox must kill Atreus to prove that none can stand against the World Ender. He gains a boost to the size of his sword to show that he has slain an Aspect. This mini-game only becomes activated after Pantheon and Aatrox hit level 11.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-08-14T14:27:24.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it, just so long as aatrox doesn't get more range because bigger sword.\nor maybe his wings ignite and are out all the time?","replies":[{"poster":"Famous Gay Actor","date":"2019-08-19T18:57:56.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more for aesthetic pleasure. (Aatrox feels cooler cause he killed an aspect AND his vessel). Pantheon might get like a glow on his cape and spear because he reignited the Pantheon in the stars by slaying Aatrox.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-14T15:27:26.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get the feeling there's a reason they stopped doing these and instead opted for vs. events as there are numerous champions who should theoretically have something similar","replies":[{"poster":"Famous Gay Actor","date":"2019-08-19T19:00:22.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So rather than stop doing them, maybe give them their appropriate mini-games (if it fits the lore and can be done).\n\nFun fact, there used to be no way you could have every champion and skin in the game.
