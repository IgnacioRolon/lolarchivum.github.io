Most people rely on randoms because they don't have a sufficient network of people who can get a 5 man premade. \n\nI am one of these people.\n\nNot to mention posting on boards or reddit may not yield a whole group and is usually people trickling in over time (i've done this and to this day the outcome of doing this is not as favorable as running with randoms).\n\nNow in simple terms this is a game mode which revolves around missions as it has no other purpose (there is no \"winning\" without the incentive the missions give), while also being time limited meaning compromise is a must otherwise things fall to shit.\n\nPlaying for \"fun\" is a very subjective reason as it is different per individual, but in my opinion the game mode is fun regardless of the mission(s) chosen at any time.\n\nCompromise is not \"bending knee\" to people, it is accepting that you can make a minor change to benefit or help others while not actually depreciating yourself, because guess what; asking someone to run 2 / 3 augs (or 5 yasuo) doesnt actually ruin the fun, and if it does ruin the fun for you you have the option to ff and carry on. \n\nUsually if spoken to properly people tend to not be so abrasive, however people tend to stick to the \"I do whatever I want\" attitude without being considerate and don't ask to leave or ff and that leads to pissing people off.\n\nI literally had a game where the group (being a 4 man premade and 1 random) wanted to do the 3 aug mission (i wanted to do the 2 aug mission but thought I would just help the group) and then 1 person said \"I'm playing for fun so I'm running full augs\" when asked if there was a compromise the one person zealously pulled the \"I do what I want\" card, this in turn made the other members of the group irritable resulting in one member getting into an argument with said zealot. \n\nThe thing with that situation was that it ended in a ff anyways but the way it was approached resulted in angst.\n\nSpecifically in response to what you first said \"if your 4 teammates told u to play a champ u suck at or hate playing u r the troll\": You're analogy is heavily skewed in the wrong direction as it is not a choice of as much importance as it is in this game mode where this choice is about the benefit (being all or nothing due to missions) of everyone. In any normal / ranked game your champion is of far less benefit as specifics are not necessary for the team to succeed. Whereas Odyssey Onslaught needs specific comps for wins / missions and thus the choice becomes of greater importance.\n\nThe final points I'll make is that both sides have a choice to compromise or just pull away from this, so blaming either side is moot as both sides can be equally toxic.\n\nHonestly I really think Riot should have 2 ques for this type of mode; one which allows progress for missions and one that does not, as to avoid the fun goers clashing with those trying their ass off.\n\nI apologize for the wall of text tho, just wanted to point out reasoning.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frickface","date":"2018-09-25T03:29:40.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"Agreed.

It's not trolling or anything to not want to go along with something, and you're never required to play anything. But if 4 people are able to come to an agreement and there's no reason _you_  don't want to go along with it for anything other than \"I don't wanna,\" it's just inconsiderate to those players. Some people play on limited schedules and those 5 minutes of trying to agree in champ select to loading in just to surrender can mess up their ability to play at all, especially since based on my own experience it can happen anywhere from once to 5 times in a row - and coincidentally these are the type of players that usually don't have the option of building a 5 man. \nNot to mention, with a lot of these players I've encountered, if it was something where people tried to agree on stuff in lobby but couldn't really decide and end up with a bad comp or little to no augs, or in a 3v2 situation, they've opted out of surrendering because they want to have fun, despite people not having the augments to have fun as well or not wanting to be in the match to begin with because they have no chance of earning missions. Does everyone do that? No, but it's happened way too often.\nClaiming that either side is inherently toxic, however, would be shortsighted as I've seen seeping toxicity from both sides. I've had people yell in champ select \"OMG POS GO EAT A COCK GET A 5 MAN\"(almost word for word btw) simply because I asked to do the 2 augment mission. I also once had a person sit AFK in Onslaught because people did not go the challenge they wanted, funnily enough we won without them, but still. People choosing to be uncooperative so they can feel like the king of their own world are annoying, people who sit through matches simply to flame you because you didn't pick what they wanted are also annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Riven","date":"2018-09-28T04:11:17.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Some people play on limited schedules and those 5 minutes of trying to agree in champ select to loading in just to surrender can mess up their ability to play at all, especially since based on my own experience it can happen anywhere from once to 5 times in a row - and coincidentally these are the type of players that usually don't have the option of building a 5 man.\n\nSo only I have all the time in the world to favor people. This can go both ways. Maybe I only have a limited time to play too?\n\nSimply put, Riot didn't implement a group finder. So, random queuing and hoping to get people on the same mission is the only way. If that fails, surrender and keep trying. There is no reason to keep wasting 20 - 30 minutes in groups doing 4 aug mission when you're on 2. Doesn't make sense. Even if 4 people are on same mission and I'm not, I'm AFK reading something online or doing something productive like cleaning my room. If they make it to Kayn, I'll come back and help and get it over with it.\n\nEveryone's time is just as precious, not only the majority that agreed in champ select.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-09-25T08:31:55.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some people want to play for fun.
