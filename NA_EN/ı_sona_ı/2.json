{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-11-08T07:05:02.114+0000","title":"To All Of The Recent Ban Recipients","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"First of all, (hug).\n\nI bet you aren't feeling very good right now. All that effort seemingly gone away for nothing, due to x y or z reasons. It isn't very fun and doesn't feel very fair. I would give you some chocolate to help you feel better were I beside you, but I am not, of which I apologize, and hope you find a source of chocolate soon. \n\nHave you taken a visit to https://support.riotgames.com ? From here you'll be able to access the ticket system, where you will be able to submit a ticket regarding the crisis you are currently facing with the loss of your account! If you prefer, they are also available via the live chat feature, but that is available only during the day between certain hours (seems to start around 3pm central?). In doing this, you may be able to find out what has happened to make this ban happen. Sometimes bans are placed by mistake, and it only requires a little bit of investigation for Riot Support to help you determine if this is the case, and possibly get your account unbanned! \n\nWhile you wait for a response, how about watching a movie? Something you haven't watched but have been meaning to, or something you've watched before but always makes you feel good! Or how about playing one of those games you've been meaning to get around to playing but haven't because League of Legends is so awesome? This is a perfect chance to do those things to help increase your happy!\n\nChances are, much of your playing has probably made you very stressful. Trying to get that kill but they get away with an inch of health, or your blue buff got stolen. Maybe someone afk'd 5 minutes into the game and you have to suffer through the rest of it, or maybe you're trying your best but players are putting you down left and right because you aren't playing perfectly. This may be a good time to sit and reflect on something very important: am I having fun? If you are playing league of legends and it is a joy every time you step into Summoners Rift or Aram, keep on playing to increase your joy! But, if you've gotten to a point where you step into a game thinking \"I bet someone is going to afk, we needed a tank but they picked someone stupid, their matchup is wrong, they picked dumb summoners, I bet my support is an idiot, i'm tired of losing these games cuz of the people around me\" you might be at a point where League of Legends is bringing you less happiness than you deserve. This may be your chance to take a break from something that is causing you more unhappy than you need in your life right now, and perhaps try newer and better things out there! This could even be the time to catch up on some book you've been meaning to read since forever, or a TV series you've been meaning to watch! \n\nDon't take the banning as a personal attack against you, none of us dislike you and you are loved for who you are, try seeing it as a blessing! Just send your ticket to Riot Support and take a relaxing break. Bubble bath and chocolate! Maybe just lay out in the yard and watch the stars a bit. Breeze deeply and find your happy. :) \n\n{{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tahmis","date":"2018-11-09T05:24:41.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all *hugs back* This is my first post on the boards so I'm happy to share it with y'all.\n\nThank you so much for this post. I suppose I'm going to vent a little bit, so If you'd like to hear a short story, if not, just ignore me. I got banned for MMR boosting, and it was justified. I had given up on getting to gold, I was sitting in Silver V in flex. one day I sat down and played some ranked, got on a win streak and hit Silver III. My only motivation had been Orianna, she is definitely my favorite midlaner and I felt like I had to have that skin.\n      \nAs I got deeper into silver, my class work only piled on. that's when I sought a boost. My account hit gold on Halloween and I was ecstatic. I had started talking to a new potential partner, my account was gold for the first time and I was gonna get Victorious Orianna. I was overjoyed, I felt like this was finally my year. Although all ill gotten gains typically come back to haunt you.\n\nThe partner and I didn't work out and I got banned for MMR boosting, like this facade I had constructed just crashed down on me. This only goes to show that cheaters really don't win. I know it's what I deserve, I know the punishment was justified, but at the end of the day I still feel bad about it all. I don't even feel bad about not getting the skin, not being able to play until the 21st, I honestly feel bad because I feel like I let Riot and all the other summoner's down. I'm mad at myself for sinking low enough to get boosted. I never got angry, I never got mad at anyone aside from myself, I never felt any animosity towards Riot because deep down I know I don't deserve the rewards.\n\nNow I'm to the point where I'm scared. I suppose its bound to happen when you hear the word \"permaban\" flying around in reference to your account. I'm scared I'll get banned if I play league on my computer at home because of different IP's, I'm scared If I do actually make it to gold I'll get banned for boosting when I didn't, I'm scared because Riot hasn't responded to my ticket yet about asking for reassurance that I won't be wrongfully permabanned. I'm hoping I'll naturally chill out soon enough, but until then, oh well.\n\nAs a final note, I'm writing this to all of the people out there that think boosting is worth it. It isn't. the anxiety of your account in someone else's hands, the fear of getting banned, the loss of money to pay for a boost. None of it is worth the skin, it won't make you a better player, and it is surely nothing to brag about. Thank you for reading this and thank you to everyone in the comments who kept it positive, its a quality we could all stand a little more of. I hope one day (well after the 21st lmao) that I can see you all again out there on the Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-11-09T05:30:39.463+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tahmis,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ppu95koV,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2018-11-09T05:24:41.580+0000)\n>\n> First of all *hugs back* This is my first post on the boards so I'm happy to share it with y'all.\n> \n> Thank you so much for this post.

I've been bouncing between gold and silver a lot this season, yoyoing so much I went and took a 6 month break! The game really is tough on the nerves at time, and i'm sorry your account ended up being penalized for a silly mistake. \n\nThe thought of a permaban can be very scary, but that just means you should go into full Barnie mode! Just say nice things to others, even if they say mean things to you. If someone says \"you fucking suck\" then you turn around and say \"we're still in this team, don't give up yet!\" Do that in all scenarios and you should be A-OK! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tahmis","date":"2018-11-09T05:34:20.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ı Sona ı,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ppu95koV,comment-id=000e0001,timestamp=2018-11-09T05:30:39.463+0000)\n>\n> (hug) Sounds like a rough gaming year for you!

At the end of the day I had a lapse in judgement and I broke a rule. I made a stupid mistake and I have to pay for it, I'm willing to earn my way back up. I have a goal now that I don't have to play ranked for, to spread positivity within the League of Legends. thank you so much for your kind words, I'm not gonna forget them as long as I play this game. \n\nSorry if that sounded really sappy, its the mood of the hour :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Always Broken","date":"2018-11-09T03:58:38.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope it's definitely all the tryhard , emote spamming, REAL TOXIC players that trigger everyone else.
