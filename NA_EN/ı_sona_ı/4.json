If you actually afk you automatically ruin a game that might have been won, or atleast could have still been fun for a while. (unless ofcourse the score is 25-7 or something in which case I understand why u'd be opening) These actions are disrespectful and can ruin the fun of the game, even if it doesn't ammount to being hateful or cruel.\nTrue, some people take it better than others, but why should the sandard be set by what rather tolerant people can put up with, rather than human decency, respect for other human beings, and the promotion of a fun environment?\n\nYou mentioned banter at the end, but what you previously said isn't competative friendly banter at all. \nAlso you have to be immensely toxic or a consistent negative influence on the teammates you are playing with to get banned. You don't just say the ocasional line like '/all ugh team too heavy' and get banned.\n\nIt's also not the case that people generally used to put up with people treating their teammates badly in the past. In pro sports you can be fined and supsended for 'chirping' and trashtalking etc. In fact violence in pro sports aagainst teammates is rather common because that's how a lot of athleats choose to regulate indecency. Respect is a basic human value that humans have promoted since we evolved to be human.","replies":[{"poster":"No Chat System","date":"2018-12-11T19:42:45.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrimsonDawn77,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WXce3uhv,comment-id=00010000000000000002,timestamp=2018-12-11T18:46:17.902+0000)\n>\n> So because trash-talking has been common throughout time players who have a bad game therefore have an obligation to put up with being treated badly?\n\n**The thing is.

Pings are all we need.**\n\nSo all players (since all players have bad games) have an initial obligation to endure the toxicity that comes their way because they can prevent it from continuing by muting etc? That is what follows from deciding that it's more important to not punish toxic chatters than it is to ensure people are treated respectfully via discouraging toxic chat through puishments, as what is implicit is the rights of toxic chatters take priority and thus impose that obligation on others to endure the initial abuse.\n\nThat would be considered an obligation because it's a result of other's rights and moral principles being considered necessitating the situation in which they have to put up with the initial abuse. You couldn't dismiss ppl having to put up with the abuse as a unfortunate fact of the world we live in -not an obligation- when you have considered everything in a moral sense and decided the rights of toxic chatters are more important than the rights to not be abused. People having to put up with the abuse, ethically speaking, would be 100% a requirement under the moral rules you've set in place, and thus an obligation. \nIs that obligation fair and sensible?\n\nWhy should there be no chat system in league when the majority of ppl aren't toxic and want a chat system? Why should stopping toxic players by having no chat system, probably the most extreme and burnening-on-everyone solution, be the option used?\n\nCan you please back up what your saying with some ethical reasoning?","replies":[{"poster":"No Chat System","date":"2018-12-12T04:46:52.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But...

It sounds like you are presenting what you personally prefer as a moral rule that should be followed when in fact it isn't because it is inconsistent. Can you further back up what your saying with moral reasoning and examples as I have? I'm all ears as I love debates.\n\nIf people are having to mute people to stop seeing the abuse/disrepect etc that means they have had to endure it intitially before muting. The fact that it can be very brief doesn't make it not abusive/disrespectful etc. Even if it is minor it is still something that people shouldn't be subjected to; it's suposed to be a fun gaming environment. Basic human decency still applies, even if people have a bad game despite trying.\nIs it ok to to throw food, paint etc on people's cars if they can easily clean it off and stop it from continuing? Should there be no deterrance or punishment for doing that if the problem could easily be prevented from continuing?\nIs it ok to be rude at a resteraunt to someone nearby you because they can easily move to a table further away and not continue to be subjected to the rudeness?

However is it possible, to not flame in some circumstances? \n\nLike seriously now 3 days ago i went duo with a friend of mines. And the games were absolutely horrible (quality wise). I had 2 or 3 games in line (im not sure how to phrase that in english) where my junglers literally ignored my lane.  \n\nThe first that comes to my mind is the garen (me) vs illaoi,top. I leashed his red and tanked for him. I came to lane with 3/4 of my hp. I ended up falling behind in exp and gold because apparantly illaoi with w at 1 lvl is pure cancer.  She pushed throughout the whole laning phase and twitch didnt gank even once.  I asked him (kindly ofc, until he outright ignored me) to come and help me. He didnt come.  \n\nAnother i remember was with a fizz vs orianna. Said orianna had also barrier so me killing her solo would be difficult. I asked my jungler kayn to gank me because orianna was pushing trying to poke me, but he never did. I had fallen so behind that after 6 i couldnt kill her even if i landed my ulti from long range. \n\nThere was also another game where i was i think fizz vs ahri. I asked my jungler kha to gank her before she hits 6 and becomes a pain in the arse to gank. Spoiler alert...... he ganked! 10 seconds after ahri hit lvl 6. I used my ulti to maybe force hers, and i did. Still she had 2 more dashes to avoid kha (lvl 5 i think). Fast forward some mins ahead and she bullies me hard and i have 0 ganks, i told him to come and gank her since i can burn her ulti. But he didnt respond or even pay attention to my requests.

I wish I could remember his summoner name but when i was coming back to the game I was getting completely destroyed throughout the game by the enemy Zed. I was playing LB. Think I went something like 2-14 and most of those deaths were from him. After the game he friend requested me and invited me to play some custom 1v1 matches with him to show me how to play that lane better. Did I feed? Yes. Did my team mates flame me and report me for Inting? Yes. Did I learn something because someone noticed me legitimately struggling and wanted to help? YES. I am not saying players need to go out of their way to coach each other every time they see someone else having a bad game, but advice how are bad players supposed to get better if they don't know what they don't know. Not everyone is able to see the \"cause and effect\" in trades or fights that end in a loss for them. Many players simply don't know what to pay attention to and what to look out for in a lot of situations. Until I got help from other players the thought of tracking my opponents spell cooldowns never even occured to me much less denying vision, following their build path and having a solid base understanding of champions base damage+items. This game is not like conventional sports where kids grow up with formal coaching through PeeWee, little league JV and Varsity. Everything is pretty much self taught which will almost always leave some sort of gap in game knowledge, reasonion, awareness and decision making. Be patient and try to actually help FIX the problem you see if you are able. Otherwise worry about your own game.","replies":[]}]}
