I log in today and have a balance of 6013!  I mean, that's not a huge loss of IP, but I wonder how long this has been going on, and over the course of the 3-4 years I have played this game, how much IP has been deducted when i wasn't looking?\r\nMaybe this is a bug, but i know I had 6170 IP before i closed my client last night.  Anyone else have this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"GuardicGaiden","date":"2017-02-11T10:50:35.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday 1522 + 239 + 80 + 63 + 80 = 1984\nToday 1633\nWTF?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-09T17:17:39.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this for you, I wasn't able to see anything out of the ordinary or IP just disappearing.

Hop back on the legacy client in case you balance isn't sync'd up.  \n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIf you still run into any problems, hit us up in a ticket so we can check it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-02-09T21:29:56.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, this is just something that I have had a problem with and you mentioned it in the post\nWhen I use the legacy launcher, it brings up the normal launcher but when I hit the orange button at the top it brings me to the updated client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lastira","date":"2017-02-09T18:13:40.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am on the updated client.  I have played another game, and it shows i have more than enough IP, then if I try to purchase, I cannot.  I log out and log in, and the IP goes below what I need.  It's something on your end,  a minor bug, but maybe something you should look into. I took photos with my phone it goes from showing 6424 to 6267 upon restarting the client. I put a ticket in. I am not so upset over the issue that it ruins my day, just something I noticed and maybe something you guys can fix so other people do not feel like they are being cheated.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
