Leave Cassiopeia as she was before.\n\nyah, this is all mostly wrong. First of all, Cass isn't all that mana hungry. Building tear will suffice as her E restores mana on last hit. You'll really only run out of mana during either an extended team fight or grabbing a dragon/baron. I haven't yet experimented with these changes but my guess with the E buff is that you'll require fewer Es to burn through the opposing team so you might not even need a tear and can go RoA instead. Those are some things I'll have to try out. With the stacking passive, I think I was getting to 400 usually by ~35min so i'll have to see if this is a real buff to her stacking which i'm skeptical about since I was using the minions to help stack before and now I can only use it to restore mana.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2014-12-10T12:55:56.656+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"The point of maxing Q first , pre-rework, was the safety of the range.\n\nWhat is the point of maxing Q first if you're just gonna get into E's range anyways......\n\nanyways, her power does come slightly earlier now and it isnt as frustrating before  patch","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhody","date":"2014-12-10T22:28:28.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I never understood why people are missing the poison damage.\n\nI kill people jsut fine by maxxing E","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-12-10T13:05:57.884+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"I like it","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSc0tty","date":"2014-12-10T13:39:13.315+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Actually it works pretty well, having seen it in PBE. That AP ratio buff on E really lets you put the hammers on with your burst, while her poison harass early makes her early game much more poison focused.

Now while I've been completely unable to make her work (it's a player skill thing, she went from being hard, to being HARD), the idea and the promise of a lategame monster are really interesting.\n\nMy main problem with the pre - 4.21 Cass was that she was forced to push the lane in order to farm stacks, which was awful, but with this change, stacks just come naturally, and even if I'm unable to pressure the enemy laner and poison him, the skirmishes and teamfights that are bound to happen are enough to get me a decent amount.\n\nOverall, I may be biased by having played old Cass and not liked her one bit, but I feel this rework really brings life to the champion, then again, I believe the numbers to be a bit undertuned, specially as it concerns her lategame, but that's the kind of tuning that these updates (like 4.21) are meant to achieve.","replies":[]}]}
