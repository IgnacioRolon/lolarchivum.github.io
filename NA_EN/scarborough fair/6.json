With champions like Karma and Trundle whose identities were completely changed, traditional skins did alot of good in giving their older players a nostalgia effect when playing them. Champions like Caitlyn and Evelynn who are going to be completely changed visually and thematically(in the case of {{champion:28}} ) need to have traditional skins to preserve their older fantasies that were favored by their players.\nFor example, I was really disappointed when Sion changed drastically and didn't get a Traditional skin, and I bet there are others who feel the same way.\nSo please, don't stop making Traditional skins, they mean ALOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2015-02-16T14:54:40.294+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't forget Sion.

Allow me to explain or rather give an example.\n\nSion, there is a reason to why they din't make a traditional skin for him. It wasn't as if they were like,\"*Two mush werk, must nat do.*\" But rather they felt they did Sion a justice and felt a traditional skin wasn't needed. He still has the same concept really, this juggernaut that would plow threw your team. Sure he may not be doing the damage that old Sion did but the same feel is there. So what is it i'm proposing then?\n\nSimply put,*** not a traditional skin but rather something close to it.***\n\nI will use Sion as an example again. Instead of giving us Traditional Sion, perhaps they can give us something close to it. Lets call it Rotting/Zombie Sion. It would have  a different name but would have some of the same looks of the Traditional Sion, with variants of course. It seems like a nice compromise to not wanting to make a Traditional Skin. It might cost as a new skin for the Champion, but seeing as how alot of people want to have a Traditional skin, I would imagine alot of people would be fine with this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Desmond Law","date":"2015-02-17T06:50:22.119+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://abyssmosis.deviantart.com/art/Classic-Sion-Skin-League-of-Legends-485208343","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-16T18:37:31.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He only had arnold quotes in his english VO, which is why they didn't keep them all (he still has a couple as super rare lines though).","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-02-16T21:07:03.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Part of the problem was that those didn't mean a whole lot in other languages.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ftftfftftftf","date":"2015-02-16T13:50:27.434+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

His regenerative abilities greatly surpassed those of his kin, but his tribe respectfully allowed him to come of age and choose for himself whether to take upon the tremendous burden of the curse and alleviate his tribe of it.
