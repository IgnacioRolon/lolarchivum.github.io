When you mentioned not having much lag in the morning and night, that does sound like it could be due to heavy internet traffic during those times. I would suggest updating your port forwarding and give you DNS a flush using the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Worth a try if you haven't yet!","replies":[]}]}
