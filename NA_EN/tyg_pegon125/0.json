I have sporadic freezes whith sound loop and i am unable to direct the cursor, sometimes i have 2 freezes in a row, other times a week or two passes between the freezes. At rare occasions my PC starts freezing but finally manages not to have a complete freeze, but this results in a total freeze after roundabout 5 mins anyways.  So far I have checked my drivers, my hardware and tried to run Lol as an administrator. Of course I tried reinstalling Lol serveral times.\r\nWoth to note is that after every freeze, while restarting the game i have to reaccept the terms of use and my launcher is set to connect to the North American server.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T22:35:52.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm that's a pretty interesting set of issues. When the game starts freezing it sounds like something might be going on with your drivers and such, but then the client crashing and showing the ToS again makes me think that something is failing with the game files. Let's try to tackle both of those at once, so try running a repair through the client options and also update your [**permission settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) too.\n\nIf doing those steps don't seem to help, then we might be dealing with something completely different altogether. In that case, go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to take a much closer look!","replies":[]}]}
