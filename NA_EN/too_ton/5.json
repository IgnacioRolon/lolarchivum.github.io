He can burn with a Liandry's and Rylai's combo, but when it comes down to it, most tanky champs can either out sustain him, out damage him, or simply rape him in lane. \n\nThere's also the fact that unlike most tanks, Swain actually doesn't do well in long engagements since he'll go oom from his R. With the beefiness of the current meta, Swain usually runs oom and is useless by the time the other tanks are ramping up, like Darius.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2015-10-24T09:47:35.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain is overpowered.

Pro players don't use him because he doesn't fill the requirements they look for in a mid.  That's why when you do see him in pro play it's always top.  Unfortunately he's much weaker at split pushing then the more meta tops, so he's not seen there much either.\n\ntldr: In solo que he can stomp with someone that knows him because in solo que you're mainly looking for someone that can solo carry.  The pro scene tends to need more specialized picks, so he's out, and what the pros play tends to make the meta.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2015-10-24T09:38:25.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On high levels of play Swain sucks.
