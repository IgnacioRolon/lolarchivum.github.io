He still poops on quite a few other top laners, and it is even more ridiculous if he gets to counter pick into just about anything. \n\nHe went right back on auto ban for me after seeing him roflstomp 2 top laners in 3 games. Sure I'm not challenger, but that is also part of the issue of him needing to be banned in my lower Elo. \n\nThat is also not speaking for any other elo, nor was I trying to, but he is still a problem when he gets into team fights because there is no reason at all Darius should ever have gotten a heal.

It's that simple. His Q heal has literally no business being in his kit. It makes no sense thematically (he's all about \"MAKE NO MISTAKES\" and healing = admitting a mistake, among other things). It also makes no sense as a reward-based system. Your reward for hitting your Q properly is bleed stacks and noticeably increased and satisfying amounts of damage. Why heal? Why scale on missing health? He's already going to out-trade you due to the nature of {{champion:122}} so what's the point of ALSO healing him?

It's even worse when it's ham-fisted in a kit that doesn't need it and makes no sense.\n\nIf you can't get him to be a viable and balanced champion without that heal then something fundamental has to change about his kit, and you're doing it wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeMyFriendPlease","date":"2015-09-23T19:06:01.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8XtE3cN8,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2015-09-23T17:00:19.493+0000)\n>\n> Darius was nerfed in 5.18 I believe.\n> \n> One of the difficult things about balancing champions with high pick/ban rates is that the champions tend to be pretty polarizing, so when we go too light, players' reactions are along the lines of \"do you really think that was enough?\", and if we go harder, it's closer to \"champion xxx gutted, gg.\" It's hard to please everyone in cases like this.\n\nI think it's hilarious.

I would definitely say so; he's actually one of my favorite champions thematic-wise in the game. But is he fair to fight against?

Well obviously my Q didn't hurt him since he could heal it and deal damage. Too slow to dodge his Q or get close so no bleed.

Yeah, it's a nerf against 1 or 2 targets, but it's a buff in big teamfights. The ironic thing is that Darius is still very hard to take down in 1v1 or 2v2, but now he's even harder to take down in 5v5. Which kind of sucks since it was just totally unnecessary.\n\nAnother thing that seems odd is that he can't be CC'd out of his Q. I was in a match against Darius in 3v3 the other day as Singed, and any time I would run in to fling him, he would hit Q right as I hit E. So his Q would go off while he was in mid air. I was effectively CCing **myself** into the blade. Like wtf is that?

If he gets that on you he can still trade very effectively because the extra damage, plus enough time to get most of his spin off and if you don't have a dash or fast speed boost(not like Rammus ball or Hecarim charge, more like Rumble shield) then you basically have to flash to avoid his full kit(and potentially die without flashing if you're low enough to be executed by his ult.)\n\nTrue though, Darius is a lot stickier and more viable but his tank-to-damage... ratio... thing I don't think is as high, even in the late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Faded Lich","date":"2015-09-23T15:57:40.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a champion is so unfun to play against people rather use a ban slot on him than learn to actually counter him..I think that speaks volumes about his design and state of balance more so than simple number tweaks.
