Yesterday i downloaded a new installer and its been going well so far. I woke up this morning and it was at 50% and applying patches. Its been 7+ hours and it's still at 50% applying patches. I saw another forum and i checked if it was frozen. It's not. Its currently 5:16pm and in my patcher file the last time it got another log was at 3:07pm. Is it working? Is it broken? or is it just taking a while to do its thing?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T03:58:08.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your computer's connection to our patching servers is pretty unstable.
