She has a KDA I would expect for losing against a damage heavy team, she isn't building any trollish items, and she even has a greater KP than you do.\n\nSo I'm disinclined to believe you that she was trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-04-11T23:10:49.287+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"To add onto what Krol Wilk Sam said it's not just Riot who has this policy as many real life establishments and even companies like Blizzard have this policy as well where if multiple people act up they'll all usually be punished accordingly.\n\nAlso, the mute button is meant to be a bandaid solution to help prevent further verbal harassment but does not excuse the harassment that's already happened.\n\nIf you disagree with the rules then fine, feel free to find another game with less strict rules regarding player behavior, but keep in mind that this is the lightest punishment given out so you still have plenty of opportunities to learn from this and improve your behavior if you decide to continue playing League.","replies":[{"poster":"Beli14","date":"2018-04-15T21:26:56.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-04-15T23:41:36.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OldChetnik,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=nbKf68sw,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-04-15T21:26:56.620+0000)\n>\n> Btw Blizzard is so much better company than this shity Riot. Riot has punishment for HOMOPHOBIA. Wait, if Rito thinks thats normal to say in game which plays children not older than 9 &quot;Gay is okey, homophobic guys will be punished&quot; than Riot is a group of liberal retards.\n\nYou do realize that Blizzard also punishes for poor behavior as well right? Many of the stuff that Riot punishes for Blizzard also punishes for themselves, at least in Overwatch. The bottom line is if you can't interact with others in a mature and respectful manner then you shouldn't be playing multiplayer online games.","replies":[{"poster":"Beli14","date":"2018-04-16T04:51:38.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When i played on battle.net (Warcraft 3),I flamed too much and nobody banned me.
