I don't think that my computer is too slow to handle recording because I could record Just Cause 2 with almost no hiccups. Is there something I need to change with league or should I use some other software?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T21:46:07.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're running extra programs, and recording software tends to eat up a lot of your pc memory, you're going to see some noticeable differences with OBS running. I'm not super familiar with that program myself, but xZeZoYT's suggestion is most likely going to be your best bet.\n\nAlso, let's double check some settings in OBS as well as the video options in League. Try to make sure that OBS is capturing the game only and not your entire pc. I was able to find this video on some of the best OBS settings, but I'm also not sure how reliable this will be.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXVD3SB5Pw8","replies":[{"poster":"Goontholomew","date":"2017-05-29T12:33:52.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xZeZoYT","date":"2017-05-27T18:13:42.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look up a video called how to record with obs without dropping fps, that video helped me out a lot aswell, it will show settings to make it stop lagging","replies":[]}]}
