Trying to ping both NA and LAN will show that the packets are lost at the same time. It's only at around 1-4%, but it's still too much. Previously I got a random issue with 15-25% and was brought to 0 by changing Interrupt Moderation to disabled in my NIC. Not sure what to do now, so I'll probably just stop playing for a little and keep checking my ping","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T22:54:07.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After confirming your network settings are compatible with those listed in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), you can run a traceroute with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to determine where the packet loss is actually occurring between the servers and your PC.

It appears the issue is coming from your modem/router since you shouldn't ever see a spike of **147+ ms** to your own equipment. If you see further issues with this, It would be a good idea to reach out to your ISP, if they provided the modem/router so they can test it for faults.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
