So basically i get on my S1 promos to S5 k. I lose the first game but when i check it says i have lost two games but i have only played one so far and the other strange thing is now i'm sitting at 82LP from this lose. Don't forget i'm mean't to have 4 more games to get into S5 but i only have 3 now and i'm sitting on 82LP which will probably make me do promos again. Just like before i won my promos but apparently i was at 81LP and i had to re do promos this was for B2 to B1 so i did promos twice. All i want to know can this be fixed and has it happened to someone before?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T18:41:41.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and see that there was a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging).  These count as a loss towards a mini series.  You'll need to win your next games for a promotion, but if you don't you'll still get a promo helper!  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
