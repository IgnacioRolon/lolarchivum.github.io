One of my new favorites; whoever the singer is has a beautiful voice. \n\nTo me, it starts out with her surfing on her rock making her way to Shurima. She is deep in thought as the world rushes by her as she makes it closer and closer to home. The music gets faster, Taliyah is racing up a hill. A pause in the music. Taliyah reaches the peek of the hill and sees the vast Shuriman desert spread out before her with the Sun Disc raised high into the sky. \n\nRiot never fails when it comes to music imo! Great job Riot!","replies":[]}]}
