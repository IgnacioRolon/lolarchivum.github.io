With Lux I don&#039;t have that big of a problem except with her ult.\r\n\r\nWith Sona in particular I feel like I have no idea how much damage her &#039;q&#039; + attack + passive will actually do to someone, and I&#039;m almost mastery 4 with her. This usually leads to me going &quot;Oh the enemy has slightly less than 1/2 health, I should poke them!&quot; _Does damage combo and enemy dies._ &quot;Oh....&quot; Or me going, &quot;the enemy is at 1/3 health and my ADC is gone, I should kill the enemy!&quot; _Attack combo takes away a tiny sliver of health._ &quot;Well shit.&quot; Even with Sona&#039;s other skills I feel like her autoattack damage (with any passive bonus, not just the damage bonus) is super inconsistent.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2017-10-16T16:08:09.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, you could just learn how to play supports that don't have that problem \nFor example {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:12}} \n\n(Btw, Lux is a midlaner, that's why you can easily ks ur adc's kills)","replies":[{"poster":"Broseidon25","date":"2017-10-16T17:08:23.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xeOpy56P,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-10-16T16:08:09.683+0000)\n>\n> Or, you could just learn how to play supports that don&#x27;t have that problem \n> For example {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:12}} \n> \n> (Btw, Lux is a midlaner, that&#x27;s why you can easily ks ur adc&#x27;s kills)\n\nAll those supports have the tools to take kills.

Odds are you aren't playing at a high enough rank for that to matter. A dead enemy is a dead enemy.\n\nSecondly, I can't tell if you're asking how to reading champion HP bars, or if you're asking how to tell your damage potential. For the former, either click on the opponent, or estimate based on the number of notches on their HP (each notch is 100 HP). For the latter, that's something you can really only develop with intuition. Remember to look at your opponents items and stats, but in the end it's something you learn to feel rather than calculate most of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-16T15:47:37.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So every notch on their health bar is 100 hp, and every thick notch is 1,000 hp.\n\nYou also have to keep in mind their armor, mr, and masteries though, particularly the fearless mastery which gives additional armor and magic resistance (both a flat and % rate) the first few seconds after they get hit the first time.\n\nSo an enemy adc with 9 armor 12 magic resistance runes and 18/0/12 masteries is going to take a lot less damage from your combo than an adc with health per level seals, some other glyphs, and 18/12/0 masteries.","replies":[]}]}
