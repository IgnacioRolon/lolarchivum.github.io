I used to get 32ms every game and now i am at 44 - 49 but I seem to be noticing a big difference than there should be.  It feels like I have a slight delay on everything I do.  maybe the delay is 0.25 seconds but it is affecting my ability to dodge skill shots and I appear to get minion blocked much easier as well.  I would link a game I played as vayne where I first discovered the problem but the match history isnt working atm.  I do not know if I have suddenly gotten much worse at the game or my new internet provider is affecting my ability to play.  I have a good pc btw, i7 3770k 3.50ghz with a gtx 1060 and 8gb of ram.  I play at 144fps on the highest settings but with shadows off and name tags off.  Some times the framerate drops to around 119 as well but I would assume that is an unrelated problem.\r\n\r\nI'm just looking to see if anyone is had similar issues.  Where maybe it says a specific amount of ping but feels much worse.  Thanks for reading and I would appreciate any suggestions of help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-22T00:27:47.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have delays but good pign, then you could be suffering from other connection issues like packet loss.
