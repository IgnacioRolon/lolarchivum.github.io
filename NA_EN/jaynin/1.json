I ignore him. Then I'm suddenly jumped by mid lane and the enemy jungler with no mias. I wasn't expecting that and i did have wards i backed off but they out cced me and i couldn't survive. So i asked mid to please call mias. Then 1 minute later im jumped by the enemy jungler again this time next to my turret and die. Then it happened again with mid and no mias like 3 minutes later so i pinged mia mid a few times as a reminder and said call mias. I was told to stop feeding by the half afk mid who has even less cs than me with like 3 deaths at this point. So after i get ganked by the jungler again i am very upset. When mid and jungler shows up again for a total of 6 ganks in under ten minutes and i have not even been playing aggressive and get no help or mias while being abused by my team of premades i left and said report me if you want fuck you all in all chat. I'm not sorry. There are games you should leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaynin","date":"2018-02-06T01:35:47.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"There needs to be a fuck you ill do what i want option for this stupid leaver thing comment instead of I Agree.

The **only** exception where it is permissible is if the team votes for a(n early) surrender. Unless a nexus has fallen, you are not permitted to AFK. If you can't have fun unless you're winning/carrying, don't play League, because I guarantee you you won't always be winning/carrying. Use the time you're in a losing game to sit back and practice defense, that way you can hopefully come back, but if not, you're still better off than you started.\n\nThis is your fair warning, further, that jokes about mental illness or using such words as a form of hate speech will **not** be tolerated on the boards, and if you use them again will result in deletion and suspension.
