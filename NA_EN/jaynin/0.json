When you start bashing someones kda or telling them to just leave that is what a mute button is for. Things like that should not be reportable, they do nothing to anyone but annoy them. Boohoo grow the hell up. Im not saying that person is not a dick but seriously grow the hell up, this is a game not a diplomatic event, why the hell is it being arbitrated like the slightest hiccup needs to lead to execution.\r\n\r\nThe most toxic thing in this community is the people who will report at the drop of a hat when you get someone banned for something minor it shows you have power this makes people want more and more. People report over the stupidest shit now. It only will get worse. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if i am the only one or not who is tired of all the report malphite for being 0 3! inting !

EZ: WHY ARE YOU SUCH A FUCKING COWARD?! I am going to support someone else. EZ: REPORT SONA TOXIC!!!! Ziggs: get off my lane. Sona I don&#039;t wanna support ez. Ziggs: TOO BAD C*NT GET THE FUCK BOT.

If i play a bunch of games and in 9 of them i am nice then three in a row im mildly bad then 9 i am nice then 1 am bad and now im punished with a ten game chat ban cause of 4 out of 22 games what stupid kinda logic is prevent future toxicity? No that's stupid i am usually very nice you troll me or you intentionally screw a game for me because i have done something you didn't like im gonna say something, If you just make a mistake i will not say something. I am not toxic i am very nice i say gj thank you well done and gg all the time. Its the few times i get assholes and say something that i get punished for, You logic makes no sense. You view everyone as a future offender who ever messes up instead of someone suffering one or two times. You know what would make this so much easier to show it is a flawed system? Context. Someone is being harassed all game and then snaps and says shut the fuck up you stupid bitch no one anywhere would punish that person. Clearly that is self defense. Your logic says that person should be permanently banned from the game because they dared be human. \n\nAll of you keep saying that it doesn't matter what happened to you all that matters is you did anything back. That is all that matters you where raped? aawwww you killed your rapist and escaped get ready to be locked up again. That is your logic. All bad things are not evidence of future bad things. The reason i advocate for the use of mute over report is not because i approve for toxicity or think its ok. The problem is no one should EVER lose their account cause they got trolled and said something mild. If you don't use hate speech you are never truly toxic. If you do get punished with a ban. No one should ever have to lose hundreds of dollars over something petty like all these people do. The fact that you think its ok makes you a horrible person a truly bad person. \n\nYou are literally the type of person who would throw a staring homeless person in jail for life because they stole food from a dumpster behind a grocery store thinking it means in the future they clearly will steal something bigger and more valuable. You are the tye that thinks one crime means it is justified to view that person as bad. You can claim oh you have to do it a bunch. No you don't for a fact i can tell you 3-5 times and you are punished. Even if those times are 20-30 games apart. No matter how mild that infraction is you can get life in prison (perma ban) because omg you called someone an idiot 4 times once in 4 different games. Boo fucking hoo grow up people are sometimes dicks usually as a reaction perhaps not a justified one but usually as a reaction to someone else. Context matters what you do matters and the punishment you get only in a totalitarian regime such as north korea or this community is saying someones a pile of shit a capital offense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-02-17T00:21:05.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaynin,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JjgR3w7A,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-16T22:36:09.547+0000)\n>\n> They apparently care so deeply for what a random stranger thinks of them \n\nIf the things you say are so completely worthless that everyone should ignore you...why are you saying anything at all?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xFresko","date":"2018-02-17T03:47:08.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jo0o,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JjgR3w7A,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-02-16T22:21:27.733+0000)\n>\n> So you think Riot&#x27;s official policy should be that, as long as you avoid a small list of specific words, you can say whatever you want and let the community self-police?\n\nIs the report system community self policing outside of the zero tolerance words?

Instead you could just use continuous chat bans for people who only do things like passive aggressiveness or sarcasm. You are not a toxic part of the community because you had an unlucky set of games with trolls or selfish people in them and went off mildly. At the same time you did go off mildly. you should get a chat ban just to remind you to cool it. I 100  percent amd certain that 99 percent of people banned for toxicity are not toxic they are just mad at a few games. In fact i can guarantee you that a lot of them are in the vast majority of their games neutral or nice. But they have those bad few where they where in no nonsense mood and nonsense happened Or you just cost them their promos by arguing all game and they had to try and get you to focus on the game and riot bans people for that too because \"not on topic of game\" which happened to me. Do i think the other people involved should lose their account for being actual dicks? No. Because im not 2 with a such an inflated sense of self importance that i think other people should lose hundreds of dollars or time because they where mean to me the only time i ever met them.  No one should lose their account because you get offended to the point you call the police over being called an idiot, cause that sounds idiotic to me.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2018-02-17T01:58:29.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking from  experience, I'm a grumpy person.

That does not mean i am negative more often than you just that i end up reported more often. I don't let one or two mistakes get to me. Its the 40th or 50th SAME mistake that gets to me.
