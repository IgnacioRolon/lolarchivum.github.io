Fine, but trash talking ain't toxicity. No one on the pitch, court, or field ever someone to commit suicide without some sort of malice, and usually something like that would end up in a physical alteration but it wouldn't ever be deemed acceptable. And now in most competitive sports, in the heat of the moment, when trash talking escalates with officials or refs, ya can get punished.\n\nJust because the internet affords distance between individuals, it's not a cart blanche to do as one wishes and say as one wishes without some sort of cause and effect.  \n\nMoreover in sports you have the ability to take the measure of someone and what they say. You can interpret by tone. That's why speech is so powerful. Is it said playfully? Sarcastically? Out of sheer competitive drive? Malice? Bad intent? It's much harder to tell these things when it's just by text, and thus why often people take things at face value online, and it's not unreasonble to do so when someone takes 20 chat lines to rage either at teammates, opponents, Riot or both.\n\nI'll guarantee the way you write an email to a friend is a lot different than the way you speak to them, even if they might know your mannerisms. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect people to think before they type something out.\n\nAnd it's not even about people being too sensitive. It's about people literally being masochists. Riot clearly puts a carrot AND stick in front of players. They know X will get them a carrot and Y gets the stick. Yet, they do Y, get the stick, often repeatedly, and then complain about getting hit bout on the noggin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vergil8084","date":"2018-08-09T21:47:21.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=redniwediS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cEdTNx0T,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-08-08T23:27:31.127+0000)\n>\n> I care about toxic people being toxic in the same way I care about someone answering a call in the middle of a movie theater.\n> \n> I don&#x27;t want inconsiderate people like that ruining my experience, either now or in the future.
