Hopefully someone else can give me some insight.\r\n\r\nI've recently been experiencing (noticed it last night when I jumped into a ranked queue. Shows how often this (never) happens when I don't even have to play a warmup to check my issues) a font of ping spikes, normally around champions, but thats most likely coincidental since it happens everywhere, and occasionally the good old 500 ping hike that leaves me unable to move.... however - The disconnects start at the beginning of the match, when my Internet cable is plugged in! I can unplug it and run it off of wifi, and it rids me of the disconnect, but keeps me lagging and at a higher ping than being direct run. \r\n\r\nOddly enough though, is when I'm at the 500 ping, I can still type. I can chat with other players during the match, but am unable to move. I've thought it could be the internet itself, but that wouldn't make since coming off of wifi just fine, but direct cable not. I'm not exactly sure what would cause just the cable itself to disconnect me and studder my gameplay, as in any other aspect it runs fine. Until league, that is. For instance, I can run around on the internet browsing pages and watching videos while in direct line. Starting league, and opening up a page is absolutely fine as well. However, Going into a queue (only after it loads in) I suddenly Disconnect and it retains the \"Attempting to reconnect\" issue until I unplug it. I can open up a browser during this time, google chrome for instance, and the Google.com page won't even load. Pop out the cable, and its just fine, yet again.\r\n\r\nSorry to go on and on about the post, but has anyone else had/been having this problem, or anything similar to it at all? Its not my first time running into connection issues during patch time, thats understandable. This one however has thrown me for one hell of a loop. Any comments would be wonderful, Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Northless","date":"2016-11-14T10:53:52.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is your ISP probably because since i got this new internet i started having 50-3k ms all the time on Wifi and Ethernet {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"AMajorSettBack","date":"2016-11-22T06:05:20.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm assuming it is most probably the ISP :/","replies":[{"poster":"Northless","date":"2016-11-29T12:34:27.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was my ISP,i switched to another one and now im having 29/32 ms all the time ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T00:14:57.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, but could you clarify whether this happens *both* on WiFi **and** Ethernet, or only on one? Also, when you connect to Ethernet, do you disable WiFi  on your computer so you aren't connected to both at the same time?\n\nI suspect there are a few issues here, but I'll need your confirmation first.","replies":[{"poster":"AMajorSettBack","date":"2016-11-22T05:58:37.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I apologize very much for the lateness, outside issues came up!\n\nAnyway, after about a week, its still been having this issue - And to clarify: This does happen on both Wifi and Ethernet, but its more prominent (at least from what I've noticed, could be coincidence) when the Ethernet is plugged in. As to the connection details, Sometimes I'll leave the WiFi connection on so they'll both be connected, but I've also tried disabling it after the connection was achieved, along with restarting my PC entirely.\n\nThank you for commenting back on my post, and I very much apologize again for the lateness!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T21:32:35.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!

Haven't tried it yet, but I'll definitely give it a shot - most likely tomorrow after work/omnoms haha. Also,\n\nHappy Thanksgiving and the like to you guys! :D\n\nEdit/Update on this'n:\n\nI went ahead and did the reboot, and played a match. Besides the fact I had a terribly salty Maokai jung, everything was pretty alright! No lag from that game, or any major ping spikes. I believe your advice very well may have worked! Thank you so much, just a few more games to test out for 100%. Aside from that, I'll definitely remember this if I run into the problem again at all.\n\nThank you again, You're Epic!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
