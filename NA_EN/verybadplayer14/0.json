If a teammate is a troll or if they are feeling spiteful, then antagonizing them will only spur them to act worse. And if they are simply having a bad game then antagonizing them will only distract them and make them play worse. If you care about winning matches then you should not be tilting your teammates with your chat.\n\nRepeatedly calling people feeders is not something I can side with.

Most importantly, I made sure I didn&#x27;t say a single word in game just to see the effect that this trial would have on me. Turns out, after the following game I played, I got the message saying I&#x27;ve been chat restricted for 9 games due to bad behavior.  It&#x27;s not about whether you were toxic or not. \n> \n> \n> So basically the system comes down to this:\n> \n> If you are toxic but only 1 person reports you, you will be pretty much safe from any punishment resulting from that game.\n> If you are not toxic but 4+ players report you, you&#x27;re almost guaranteed a punishment even if those are all false reports.\n> \n> \n> It was an interesting experiment and I&#x27;m just glad it was a chat restriction not a full fledged account ban. \n> \n> What I learned from this experiment is to not say anything in game but to also not stomp the other team so hard in order to avoid any frustration reports.\n\nFirst things first: Tribunal doesn't exist anymore. The Instant Feedback System is what hands out punishments now.\n\nSecond off, it only takes one report to flag a game for review, so unless you're displaying punishable behavior the game will be thrown out if nothing of guilt is found regardless of how many people report you. From [Riot Tantram](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/t4BNHARj-banned-again?comment=00030000000000000002) (aka the guy who wrote the entire system): \n\n>4+ reports is the same as 1.\n\n>A report, or 9 reports, flag a game for review.\n\n>if (reports > 0) {\nreviewGame();\n}\n\nSince you got a chat restriction I can only assume that you've been validly reported for poor behavior in multiple games (which is what actually caused your punishment) and are using this one outlier game as an excuse to try to discredit how the IFS works. If I'm wrong then make your own thread and post your entire unedited chat logs in it rather than posting in a 4 month old thread with a bold claim like this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prodigywanted","date":"2018-02-21T23:41:34.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel ya man i wish things will change here..
