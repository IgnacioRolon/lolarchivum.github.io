Any anti-cheat software scans your computer for cheats. One way of scanning is accessing your open windows and looking at their titles. \n\nQuite literally any piece of software on your computer has this ability natively from Windows. Windows *provides* this information. They barely have to go looking for it.\n\nSo suggesting that Riot 'knows what you google' is extremely misleading.
