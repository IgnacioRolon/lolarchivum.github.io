Because of this, I went ahead and performed an in-depth audit of your account.  From this audit, I went ahead and refreshed your Fizz skin on your account.  You should not be able to select it in Champion Selection!\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your new Fizz Skin!  ^.^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2013-10-02T02:57:07.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume since you're posting this here, you can't select it in game, either? \n\nYour best bet is to submit a support ticket here: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/home","replies":[]}]}
