Also reaches godlike status fairly reliably\n\n{{champion:15}}  Strong poke and wave clear combined with acceptable slipperiness (spell shield and +MS passive and ult)\n\n{{champion:21}}  I'm not so sure on this one, as I personally haven't faced MF in ages.  High AoE DPS?  I suspect it's also because, as an ADC, MF can rely on her support to supplement her lack of CC and mobility\n\nSo that leaves us with our unpopular, \"unscary\", immobile, relatively CC-less friends below\n\n{{champion:36}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:68}}  {{champion:29}} \n\nWell I'm writing this up because Kayle and GP are two of my favourite champions, and with each passing patch it seems that they're more and more outclassed.  I want to talk about Kayle first, and I'll add up other champions if we can get a good discussion going.\n\n*****\n\n{{champion:10}} Kayle, the Judicator\n\nKayle is a ranged-melee-AP-AD-support-carry who brings a unique mix of damage and utility to the game.  Her AP burst build got quite popular for a short time last year before she was promptly (and, imo, severely) nerfed - she's been unpopular and unscary ever since.\n\nKayle is one of 14 champions whose ult does not provide damage or offensive stats.  The others are\n\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:26}} \n\nOf these, 6 see significant (>5% play).  Let's take a look\n\n{{champion:432}} A new champion, so high pick rate is understandable.  Also, notably, has the lowest win rate in the game at 36.52%.\n\n{{champion:40}} Janna is the best disengage champ in the game; her ult's AoE displacement and healing allow her to save an entire team, making it LoL's best disengagement skill.\n\n{{champion:429}} One of the most overloaded ults I can think of, this ult gives an ally a {{summoner:1}} {{item:3157}}, and then a Malphite ult.\n\n{{champion:76}} The most banned champ in the entire game, nidalee's lack of an ult is made up for by having 50% more skills than the rest of the roster (*and a whole lotta toxicity...*)\n\n{{champion:421}} One of the game's most mobile champions gets {{summoner:12}}  on a 48s CD at max rank and cdr; understandably, Rek'Sai has the 11th highest ban rate.\n\n{{champion:117}} Lulu is the closest champion to Kayle in terms of mechanics, and is, in my opinion, the best designed champion in the game (thematically, ergonomically, playing as/against, impactful decision making, versatility).  I would love it if Kayle could be brought to her level of refinement.  It's worth noticing that although Lulu's ult fulfills a similar purpose as Kayle's (massive, clutch defensive buff), it also provides AoE knockup, healing, and a slow aura for 7 seconds).  Lulu's pick and ban rate are both roughly double Kayle's.\n\nOkay, so clearly champions with non-damaging ults can be enjoyable and scary.  However, the successful ones tend to be very powerful (best team saver in the game {{champion:40}} , incorporate Summoner Spell functionality on a short cooldown  {{champion:421}}, or feature the game's best CC, knock up + other goodies {{champion:429}} {{champion:117}} ).  Yes, Kayle's ult is powerful, too, but I am hoping to show that non damaging ults tend to be powerful in general to make up for that lack of damage, and that many other non-damaging ults are more powerful than Kayle's.\n\n*****\n\n\nWellllllllllllllll this is taking longer than I thought, so I'll wrap it up quickly for now and come back to edit later.  What I think needs to happen is for Kayle to get one or more of the following:\n\nHigher base movement speed\nincreased E AP ratio\nhigher base attack speed\nhigher AS/lvl gain\nlonger ult range\nshorter ult cooldown\nreworked Q to provide better type of CC, longer range, lower mana cost (wouldn't mind if it became a skillshot and/or got longer CD), no cast delay\n\nMy arguments will be: \n\n* No one is afraid of her CC.  She exerts her zone control through the threat of damage, but its combination of downtime, short range, dps-as-opposed-to-burst qualities make even her damage less scary than most other characters.  The nerfs to her damage made it so that most people aren't even afraid of her damage, either\n\n* when kayle gets fed, she's strong, but still has inherent counterplay (E cd, low burst (I think it's important that she have low burst), kitability, short duration, non damaging ult).  You deal with her like you do a fed tryndamere (Stop the splitpush, draw out the ult, kill).\n\n* Gold, mana, cooldown dependant - High Q mana cost prevents overuse, E cd provides opponents with clear opportunities to counter attack, requires her items to do well.\n\n* innate pushing is a weakness in its own right\n\n* Defensive ults should be on shorter CD than most offensive ults\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2015-03-19T16:25:13.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only reason Mundo isn't popular is because morellos is so popular. \n\nKarthus is fine. \n\nIf Kayle had hard cc she'd be broken as hell.

If we lose, part of the raging I often see is \"Kayle is just a bad champion\".  I think her low pick and ban rates are indicators that it's not just my anecdotal experience.\n\nI admit that my OP is short on explanations as to what I want changed and why - I hope to update it soon with those things.

Like I see Ezreal as an AP mid more than an ADC now but if my friend and I go bot lane him Ez and me Bard or Thresh we win that lane hands down. I understand why Graves is one of the top ADC's because he gets free tankiness for fighting and great kit. I hate Graves as a champion personally I just don't like him. I think there is a lot of wiggle room in the meta for League but people don't want to work with it. Anyway what I'm trying to say is I agree with you lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-03-19T17:40:40.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her kit itself is fine, I think her early game is a little bit on the too weak side, its difficult for her to make it out of that phase. but personally, that I think has to do with number changing as oppose to giving her hard CC, if she got hard CC, she could potentially become problematic, leading to nerf/buff sprees for god knows how long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-03-19T17:17:30.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need hard CC to be reliable.
