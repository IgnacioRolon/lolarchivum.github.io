I would assume that the OP is from a country that speaks a Germanic language, and that one of two things is true: either he is unfamiliar enough with English to not realize his mistake, or he is completely trolling the native English speakers in the thread by subtly claiming linguistic dominance.\n\nIf it's the first, then lol.

Isn't it random 1 seed paired vs random 2 eligible 2 seed, where a 2 seed cannot be vs the 1 seed from their group or on the same side of the bracket or the group? So if SKT is picked first and Origen takes second and is drawn against them, then 2nd from fnatic/c9 goes against winner of the clg group, while 1st from fnatic c9 gets either edg or 2nd from clg group.\n\nI mean basically bc edg and skt are the same group 1 of them will be in each side of the bracket, so if the matching seed isn't drawn for the same side of the bracket (ie skt and winner of fnatic/c9 group both drawn for A side of bracket means EDG and loser of fnatic/c9 group both go on B side of bracket and can't play till semi's) then both 1st and 2nd from fnatic/c9 group are eligible to play edg/skt. The diff is that first place can only play the loser of clg group (fw or koo hopefully), the loser of KT group (looks like origen currently), or edg, while 2nd place gets either SKT, or what's looking like KT rolster or CLG. 1st is a much better spot to get if you want them to move forward.","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2015-10-04T20:14:25.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah they have a chart set up","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-10-04T21:23:24.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean this one?\n\nhttp://2015.na.lolesports.com/articles/everything-you-need-know-about-2015-world-championship\n\nBc that is the only thing I can think of that you might mean, and it clearly says example and that the actual bracket will be randomized.
