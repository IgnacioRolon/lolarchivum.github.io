You go with your gut and stick with it. They wouldn&rsquo;t offer you nearly 150USD in skins if you were able to get mulligans and change stuff because you were wrong. It&rsquo;s the nature of the beast.

I don't need to insult people, just look at the numbers.\n\n10 NA LCS teams this year. A bunch of new ones.\nThe upfront FEE is $8,000,000 MILLION dollars, with additional fees. New teams have to pay $3million. And you have to keep paying millions over time.\nChampionship Ashe sold for OVER $7,000,000. 7 MILLION with one skin/ward they produced.\n\nSo yes, they may lose some money if people don't buy those 4 skins. But it isn't going to bankrupt them. It isn't  generous prize. It is less than 0.01%, less than 0.001%, less than 0.00004% of what they made just on Ashe skin sales. Not even including the fees for teams to join etc. \n\nI am not saying give $100 to everyone. I am saying give 1 skin to the top 16 or something. Because it is rigged to say only the perfect bracket <1% chance gets a \"generous\" prize.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-19T21:48:18.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this year.  You mean the thing that was decided as worlds as worlds was happening.  Again your complaining about not getting enough free stuff in a free to play game for a basically pointless bracket that costs you no money.  Thats the definition of greedy.  skins are there best form of profit currently.  You want them to hand out there best skins why.  because you feel you deserve it.  And no its not rigged gambling is rigged.  If riot charged you 5 dollars to make a bracket itd be rigged.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-10-19T19:33:37.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I wouldn't say people are complaining.

While I do agree that challenge needs to be involved, the fact they aren't doing \"pick'ems\" with regional games bugs me a bit as they could make it actually entertaining. Perhaps have weekly leaderboards across all regions, and have split-based icon/ward rewards should you hit certain \"milestones\". They could even make it \"kid-friendly\" by not including any cash-related stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-19T14:32:13.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id be interested in split based pickems that have the opportunity or even placing bets with an over/under on games with ip.

Laws are different anywhere you go.  Even in the US it varies from state to state.  The state I live in, it is totally illegal to gamble actual money on things like sports drafts - even if it is online.  I've tried small things with Lol just to see if I could get lucky, but as soon as money is involved I am locked out.  The only gambling here is either lottery and scratch cards, or going to the Native American reservations that have casinos and doing it there.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-19T16:18:41.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well yea thats why i mentioned it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-19T14:57:23.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, from what I'm seeing in pick'em, it says about 17% of players who guessed are still in.  Kind of surprising when you see this explosion of backlash over an upset like this.  lol\n\n... of course, this is coming from someone who didn't care about it and picked Samsung because they were the underdogs.  I am not expecting to guess them all right, let along all of the Quarter Finals matches.  This was just sort of a pleasant surprise for me that my support of the underdogs isn't totally wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"Takito","date":"2017-10-19T19:51:06.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, only 1 person is still in because the others didn't have a perfect group stage...","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-19T23:59:17.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving this as a separate comment from my last... but it looks like there is no perfect draft.  If i am actually looking at the person on the top of the leader board, and reading correctly... one of the groups it says he got 10 of 16 points.  I'd imagine that means something got predicted wrong.  Maybe which team got which seed?  I am not sure, I didn't get around in time to even see the scoring for groups.  But Group B is the group in question.\n\nEdit:  Ok, the rules does have the scoring for groups, I must just be blind.  Yeah, they messed up which place Immortals and Gigabyte Marines took.  So they lost 4 points for that, and 2 for not getting the entire group perfect.  I don't know if I am actually looking at the right person though, so I'm not going to state this as fact.  I just saw this and wanted to point out what I had seen, if nothing else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-19T19:54:03.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually realized that long after I made my comment.  Sorry about that.  My view only had the Knockout stage, cause I found out about Pick'em halfway into groups.  lol  I actually didn't realize you needed both to be perfect.

Breaking it down, you'd have (My numbers are under the assumption that every team has equal chance, which is not accurate.  There would be no hard number to put for individual teams chances though, so making it even between them is the best way to go for this argument):\n\n1 in 4 chance on every first seed for groups, or 1 in 258 for all four top seeds.  Same for second seed (since you can't determine who is first seed beforehand with this argument, you have to count all four teams still), meaning perfect guesses in groups are 1 in 65,536 chance.\n\nNow, counting Knockout separate to start out, you have a 1 in 2 chance for any single team to make it to semifinals, so 1 in 16.  (Again, this is not even considering who the teams are, or how good they look.  This is simply flat chances for all teams for the sake of argument only.)  Semifinals are 1 in 4 chance, making it 1 in 64 so far.  Finals adds the last bit, putting us at 1 in 128 for Knockouts - a much less daunting number.\n\nTo finish off the argument, we just combine the two, giving us a 1 in 8,388,608 chance for a perfect draft.  So... you are actually more likely to draft correctly - even without paying any attention - than winning the lottery.\n\nOf course, with sports, even eSports, you have estimated odds for each individual team, making this number higher or lower depending on who you pick - in theory.  Remember, they are always ESTIMATED odds.  Odds don't decide winners.  Winners decide winners.\n\nI know this might seem unneeded, but I more just wanted to point out, yes, it is possible.  Just very, very unlikely.  lol  Still, I'd rather take my chances on this than the lottery.  It is almost twice as unlikely to win the lottery (closer to 1.6 times from what I'm calculating.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
