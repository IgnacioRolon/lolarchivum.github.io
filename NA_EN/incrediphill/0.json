I've seen more thread locks, and more moderator complaints of the last 2 weeks than I've ever seen. A lot of these disciplines and things are going over my head apparently. I know some are justified, but some are just petty things that have no reason to be acknowledged. \r\n\r\nI could be waaaaaaay wrong on this, because I have no clue how the selection process goes for getting these moderators selected... but it seems to me that these people are all over the place. Inconsistent, biased, and flat out nit-picky. I feel like we have to look over our shoulder after everything we say.\r\n\r\nI got told by a moderator this morning \"Don't be a jerk.\" After they took down my post in which I said \"Mr. OP, I think you should delete your account. I'll wait patiently for this.\" (This was on the thread in which 4 or 5 moderators are all arguing with an obvious troll OP... you know the one) If that is flammable and out of line, then sure, take it away, but I've also posted the same thing twice in the last two weeks with nothing. In fact, me and the guy I was talking to earlier in the week had a good laugh about it... because it's obviously not a serious jab... I guess I'm just confused in what warrants \"being a jerk\" when the moderators engage in more toxic conversations than what I got flagged for posting earlier, but by all means, come and get me. \r\n\r\nI guess my feelings are just hurt and it's frustrating watching this group being so inconsistent and all over the place. I really think RIOT needs to have a more serious selection and vetting process when it comes to choosing the boys and girls who do the moderating on these boards. It's getting pretty bad as of late. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not a job I would want, and no one is perfect and that's understandable... but there seems to be a formula of being consistently inconsistent... and that's not good.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-10-26T18:31:39.607+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":6,"body":">Who Holds These Moderators Accountable?\n\nOur Riot contacts, the Heralds, and the other moderators.

We have a lot of people working as moderators, and we can't all agree on every single action we take. I don't think that's a feasible expectation even if the vetting process was the same as for an FBI job. If it could be automated to give exactly the same response every time, we wouldn't need people to do it. \n\nI understand the frustration about that, for sure. I'm just trying to realistic about how you would address that. Different people do the same job differently sometimes. I'm not trying to argue that the fluctuation is a good thing, but it happens. Even the same moderator may bring a different set of experiences to the same issue a few weeks apart and handle it differently the second time. \n\nIf the comment got removed 1/3 times, there's two things that could've happened. First, it may have not been reported the first two times. We can't moderate what we don't see. I always encourage people to report things that are against the rules so we can handle them. That's what we're here for. But it doesn't always happen.\n\nSecond, there are certainly cases where something is borderline, and some moderators may let it slide and another doesn't; all that says to me is that you are making borderline comments, and you eventually got punished. I think that system is honestly fine. The context also matters a lot, so it's possible that the discrepancy can be partially explained by that. If there's an obvious joke thread where you tell someone to uninstall, I'm not going to remove that.

That is indeed oversight however. They are aware of this board in particular.
