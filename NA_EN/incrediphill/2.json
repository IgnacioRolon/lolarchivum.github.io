You will need to mimick all their strategies and champions in order to win worlds. \r\n\r\nRiot has been unable to get out from underneath the Korean (SKT) shadow since their inception and this Misfits run possibly failing will confirm their worst nightmares. That international play will ALWAYS be mediated, controlled, and lead by a Korean broadcasting company instead of the very people who made the game. \r\n\r\nMisfits needs to win this game to shut it all down. They need to show someone that the only way to beat a Korean team is not to mimick their style, but to show them your style is better. \r\n\r\nGear up for another boring worlds finish. If SKT wins, we&rsquo;re gonna see 2 Korean teams and 4 other teams trying to be Korean... and that&rsquo;s just bad business. Fix it RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-20T13:05:33.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was hardly for nothing.  They were heavily the underdogs, and weren't expected to get even one game.  They may not have won, but they proved they were capable.  And listening to the interview they had with Ignar at the end there, I think they feel that way.  This isn't a loss.  They have every reason to be happy, because they put that doubt in people's minds.  They had people thinking SKT would lose!  And they controlled the pace in all but that first game!  So... no, it does not mean nothing.  Far from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2017-10-20T12:57:46.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IncrediPhiLL,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=GkOpxwvZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-10-20T11:56:51.226+0000)\n>\n> It will further cement the idea that you need to play like Koreans in order to win Worlds.

MSF was still in the challenger series last year. Give them some time to get some more experience, and they can go very far.\n\nIf anything, MSF has proven that you shouldn't play the korean style to beat koreans. Western teams playing korean style have never come this close.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-10-20T12:49:37.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so.
