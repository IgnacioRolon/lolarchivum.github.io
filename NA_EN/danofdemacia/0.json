Why not focus on the root reason why Lulu is so contested?\n\nI find it a little frustrating that the first impulse is to nerf solo lane lulu without really looking at WHY Lulu is hot right now.  Lulu hasn't had a meaningful change since 4.13 and that was a nerf.  And yet recently she has seen only recently been seen as a contested pick again.  Lulu is such a contested pick because hyper-carries, like Vayne, Jinx, and Tristana are all really strong right now.  Lulu is picked to amplify those carries in their ability to carry.  Nerfing solo lane Lulu won't fix the pattern for why she was picked in the first place.  It's only a stop gap that will push players on to other champs with similar play styles like Orianna or Karma.  Lulu is just the best champ currently in the most common metagame being played in competitive League.\n\nThere are a few reasons why hypercarries are strong right now, including nerfs to counters and the changes to IE, but I think that Lulu is just a symptom of a larger issue in League that needs to be addressed.  Lulu might be too strong right now, but when hyper-carries are brought back in line, nerfs to her might make solo lane Lulu too weak.  Maybe, maybe not.

In short: Lulu is overpowered in solo lanes right now.\n\nI think op.gg and fow.kr says completely otherwise against the \"always banned\" statement unless we're talking about tournaments here. The main outcry about the nerf is due to nerfing both mid and support lulu, causing support lulus to become even more unpopular amongst users.\n\nOn top of that, the current meta focuses way harder on the hypercarry jauggernauts, leading to lulus to being picked at mid because of the sustain and the ability to peel for such carries as a solo laner. People understand that mid lulus need to be nerfed, but the main problem whenever the mid gets nerfed, support lulu gets nerfed even moreso than the mid. \n\nNot only that, with the new test environment, support lulus are now harder to survive due to her squishy body and slower than average support movement speed to begin with. This change causes might not badly effect the early laning phase, but as the game progresses, lulu is going to be squishier and squishier even with tanky items built on her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2015-09-03T20:33:21.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":":/ so soraka can never be in a solo lane again?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-09-02T05:45:58.956+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are agreed that support Lulu is currently bad and can't take any nerfs, no matter how much smaller they are than solo lane Lulu's, right?

Most champions nowadays have some sort of mixed damage.\nSupports often run Armor/Health Runes, so making a few swaps between them could minimize the effects of these changes. Allowing Pix to trigger an extra proc of Tribute may make it easier in some duo-lane matchups where poking is more difficult. In others, there would barely be an effect, as a good Lulu would be constantly poking anyways. It does make it a little more forgiving, but I wouldn't really say this is the help that Support Lulu needs. (Especially if Lulu decides to go with the Talisman line.)\n\nOne thought I've played around with is changing the way Lulu's passive works to be more supportive than straight up offensive. \nInstead of firing bolts that deal X +%AP damage based on level, maybe it could be something like..:\n\nLulu is assisted by Pix, a faerie, who fires a barrage of 3 bolts to her target every time she uses a basic attack against an enemy.\nEach bolt adds 1 stack of Glitter to the first enemy it hits, and lasts for X seconds. (Max Y stacks, decays over time.) \nCasting Help, Pix! on an ally transfers Pix's help to them for the duration.\nAllied Champions with Help, Pix! on them will deal an additional Z% damage per stack of Glitter on the enemy per basic attack.\n\nThe idea is to make it so that Lulu doesn't always have that extra damage which happens to scales off AP (which Support Lulu doesn't get as much of, compared to Lane Lulu). This would weaken Lane Lulu since the current passive helps in trades and last-hitting.\nFor Support Lulu, her straight up damage from pokes would be decreased, but with coordination with her lane partner, could end up doing more damage in trades/fights.\nCould also lower the scaling of Glitterlance a bit and have it add some extra stacks of Glitter if an enemy is hit, to further tone down Lane Lulu while helping Support Lulu.\n(Though this idea overall makes things more complicated, so I don't _completely_ like it either.

I was so looking forward to a Katarina gameplay updateyou were working on but they never hit PBE..:(\n\nI really wish Katarina was a Athelitic slippery fighter with some good right click power rather than just \"that chick who throws a billion knives then poofs around and ace's your team in 3 seconds\".\n\n\nIm just a average joe player so I dont know much about balance but what if  you changed shunpo so instead of dealing instant damage.  It empower her next auto?(dealing extra damage if she hits her targets back!)\n\nwhat if her passive  was Evelynns old ability Malice and Spite?(recover HP upon kill and recieve MS and AS boost).\n\nor what if you reworked her Ultimate to let her execute people below a certain hp sorta like Pantheon(this would probally have to scale with offensive stats so people wont just run a full tank kat)\n\n\nor what if a Well timed sinister steel could dodge an auto attack  OR any ability that deals physical damage then it gets temporarily replaced with a ability called \"Retaliate!\" where her next attack was a garenteed crit that crippled her target.\n\n\nIm not saying it would be balanced but you know Just throwing some ideas around, as of right now I think Katarina is so repetitive to play in lane she only has one combo Q into E and W then run away and  she is extremely frustrating to play against  because she is next impossible to gank  thanks to her ward jumping and can just throw daggers all day and sit under tower until level 6 at which point she roams bot for a practically garenteed double She can be even MORE frustrating (especially in SoloQ) once she gets ahead because there is no way people can eat 3k damage per person over the course of 2 seconds and she ends a teamfight before the enemy team can even finish a spell rotation or react. I feel like her laning phase should be all about quick reflexes and jumping on oppurtunities for big burst to punish sloppy play!I find the idea  of constantly being on the lookout for andrenaline packed 1v1's  alot better than  the typical QWER{{summoner:14}} Ctrl6.\n\n\nTL;DR \n\nplease take a look at Katarina If the other faces of LoL are getting reworks and QoL buffs why not her ?Cinematic Kat is so much more interesting than ingame Kat!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-09-04T03:12:23.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buff solo lane morgana and make support morgana weaker","replies":[]},{"poster":"Almighty Teemo","date":"2015-09-02T17:11:16.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So rito is \"buffing\" lulu by changing her interaction with an item, although numerous times people complained that items should play no part in balancing champions' stats.\nThe way Lulu is played as a support is extremely risky, either you succeed by poking or you die, because you are already squishy. Her kit forces you to commit to trades to get some value, but this is already too high-risk low-reward.\nAnd the interaction with the item may not be a buff at all, since the poke item is terrible.\n\nYou can proceed to downvote me now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"amortensen4","date":"2015-09-02T14:04:59.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm danish..\nAnd i like trains.","replies":[{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-09-02T15:02:55.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131002001450/sonsofanarchy/images/1/10/I-like-trains-asdf-o.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-09-01T20:27:52.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can Lulu's pet be updated into rogue Meep?
