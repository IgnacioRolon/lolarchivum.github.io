We won the game after I disconnected but I lost LP. Anyway to get it back?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-06T17:58:33.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I hate to say but getting marked for a leaver will count as a loss even if your team wins.  :(  It sounds like you were gone for long enough to get marked as a Leave, so in this case it would result in a loss of LP and the match.  More info is also available in our [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) guide, but I'm sorry the info had to happen as result of this!  Let me know if you're having any technical issues, though, I'd be happy to help.","replies":[]}]}
