The way you are supposed to build is the way that follows a strategy that gets the player the best ability to win.  Players were following that in what they built previously on Vayne.\n\nIt's not any more \"wrong\" that Vayne players are building that way than other Marksman players being in the \"wrong\" for building {{item:3085}} nowadays","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2017-02-01T08:10:17.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's both a 1v1 assassin and a tank buster. It's always been like that, but she used to be way better at the 1v1 part. She used to be able to 1v1 bruisers at any point in the game after she got a bork. But that was back when ADCs rushed BT, she would rush Bork due to the silver bolts passive and OP bork active. She's still a very strong duelist and a tank buster. That was what she was meant for. She's also meant to be really shitty in 5v5 team fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-02-01T07:55:20.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"%health true damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-02-01T08:09:24.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Weak early, 1v1 queen late provided you can kite and dodge skill shots.
