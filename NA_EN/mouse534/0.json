I am just wanting to understand your standpoint, considering the backlash over the bad. I am not wanting them reversed, or an apology over any real/perceived injustices, just curious about some of the reasoning for the choices? I was wondering about why Q increase speed to the skillshot over, something like increasing the radius of W? I like to know if there was a tiny bit more you could elaborate on, but was not able to during all the backlash. I thank you for the current changes on the PBE for our awesome master and anything to accomplish his short term and long term goals of world domination. I want a good healthy discussion on Veigar, but have only found comments about the changes themselves. Lets talk and see about what this may mean for his future in the game, something that I did not really see communicated though the process that I think should be interesting to see.\n\nTL:DR @Meddler since you have commented on some of the choices for the negatives, lets hear your side for the design of the good.\n\nEdit: For more on what meddler stated about the changes look here:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Q6AojjfV-not-a-riot-bashing-post-why-was-veigar-changed-at-this-point-in-this-way?comment=002d00040000\n\nAnd thanks for commenting Meddler!

I didn't really like the edge-stun mechanic, but this new version is even stranger—it's a \"stun\" that only stuns the target if they decide to be stunned. Outside of some weird chase scenarios, there's no reason why someone would want to be stunned for 2s instead of being free to move around (and indeed free to kill Veigar, which is what happened to Veigars who missed their stuns pre-5.4, and happens to them all the time now) for 3s.\n\nIf the cage's duration were increased, or if **[some other mechanic](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/OEuzazm2-veigars-event-horizon-needs-a-new-mechanic-lets-come-up-with-ideas)** (e.g. MR shred inside) were added in such that the enemy might genuinely want to stun themself, it might be more interesting. Alternatively, if the cage gained a mechanic that allowed him to stun a target inside the cage by landing a Q, that would provide another means by which this \"stun\" might actually stun the target.\n\nAs it is, it's only stunning people because they're confused about how the skill works. I don't think that's a strong basis for an ability.\n\nI love Cho's Rupture, but that's a completely different skill: that's a large filled circle, not a ring, and while someone can generally escape it before it goes off, that requires immediately bolting for the nearest edge. All you have to do to not be stunned by Veigar's \"stun\" is to move slightly in any direction. Also relevant: Cho'gath does not instantly die if he misses a Rupture.\n\nAs for \"trapping them inside the cage\", well, ask any Veigar main (you did talk to Veigar mains, didn't you? You did call up Nyjacky and Dabox before redoing Veigar, right?) what happened to pre-5.4 Veigar when he missed his stun. The answer: you die, and you look absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI'm sure you can buff his numbers up to the point where he's viable, but his gameplay is so flat now. He just sort of throws damage at the enemy team. There's no more cat-and-mouse game with the enemy squishies, no more concern about positioning…you just trade punches with the enemy until one of you dies. (Hint: Veigar dies.) Old Veigar was much more dramatic: you were either in control and terrifying or out of control and absurd. New Veigar is just always \"meh\".\n\nI hate edge-stunning. I also actually hated rushing DFG every match, and I hated even more the way I'd sometimes fail to get DFG to go off and end up bringing someone down to 5% health only to be exploded before I realized what happened. (\"How did she survive that? Wait, why isn't DFG on cooldown?\") Taking away the edge-stun on his cage (even though, let's be clear, that's the only reason someone ever should be stunned by that ability) is reasonable, so long as you insert some new mechanic to make it an interesting skill again. I think we're **[still waiting on that.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/kMxmMEAE-veigar-tries-to-get-riot-to-make-him-a-new-event-horizon)**","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-03-04T06:43:59.852+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like Veigar is meant to transition from burst mage to poke mage.\n\nPoke enemies with your Q.

The problem is that Veigar lacks much of the safety of other poke mages.\n> \n> It'll be odd to see how this plays out.\n\nI think that's exactly it: he feels like a poke-mage now. And he's not a particularly interesting poke mage, either.\n\nOld Veigar was interesting in part because there were two things he could do: 100-0 a valuable squishy, and use his stun and meteors to break the enemy's teamfighting power. You were often balancing between those two; in rare cases, you could go double-or-nothing and try to do both, at an increased risk of accomplishing neither.\n\nThat dynamic tension is gone. He can't really 100-0 a target, and if he does, it doesn't involve throwing his stun on an out-of-position squishy. If you fall down to Wood Tier, yes, you'll see some people freak out and run into the wall because they don't understand how it works, and yes, you can then do a full rotation on them (assuming Q doesn't get minion-blocked), but that's a side-effect of the recency of these changes. You certainly don't have to decide between catching two bruisers in the stun versus catching one mage in it; you no longer aim the stun, you just toss it in the middle of the fight and hope someone doesn't notice it.\n\nI don't feel like I'm making any interesting decisions when playing him now. I'm just chucking damage at the enemy. It's supremely dull. To be honest, it feels like I'm playing Old Veigar in a very lazy way. When I got lazy with Old Veigar, I'd AFK farm in lane and just sort of toss my stun in the middle of the fight without worrying about hitting anyone. If there's a difference between playing New Veigar seriously and playing him halfheartedly, I don't know what it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nasal Herpes","date":"2015-03-04T17:22:41.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"speaking of \"odd\" look at fizz, top bruiser","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-03-04T06:26:52.685+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> the E stopping dashes/jumps in progress (that one also plays up the 'trapped in a cage' gameplay and thematics as well).  \n\nThis is an absolutely fantastic mechanic.

From everything I saw on the PBE boards (I tend to go once or twice a week to it) people were explaining why his new-ish kit was a nerf. And there were a few with a lot of views that showed the math on some of the issues. So when people put the time and effort into showing what they believe (and what they test for you), a simple \"oh we didn't know this would nerf him\" isn't going to work as an excuse. \n\nI feel bad for you Meddler. Mostly because you take the brunt of the forums. I am glad you come answer some things, even if I don't agree with what you are saying.

Who exactly told you that this wouldn't be a massive nerf?\n\nI mentioned the \"changes\" to some friends, and to a one they responded that they thought I was kidding, and that this would completely wreck Veigar. It made every stun into a missed stun. They generally agreed that the Q changes were unpredictable, but doubted that they could possibly compensate him for the loss of his stun. And it was the loss of his stun—there is simply no reason for anyone to be stunned by Veigar's E any longer, unless they deliberately run into it.\n\nIt's not so much the nerf that I'm concerned about, though. I've played almost exclusively Veigar; I do not mind playing underpowered, even non-viable Champions. What I'm concerned about is that his strategic depth seems to have vanished. He's now some kind of poke mage who AFK farms during lanephase. Yes, he can burst people, but there's no dramatic moment where you risk everything to land a stun and chain a full rotation onto an out-of-position enemy: instead, sometimes you notice someone's low, and so you push R and they die.\n\nAdding some kind of distinctive new mechanic onto his E could fix this, but so far, the changes seem to be premised on the idea that anyone should ever be stunned by his new E.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-03-04T09:09:05.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except it can be hit now.

Veigar had way more counterplay than your beloved Zed and Lee Sin, and his instant skill shot stun and point and click nukes were, in fact, not problems and actually good for the game. Not that I ever expect any competence or intelligence from Riot designers any more.\n\nBut hey, I guess all that really matters is doing the same thing you did with Cass, throwing enough numbers at a complete trash rework until your idiot player base shuts up. Nobody is under any illusion that anyone in your shit balance team has any intention of making Veigar a viable champion, because if you did you wouldn't have touched him immediately after he started being picked to counter mobility creep.","replies":[{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2015-03-04T07:16:37.306+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"You don't know what counterplay is if you said Veigar had good counterplay, or more than Lee Sin and Zed.\n\nAgainst a Veigar this was how it was before. You walk around too close to Veigar, suddenly you are stunned, with pretty much no time to react. While you are stunned you get hit by a bunch of nukes and die.\n\nYou HAD to have a cleansing mechanic. There was no dodging involved, or anything like that. You just kept out of his way and had to have a cleanse ready, and enough defensive stats to survive his ulti+Q.\n\nLee Sin is NOT the epitome of counterplay, but to engage he at least need to hit his Q.\n\nZed have great counterplay, he is heavily skillshot based, his ulti have lots of things that can be done to it, and he shadows is predictable so you can play around them.

By doing so, I'd be able to stun them as they ran into it; this was great for chasing enemies down.

There is merit in counter play, don't get me wrong, but I feel that as of late, riot is putting too much focus on it at the expense of cohesion and the player's ability to think outside the box.\n\nIf a player's response to any champ the enemy picks is, \"just dodge what he throws out and I'll be good, then you've got a problem. There need to be more factors than just \"get better at dodging stuff\"\n\nI firmly believe that a healthy does of instant cc is necessary for game health, provided there are counter measures players can take to negate or abate it. At present, league has several tools to do just that: tenacity, to reduce the duration; banshee's, to negate it entirely; and qss, mikaels, and cleanse, to remove it if applied.\n\n\"But Thryale! how can something so inherently toxic as instant cc be *healthy* for league?\"\n\nSimple really: it causes the players to approach the game differently. Variety is the spice of life, and monotony is killing league. I've played tons of games of league where it each game hardly felt any different than the last. Dodge this skill shot, land that skill shot, etc. The thing about instant cc is you can't be careless. You can't just walk around and think you'll be fine as long as you can rely on your reflexes to get you outta dodge, you need to constantly keep your opponent's position in mind and their ranges. You are now calculating what it will take to get to them or how to scare them away so that they can't use that cc when they need it.\n\nNow, that is not to say instant hard cc should become common place. Far from it. But when applied sparingly (in this case, all that comes to mind is veigar, amu, liss, fid, ram, annie, and ryze) it can be beneficial to the game to prevent players from falling into a repetitive mindset.\n\n\n....great. it's late, and my mind just went blank.
