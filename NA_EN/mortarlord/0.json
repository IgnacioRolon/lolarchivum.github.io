And a few days ago i started playing it again. BUT , i have a problem, when i start playing on Fullscreen my Monitor Goes black and is keeping telling me this : \"Monitor going to sleep\" and i need to restart my PC ... But i still hear the sounds of the game. And this error happens just in LOL . I have no problems with the other games. And BTW one year ago when i first started playing LOL i had an AMD Radeon HD 4650 1 GB VRAM and i had no problem,but i needed to get this GT 420 because that AMD was overheating. So,to make the GT 420 compatible,i canged to VGA cable . And now i cant play on fullscreen .

What happens if you hit Alt+Enter during this sleep mode?  If it puts you to a windowed mode but restores the game then your settings may be the culprit.  A config reset might fix this:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nLet me know how that goes for you.","replies":[]}]}
