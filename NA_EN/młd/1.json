It started a couple days ago where I played a couple games and when I came back like 2 hours later I couldn't login anymore. I have already tried everything they told me to do in the link as well as reinstalling lol. I also tried using the Hextech Repair Tool but that didn't work either. Does anyone have any other tips that are not on the Riot website? Pls halp, I need to climb to get my challenger jacket, cuz it's freezing over here in the winter.","replies":[{"poster":"Tüna","date":"2016-10-31T19:08:02.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem!!! please help Rito.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T17:37:41.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network can't connect to the login servers.  I know you've tried some troubleshooting already, but those steps won't really resolve network issues but moreso game file problems.  Instead, I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get that fixed up.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
