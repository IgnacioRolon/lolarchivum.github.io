Now I can't figure out how to make it so when I click on the minimap, the camera goes to that place. Yes, I have tried pressing y. I also have deleted my input.ini and persisted settings. Was this feature removed or something? \r\n\r\nAlso, unrelated but how do I make my team icons go from the left of the screen to above the minimap like it used to be?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T22:14:48.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minimap movement is an option that can be toggled in-game via the interface options.  You will see an option to uncheck, \"Allow Minimap Movement.\"\n\nSimilarly to your other question, champion portraits can be moved via the interface options.  It's not necessary to delete files or modify them, as that can actually cause you more issues than solve.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"MłD","date":"2016-08-05T14:58:15.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I fixed the champ portraits part. But the \"Allow Minimap Movement\" option simply allows me to right click on minimap to move there. It does not affect whether or not I can move my camera there.
