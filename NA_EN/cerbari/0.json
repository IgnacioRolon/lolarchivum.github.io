We have so many regions and civilisations that it is sometimes confusing as what happened first.\r\nFor example, were the watchers in freljord trapped in the howling abyss before the ruination of the shadow isles?\r\nSo after reading here on the board, that it was confirmed, that shurimas fall, the darkin wars, and the rune wars happened in that order. I wanted to make a bigger timeline. I started to search for glues in the different Storys on the universe page, that say when something took place.\r\nWith that Information i created my own timeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n- shurima founding (my starting point) \r\n- aurelion visits runterra again (he saw the construction of the sundisc in his Story)\r\n- Doom of Icathia (since Setaka died on the eve of Icathias Doom and Setaka was ascended) \r\n- great void war (guess, but it is a probable reason that the doom of icathia was the reason) \r\n- creation of vastaya (&quot;The vastaya&rsquo;s origins can be traced back to a hidden corner of Ionia where a group of humans fled in escape of the Great Void War.&quot;)\r\n- fall of shurima (millenia ago) \r\n- darkin wars (after fall of shurima confirmed boards)\r\n- Morde gets his empire (in his bio its said that he has existed for countless centuries) \r\n- Morde falls \r\n- the freljordians are enslaved by the Watchers (in lyissandras lore it happened centuries ago) \r\n- watchers are defeated (lissandra said it happened Generations ago) \r\n- Noxus founding (confirmed after fall of Morde) \r\n- Rune wars (after darkin wars confirmed board) \r\n- Demacia founding (confirmed after rune wars in Galios bio) \r\n- Ruination of the blessed isles (~100 years ago, confirmed by Yoricks short story) \r\n- Rise of Shurima \r\n\r\n\r\nWould be nice if you guys could Point out any mistakes i may have made, or help me expand the timeline. \r\nOr if an official Rioter could confirm if it&#039;s accurate or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-12-09T00:35:43.514+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok!

But I have issues with the idea that Darkin War is between Shurima's fall and Rune Wars. I know it's basically set by the few instances recently mentioned by Rioters on the boards but some thing don't add up.\n\nThat being Varus' knowledge of it mainly. He mentions that not only was Shurima a wasteland (which doesn't mean a ruin, wasteland means nothing, meaning it might have been jut a desert so Darkin War long before Shurima even rose up) last he remembers but more importantly, people don't know what a Darkin is or that they 'all but destroyed this world' (Varus words). Why don't people know what Darkin's are? The guy writing about Vastayans and eyeing up Ahri mentioned that the Darkin were sentient weapons, not an entire race of invading near immortal beings that killed thousands. Is it so easily forgettable of a war? We, as humans, have on record nearly every major battle for the last 2000 years, some earlier through documentation. Did Runeterran's not document the Darkin War? \n\nYet they remember Shurima, quite well it seems. Seems out of place.\n\n\nAlso, as Brand is mentioned in the Shurima lore, yet he has a World Rune it means world runes were known about long before the Rune Wars. \n\n\nAnother thing, wasn't Aurelion Sol's story set recently? More recent that Shurima's sun disc was first constructed?  (as in after Azir arose) I might have misunderstood it but he closed a void breach and killed a Pantheon, meaning the other Aspects left over from the dead Targon Empire took notice and were to return to Runeterra because their grip on him was subsiding? No. Probably took that story all wrong.\n\n\nJust some thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"cerbari","date":"2017-12-10T20:48:16.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Antergaton,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ZmsIsYfy,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-12-10T19:32:48.731+0000)\n>\n> I really like the whole theory of the timeline of the lore of LoL.

In nasus lore i believe he said that after the sundisc had no more Magic the oasis ran try and thus turning shurima back into a wasteland/Dessert.\nalso People still remember the darkin, its just more like a myth.\nIn shurima lore fiery Spirit is mentioned i dont know if its confirmed as brand.\n\nAnd finally Aurelion saw slave worker constructing the sundisc so it was definitly not azirs Ascension.\n\nI hope i could help you ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2017-12-10T23:18:35.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfect, that cleared a lot up. So Varus meant just the main city, not the rest of Shurima because of the magic involved in Oasis of Dawn. Shurima stuff and Sol sorted. :)\n\nThe whole Darkin thing I still don't get. 1066 is not a myth in British history, it happened, we have it documented. The Black Death did wiped out 50% of European population yet we all know about, no one thinks it's a myth. If the Darkin were that big of a deal it wouldn't be a myth. But alas, this is just my issue with the way it's told....and me being picky. :P\n\nThanks regardless.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Necrozard","date":"2017-12-10T16:05:13.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3348}} :Poro:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-12-09T13:40:14.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought the Watchers were before the Fall of Shurima","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celebrimborr","date":"2017-12-09T01:57:55.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where is people getting all this void information on","replies":[]}]}
