Good times were had, but nothing lasts forever ya know?\n\nMy favorite zone was Valley of the Four Winds. It had everything! The zone had settings for where the panda's worked, slept, ate and trained. It gave you a career track, complete with a personal student after you became a head chef. It even gave you your own plot of land to build up a home, complete with elements of Harvest moon/ Animal Crossing on friendships and home/ garden customization","replies":[{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-05-17T20:40:46.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I quit soon after he left too.

We all bought Flag of Ownership cards and would run around zerging BG's between raids and such, dropping our flags in unison. \n\nThings ended on a sour note in the end, but I still have my Flag of Ownership \" Owned\" Card on the shelf in honor of the good times. Now that we've all gone our separate ways, It feels like a treasured Piece of the Tri...Quadra-Force we once were \n\n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-05-17T21:01:25.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, I can't say I have any interesting stories like that.
