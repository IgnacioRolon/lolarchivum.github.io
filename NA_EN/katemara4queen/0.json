How many hours did we invest in those account and how much money did we put. I know i have over 100$ spread out on 2 accounts and I also know someone thats has over 1000$ spent on his. \r\n\r\nMy first point is that Im down to my 7th or 8th account. That should tell you something. If words hurt the community so much ( and I agree, im not trying to excuse my actions) Why no just ban those words. Forever. Freedom isnt a good reason because Riot is certainly taking that away by banning the account. Just effin block the words and any derivation. Cant be that hard. \"In this community we do not accept the use of offensive language and hurtful words, therefor any sentences contain anything that uses will be blocked\" yady yada. You get the jist. You went into such lenght to make a \"system\" to \"purge\" the salt and 9 season later... Im still getting banned. Imagine if I couldnt use any bitching... I wouldnt even bother xD\r\n\r\nMy second point is that fine you want to leave it up to us to be nice or not. I can get behind that. But our accounts shouldnt be banned forever. The YEARSSSSSSSSSS and the amount of stuff I have on my very first account are \"!lost forever\"? I dont see any reason to behave because my main \"loot\" is gone foever. But, on the other hand, if you did like CS 1.6 did back in the days, when someone got caught hacking, account would get banned for 1 year. HELL YES if had access back to my main and first stuff now after being banned for so long I wouldnt want to lose it again. I would make sure to stay in check or  else I know its going to be a long time before I get back and be stuck with that small account with hardly anything on it. The things the way they are right now, If I get banned well screw it, ill just get stuck with an other small account, sucks but hey no real reason not to bitch at those noobs since im stuck with them for 3 months.\r\n\r\nSo basically I feel like Riot has been incompetent in managing the issues and are trying to rob us and trick us in rebuying the stuff we had. I find the situation unfair and I hope that I am not the only feeling the same way. I know my attitude is the problem but I feel that either my solutions are both More Effective and More Fair in solving the issues.\r\n\r\nAnyways\r\nGFHL fellas","replies":[{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2019-03-02T20:07:01.653+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"so... in other words... you live in a world where you don't think that taking responsability for one's actions is a thing that needs reflecting on because you'd much rather blame riot for having rules you can't bother obeying than actually obeying them\n\ncool\n\n>My first point is that Im down to my 7th or 8th account.

How many hours did we invest in those account and how much money did we put.\n\n It's not robbing people. Legally it isn't because we agreed to the TOS which says we don't actually _own_ anything on our accounts, we just 'rent them' from Riot essentially. Morally (?) it isn't because spending money shouldn't give you a free pass to act like a jerk.  \n\n Hours and time being invested doesn't change anything.

Freedom isnt a good reason because Riot is certainly taking that away by banning the account. Just effin block the words and any derivation.

If they get very strict with the system, innocent players can get punished and it impedes on their account health. If they become too lenient, flamers and griefers run rampant. \n\n Banning \"fuck\" doesn't stop me from saying \"you're freaking trash, uninstall\" or:\n\n\"you're f.ucking trash\"\n\"you're fking trash\"\n\"you're fvcking trash\"\n\nSee what I'm getting at? \n\n> Im still getting banned. Imagine if I couldnt use any bitching... I wouldnt even bother xD\n\n That sounds like a personal issue. If you can't enjoy a game or get your point across without swearing or flaming indiscriminately, Riot isn't at fault for that and they've made it clear they don't want that behavior in their game.\n\n>But our accounts shouldnt be banned forever. The YEARSSSSSSSSSS and the amount of stuff I have on my very first account are \"!lost forever\"? I dont see any reason to behave because my main \"loot\" is gone foever.\n\n It _should_ make you look at yourself and say:\n\n\"Hey, why was I punished? I guess my behavior wasn't acceptable and if I want to keep playing the game, my summoner name, and all of my acquired loot, I need to change my act.\"\n\n Whether or not you can actually do that isn't Riot's responsibility. A line has to be drawn somewhere.\n\n>But, on the other hand, if you did like CS 1.6 did back in the days, when someone got caught hacking, account would get banned for 1 year. HELL YES if had access back to my main and first stuff now after being banned for so long I wouldnt want to lose it again. \n\n Not sure how Counter-Strike compares to this. Steam bans the account that's linked to the ID, meaning you have to purchase the game again just to cheat or wait an entire year just to get banned again.\n\n You most likely had multiple chances on your main account before it got permanently banned and you had access to information surrounding the punishment ladder. Why not just take action then instead of taking issue now?\n\n>The things the way they are right now, If I get banned well screw it, ill just get stuck with an other small account, sucks but hey no real reason not to bitch at those noobs since im stuck with them for 3 months.\n\n This train of thought is so backwards. If you're complaining about being \"stuck with another account\" or being \"stuck with noobs\"\n\n_Just stop getting your accounts banned?_ \n\n That's one reason right there. You have to level an account up to level 30 which takes time, risk getting punished and losing _that_ effort along the way, and lose any content you may have unlocked along the way such as skins or icons. 3 solid reasons for changing your behavior.\n\n> I know my attitude is the problem \n\n Yes.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n# For what it's worth -\n\n I do think that players should have the ability to appeal a permanent ban (in my mind it should be called an \"indefinite ban\") if they show massive, consistent reform.\n\n I'd like to see something along the lines of:\n\n  \"If your account has been indefinitely suspended, there is only one way to recover it. Through consistent, positive action on a new account it will be possible to repent for your actions so long as the following conditions are met.\"\n\n* The account _must_ be level 30 or above in addition to having 500+ games played on it.\n\n* The account _must_ reach Honor 3, 4, or 5 and hold that level for the duration listed above.\n\n* Afterwards, an appeal can be filed displaying evidence of your reform. **Accounts banned for zero tolerance phrases (such as racism, homophobia, or other derogatory language) are not eligible for this program. **","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-03-02T20:17:40.751+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I choose option 3. \"Learn to control yourself\".\n\nRiot isn't the first nor last game, especially free to play, that will punish you by taking the stuff away.

It makes games more enjoyable in sense that the problem people are being get rid of. Also you don't own anything you buy on your account, you are essentially just given a licence to use the skin on your account. Read the ToS.\n\n> My first point is that Im down to my 7th or 8th account. That should tell you something.\n\nThat should tell you something rather. **You** are the issue, not Riot, and not others. I've played this game since the end of Season 1 and guess how many punishments I've had over the years? Zero.\n\n>  If words hurt the community so much ( and I agree, im not trying to excuse my actions) Why no just ban those words.\n\nPeople can work around using certain words. It's not about the words even, it's about **behavior**. You can be toxic without using toxic words. \n\n\n> So basically I feel like Riot has been incompetent in managing the issues and are trying to rob us and trick us in rebuying the stuff we had\n\nPermabanning isn't meant for you to start all over, it's meant to kick you out of the game. Riot doesn't want toxic people to play their game, and permaban is meant to stop them playing, rather than continue playing. You already are warned multiple times about your behavior, and even warned that the next offence is a permaban, so there is no real excuse to keep behaving badly.\n\n> I know my attitude is the problem\n\nThen do something about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2019-03-03T01:04:03.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Option 3: ignore loaded (&amp; therefore useless) poll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Original Sin","date":"2019-03-02T21:12:58.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Banning permanently an account is both ineffective and robbing people. \n\nHave you ever read the ToS?
