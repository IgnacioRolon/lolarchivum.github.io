The towers were changed so why didn&#039;t Kha&#039;Zix?\r\n- Evolved Claws now again deals  % missing health damage, regardless as to whether or not the target is isolated. \r\n~ In the patch preview for 3.8, FeralPony says the following, &quot;The problem with Taste Their Fear was that all of its evolutionary damage was based on your target being isolated and low on health but you got nothing if they weren&#039;t. We still want to reward you for catching isolated targets but we didn&#039;t want the evolution to rely on it so completely.&quot; Well fast forward to today and Taste Their Fear has gone full circle, being completely useless when evolved unless the target is completely isolated and with the nerfs to the range necessary to actually isolate a target, one might say this ability is even worse than when it started.","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2015-04-08T18:14:07.830+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot walks a fine line with Kha'Zix's evolutions. They want all of the evolutions to be viable, but not completely necessary to his kit or burst pattern. Essentially, they're bonuses that support your Kha'Zix playstyle, without there being a set 'best' evolution. Currently, they're failing at that, but it's a hard problem to solve.\n\nHard, but not impossible. These are my suggestions.\n\nBuff Taste Their Fear. The current evolve bonus should be baseline. Kha'Zix's theme is isolation? Reinforce it without requiring you evolve his claws. Evolving the claws grants the increased range, and bonus damage. This damage can be whatever. It can be execution based, it can ignore a portion of the target's armor, it could apply Unseen Threat on hit, whatever. But it adds to the isolation burst while also adding damage when the target isn't isolated.\n\nVoid Spikes is fine, but weird. I think it should be buffed to always fire three lines of spikes. Maybe nerf the slow to compensate. Evolving Void Spikes would be Evolve Venom Sacs, which makes the Void Spikes envenom the target with a psychotic void toxin, making them feel paranoid and _isolated_. This evolution would give Kha'Zix more reliability late game, but good players could function without it. It's a bonus.\n\nLeap should have it's range slightly buffed, maybe halfway between current unevolved and evolved, and have the damage nerfed. Evolving Wings would buff the range, make the damage true damage instead of physical, and allow the Leap resets. It promotes the playstyle of, get in, kill, get out.\n\nHis ultimate is really good the way it is. Evolving it should promote a stealthy playstyle for sneaky Kha's that want to subvert wards. Evolve Active Camouflage no longer allows a third cast - That promotes more of a duelist playstyle where the Kha'Zix has extended, one on one fights where he benefits from Unseen Threat multiple times. Make it so that, if Kha'Zix is moving towards a bush, the stealth duration is increased infinity until he either moves in a different direction, or reaches a bush. This makes Kha'Zix a sneaky one who can subvert wards by ulting towards a bush. Even if the bush is warded, he won't be spotted until he's in it already. And then he can cast Void Assault a second time for the ambush.\n\nJust my ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"grLKQ9ma0o","date":"2015-04-10T14:01:10.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like most of this, but the issue I see is that he still lacks the amount of reliability that every other AD assassin has. Hitting someone with W shouldn't make them isolated. The problem is the lack of counterplay that results from that situation.\n\nInstead of making them instantly isolated, what if hitting a champion with void spikes decreased the isolation radius by 100-150? That gives it counterplay by still sticking with your team, but also opens more windows for playmaking.\n\nAdditionally, I think isolation Q should be calculated on cast, not on hit. If this were the case, you would know for sure when you were getting isolation damage, as opposed to the BS where you hit them while they flash into their team and you do like 1/3 the damage you thought you would. That would make it easier to actually calculate whether you can get the reset or not.\n\nAs for the evolved ultimate, I think that's a good start, but it's still not worth evolving it. The evolved R is tricky because you want the evolution to actually enhance his stealth gameplay, but if you choose the stealth over another ability, it doesn't actually give you any snowball potential. \n\nWith only 3 evolutions in a normal game, the easiest evolution to drop given your solution is and always will be evolved R. It just doesn't help the kit. Q damage is necessary. W's easier isolation is incredibly valuable. E's resets are a necessity. Being invisible for longer is not important compared to those abilities. It just isn't. No matter what, you can always do without. Either through increased vision control and sweepers, or outplaying the opponent, you just don't need it. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\nEvolved R: Gives increased movement speed of 80% instead of 40%, and bonus % AD per rank of R of 4/8/12%. If not bonus AD, maybe damage amplification against the first champion he attacks out of stealth of a similar value. For me, that makes it actually worth something. It promotes him as a stealthy killer, and it might actually be worth getting instead of one of the other evolved abilities. It forces the choice. Do I get easier isolation? Do I get moar damages? Do I get reliable stealth with damage for ganks and assassination ability? Do I get the invaluable reset? That's actually a tough enough choice that wouldn't always follow the same evolution cycle every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HailFire Dragon","date":"2015-04-09T15:40:12.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELL YES on your evolved void spike idea","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-04-08T14:29:22.564+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Riot balance team's logic at his finest.\n\nOn release it only affected isolated targets.

You'll note Meddler says he doesn't know an ETA and they're \"planning to look at, see *if* there's potential buffs they can give him.\"\n\nThat not only puts them even *examining* him up in the air, but the idea of buffs once/if they do look at him up in the air as well.\n\nRiot is actually fairly aware of balance-states of champions. It all comes down to what champions they like and what champions they don't, and that's a fact they've proven over and over and over and over during the last 4 seasons. They don't like Kha'zix much (if essentially reworking him through sheer number of nerfs is any indicator). Therefore, even if he *does* get buffs, they probably will have very, very little impact, so they can say \"yeah we buffed him so he's fine now\" even if he's still in a really crappy state afterwards.\n\nNot to mention, they have little-to-no respect whatsoever for preserving a champion's design and character vision. The Casseiopeia fiasco, which Cass mains (at least, every one I know and every one I see on the forums) are *still* feeling completely shit on by Riot about, is evidence of this. They don't care about the preserving the *character* and design direction of the champion, they just care about the champion's balance state. It doesn't help any that despite Kha'Zix players being able and willing to provide every possible suggestion and bit of feedback Riot needs about the champion, Riot still refuses to respect the champion or listen to his players (remember how Bruiser Kha'zix happened?). \n\nI apologize for the salt, I'm just *still* incredibly infuriated by how ridiculously they handled the champion and where they left him. They learned absolutely nothing from how they handled Shaco years ago: Dumpster the assassin, force a completely different playstyle, then leave them in obscurity.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Visigoth","date":"2015-04-08T13:08:33.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh I just want the execute back.

Once you get rangers trailblazer+ tiamat you are fine, but just killing three camps leaves you at 100-300 health (if you start gromp, which is highly recommended). Even then, you only have enough gold for the trailblazer.

His sustain is rather bad due to the heal being a AP ration with a 10 second CD, and his Q does very little unless you kill the smaller minions first (which results in a ton of damage taken) or finish Hydra. If you catch someone out with your Q evolved, they will usually die.
