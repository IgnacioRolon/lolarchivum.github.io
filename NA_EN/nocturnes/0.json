It has no scaling, he has no AA reset, and he has one of the lowest attack speeds in the game. He will only get 2 attacks off in 5 seconds. Mundo's only option is to build tank because he doesn't do well building anything else.\n\n1 Total AD + 199 (at 1% health)\n\nYorick gets an AA reset which can be done in less than 1 sec. \n1 Total AD + 1.2 Total AD + 150 + [40  + 35% Total AD (per hit by ghoul)]\n\nMundo gets a 35% speed boost when he ults. Yorick gets a 35% speed boost by pressing Q. The duration is 5 seconds, his cooldown is 5 sec with no CDR. Meaning he can ALWAYS have his speed boost up and AA reset often versus Mundo's 7 second CD.\n\nMundo's Slow is 40% and last 2 seconds, dealing 280 dmg to a single person, but does scale if versus tanks.\nYorick has a 40% AoE slow, lasts 1.5 secs, and whenever his ghoul (40 + 35% AD dmg per hit) attacks, it also slows for 5 seconds. It also gives sight.\n\nYes Mundo is a better tank, that's what he does. But his damage is not scary. The only scary thing about Mundo is that if he lands a slow on you, you might be stuck fighting him. He has CC mitigation but no damage mitigation, so he still suffers horribly to ADC.\n\nYorick gets 20% damage reduction, technically has 4 damage abilities, and heals 40% of all damage his E ever does whether it be immediately or sustained. Yorick can fight an ADC with his burst (since honestly they will always win a long duration trade).\n\n**In 1 Second, spam blasting his ghouls.

He does 59% as much damage, and his sustained damage is mainly his W with an AP scaling, while Yorick's is 105% Total AD + 40 per second. Yorick is very scary.

Also when you have a Yorick in lane, all of those champs you listed will be starved, minus maybe Irelia, so that he's always at an advantage anyway. He can 1v1 all of them (except mega gnar).

If he lands one enhanced w on you you just lost the trade by about 3x the damage output seeing as renekton enhanced w does 200 damage at level 1. Q's every time you spam ghouls for free health and after he gets 3 points in q he insta kill your ghouls with one q and an ad item. Reneks ult is much much more useful in team fights. Ive done 1800 magic damage just by standing in a teamfight and it allows you to soak up damage for your team. yorick depending on how he uses it can be more useful but yorick doesnt have a 700 damage nuke stun on a 5.5 sec cooldown.\n\nNasus- I have never gotten more stacks as nasus then i have vs a yorick. I am a nasus main and i can tell you yorick stands 0 chance vs nasus after level 6. Nasus will rush frozen heart and his q will be on a 3 sec cooldown and your abilities will do nothing to him afterthat. He can q the minion you hit him with a ghoul and his cooldown is low enough that he can q the ghoul. i very rarely have over 400 stacks walking out of lane at 20 min but yorick is one of the few i can do it against. Also yorick is notorious for having a garbage late game, whereas nasus wil lbe one shotting your team as he laughs at you and your ghouls doing no damage to him.\n\nDarius- This is the funniest one of all of the ones you posted. Yorick E range= 550 Darius e range=550 plus a little extra its well know that it is more like 600 as i have hit people well outside the range many times ( darius is my 2nd most played champion) so every single time you try to e him you are within pull range. With no escape.... against darius... lol your damage output is no where near darius's. Also if you have 4 ghouls out and he ults you with 5 stacks, with a tiamat it will do 647 true damage or in yoricks case 517 true damage. You are getting dunked regardless. Unless you plan on going ap yorick and only harrassing with your w, you lose as he will pull you every single time you try and harras with e and you have no escape.\n\nCho- Dont even try with this one, cho destroys yorick soundly. you are basically providing cho with free farm and stacks for his ult by using ghouls, you are better off using them to cs. Also, cho's team fight makes yorick look like a caster minion.\n\nTrundle- 12 health per ghoul plus 18 health for every minion and 26 for cannon minions thats 170 per wave. You will go oom trying to push him out of lane. Especially when he backs for the first time and buys a vamp scepter.\n\nAlso, my yorick play has nothing to do with yorick in general. I dont take ranked very seriously. If you dont believe me look at all of my builds. mostly every game i play darius i go full ad no tank. Hell ive even gone full ad nasus a couple of times. i build glass cannon on everyone. I like normals much more than ranked. I do try to win but i don't take it extremely seriously.\n\nYou are arguing for a lost cause. There is a reason no one plays yorick and no one in lcs evre plays him. Hes just not good. He can't even fill his one identity well and thats a lane bully. The same thing happened to urgot. Lane bully identity got destroyed by tanky supports with tons of cc. Yorick in season 1 and 2 used to be able to destroy people top but now he just can't. There are way to many top laners that do his lane bully job much better and team fight better than him which is his biggest weakness. Top laners like irelia darius renekton nasus. When i play and when most people play they are more scared of getting darius or renekton than yorick. Darius in my opinion is the biggest lane bully for top. Period. Every time you go for cs you lose half your health bar. not to mention his level 6 powerspike is the highest in the game as he gets kill potential on anyone in the game. Yorick is fun to play but if im playing to win, im not picking him","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-06-23T19:09:03.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unicorns of love played him in a Cassiopeia comp.
