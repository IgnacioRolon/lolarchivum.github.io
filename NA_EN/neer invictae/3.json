Most of the time teamfights will me cramped, which gives Karthus an edge, since his e does massive damage, and even if you die you can continue doing a good deal of damage.\n\nAlso, if the enemy is killing Ascended Xerath you  should dive in as Karthus. You will probably die, but that's the trick. Even when your dead (your passive death) you can steal ascension from them. And if you do you are miraculously (through a bug most likely) reborn on the spot. Most wouldn't know about this, so you can easily use it to your advantage. An Ascendent {{champion:30}} is nothing to laugh at, since no mana costs means you can continuously spam your q and have your e toggled on.\n\nMy first 3 games were all won with Karthus. If someone's interested here was my build: \n\n{{item:3029}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3090}}{{item:3151}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-09-11T12:49:18.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intended.

Usually an Ascension on her last for a good amount of time.\n{{champion:143}}  is my favourite pick: you can snare and poke behind walls, plus she can grant vision and can steal xerath/distrupt the enemy team while they are doing it\n{{champion:45}}  it is a risky champion that needs some kills in order to work properly, and a match where you only tf is a feast for his magic! His E is distruptive in narrow passages, that are plentyful in this mode.\n\nThere are also some othe rcases but i have not tried them, just remember that diving between walls can isolate you from the party.\n\nPlus if you pick champions that can grant vision for some time in bushes you can check and threath enemy champions while securing objectives\n{{champion:61}}  She is a bit compromised, but can make a good and lasting use for her ball, other than beign a good champion overall for this mode.\n{{champion:99}}  as i said she is godlike, and with her Q she can distrupt and reveal enemies in bushes\n{{champion:143}}  again her, she can plant seeds and grow plants in order to check points. Most useful while doing Xerath because she can reval incoming champions\n\nThere are more other cases i guess, but these are my esperience .
