The textures of these poros are the same as they were right before snowdown and then Riot updated the poros on howling abyss to look much more smooth, however they never updated winter wonder Orianna's poros. I was hoping they could get this done as the poros as of now look  very misplaced on the new SR and next to the Howling Abyss poros too.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-06T22:30:22.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh!

Thanks! :D\n\nIt's really awesome when a Rioter takes time out of their day to look in on silly stuff like this for players","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raja Chachki","date":"2015-02-06T02:04:34.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"never going to happen. It's a legacy skin, that kinda sucks but they'll only update it if thousands upon thousands of people scream about it.","replies":[{"poster":"AtlasHive","date":"2015-02-06T03:00:29.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"then lets all scream about it","replies":[]}]}]}
