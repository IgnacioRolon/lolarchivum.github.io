Don't give them reason to be legitimate reports and you'll be fine. Mass reporting also doesn't hurt you any more than a single report does; punishment is calculated per match, not per report.

And the results just look bad. Like... real bad. I understand your point of playing whichever champ you want, but there are certain roles that just let them make work better. Supports want either heavy cc and tank stats, or plain range and poke power. Kat has none of these, thus making her not the best pick for support.. I really don't mind creativity in this game, I carried as Support Jayce a long time ago, and I had an astonishing Support J4 in my latest game, who caused havoc all above the opponent. But you should really consider working within the border of a Champions pool of capabilities, rather than spinning a wheel and see what happens. People out there might (obviously) have problems with picks that are THAT much off their usual playground..\n\nAnd to be honest, ever since TeamBuilder died, I use my Normals for some real stupid stuff as well every once in a while.

If it wasn't blind pick it doesn't really matter what you called, as roles are assigned.\n\nAs for their behavior just mute them.  As far as the punishment system is concerned there is only one game where you were reported.  The number of reports per game, from what I've seen at least, doesn't seem to matter.  You would need a few more games where you are reported to even show up on the system's radar, and even then it likely would see that the reports are false.\n\nIf you ever do get wrongly punished just come on the boards here, go to the Help & Support section, and under Guidelines on the left hand side click on \"submit a ticket\".  It's not in a great spot, but it's a highlighted link under Culture.  Just fill out the ticket as best you can, fill in anything that doesn't really apply with the closest answer available, and things should be handled for you.
