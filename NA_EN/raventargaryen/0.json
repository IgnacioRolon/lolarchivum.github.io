The client doesn't pop up. Opened Activity Monitor and shows UserKernel is not responding. I usually have to force quit it and then start it again multiple times before the client finally appears. Sometimes, I just let the logo stay there and then after like 2-3 minutes, the client window appears. But, UseKernel is always not responding. Reinstalled the game 4 times now but it keeps doing it. I started using the updated client but same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T03:43:28.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It certainly sounds like there is either a permissions issue or a connection inconsistency happening.
