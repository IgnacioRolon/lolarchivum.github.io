Thankfully for me, every time I restart the patcher I have to go through a file scan process consisting of about seven thousand files that works at a snails pace, totaling 30 or 40 minutes before I can even *attempt* to download the actual patch again. Needless to say I love it when riot updates their game. It's not frustrating at all!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZemoVIII","date":"2014-11-06T04:55:35.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nevermind. It froze again and stop. So I uninstalled the whole thing and installed it and then realized its riots servers it just wont download. So I guess ill wait it out till tomorrow.

I'd say let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before closing it and giving up on it. If you're still having issues getting your patch to complete, check out some of the [troubleshooting steps found in the knowledge base](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!","replies":[{"poster":"ZemoVIII","date":"2014-11-06T03:02:49.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey there, thanks for bringing your issue to the Help and Support boards!\n> \n> It's normal for your patcher to drop to 0 Kbps download speed sometimes, because there are some parts of the patching process that don't require active downloads.
