Be wary and use at your own risk!\n\nAre you guys going to give out warnings (instead of permabans) if your stance on certain programs change?\n\nAfter joining the modding community I realized most League mods are coded by high school kids, so malicious content is actually a huge risk (kids are dumb, and \"fuck everyone, here's a virus\" is actually a thing they might do in an update to their program). That's also why a lot of the programs get abandoned - they're made by students who move on to bigger, better things.\n\nI was also wondering if you ever plan to solve this in the future by being more open about your packages and proprietary filetypes. The way you **_intentionally_** make it hard to mod League drives away actual experienced professional programmers (like me) because it's not worth their time to learn. This is part of the reason why the modding community is just a bunch of ragtag hobbyist kids testing their skills (and I have to trust their programs instead of making my own).\n\n\"But That Evelynn, you could always just not use mods!\" - mods are the only way to mute unneeded sounds in the game that I don't like (specifically, the noisy HUD, eg: the \"cannot cast that skill right now\" noise, which actually hurts my ears and drives me insane).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Op Two","date":"2017-05-31T21:44:28.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SOOOOO IF SOMEONE HAS SPEND ALMOST A 1000 EUROS ON SKINS IN LOL HIS GONNA GET A BAN?

It was your choice to spend. You could play lol for free. When you created your account you agreed on those terms. You won't get your money back riot does not own you anything. And you have no legal grounds to fight them. \n\nAnd yes I do agree that riot needs to put out warnings. Riot needs to raise attention to the subject matter before banning.","replies":[]}]}]}
