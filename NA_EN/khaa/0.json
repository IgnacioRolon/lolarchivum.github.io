There are too many toons in this game that are basically unstoppable with yummi in the game. I know you can ban but there's always another needing a ban. Mordakaiser with yummi on the shoulder is unstoppable. I just had the worst game with this combo and it was -0000000 fun. Remember when they said this was a team game.  Yummi needs to be targetable or at least forced to leave the sholder of player after so much time if she doesnt go in and out. You should not be able to just afk and wait to press your ulti every-time its up. Balance is needed, these 2 especially yummi have wrecked ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Smurfraka","date":"2019-06-12T23:36:16.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"toons\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2019-06-12T23:24:06.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yuumi was meant for people who want to just afk and watch the game,aka mobile gamers playing on PC lmfao.
