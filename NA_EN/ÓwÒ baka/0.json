Shortly after the suspension, I unlocked the honor again. It felt like I was making progress, I'm honored quite a lot after my matches. It's been months, and I've waited for my account to even just hit honor level 1, after constant honors. I don't type in my games, I don't feed, I don't AFK or Grief. I have no idea why my honor level isn't rising. I've gotten an account to Honor 5 without typing at all (not literally, but I RARELY typed) but once you get hit level 0 honor, it's impossible to make any progress. I made a mistake and was toxic because I was on a loss streak due to people inting and afking, I got suspended, ok that's fine. But to make it near impossible to make progress after that is unfair. Me and some friends want to put together a team on League to compete, have fun, and try and improve, but it requires at least Honor level 2. Why is it so hard to gain honor, and what can I do to gain it faster? The system seems very broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T22:40:38.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you have been playing a lot of games and might be getting a lot of honors, keeping up the same type of chat behavior that warranted the punishment in the first place will often slow your progress since the main issue is still going on. You need to show consistent improvement on whatever got the account punished to start rising up the honor ranks again. \n\nIf you're not sure what's been holding your progress back chat-wise, reach out to the player behavior agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can go over your account with you.","replies":[]}]}
