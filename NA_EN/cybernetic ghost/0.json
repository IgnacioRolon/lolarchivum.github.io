Played 3 games today and noticed a definite increase to around 73-75 ping. This is still pretty good for me so I can&#039;t complain.  So I&#039;m curious...how did your ping change in North America?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s help Riot out by giving them this feedback. Post here if you notice a difference and state by how much your ping has changed.","replies":[]}
