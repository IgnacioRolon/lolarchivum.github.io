In the others, you bought Bilgewater items but lost :(\n\nIf you win another game with a Bilgewater item, you should proceed through the objective. \n\nThe objectives are achieved sequentially, so when you finish objective 1 you can begin objective 2.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Cavemantero","date":"2015-08-08T00:10:57.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks.  didn't see that part of it.","replies":[]}]}]}
