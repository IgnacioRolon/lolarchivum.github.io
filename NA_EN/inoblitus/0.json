I know a friend of mine has done it, because he was reading the chat log to me while spectating the same game I was. o.o","replies":[{"poster":"Daklore","date":"2017-05-15T18:43:17.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get all chat to show up, but only all chat. I've often lamented on being able to view team chats while spectating, just because I wonder if one team is afraid of the terror of my friend's Nami, but, only all chat can be enabled for display.\n\nIf you're looking for all chat display and aren't seeing it, hit escape while in spectate, select interface then find \"Show [All] chat\" and that's about it. It shows up for me in spectate. :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-05-15T18:19:50.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I've seen it while spectating a Custom match.
