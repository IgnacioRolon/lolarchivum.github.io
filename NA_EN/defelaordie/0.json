I haven't used hack, didn't even type when I play, not even a inappropriate name. So i login to my account on league of legends and saw that I had a ticket? So i requested to look through my account again. There was a respond back saying to answer lots of questions. I answered all of them and sent it back, back the next mail was that they can't help that was it. I tried to login to my banned account again and now it shows its not a existing account, even pressed forgot password or forgot account, but to my email it doesn't come. What can i do.. If i did something and got banned then I won't even say a word, but i didn't do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-18T22:51:16.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That most likely was a suspension due to suspicious activity such as a hacker gaining access to your account or being logged into from multiple places at once frequently.\n\nThey ask a lot of questions to try and determine who the proper owner is of the account. If you can't answer the questions to prove ownership, then they generally don't unlock the account. Your only option is to continue discussing it with them in the support ticket and give them enough information to prove you are the original owner of the account.","replies":[{"poster":"DEFELAORDIE","date":"2017-09-18T22:59:28.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but i can't login to the suspended account. it shows its not an account now...i have been doing this 3 times now..","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-18T23:06:58.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone did hack into your account, they may have changed the password, and/or it may have changed regions.

We're more than happy to return the account to its original owner, but we need to be 100% that we give it back to the person who created it. Look over those questions again and do your best to answer them as far as you can remember.","replies":[{"poster":"DEFELAORDIE","date":"2017-09-21T00:43:13.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it said that it got banned forever not that the region changed.
