But sadly we cant do that. I main Wukong and hated Lee and renekton for the longest time. But then I moved on and play every single top lane champion lol.. so I dont even mind anymore. Once you learn every champion you will know every match up and every weakness of every champion, and once you got that you basically never lose top lane. If I ever lose top lane is most likely cause its my fault (picking weak champions/getting countered for picking a champion that has many counters/getting outplayed in lane/playing lane wrong), like if I am going to pick Nasus in ranked, its going to be the 4th-5th spot or I would never pick him (I also have a positive win rate on him because I only pick him into favourable matchups). So imo Darius and Garen are not even that strong. As a top lane main my problem is mainly just junglers haha.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-25T06:39:26.185+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Because he's basically pentakill bot.\n\nHis main counterplay is \"Don't go near him, and if he gets near you run away\".\n\nhint: that's not counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"HolyCrapItsMe","date":"2015-09-25T07:33:35.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wont defend darius, hes really powerful right now, but your statement is counter play, if you pass the red line at the subway and the train hits you, does that mean the train is stupid for being so dangerous? dont want to die, stay behind the freaking red line. with darius its the same, dont get into his attack range and you wont die, hes easily kitable, he gets stronger as combat goes on, so dont have prolonged fights with him.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-25T14:44:28.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which means unless you're one of 2-5 champions in the game, you can do absolutely nothing to him.\nNot counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"HolyCrapItsMe","date":"2015-09-26T16:07:25.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what about fizz? only a few champions can counter him, and its not 2-5, its any ranged champion (only 3-4 ranged champions in the game, obviously...) and any champion with dashes that can enter his circle before it lands, also only 3-4, but still more than 2-5.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-26T17:33:42.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plenty of champions can counterplay fizz. \n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:245}}{{champion:69}}{{champion:25}}   - use range to harass and then CC when he tries to all in\n{{champion:96}}{{champion:99}}{{champion:45}}{{champion:101}}{{champion:61}} {{champion:268}}{{champion:74}}   - use range to harass, bring barrier+zhonyas for his all ins.\n{{champion:76}} {{champion:84}}{{champion:7}}{{champion:55}}   -try to harass and then out burst him\n\nQuite a few of those matchups are going to depend on whether the Fizz or his opponent is better at using their respective champions, but Fizz has a very well defined weakness to harass, so pretty much every mid laner can counterplay him. \n\nThe reason Darius's \"weakness to harass\" isn't important is because he builds straight bruiser/tank. Your harass doesn't make him vulnerable the way it does to Fizz. Darius needs to either get trapped somewhere he can  get ganged up on {{champion:268}} {{champion:34}} or perma-CC'd by your whole team.

He waits for the team tank to initiate and then uses his momentum on the lowest hp target, then dunks them. He can then get all 5 stacks on every single one of your teammates. It's annoying as ****. \n\nAlso, I hate to blow resources on Darius rather than on focusing on the enemy carry. Like, if I'm going to use my stun, do I stun the enemy ADC who's doing a crap ton of damage, or do I stun Darius, who is about to dunk my midlaner and get off all the stacks onto my team. He's just too annoying to deal with. \n\nOh, and not to mention that if you do blow your resources on Darius, he'll still find the stupid person on your team and heal off of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-09-26T16:15:22.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No mobility? Well lemme just fix that with swiftness or deadman's plate!\n\nOr even a righteous glory?\n\nHis weakness is mobility, but he has avenues of completely negating that even before the rework, its just people never noticed, and its extremely easily I might add too. I've won every game as a jungler with a Darius on my team, simply because I camp his lane to get him snowballing, then I first buy righteous glory after jungler item and he has literally no problems with getting in range. \n\nThe other three teammates can all go combined 0/30 and we will still win, there is no other champion that is in a healthy state that can do that. Period.  Some people poke fun with it by describing him as becomes a Destiny Raid boss, but that's pretty much accurate.\n\nPart of his problem pre-rework was that he was all damage with no means of outputting it, and people held to that. But when the introduction of righteous glory and deadman plate came up, people still didn't notice. \n\nThen the juggernaut update came out, and people realized, he actually DOES have means of getting the damage out. He's still all damage, but now he's tanky...and now he has a freaking gargantuan heal on top of it, yes people say its situational and you need to be in the thick of a team fight to do it...but that's where Darius wants to be!\n\nAnd with the items available, he's just as mobile as the next person.
