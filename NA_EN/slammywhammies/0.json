I know when the client won't open that you can use the launcher, but that doesn't work when it's missing. \r\n\r\nI'm doing a reinstall and clean uninstall with the repair tool, but this will be the second time this month that I've had to uninstall and reinstall League. Does anyone know what could be causing this? Is it leaving league open and it disconnecting? I have no idea, but it takes hours to reinstall with my PC/connection and I cannot handle this happening on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any idea what could be making this happen or how to prevent it I would really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T02:08:58.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying the actual game files are disappearing entirely from your install folder? Leaving the client open wouldn't do that, and the game isn't designed to simply uninstall on its own. You might be able to just run a quick repair to recover the launcher files, but I'd also consider closing out of League and making sure your pc is locked when not in use (it almost sounds like someone might be deleting those files).\n\nEDIT: Also check out your antivirus. I just had a thought that maybe, somehow, for some REALLY weird reason your antivirus might be deleting those files mistakenly.","replies":[]}]}
