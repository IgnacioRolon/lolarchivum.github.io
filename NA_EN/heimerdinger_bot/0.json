I actually have a post I made about a week ago comparing Old and New Sej and detailing how they basically deleted Old Sej from the game that you might be interested in. I've tried again and again to make New Sej work for me but the difference in playstyles is unfortunately almost too much to handle. I do think with the right tweaks Riot could change Sej into having a playstyle more similar to her old kit while keeping aspects of her new kit that New Sej players have come to love; this rework idea posted over on the Sejuanimains subreddit is really good IMO and would blend her old and new kits into one, hopefully, fair, balanced, and fun kit https://www.reddit.com/r/sejuanimains/comments/9dahy7/my_idea_for_sej_rework/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mega Annie X","date":"2018-10-25T21:57:14.046+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"revert the champ so i can get my ap sej back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marothennan","date":"2018-10-25T19:30:38.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"And how is that a bad thing?

Sure roles overlap and their purposes can be similar, but the way they work and do their job can vastly differ. Volibear, Skarner, and Rammus are all disruptors/tanks with CC and damage. They run into teamfights, pick somebody off with a decent focused amount of damage, throwing the enemy team off their balance. Possibly stopping a carry from doing their job, causing other champions to become distracted while others engage. However, they all differ. Volibear you have to work out getting too close to him and being thrown off, he can move to your backline swiftly and he will take lots of damage. Skarner is similar, but he may decide to grab a tank and run off with them, even though it was only a tank, you can quickly lose a fight as your team disperses and falls apart, but he may also decide to provide constant CC with his E and distract carries and tanks alike. Rammus can help hunt down enemies quickly, but is not so good in fights as he can be blocked, but he still provides taunts and decent AoE.\n\nI don't think many champions are similar like this, they all have key parts of their kit that make them special for their own purpose and especially their own matchups. However, even in situations like this where champions are similar in style, they have plenty of minute details and styles that make them special.\n\nRegardless of all of that, even if champions are similar, I at least rather see someone different most every game considering the size of the rooster. Seeing the same 3 ADCs, junglers, top laners, supports, mid laners, etc. is desensitizing. And it starts to feel like every match plays out like the previous one. Having a balanced rooster would add more flavor to this game. I miss the old days of playing against a different champion and having to think about what to do to win lane or a fight. Now though, I see Lucian/Jhin/Kai'sai for the 10th time in a row and I've decided before the game even starts that me and my adc will be farming under tower because that's our best bet.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-10-26T21:33:08.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"if the 3 of those are all good at the same time then skarner is the best just about every time \n\nchampions need to have more different designs from each other if you want the game to be anything except shuffling out who's good enough to be worth picking every few months","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marothennan","date":"2018-10-26T05:48:02.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes all champs should be balanced, but that doesn't happen as you can see.

According to lolalytics.com, Sejuani sits at a 54.5% winrate in Master+ while if you look at the next lowest skill level of Diamond+ she already drops to 44.3% winrate. That drop is huge and indicates that even with a bit less coordination, Sejuani's impact on the game drops dramatically. Sej is just so gated by the need to have a reliable team that she feels terrible to play in solo queue and she needs some fundamental kit changes so that she is able to do things on her own easier and isn't broken with a coordinated team.","replies":[{"poster":"Frostfel","date":"2018-10-26T01:39:34.455+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sej is a team oriented champ, there is no getting around that.

He pays for that by being extremely easy to kite, able to simply walk out of his ult, and having really no way to chase any mobile target.\n\nIt's not even all tanks that are bad against him, HP stacking ones instead of armor or magic resist do just fine.  There are also more than a couple of bruisers who can give him trouble including Udyr.\n\nI know I know... you probably have heard all this before, but I like Trundle and he goes through a roller coaster ride of nerfs/buffs every season.

When I see people get frustrated about Trundle you are really talking about all the same things Nasus can do, but no one is turning around to say how frustrating Nasus is despite having stronger sustain with Q, a gigantic slow, and an ult which makes anyone unable to duel him 1v1.
