So many that I wouldn't even classify riot as greedy, rather a business just making business decisions.\n\nTake a look at the pharmaceutical industry or the oil industry or the beauty products industry.  Way more companies have done way worse things to make money.  Remember that whole thing with valeant jacking up their prices by 5000% on life sustaining mandatory drugs?  Or any other amount of price inflation in the drug industry that is currently taking place.  \n\nOn a side note, Ranked has never been purely about solo skill.  It has been said multiple times that this is a team game and they your ability to cooperate and work together with team mates is quintessential to winning games.\n\nAlso how did dynamic que make them more money than solo que?  I mean I can understand it because it helps promote the team aspect and playing with friends part of the game, thus making the game last longer and in the long run making more money but you seem to think that they chose it purely due to the money (which I remind you isn't making any quick money but rather it's a long term investment so they have almost no data right now as to whether it was a profitable decision or not).\n\nOn the topic of lying to the customer.  I agree with you here, I am not as outraged as you but the way they handled the release of dynamic que and subsequent cancel of solo que could have been handled better and resulted in less outrage.  If they had simply not promised solo que back in the first place then this latest update that it isn't coming back wouldn't have lit a new flame under some peoples butts.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeeCuz","date":"2016-06-01T14:42:11.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a particularly fruitful position to take, and unlikely to be the one chosen by Riot.\n\nThe player population is the source of income, and so the more players the more income.
