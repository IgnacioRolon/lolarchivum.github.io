I enjoy dumpstering bad players and kids like you all day. All I said was that the pros need to follow the rules. Meteos is obviously extremely toxic, yet Riot puts him all over the front page. Krepo was never investigated and they swept it under the rug and prevent anyone from talking about it. Doublelift trash talks every single person in-game and out of game, and no one wants to play with him because he is such a dick. \n\nPros do not deserve special treatment, they should be punished on the first sight of toxicity since they are the public image of this game. I bet all you fanboys who are defending them are the same people advocating that more and more people should be banned, or you justify every ban in the player behavior and moderation forums. You can't be on both sides of the fence.","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2016-06-09T20:32:48.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leblancster,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fV5FqGYw,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2016-06-05T17:35:55.565+0000)\n> think you need to take an english class because it's \"I've ever seen\"\n\nSorry, english isn't my mother tongue.  \n\n> how does me playing the game make me a hypocrite?\n\nBecause you don't stop ranting about how Riot treat their customer?!
