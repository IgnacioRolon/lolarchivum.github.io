After reading your message, I went ahead and hopped into draft mode in order to reproduce this issue.  Unfortunately, no matter how much we waited to the last second (or second 0), we were unable to reproduce this issue here at Riot Games.  To that end, could you try to reproduce this issue in a Custom Draft Game?  If you are able to do so, please either record a video of this bug occurring, or please detail out step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish this.  If you do, make sure that you submit this in a new ticket to Player Support, which you can do here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new","replies":[]}]}
