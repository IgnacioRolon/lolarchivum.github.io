Complaining about stuff before it's on the live server is what stops stuff getting on the live server. As long as people are saying \"I don't like this\" rather than acting as if the game has already been destroyed by something that hasn't happened yet, I think it's fine.","replies":[{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-10-30T17:11:09.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah...that's why there's a PBE board for people actually playing on the PBE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-30T02:36:17.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as it's not extreme, then fine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-10-29T22:01:19.490+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well things can already be broken on paper.

TEST FIRST, before making dumb statements.\n\nOut of all 4 Juggernauts, only Garen and Skarner came out OP as a result of player feedback. Darius was UP on re.release, and Morde had nothing to do with community. After first change, Garen and Scarner were toned down, Darius became OP due to buffs community complained about before they hit live, Morde stayed the same because he was perma banned and they didn't have the data to make the adjustments. What did people complain the most? level gaining as solo laner in dual lane, which is the same thing being nerfed on his kit.\n\nCommunity is not the best at guessing the effect of the changes, but unfortunately Riot isn't as well,even though they have a lot of thata and that internal testing we know nothing about. \n\nIn fact, over the years I have seen Riot implementing new things to the game which I had seen loong before in board treads by community. Some of the ideas currently implemented in the game, like ward limits to end vision wars, were suggested long before by the community and, at the time, shut down by Riot as unviable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sweetiex","date":"2015-10-29T23:19:50.888+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"It's only the PBE, it's not final!\"\n\nOh, I've heard this so many times...","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-10-30T00:07:03.676+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Obviously the general concept is going to stay but the numbers have plenty of room for fine tuning, especially since it's the pre-season.
