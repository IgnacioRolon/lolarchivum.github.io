However, it is something that is possible to do and people should know that it's doable imo. Why smite doesn't prioritize monsters is a mystery to me; I can think of very few situations where I would want to smite an enemy champ but a monster is blocking them. I can think of tons of examples of the reverse.","replies":[]}]}]}
