Imagine you are playing Elise jg, you head over to your blue buff at full health, see that low health Trundle, and then out of the blue, only you move while everyone is twitching in place. You see the \"attempting to reconnect\" sign as a banner in the game, and hope you didn't die despite this being an easy first blood kill. That's what I've been going through for the past couple months. I love to play this game, but it is hard to with all of the disconcertions. Yesterday, I decided to play, and got beat up on so badly due to disconnections, I'm sure i completely ruined the game for my team. Luckily for me, they were cool about it and tried to make suggestions like \"don't run anything in the background while playing.\" I told them that I had tried all that, and that after this game I was going to solve this once and for all. I looked through much of the support website until I found a solution hiding in plain sight. It was the \"Hextech Repair Tool!\" I looked through all of the available help options until I found under the DNS section \"Use Public (Recommended)\" I clicked on it and then the start button, and it did its thing as i waited, until about a minute later it asked to make changes. I let it, and it finished up. I went into game to test this out, and sure enough, it worked. Not once in that game did I disconnect, which has not happened for a while. So anyway, if you are like me and having these spontaneous disconnections, I highly recommend trying the Hextech Repair Tool. And to conclude this, I would like to thank riot for putting out such a wonderful solution for my disconnections.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T20:57:41.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm so glad your issue was resolved!
