As a result, I have been forced to close league, restart my computer, and reopen league. In doing this, I have been put on leaverbuster, despite making it back in the game to help my team. I am essentially being punished as if I got annoyed with my team and quit the game, when in reality, I am going to a certain length to keep playing the game. I'm probably just going to quit playing league if this is not fixed.

I would be more then willing to wait, damn even 10 t0-15 mins would be understandable but still 20 minute wait per game 5 times is a little excessive, would be fine with 3 games but five? I left league for a year because i got so irritated with the leave buster. having to wait an hour in total.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BestSkarnerEver","date":"2017-02-14T13:08:15.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=jq1hYsEJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-13T00:13:03.402+0000)\n>\n> In this situation, Leaverbuster is acting as intended.
