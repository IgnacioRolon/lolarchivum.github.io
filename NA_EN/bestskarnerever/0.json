This can fix on it's own over time, but a relog can help too.

I logged in and out multiple times, only to see \"game is still in progress\". My game was still not launching on its own.\n\nI checked to see if it was a ghost game, but the match showed up on my history as a 3:15 long game with players buying items. I am fixing my client but this has never happened to me before.","replies":[]}]}]}
