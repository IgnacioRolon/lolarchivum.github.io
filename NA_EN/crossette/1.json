Her shields are pitifully small individually, she also stops to cast EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER SPELLS how is that not a MS penalty? Xerath's skills are way harder to dodge than Lux's and are way more spammable and he actually has a stun. Xerath is way safer than Lux since with Lux you want to proc your passive to deal damage, with Xerath you could care less about that and just spam Qs while autoing whatever is near you every once in a while to regain mana","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crossette","date":"2015-10-28T12:23:36.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We can't exactly compare two different champions, but this is quite accurate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-10-27T00:44:10.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmfao that's impossible. Lux can't delete anyone with a full rotation unless she's ahead. \n225% AP including her passive in a full rotation.

Depends. While I usually go Luden's over Zhonya's second, I tend to one shot anything on Lux.\n\nWith thooooose specifically and with her runes being 15 flat AP and 8 flat MPen, plus 15 MPen from the boots to total 23. Vel here runs 12 MR and had 25 more from the Athene's, so he's at 67, minus the 23 now and he's at 44. 44 is around 30% reduction. \n\nGiven Lux finished with a Luden's, Blasting, and a Rabadon's on top of it all, I'd guess Vel got fed early and had 4 items by about level 14-15ish and with his lead, he had about 2 levels on Lux, so she'd be about level 13. That means she has max Q and E and a level 2 R, so 225% of he AP plus 114 from her passive (10+8xlvl), 260 from Q, 240 from E, and 400 from R. That's 1114 base plus 225% of her AP. Given I looked her up, she has 15 flat AP and standard 21/0/9 as a Lux set up, so flat 6 and 12ish from the scaling in Masteries, plus the 5% overall. Zhonya's gives 100, Nomicon gives 80. That's 213 AP, which after Dragon and the 5% from masteries, she's at about 236. 225% of 236 is 531. So she's doing 1645 damage. Vel'Koz at level 15 has about 1517, totaling 1817 after Liandry's. \n\nIt would seem she wouldn't have nearly enough given with 1817hp and 44 MR (After MPen), meaning he has about 2616ish damage he can take of magic damage. Given Lux's kit, it wouldn't be a surprise if he was missing about 300 health because she had poked with an E prior before catching him in the full combo and ending the combo with a single AA.","replies":[{"poster":"Smitemuffin","date":"2015-10-28T12:49:57.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, as a previous poster proved, the Velkoz was behind and Lux had void staff, Morello, Ludens and Deathcap","replies":[{"poster":"Crossette","date":"2015-10-28T13:19:01.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was behind?\n\nI updated my 33 minute-mark build when she nuked me.
