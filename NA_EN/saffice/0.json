I play mostly adc and jungle but I am proficient in all roles. When I first started playing a had a friend show me the ropes and help me improve. Now that I have achieved a reasonable high ranking I would like to do the same(completely free of course, no interest in profit). I would be willing to do everything from replay reviews to actually playing with you. I feel that &quot;higher teir&quot; players should help and look out for newer and/ lower ranked players and help them improve even if its just with small tips! If anyone would be interested in this comment below! I have a discord also dedicated to this!","replies":[{"poster":"zary","date":"2016-12-01T21:41:37.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man not new to league but am still a lower rank currently at Silver IV.
