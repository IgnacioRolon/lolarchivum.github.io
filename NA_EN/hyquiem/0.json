It was stated by Rioter in a previous quote that if he and Xerath fought in the open desert, Xerath would almost certainly win. If they fought in/near the capital, however, Azir could muster enough strength to beat the Magus. This may be due to the fact that his Ascension was also unique, getting the power after saving Sivir's life as opposed to actually finishing the ritual with the sun priests.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-07-11T15:49:48.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.\n\nAzir is possibly the most powerful Ascended in capital (for now), since he has everything he needs here. Sand, structures of Shurima, Sun Disc. He is in clear advantage here, but it is still not certain that he defeats Xerath even in capital, since he is the villain of story and villains are almost always more powerful than the hero.\n\nI mean, if Xerath can't defeat Azir in capital, what is the point? What is the threat? That just means Azir is always safe, and Xerath is not a threat.\n\nI think it always depends on the story when it comes to power level. Rioter opinions are opinions, they are their personal thoughts. \n\nWhat I am sure is, when Azir and Xerath meet, it will be epic. They are 2 Ascended that can destroy the capital   unitentionally. \n\nIt would be even more epic if Renekton turns side and fight against Xerath for 3v1. I really want to see what Xerath is capable of when he gets serious. He couldn't get defeated at his weakest against the 2 high tier Ascended at their prime. Now he got control and state of mind,  sarcophagus is getting weaker, Nasus is a shadow of previous himself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-07-11T23:18:55.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fasmodey,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uNNF9HsP,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-11T13:06:49.140+0000)\n>\n> Yes.\n> \n> Nasus can:\n> \n> * shoot energy bolts\n> \n> * summon &quot;hellfires&quot; from under his foes\n> \n> * become bigger and stronger at will\n> \n> * strike physically, powerful enough bisect 3 barbarians at once\n> \n> * use sand to a point harsh and brutal enough to leave nothing behind except skeletons of a camel like animal in minutes.\n> \n> * regenerate unbelivably, possibly even better than Wolverine\n> \n> * sense powerful beings, and possibly read minds of mortal as it was described as the Ascended can see the spark of betrayal beyond flesh and punish people responsible of it by death.\n> \n> Though it is not seen in lore, in his gameplay, it is said he can wither his foes and age them to death.\n> \n> Xerath can:\n> \n> * shoot arcane energy in many ways, of course\n> \n> * control elements\n> \n> * use telekinesis\n> \n> * summon sandstorms and lightning bolts\n> \n> * mind control\n> \n> * create chains of arcane energy to imprison someone\n> \n> * like Nasus, can sense powerful beings, but it is even better.
