As opposed to mages being powerful like Azir / Orriana. When control mages are viable (as it is now they really aren&rsquo;t that good unless played at a great level) they aren&rsquo;t that oppressive..\r\n\r\nNow when you look at itemization assasins have ap shields like null orb and hex drinker while opposed to having mages only have one armor item, {{item:3157}}  and no I I&rsquo;ll not count seekers arm guards as good since that flat armor isn&rsquo;t so use full when&rsquo;s it comes to SURVIVING.  It&rsquo;s fair to say itemization plays a great role in damage and survival. As now assasin burst is instant why can&rsquo;t mages have an ad shield or rune for such. Why can&rsquo;t it be. \r\n\r\nAlso. Another item mages lack is a qss, or ap champion in general lack this item while it makes no sense why.\r\n\r\nIMO it&rsquo;s not right that ap itemization in terms of deffence lacks greatly as well as in survivability... please compensate some items to survive burst for ap champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2018-07-18T15:42:39.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another \"unpopular\" opinion post where it's basically just repeated the bad points of multiple Mage main circlejerk post.
