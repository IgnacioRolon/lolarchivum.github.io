Sure I tried that in normals but guess what there are pure golden noobs running around lvls they aren&rsquo;t even suppose to be in you invented a lvl system so why not make it so players play with the same lvl a lvl 10 obviously comes into normals /10 feeds leaves and more games are so atleast make a team system","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-11-14T03:33:57.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals IS for messing around and trying new things.  If you want to get better play ranked or play ranked on a smurf and focus on improvement.  You could also use flex for improvement as that is still better than normals at matchmaking.\n\nIf you are getting sub level 30s in normals its probably because they are either smurfs who the system has identified and rightly moved up or as Xeref stated above, friends of high elos.\n\nEDIT: WTF are you complaining about, your account is below 30 of course you are gonna be playing with sub level 30s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xeref","date":"2017-11-14T03:04:04.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are see none 30s in your 30+ games someone is inviting their low lvl friend to play. and Rank is no better with trolls, they are at least 30 but still you get J4 support with TP flash and no gp item. and Riot doesn't punish for trolling.","replies":[]}]}
