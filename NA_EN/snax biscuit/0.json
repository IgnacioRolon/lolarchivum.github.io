I would like to put down one argument:\r\n\r\n- quoting IronStylus from Sion Champion Update Q&amp;A &quot;..&#039;Also, speaking to the audience of Sion players, the voice is really specifically an NA component...&quot;  He goes on to state in comment further below &quot;...while English speakers and fans of Western media that involves Arnold is charming to us, we&#039;re sort of in the minority actually. By a wide margin the accent, the mannerisms, the reference, aren&#039;t understood by a huge chunk of the world.&quot;\r\n\r\nMy counter point below:\r\n\r\nPlease consider Brolaf that went internationally; I listened to voice overs from the other regions and what it says to me is that you (Riot) assume that the world knows more about fraternity and sorority college culture/american 60&#039;s hippie culture more than they do about pop -Arnie movie culture? I&#039;m pretty sure Arnie wins out hands down!\r\n\r\nSion Deserves Traditional Skin. \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"I amPoroKiller","date":"2016-06-14T16:58:14.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they did traditional lee , karma, seju I would like to see a traditional sion skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-06-14T17:08:23.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot as this problem wuth giving name to skin that no connection what so ever.\n\nMaybe Traditional {{champion:48}} ,{{champion:43}} , and {{champion:113}} need a new name.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-06-14T16:57:18.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too bad Riot stop making Traditional skin only after making 3 skins. Out all the things I miss about the old Sion was him telling people to â€œGet on my Chopper\" is what I miss most.
