But im sure you think this is a working system for some delusional reason\n\nThey do use chat restrictions, but only for the first few punishments. The punishment order goes like this:\n\n1.) 10 game chat restriction\n2.) 25 game chat restriction\n3.) 14 day ban\n4.) Permanent ban\n\nYou start off with the chat restriction for the first punishment, and the more times you break the rules, the harsher the punishment. Since you had a 14 day ban recently, your next punishment was a permanent ban. The permanent ban isn't because of one or two chat logs alone, it's because you were punished multiple times beforehand but you failed to recognize that your behavior is unacceptable and showed no signs of changing it.\n\nAlso, those who troll on purpose do get punished. The problem with these people is that it can be quite difficult to catch a pattern of trolling over multiple games (note that I say pattern, as people are generally not punished for a single instance unless it is quite extreme), thus it will take longer for them to be punished. People who are toxic in chat are much easier to catch, thus they are punished quicker.\n\nAs for AFK's, they too get punished, but there is a different punishment for those who AFK. They receive a what is referred to as a low priority queue, which for this game means they have to wait a certain amount of time before they actually enter the queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Gotodead","date":"2016-03-11T14:46:24.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"never received a chat restriction as confirmed by the rioter.","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2016-03-11T14:55:16.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you did receive a 14-day ban, no?","replies":[{"poster":"Gotodead","date":"2016-03-11T14:57:23.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yes but I never argued that.

Hence why I didn't use the word \"know\".\nHowever statistics dictate what is a practical approach. That's the answer to both, the fact that you didn't receive chat restrictions, and also why they didn't jump to a permaban right away.\n\nHypothetical example with made up numbers:\n\nLet's say that of all the people that say the word \"retard\", 0.1% reform after receiving chat restrictions. 49.9% reform after a 14-day ban. 50% end up permabanned over the course of the entire \"standard\" 4-strike approach.\nAdditionally, let's say that when skipping the chat restrictions, 50% reform after the 14-day ban.\n\nSo... what would in this scenario be your approach to people that say the word \"retard\"?\nThe 0.1% that wouldn't \"need\" the 14-day ban don't really warrant letting the 50% continue to rage until they finally get permabanned. But the 50% on the other hand warrant not jumping straight to a permaban.\nSo instead of the previous approach, you simply go straight to a 14-day ban.\n\nOf course, neither the \"identifier\" nor the statistics will be as straight forward as this example.

It's an optimization problem, where you want to minimize the amount of games ruined by players, while also trying to maximize the amount of people that reform.","replies":[{"poster":"Gotodead","date":"2016-03-11T15:34:50.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which is absolutely horrible if thats actually how the system works, as its specifically directed at maximizing profits in a negative reinforcement system.

Even if you don't believe that punishment should be minimized, reforming is **always** preferable to permanent punishment.\nAt the same time, oviously a lower amount of overall offenses that are commited is preferable as well.\n\nNow make those offenses murders and the permanent punishment a life in prison or death penalty. Again, you need to balance between trying to reform those who are still capable of reforming and keeping those who are inable to reform off the street.\n\nThe argument about trolls being the root of the problem is so old...\nA) Trolls are not the root of all raging. A lot of people rage at bad players.\nB) It's impossible to remove all trolls, so the problem of retaliating ragers will also persist.\nC) The \"symptom\" of ragers is still ruining the experience for a lot of people.\n\nIt's simple: Treating a disease is important.
