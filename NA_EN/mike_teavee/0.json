You can 1v1 her with most fighters at that point and do ok, or simply dominate her with some others.\nThe only aspect of mid-game that really benefits Riven is that, as a duelist, it's nice that towers having fallen allow decent map-movement and team-fight formations aren't that common, so it's the best time to force 1v1s outside of just trying to take on your lane opponent.\n\nAlso - her team fight is terrible.\n\nRiven's only defensive mechanic to justify being a glass-cannon is her Valor shield, which just about any CC will prevent her from using. Compare that to Fiora/Yi/Fizz being untargetable, Kayle being invulnerable (and ranged, and having the capcity to turn anyone on her team invulnerable), Jax being immune to auto-attacks, or Poppy being invulnerable and immune to CC: all these champions, as fighters, also have lackluster team-fight pressnece, but they have more reliable survial mechanics than Riven.\n\nRiven's mobility also sacrifices a significant amount of damage should she actually need to cover, say, 550 range - as she can easily burn through 2 Broken Wings casts without even hitting anything on that journey - not to mention everyone can see she's coming and do something to stop her. \nMost fighter/assassins with some level of mobility operate more on the 1-dash that sends them 650 range at their target in an instant, basically guaranteeing they'll land all of their kit's damage in an instant with minimal warning.\n\nIf Riven doesn't garner a significant lead - she can easily become dead-weight in a team fight. She's a melee-range glass-cannon.\n\n> She has insane early game, insane mid game post-level 6, and insane teamfight.\n\nI'm not seeing this post as a solid break-down of a champion being insane.\n\nIt's much more a \"QQ I was beat by Riven and am now salty about it\" kind of deal.","replies":[{"poster":"OlafRagnarson","date":"2015-08-07T20:59:57.547+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"STFU.

You're underrating this item, it does miracles {{item:3134}}.\n\nDon't go telling me she has less MR because of this and that's a weakness, there is no real magic damage duelist pre-lvl9. It's extremely difficult to land skillshots on {{champion:92}} because of her instant dashes. It's also impossible to land targeted abilities on her like {{champion:13}} Q because of travel time, she shields it right away.\n\nRiven doesn't allow you to stand in your minion wave because she stuns it with 2 AoE abilities. Riven doesn't allow you to chase her because slows are meaningless to dashes, and ranged hard CCs are skillshots and she will dash from that.  ( ie {{champion:31}}  Q )\n\nShe can push lane with no punishment due to mobility or even pull off 1v2s, her laning phase is beyond ridiculous. I'd fight {{champion:58}} & {{champion:122}}  anyday. \n\nHer teamfight is strong because she bullies so hard early on, just a {{item:3143}} is usually enough as mage skillshots are irrelevant. Even if some guaranteed magic damage is going to hit riven this exists {{item:3155}}.\n\nEven if we say {{champion:92}} somehow messed up early on, it's impossible to miss farm when using this {{item:3074}}  so falling off in terms of farm is hard. Also, mobility and CC don't fall off. Because of her mobility she can split push and escape most situations using this {{item:3142}}. \n\nSee where this is going? Because of her kit design, there is very little risk for the {{champion:92}} player because he will always demand someone to come to lane due to his waveclear with {{item:3074}} and extreme difficulty of capture due to {{item:3142}}.\n\nPlaying against {{champion:92}} to me is not fun. I wish she had a niche like countering ranged champions e.g {{champion:150}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:126}}    ( a noble cause I may add ) but no, she bullies the other melee champions e.g {{champion:266}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:75}}  so darn hard with little to no punishment :/","replies":[{"poster":"19348180DEL1","date":"2015-02-18T01:28:12.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-02-18T01:34:28.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you can use it to your advantage if she messes up (like every champion, punish them when they mess up even {{champion:238}}).

Her, Q, W, and E all serve defensive purposes if need be and to ignore that is silly. She can stun, has good mobility, and can wall jump. Fiora and Yi also have no escapes, no cc, no sheilds, and no wall jumps. Fizz is the only comparable one there with his mobility, but he also has no ranged aoe nuke (if you call his R aoe it's because you're bad) and no aoe cc. Kayle's invulnerability is her ULT, so off the bat not comparable, and again we see larger risk due to no mobility, and little cc with a single target slow. Also you seem to have neglected the fact that that ult is a single target, if she ults someone its fairly easy to just attack someone else. \"Jax being immune to autoattacks\" ...Immune? Really? Looking at your quote on poppy you again seem to be just completely ignoring the actual limitations of these abilities just to get a point across, because your quote simply isn't true (but just in-case you forgot what her ult does I've included it below :) ).\n\n> Most fighter/assassins with some level of mobility operate more on the 1-dash that sends them 650 range at their target in an instant, basically guaranteeing they'll land all of their kit's damage in an instant with minimal warning.\n\nMost fighter/assassins also don't have manaless abilities, short CD's, a shield, a dash (+3 extra dashes), a wall jump, and aoe stun, lifesteal (from her build), and an aoe nuke combined with combat steroids. So there's a larger degree of risk of dashing in.\n\n> It's much more a \"QQ I was beat by Riven and am now salty about it\" kind of deal.\n\nBut nice final touch on the argument.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-02-17T22:22:49.709+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riven is right at a 50.10% win rate.  Unless something shifts in the Meta she'll never see a nerf.  She's in a comfortable spot.\n\nIf YOU have trouble beating her, that's you, not her being OP.\n\nShe can be counterplayed quite easily as her only CC is a 0.75 second stun with almost no range and the knock up after the 3rd broken wings Q which is again melee range.  Any champion with a real CC ability can stop her combos just by timing them.

It is only useful now when approaching, not departing. If you take note of how long it lasts, and cast your big damage half way through...\n\nRiven is an All-In champion.

Try to kite and harass her, but don't let her use her passive ability on you whenever possible.\n\nWhat you might want to do is look at the Riven guides that have video guides as well, and consider what makes her kit strong.

This is somewhat similar to the above tip. Riven has no real long range gap closer to get to backline in teamfights. You might argue that Riven can just use her Q and E to get there. By the time she does that she has no abilities to stick to a target or deal damage other than autoattacks and maybe windslash. Rivens don't usually engage teamfights, in fear of getting locked up and instakilled. They usually wait for the typical solo queue ADC to misposition and then jump in to deal quite a bit of damage. High peel or CC Champions like Janna or J4 can just press their buttons mindlessly to keep their ADC very safe from Riven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-02-18T00:06:50.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd just like to see her become a *little* less reliant on snowballing.
