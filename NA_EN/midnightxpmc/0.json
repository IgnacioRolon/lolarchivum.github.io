All of my friends told me that I didn&#039;t even play League that day so I shouldn&#039;t receive the icon! I felt that they didn&#039;t grasp the depth of the day and the full spirit,  for that day in honor of fooling around I decided not to play at all. I feel as though my attempt for April Fools went unnoticed and I ask, nay I demand, that icon.\r\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-04-05T17:34:29.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at your account (on op.gg) it seems like you only played bot games and ARAM. in order to get the icon you were suppose to play Normals (either Blind or Draft) and finish that game.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-06T19:27:26.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep yep, this is correct. You needed to finish a normal game between the launch of Advanced Bots (Friday night) and 11:59PM PST on Sunday in order to receive the icon. *They're still in the process of being distributed.*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-04-05T17:45:57.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you could have done it on the 2nd as well.","replies":[]}]}
