One thing I felt uncomfortable with is that I have never got any honor notification (such as Teamwork, Helpful or Honorable Opponent) in the new client. Back to S6, I usually got at least one or two honors every 5 to 10 games or so, but this no longer happens. I&#039;m not sure if the client is not complete enough to integrate the honoring system or if my teammates are not honoring me any more? Are you having the same situation?","replies":[]}
