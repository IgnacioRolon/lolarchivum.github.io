They seem to be playing her in KR, and streamers like Azingy and Santorin etc seem to have picked her up again.\nNow, what I really want to know is why. Since, to the best of my knowledge, there haven&#039;t been any dramatic changes that would favour an Evelynn pick?\nAlthough, I guess Assassins being picked less could be the reason.\nThoughts? Anyone know why, for the pass week or so, Evelynn has been cropping up in high elo games?","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-29T13:13:07.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to assume it's because of her passive. Being an invisible terror that could show up at any moment creates a lot of map pressure without actually doing anything, and it forces the enemy team to invest in more pink wards than normal or risk being impaled out of nowhere. This helps your team snowball/farm/secure objectives/etc. more effectively. That's the only reason I can think of why she's showing up again.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-05-29T13:16:53.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has always been having this type of kit. She stopped being popular due to the emergence of the Cinderhulk tank patch, but we're just unsure why the pros would pick her back up when she got fanned out by the Cinderhulk patch, when she herself isn't even being buffed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2015-05-29T16:18:39.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen a noticeable increase in Eve players.

At least if I play a Noc or Shaco or something, yeah my late game sucks, but I can crush the laning phase and get people fed. Eve is more a selfish champ. She doesn't get people fed; either she gets fed or nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2015-05-29T13:12:30.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the jungle has been nerfed. The reason eve fell off is because when the new jungle came out it destroyed her. Now with the jungle being weaker she doesn't have nearly as hard of a time with early clear as she had originally. Her damage has always been good, she is realatively tanky, and she ganks well because it can be difficult to keep track of her. She is a good champion overall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phuc Dat Bich","date":"2015-05-29T13:10:40.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerfs to tank junglers and the tank jungle item nerf on warrior jungle item nerf on vi/j4 champs who use devourer are useless so who left to play? evelynn!!! But she is still bad because if you fail behind say bye bye to your LP when if you fail behind as gragas or sej you just build tank and still do stuff","replies":[]}]}
