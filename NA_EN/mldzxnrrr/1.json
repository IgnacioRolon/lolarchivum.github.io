Why yes, there is definitely a strong blues influence with this piece. There are many types of Blues, but the River King piece was heavily inspired by Delta Blues (with dark folky undertones). If you want the real deal for that Delta sound check out Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Mississippi Fred McDowell. If you want to hear amazing modern blues guitar check out Stevie Ray Vaughan! Let me know if you want more :-)","replies":[{"poster":"QUALLSTK","date":"2015-06-24T11:03:04.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was wondering if there was a link to hear the song used in the river king video?","replies":[{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-07-11T21:05:30.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i believe it is on soundcloud atm but im not sure","replies":[]},{"poster":"101100111000","date":"2015-06-25T01:38:57.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could probably just google that one, or look it up on Youtube.
