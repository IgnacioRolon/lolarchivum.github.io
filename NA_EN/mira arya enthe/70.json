In the past, choosing a champion, let&#039;s take Ashe. Was saying &quot;I will give up DPS for CC and utility.&quot; Because her old Q was her slow, and her old passive gave her a much more archer-like precise and powerful shot. But she had no DPS boost. Now you choose Ashe and you aren&#039;t sacrificing anything, you are getting CC, utility and damage. Which is toxic for design. But it also threatens the champion&#039;s core values. Because it means they might nerf what a champion&#039;s identity is, slow and ult stun, or even rework them.\n\nI feel Ashe is just a good example. But it is largely why a lot of fighters are feeling like garbage right now. Because you can pick a high CC team that STILL does damage and STILL has sustain. Without any sacrifices. So the fighter tries to run in, gets CC&#039;d but also takes a lot of damage.\n\nWe should go back to chooses being give and take a lot more. If I choose Ashe i shouldn&#039;t have the hypercarry potential of Tristana, the bully power of Caitlyn. I should be a precise, CC wielding utility ADC. On the flip side, if I choose a high damage ADC, I shouldn&#039;t also get tons of CC and utility with it.\n\nAm I making sense?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-08-19T23:14:09.321+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"There's more to consider than just damage and CC.

There isn't anything. \n\nShe builds into it because it's the main thing that her kit lacks. She has sustain, sure, but it's not strong enough to drain tank so it more acts to heal her up between trades.\n\nI don't personally believe that Irelia is a problem in anywhere near the same magnitude as Ekko, Yasou or even Lee Sin. My reason for this is because you have defined your 4 traits slightly wrong, it's more mobility, damage, utility, and durability. Extreme levels of CC (as in Ekko's case) can be utility but a single stun isn't really enough to be high utility.\n\nIrelia actually does make tradeoffs in durability and utility. I think a lot of people just hate her because she specifically shits on squishy assassin like champs who tend to be very popular and the somewhat popular ranged tops. A lot of popular tops, like {{champion:114}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:150}}  {{champion:157}} {{champion:41}} all get beat by her and a lot of popular junglers {{champion:64}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:107}} also struggle to deal with her. \n\nThese are 5 of the 7 most popular champs in both roles and also 14 of Irelia's best matchups in the game. She actually loses very hard to most tanks, durable fighters and juggernauts. She's very bad at handling bulk.\n\nA better example of a top who fits this definition at base would be Riven, who has durability in her base kit with a spamable shield, mobility, damage and 2 AOE hard CCs. Or Fiora. Or Gnar, who also has ranged harass in addition to all these things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-08-20T01:58:38.057+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure Ashe needs to get her stacks going before she can do real dmg.\n\nAlso she has 0 escape moves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-08-20T18:11:56.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the primary issue with champions that are *newer* is simply how many facets there kits contain and how many ways they can be utilized. \n\nFor example, I personally despise Jhin's kit, despite the fact that I find his personality to be _sassy af_. His kit begins with complex functions involving attack speed/critical damage/movement speed that not even I can fully explain to you, he has a Q that works like Sivir's ricochet but rewards him for doing something as basic as killing a minion with it, his W is a long-range snipe that, despite being moderately challenging to land, has CC built into it (which I personally think that having anything beyond a slow on an ADC is problematic in and of itself, but that might just be me), his E synergizes incredibly well with his W and itself has a slow on it, and his ultimate is identical to Cait's, simply more interactive.\n\nI'm not saying that Jhin is even overpowered, I'm saying that he's _overloaded_. Sure, I can win against a Jhin as Karma, Nami, Lulu, etc, especially if it's ranked and I put forth a concerted effort to win laning and teamfighting phases. The point I'm trying to make is that he has capabilities in his kit that stem beyond other ADCs, and I think this causes issues with more \"binary\" champions (for lack of a better word) ({{champion:96}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} for example).\n\nThe previous champions have specific focuses in their kit, along with tradeoffs to counteract said focuses. Varus, for example, has spectacular poking capabilities, which continually increase as a game goes on (assuming he can win his lane). His ultimate is his only form of escape, however, so as the Varus player, you must be wise and ensure not to get caught out. His E has grievous wounds, yes, but it require that he actually lands something in order to inflict said status. His Q is the prime focus of his kit, but can be challenging to land and generally is upgraded first to ensure it's full damage is being received. His W encourages even further for him to utilize a combination of poking with AAs and poking with Qs to maximize damage output. \n\nI feel as if the issue lies within the amount of strategy necessary to execute x amount of damage in older champions versus newer ones. Against Jhin I feel as if they put 50% effort with 100% reward, but versus Varus they seem to put 100% effort for their reward. Why would I want to use a champion that's requires _twice as much effort_ for a similar reward, aside from my own pride?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-08-20T05:18:24.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even when you do pure dmg kit or pure cc, they're still toxic.\n\nFor an example of a basically full dmg based of kit, look at Illaoi.

Naut top did have a lot of CC, but the issue was he brought dmg with the CC. Alistar had an issue with his W proccing Sheen, as it guaranteed an AA.

Also durability, but that's not really an attribute that any ADC has.\n\nAshe's kit actually makes an appropriate tradeoff and is a terrible example to use. A better example is Kalista.
