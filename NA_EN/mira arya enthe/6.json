Between those things he laughs, taunts  with his emotes to actually drop their morale. But guess what, psychological warfare is nearly useless if you're mentally strong.\n\n If Singed provoked you with his overall gameplay style to follow him by his trail then oh boy you need to chill. Or even if you're easily tilted there is much you can do against him (so you won't get tilted because of these things). He refuses to interact with you by proxying? Fair enough, free gold with good waveclear/rushing tiamat. You want to actually leave your lane without being proxied and pushed by minions? Get Zz'rot. Your waveclear forces him to actually interact with you? Good for you because most of his matchups are bad and you can beat him to pieces. He proxies in your base and you're not laning against him?

I hate braindead split pushers but it can be deal with, with nothing more than \"Ugh, I gotta go stop his split again\" or likewise.

If he didn't do that most people would ignore him making him useless. He is far from being braindead splitpusher as he heavily relies on his teammates, stalling, juking skillshots, knowledge of when to splitpush or when to group and general teamfighting skills. Most splitpushers don't need their teammates to do it cuz they have attack speed, AD and escapes, strong 1v1 or even 1v3 potential or other effects like immortality for short period of time. Singed relies on his teammates pushing and while they are busy doing other things he is making them at disadvantage by splitpushing because he needs more time to take down turret alone than Tryndamere, Yi or Shaco.\n\nSinged and Shaco are not the only ones who use emotes or strange gameplay pattern as part of their gameplay. Leblanc often does similar things, so does Mundo, Nunu, Udyr and Teemo and guess what. People find that funny and even those who don't play said champions are laughing or make posts like \"petition to make Teemo laugh global\".

Go to a bush and as soon as they push gank again. BOOM. You got a kill/forced a recall and most likely got that laner rather pissed about being double ganked. As soon as they get back to lane (all the sweeter if they don't have TP), gank them again. You don't even need to kill them, just chunk them hard so your laner can zone. That one player is now pissed at you. That player is now much more likely to overextend to try and kill you during the rest of the game.\nSure, there is likely a gold lead gained, but it's not the point. At least not to a player who chose to main such a champion.\n\nSame happens with Singed. Enemy picks a lane bully, Singed invalidades their pick by proxying. Not only that, but with Rylai's perma slow+mov speed buff from Ult and Ghost+Defensive steroids from ult the Singed player can easily make someone waste important CDs on what looked like a sure kill only to see him walking away at 20% hp. And that's when people chase Singed and he gets to do the most out of his kit.\n\nYou don't play those champions because you want an Assassin in your comp or a mobile tanky damage dealer, you play them because you enjoy messing around with people.\n\nHell, my favorite memory with Shaco in over 400 games is having 3 people following me for about 6 full minutes and crossing the whole map multiple times and even having their Morgana flashing on me TWICE during the chase.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2017-02-11T05:30:54.389+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"no champion damage {{champion:23}} has been a thing (trolling?) for some time now","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-02-11T05:33:04.739+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"Trynd clearly needs a rework ~~and better lore~~.
