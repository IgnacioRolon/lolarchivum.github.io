{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-06-20T12:49:26.546+0000","title":"Why Order is guaranteed to lose","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":70,"down_votes":16,"body":"#Disclaimer\n**Before reading this post note that these are generalizations and that if you and/or your friends are an exception that is already accounted for later.**\n\nI mean Riot directly states Riven stands for Order, Progress and Love, with stricter rules\nYasuo stands for chaos, death and destruction, ruining everything to rebuild an impossible world.\nSo why will Yasuo win?\n\nSimple, this is the internet. The 'good guys' have always lost every single fight of popularity. \n\nZerg is the most popular race in Starcraft\nSith are more popular than Jedi\nLissandra was more popular than Ashe in their event\nHorde outweighs Alliance players heavily in WoW\n\nEven modern media portrays the rebels as almost always being the good guys.\n\nWhy? The media industry, especially on the internet, is largely ruled by young players/viewers. These are people living at home who are dealing with their parents every single day, a representations of order in their minds, same goes for the schools they go to. It is well known that for reasons like this most young people are far more rebellious. What is more is on the internet you have a whole lot of them trying to act like they are special by acting edgy, pretending they are mental, or talking constantly about how cool evil is. \n\nYoung people like chaos. And some chaos is healthy, it stirs up society when there is foul play afoot and can lead to healthy revolutions. But young people do not see it this way, that is not Yasuo's goal in this event. He has made his goal clear, it is not to cause some chaos to shake up an order he feels is corrupt and rebuild a new order. It is mass destruction and murder leading into a chaotic world that he considers ideal. Pretty cool for a villain honestly, almost had me on his side.\n\nBut why did I side with Riven? Because honestly, on the internet. Love, Compassion, Order, Progress, these are the 'rebellious' actions on the internet. Because everybody pictures themselves some sort of chaotic crazy person, that has become the normal attitude and side to pick. Sadly, this event was predictable from the start, I said it in another post long before the bar moved in Yasuo's favor. \n\nWhile there are exceptions to the rule, young people who prefer Riven or order. In general the mass number of young people with far more free time for games is still a bunch of young people who want chaos and disorder. They still want to see their cool guy beat that overly controlling girl. Regardless of their actual goals or moralities, they will create any justification why his side should be picked even in a realistic scenario.\n\nMeanwhile people like me who want to side with Riven for moral reasons and because I like the character well... I work two jobs and go to school. My op.gg will tell I do not have much time for LoL compared to dedicated players. Sure there are exceptions, people with jobs who are fully responsible adults and just side with Yasuo because it is fun or they prefer villain characters. But we are talking about the generalizations of the masses that are playing the game and leaning the bar, not the couple exceptions that may read this.\n\nI have seen it honestly in dozens upon dozens of fandoms. A couple older people who try to be cool by picking the dark side, most young people picking the darkside with a few exceptions who just like the light side more, then a bunch of older people too busy to be dedicated fans but picking the light side.\n\nFor clarity I am young myself, in my mid/low twenties. I just came out of my edgy darkside period a year or so ago. So it's not like I am some 30-50 something year old judging all them youngins or something. \n\nSo anyway, that is my view on why chaos was assured to win from the start, you may disagree but here is some Order art to pursued you.\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Dawnbringer-Riven-by-SongJiKyo-HD-Wallpaper-Background-Fan-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg?noredirect\n\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Dawnbringer-Riven-by-Ayiori-Kaipng-HD-Wallpaper-Background-Fan-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol-500x383.jpg?noredirect\n\nBesides, Yasuo is also about control.

I may think Molag Bal is a cooler Daedric Prince than Meridia, but Hircine is still my favorite by far, the fact that he's not directly evil like most daedric princes is a big reason for that :P\nI suppose I do lean more to the Villain characters tho, considering I main two of the more... Evil characters in LoL , being GP and Sion :P","replies":[{"poster":"OceanicEyes","date":"2017-06-20T13:22:35.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hircine is my second favorite prince, behind Hermaeus Mora.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-06-20T13:28:09.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mora's up there, he's pretty bloody awesome :P\nI loved his role in the Dragonborn DLC, even if I can't appreciate the lovecraftian influeces as much as some others do.\n\nIf you haven't yet, you should finish the  \"Discerning the Transmundane\" quest before entering Apocrypha the first time.\nHe'll have different Voicelines if you enter his realm for the first time if you already are his champion, which I thought was pretty cool","replies":[{"poster":"OceanicEyes","date":"2017-06-20T13:49:58.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I loved that little bit of detail!

Thing is, riven playerbase is smaller and in my opinion, being a Yasuo main she's WAAAAAAY harder to play then Yasuo. This could be a reason for chaos winning, also that Yasuo is permabanned so people don't get very many wins against him cx","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-06-20T18:39:39.009+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"People just seem to love/hate Yasuo harder than they love/hate Riven, which is why he has such a high ban rate too xD.
