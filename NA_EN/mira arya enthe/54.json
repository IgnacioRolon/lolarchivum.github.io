Meanwhile your team couldn&#039;t care less still...\r\n\r\nAnd before you say her new passive is to compensate power in other areas. It doesn&#039;t. Her win rate has plummeted and aside from that all the other abilities already were self compensated for their changes.\r\n\r\nW: Lost flame trail gained size.\r\nE: Lost human form power gained dragon form power.\r\nR: Lost 100 range and double MR/Armor from passive and damage, gained unstoppable and a tiny chunk of HP\r\n\r\nThe passive nerf, because that is what it is, wasn&#039;t needed.

It's not like Kindreds passive where Jungle monsters are always available in the enemy's jungle at some point in the game, or Rengar's on how he has to slay champions or gain assists, rather there are only a handful of dragons to secure each game and they can be easily denied by vigilant team.

I can agree with that. I've done quite well with her post-rework (in norms, albeit, which are relatively easy), but I do feel her passive needs a bit more oomph. I'm not sure how I feel on it being so objective-oriented (you outlined the problems pretty well!), though there is a flip side: with the bonus damage, nabbing dragons has never been easier.\n\nAs for the suggestion that her e needs a slow (from another poster), I don't think that's an altogether terrible idea. That said, I do like that you're forced to play around Shyvana's weaknesses. From masteries (e.g. stormraider's surge), to runes (e.g. movement speed quints), to summoners (e.g. exhaust, ghost), to items (e.g. swifties, deadman's, frozen mallet, chilling smite), you've a lot of options to mitigate her weaknesses. What's more, you're rewarded for holding onto your ultimate to use as a gap closer, rather than necessarily using it as an initiator 100% of the time. Some of that, I think, is a _good_ thing. It rewards smart play and itemizing properly against the enemy comp.\n\nWhich is not to say she doesn't need something more in the way of helping her engage. I really dunno.
