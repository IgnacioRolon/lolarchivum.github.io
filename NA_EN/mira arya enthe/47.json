Go into a custom game. Pick a tank for a friend to play as, not an off tank(like Voli the sorta juggernaut tank thing) or oddball tank(like Amumu the mage tank thing). Stuff like Sion, Nautilus, Rammus, Sej, Malphite, Poppy. Just true, pure tanky tanks. Build their full meta build as found in sites like op.gg. No favoritism, whatever their most common build is, even if some items are useless vs physical damage. Just whatever the most used build is including runes, masteries and items.\n\nNow have somebody get them to 18 with that full build.\n\nNOW you get on a *ranged* ADC of your choice. ANY adc but preferably one you play. Build their full meta build, no bias, whatever they build the most. Not some specialized build, just whatever runes, masteries and items they are shown to use the most.\n\nNow with every ounce of effort possible I want you to try to kill that tank as fast as possible. The person playing the tank cannot fight back but may use tanking steriods and item actives. No summoner spells for either side. This means the ADC is not even getting CC&#039;d or having to kite, this also means the tank doesn't even get the MASSIVE shield from CotC. So the ADC gets maximum DPS.\n\nBet you NOBODY will kill the tank in less than 3 seconds by the in game time clock. And if they do it will be on Kog&#039;maw, I still doubt it, but just wanted to clear up since I know a large group of people will pick the most optimum ADC vs the worst tank/build. I still doubt it.\n\nSubmit a videoclip through a video sharing website of your choice of how fast you were able to do it, make sure that item builds and champion stats are visible. If you kill the tank with the most meta build for that champion in less than 3 seconds in game time clock, you get a cookie.\n\nAs a {{champion:102}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:111}} player, I have never experienced this &quot;Sivir solokilled me in 2.2 seconds as full armor tank!?!?!&quot; so I might be bias from personal experience. So I want somebody to show me a tank dying in 3 seconds to an ADC, not even a full armor build, just their normal meta build.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-09T05:06:57.578+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":5,"body":"ok but the game is 5v5\n\nnot 1v1\n\nand twitch kog vayne tristana  jinx can do it i assure you","replies":[{"poster":"Anhartamin","date":"2017-06-09T11:15:08.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-06-09T12:11:39.221+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"shut up pls, ty\ndon't say what i didn't say\n\nthose are your words","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2017-06-09T18:34:49.304+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ This lol\n\nDo people even think before they make these kinda posts ffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vallalan","date":"2017-06-09T09:43:41.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"give a  6 item vayne with rageblade fully stacked 3 seconds on anyone and they are donezos.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2017-06-09T10:04:25.038+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"An ADC can kill a tank in 1 vs 1 in 6-7 seconds. \n\nA Tank that gets focused in a teamfigth basically explodes in 2 seconds. \n\nIs not a matter of \"I want to survive 2 seconds more\", is a matter of \"I have 5.000 HP + 300 armour + 200 magic resistance and I still not tanking sh*t\". \n\nIn fact, and ADC with speed attack and lifesteal survives longer than a Tank.
