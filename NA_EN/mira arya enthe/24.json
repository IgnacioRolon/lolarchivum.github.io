Seriously, you ult into an enemy team and gain AoE... woo...\n\nShe is the only Juggernaut I know of with no sustain/heal. And her team fighting fails so hard compared to many others(Darius, Illoai &gt;.&gt;) because she jumps in(usually gets blocked by the first CC issued and falls 500 units short) then gains some AoE. The enemy team isn&#039;t scared of her, at all. Illoai or Darius walking in your general direction is scarier than Shyvana&#039;s ult. Garen&#039;s execute and silence are scarier then Shyvana&#039;s ult. Nasus ult maintains the fear that Wither and a high stack Q already has.\n\nMy suggestion? Certainly do NOT add damage. Shyvana has that up the ass. \n\nAdd minor sustain to her ult, that does NOT scale off of tank stats(she is a Juggernaut/Diver). My suggestion is fix her E animation to make it look like a plume of fire. Oops... wrong topic. My suggestion that while in Dragon Form(honestly it could probably work in human form without being too strong as long as it doesn't heal on jungle mobs) the initial damage of Shyvana&#039;s E along with the on hit damage it does, heals Shyvana for the damage done. That&#039;s it.\n\nThat on top of fixing the terrible hit box on her R(maybe fixing how easily she is CC&#039;d during her leap?) should make her viable again. In my opinion her lack of team fight sustain, and the fact that 1v1 dragon form is next to useless, is really holding her back.\n\nThoughts from other Shyvana players on if this is a good idea?

Juggernauts (by Riot's own definition) is a champ that is characteristically slow and slow and clunky, but can deal a lot of damage if they can get to their intended target. Now, some of the juggernauts do have speed ups (Voli, Garen, and Mundo), but the commonality between these champs is a complete lack of a gap closing dash. Shyvana, however, has one in the form of her ultimate.

With no cc to lock down enemies, there is no fear of her (except for the damage she does), all she does is become a nuisance in fights. If she were to have a rework (which is doubtful for the next year) she would need some form better cc than a weak shove from an ultimate. \n\nNow it can be said that she is meant to be a split pusher, which is what I think Riot was getting at with Shyvana. A moody dragon woman who has always been an outcast, hence why she isn't so good at team fights, but excels at solo combat and split pushing lanes. With low cc, but higher damage and tank stats to boot, Shyvana can duel a fair number of champions in her human form alone and if needed she can ult to gain more damage and tank to deal with other dueling champions. \n\nTL:DR Shyvana is a split pushing champion with plenty of damage to do push objectives and duel any champion that comes to stop her lane pushes. I think Riot did a good job with Shyvana, she is not meant to be with her team in fights, but rather pushing objectives on her own.
