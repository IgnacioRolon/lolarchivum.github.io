I am talking like, shifting 10-15% of the power out of items, 0-10% out of runes and masteries. And putting those in base stats. I feel this might make the game easier to balance and more fun. Since being ahead would still give an advantage, but not nearly as strong of one. I also feel this would encourage more roaming, more objectives and more teamwork over ceaseless farming for items. Obviously some items and assassins, would have to be adjusted in manners that prevent all assassins from just going tank. But, I am a noob who doesn&#039;t play Ranked.\n\nSo... opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2016-08-19T21:48:44.241+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"haven't you learned anything? high base stats= assassins build tanky and still do a lot of damage","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-08-19T21:49:57.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=venomous frost,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6BGc1JLG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-19T21:48:44.241+0000)\n>\n> haven&#x27;t you learned anything? high base stats= assassins build tanky and still do a lot of damage\n\nThis would include taking power from tank items, utility items and so forth. ALL items and putting it into base stats. Since assassin base stats would = assassin stats, it would actually discourage that. Because they couldn't buy enough tank stats for it to matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-08-19T21:55:23.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're not talking about a significant enough change to make it where they can't build tanky, you're saying 10-15%.

Thank you for your imput. I don't feel it would destroy off builds.

Much like how WoW remained the juggernaut of MMO's for years, and is only now facing real competition after twelve years. League of Legends is the juggernaut of the format, and it's fan base is too big to compete with. Another problem with heroes, is that they started to look to League for what made people find watching it as an esport interesting, and made everything super mobile and bursty just like League, instead of sticking to their original plan.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2016-08-19T22:28:18.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E.G. take more ideas from HotS?

Why make games longer?\n\nHow would encouraging roaming, discouraging farm fests make the games longer? Currently games last 30-50 minutes despite all attempts to make them 'shorter' through encouraging excessive snowballing. Still as long as ever. Clearly that isn't the answer, it just has made the gameplay more toxic.\n\nHeroes of the storm has much more action, teamfights, roaming and shorter matches. Largely because of the lack of farming.
