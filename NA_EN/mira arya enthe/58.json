You are saying they are nerfing supports into support role only when half of those supports that were nerfed were way too oppressive via the Crowd Control they had and were making absolute 0 counterplay in the lane they were in, often times 100-0ing champions with a very slight lead. What you are not stating at all is your version of \"fun\", fun is such a loose term. Do you like absolutely controlling the enemy so they can do nothing against you? Do you like 100-0ing an enemy champion? Do you like being able to go into a 1v5 and win?

Honestly there are times that I am support and I have the enemy ADC and support back clear away from the minions because they knew if i caught them, they were going to take sever damage if not die.

I have also been targetted by ultimates galor by Warwicks etc because they knew if I died, the team would go down, and sure enough if i died or could not get there in time.... 2-3 of them could take on 4 of my allies. Support role has much more of an impact than people realize. Supports often do charge in recklessly also, they get into the middle of their team and CC them, drawing all their attention..... they just often times do not have the damage to do what a Zed or Elise does.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2016-07-21T00:12:37.893+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"sona has a 57 percent win rate, supports aren't under powered, or boring, just horribly stereotyped as useless","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-07-21T00:19:30.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PhantomGG,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ae6uJpLu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-21T00:12:37.893+0000)\n>\n> sona has a 57 percent win rate, supports aren&#x27;t under powered, or boring, just horribly stereotyped as useless\n\nEveryone knows it's useful, they don't play it because it's boring.

And most of them, are rather helpless alone, they more and more are being designed so if they are synchronized with having somebody else near them, to the point where they are only useful around their dedicated person.","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-07-21T01:16:39.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do people insist on replying to a comment that they already posted?

Like how Soraka can heal anyone, or just everyone at once from the fountain? Like how Leona only has her cc around the adc? Oh wait, that doesn't exist. There is not a single support that binds to a person as part of their gameplay and is useless without them. Are most not effective without another part of their team around? Yes, but neither is the tank. The adc/most mids will be caught out if completely alone. Pretty much only assassins will be fine when alone, and that is because they are designed to **be** alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2016-07-21T01:17:52.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Last Ballad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ae6uJpLu,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2016-07-21T01:16:39.027+0000)\n>\n> Why do people insist on replying to a comment that they already posted?

Feeling helpless because your ADC gave a kill away and your team is behind does. Being unable to buy items until you complete several necessary support items that have no variety choices on most supports does. I played Healer in WoW, support or specialist in HotS, support in League and healer in Perfect world. I have no problem with supporting being 'boring'. I have problems with how Riot pigeonholes supports and shuts down every off meta support item or gameplay facet they see.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FireStorm21","date":"2016-07-21T03:14:56.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Platinum support main I can help explain this to you some.
