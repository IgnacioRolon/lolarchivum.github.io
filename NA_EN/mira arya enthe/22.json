Lee is too strong, he does fall off late game, he is hard to play, he does need nerfs. This is all numerically supported.\r\n\r\nNow, the question is HOW should he be nerfed and to what extent? I don&#039;t believe in gutting a champion just because I dislike them, so here are a couple things to consider.\r\n\r\nGames are currently closed out early, Lee is strong early, he never gets to fall off. So firstly games need to last longer, which will nerf him by proxy.\r\n\r\n#But I do think some direct changes are needed. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost his ult stuns prior to displacing you. This should be trimmed to stun only during the displacement, not for a period before and after.\r\n\r\nSecondly I would cut the execute damage of his Q in HALF. It makes his early too toxic.\r\n\r\nThird I would increase the CD of his Q and W by 1-2 second(s) at ALL ranks. This may not seem like much but it gives that 1-2 extra second(s) to escape, catch or kill him off two abilities.\r\n\r\nThese are the direct nerfs I would hit him with. These all combined would destroy his toxic early game and bring it into tolerable levels.\r\n\r\n#Why not ward hopping?\r\nI would actually prefer it be removed. But like with Katarina and Jax to come, it is central to his *current* design. I would remove it when he is reworked eventually. For now I think these three key changes would make Lee FAR more tolerable. Means easier to counter prior to and after getting ulted, no massive execute burst, longer Q and W cooldowns meam fewer free kills and escapes for him, and more punishment for escapes. Longer Safeguard CD is also doubled when jumping to wards so even more punishing.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.

That'd be DOTA. There's no turn speed in League.\n\nAnd uh, sorry, but LITERALLY EVERY SQUISHY CHAMP IN THE GAME needs to position well or instantly die.

I tested several builds for this but also looked at some top Riven player's average burst combos. \n\nMind you this is with a BC and lethality so this target actually has 70 armor vs her at the start of the fight and 40 by six hits in. With Riven's standard build your average Nautilus(whom I play quite a bit) will have about 300 armor for simplicity. As Riven only buys two Lethality items and does not take the Lethality mastery this means if she goes Thunderlords path the tank will have 270 armor vs her when they begin fighting plus his shield, item passives, actives, summoner's and CC(which reduces damage taken). By six hits in(when much of her combo is blown already) he will have 180 armor vs her.\n\nIf she went with Fervor she will have more tank killing power but less CDR, less burst and less squishy blowing up power. With the fervor build she would get the 7% mastery for armor pen so he would have 249 armor vs her when she started the fight and when she was six hits into killing him(if his CC didn't prevent that) he would now have 165 armor vs her. \n\nFrom the wiki\n\n>100 armor →  × 0.5 incoming physical damage (50% reduction, +100% effective health).\n\nEven if he was reduced to 100 armor he would still be reducing the burst of all of her damage(except Thunderlords but then she has less pen anyway) by 50%. But he isn't, worst case scenario he is left with 65 over 100. \n\nSo we are talking about the difference between 70 down to 40 armor vs 270 down to in the worst case 165 armor.\n\nNo, Riven CANNOT and WILL not one shot a tank unless they have built AP or some shit and she is drastically fed. Even then it will take her a full ability rotation. Riven blows up squishies with her high risk all in combo, not tanks. \n\nAs for her shield, standard build if you reach FULL build at lvl 18, you get 600 shielding with this build. An average ADC in the 1.5 seconds her shield lasts, at full build, will do between 1000-1600 damage(old DPS calculation from S6 damage amps have been cut since then so may not be accurate) and an average AP standard Nuke at full build will do drastically more than her shield in a single hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-04-23T02:18:34.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riven from having a shield for all her health on top of one shotting even tanks?\n\nDidn't even read past this. It took me in practice mode a full AD, 3 red drake, elder dragon and Baron to get just over a quarter of my HP on my 1.5s shield. An unrealistic scenario. Normally her shield with a BC into lethality build won't shield a full GP Q with Tri-Force or Pantheon Q with Youmous. It is removed with 1 ability.\n\nOne shotting a tank. Pffffffttt she isn's even Fiora or Vayne who actually obliterate tanks. Same build and scenario above in practice mode with a full lethality AD build and every resource on the map plus ignite and red buff. A full 4 seconds blowing everything Riven has 3 Qs, 3 AAs, ignite, Hydra, both segments of ult, W all in the correct order. 5100 damage in an unrealistic scenario full build lvl 18 vs a 100 armor target with no tanking steroids, passive items, active items, runes or masteried.\n\nGood fucking luck with that. \n\nBut just to satisfy the utter bullshit that is your post.

That's just how it is. When I was talking about it with my brother (who plays more League) I was annoyed that it's called orb-walking because there are no orb effects in League that can be manipulated like that, but at the same time it's really not a big deal to differentiate them between games. Some games are just going to use one term to mean something else, and that's just how it's going to be. \n\nNow, on to ADCs, as that one of my preferred roles and I tend toward support and pos 1 in DotA2: Yes, every squishy champion needs to position correctly to not die, but unlike most squishy champions ADCs have to do their damage over a sustained period of time. It isn't \"Oh, at least I dropped my burst combo and killed a couple people\" with most ADCs if they die quickly. For them it's more akin to \"Holy shit, I didn't have time to do any damage.\" even if they both die within, say, 2 seconds. Unlike most other squishies, staying alive is paramount to do anything at all, not just live. A mage? They can do their combo and if they die then at least they did the bulk of their damage. An assassin? If they got the enemy ADC or mage then it was likely a worthwhile trade because most of their damage was going to be on cooldown for a bit anyway. For an ADC? They have to live to pump out their damage because they don't have the burst most other squishies tend to have. This makes them reliable in terms of sustained damage, but unreliable in that if their positioning is bad then you'll never see a bit of that damage come to fruition. This means ADCs, by their nature, are only ever easy, safe and reliable if the enemy team is basically worthless.\n\nOn to tanks: A tank is something that demands attention because of the disruption they cause, not just a damage sponge--this isn't WoW, there is more to being a tank than not dying quickly. They disrupt. Mundo doesn't disrupt through anything but damage. Tanks in video games, unlike real life, also don't tend to hit very hard, and so Mundo, who has high damage and survivability but low CC is not really a good tank. He's good at being a bruiser, but if he needs to protect an ally (something tanks are known for) or go into an enemy team and disable an important target (alternative thing tanks are known for) then he simply can't do those. His option is to run into the enemy line and hope to god that's good enough to draw meaningful enemy fire with the threat of his damage. Darius has pretty much this same problem in classifying him as a tank: He's hard to kill, but his main source of disruption of disruption is damage. Like Mundo, he has lacking mobility, low CC, but he makes up for that by bringing high damage and high survivability, I.E. not a tank. \n\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:113}} and etc, these are tanks. They can, in fact, CC key targets or disrupt an enemy line on demand, they can peel for allies, and they can take a beating. Damage levels are variable but it tends to meander somewhere around \"low\" to \"mediocre\" when properly balanced. They do enough damage to threaten a squishy, but their damage isn't particularly intimidating for someone building defensively, as opposed to Mundo and Darius who _can_ threaten someone building defensively. They give you reason to focus them other than just damage; damage alone only puts you so high on the threat meter, because damage alone can't guarantee a kill. CC in a teamplay scenario, on the other hand, can net kills by making the damage significantly more targeted in that area or player. Like the ADC, the tank would like to live as long as possible but not for the same goal: he does it so the enemy team can't just get straight to killing squishies easily as long as a CC machine lives and threatens their livelihood with threat of being put in a very compromised position. Darius and Mundo want to live longer just to put out more damage because that is wherein their value lies. They are not tanks. They will never be tanks. They are juggernauts.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-22T18:06:16.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"lee actually had a sub 50% win rate the last few patches, he was so bad he wasn't even picked in the LCK and when he was he had a win/loss of like 1-11 outside the jungler for SKT. \n\nand there are a lot of really good counter junglers , if we all know lee is gonna start red take his blue... if he is gonna start blue take his red , lee typically starts on the buff on his duo lane side. isn't udry one of the best counters to lee , you can 1 vs 1 him early and just take his camps fast. ivern ? just do the lil tap thing and boom camp is gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2017-04-23T01:44:30.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"warwick was good at it in S3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-04-23T21:15:14.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GY9EE2An,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-22T17:39:10.685+0000)\n>\n> part of his strength is the early game... he has a strong base kit... lots of mobility, some tankyness and good damage. he excels at early game ganks and clears which if he can pull off gets his team ahead and when you get ahead its hard to lose. but if you just don&#x27;t let him do that... and expect the 2:30 gank on your blue side jungle and ward properly it will negate a lot of that... but no one does that.. no one invades and steals his jungle and put him behind... they mindlessly play with out thought to how do i beat this champ?\n\nBut if you invade and he finds you you will die","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-23T21:38:39.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe depending on the champ\n\nudry nope he wins 1 vs 1 early vs lee... nunu ? nope he is too tanky can steal quickly with Q and heal while he throws a snowball in your face and spams laugh as he runs away with blood boil. ivern? nope tanky, and has the fastest clear ... amumu not really.. he is too tanky and can just Q over a wall to a monster just to name a few that can invade and take his jungle... \n\nwhere lee excells is early game pressure and ganks... if you play a farm jungler vs him and expect to have your laners be safe and not give up kills then thats wishful thinking while you try to scale. and the stats show past 20 mins his win rate plummets ... so either be safe early and dont let him snowball the lanes or himself . or pick later game champs play to your win conditions and scale and make him useless. oh and what stops most ganks? wards? cc? not being dumb?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2017-04-22T17:56:10.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The stun is there to make it so that it isn't really wonky when he kicks you and you flash out or dash out.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-04-22T19:15:25.875+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"The stun during a displacement is normal.

W is like a defensive Jax Q with a higher cooldown, and then a Turtle Stance passive, E is AoE damage and then a slow+reveal. And his Q is more like 1 ability, although it's poke+gapcloser.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2017-04-23T10:48:31.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RITO; ˝We're aware that Lee has been on the strong side and it's time to nerf him,which will allow other junglers to be viable˝\n\nNext patch ; Lee sin  -3AD","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-23T04:14:20.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fixing lee should be really easy.\n\nKill all the hidden power he has.\n\nRework w, remove ult snare.\n\n(Needs to get rid of wardhopping and the stat button, should have an alternative to both)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-04-22T23:18:44.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imo he does fall off, but not enough.

This should be trimmed to stun only during the displacement, not for a period before and after.\n\nNo, not negotiable. It would make his ult the most unreliable point and click spell in the game. It would be horrible. \n\n> Secondly I would cut the execute damage of his Q in HALF. It makes his early too toxic.\n\nIf you're cutting his early game damage to pieces, how do you expect him to be anything but dog shit? As you acknowledged the champion is just not good late game. Drastic nerfs to his early game would make him a champion with no point of the game where they are strong and a point in the game where he is actually weak.\n\n> Third I would increase the CD of his Q and W by 1-2 second(s) at ALL ranks. This may not seem like much but it gives that 1-2 extra second(s) to escape, catch or kill him off two abilities.\n\nI think this is probably fair. \n\n> These are the direct nerfs I would hit him with. These all combined would destroy his toxic early game and bring it into tolerable levels.\n> \n> #Why not ward hopping?\n> I would actually prefer it be removed. But like with Katarina and Jax to come, it is central to his *current* design. I would remove it when he is reworked eventually. For now I think these three key changes would make Lee FAR more tolerable. Means easier to counter prior to and after getting ulted, no massive execute burst, longer Q and W cooldowns meam fewer free kills and escapes for him, and more punishment for escapes. Longer Safeguard CD is also doubled when jumping to wards so even more punishing.\n\nI think the jungle and the game itself should be retooled to allow playstyles other than Lee Sin's jungle playstyle to be viable. High pressure early game gank and invade junglers are pretty much all that's viable right now. Even Master Yi, the archetypical late game farming jungler, has modified his playstyle and build path to make way for more early game pressure and power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2017-04-22T18:50:31.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He needs multiple things to be removed in his kit in favor of enhanced strengths\n\nno more generalist\nno more mobile CC burst dps tanky character\n\nbut a diver that counters stealthed champions with Q and E","replies":[]},{"poster":"MooseLaBoss","date":"2017-04-24T17:45:54.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the same can be said for renekton or panth.\n\nthey dont get to fall off when the game is already decided.\n\nthem insta winning lane is determined off champ picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seekêr","date":"2017-04-22T20:02:00.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"He is hard to play\" would require and actual random sample experiment where you had people, who had never played him before, play him and then you recorded their scores.
