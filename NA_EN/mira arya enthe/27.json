But if you do it as a melee it is suddenly &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;anti-fun to face&quot;.\n\nI&#039;m sorry. I&#039;d much rather have somebody dive my team get CC&#039;d and die than wipe all 5 of us from next galaxy.\n\nSkirmishers tend to have slightly more tankiness and mobility than ranged champions.\n\nAssassins tend to be burstier and more mobile.\n\nBut neither gets to sit 750 units behind their tank so they kinda need that. They are also squishy as hell compared to Tanks and Fighters. So they die almost as fast as ADCs and Mages.\n\nDoes the community just not know they are also carry classes who do well when ahead?\n\n**EDIT: So about 2/3rds of comments consist of \"They are mobile\". No duh... okay, take that away, now you come up with a way for a squishy, damage based melee to get to an ADC before they kill them with 3 crits... Unless you think the only melees that should exist are immobile ~~target dummies~~ tanky ones that you can easily kite.**\n\nEDIT 2: A new wave of comments are \"they can outplay you!\"\n\nAnd uhm... ADCs cannot?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mWxyYWE2oOc\n\nIn fact it is top tier ADC mains a lot of people think of when they hear \"Outplay\". I mean don't try telling gosu, sneaky, doublelift, Imaqtpie or other top level ADC mains they cannot outplay people when ahead. Or even behind.\n\nFor mages try telling that to faker, hai or any other top tier player that plays mages.\n\nBut even down here in Silver I see Lux's outplay Zed's all the time. And Ashe's flashing out of Riven's knockup, stunning her then killing her in about 2-3 AAs while lifestealing any damage she took.\n\nThe difference between an Assassin/Skirmisher and ADC/Mage the former is better at solokills when in small fights. Allowing them to be good split pushers. But otherwise does the same job of killing things from a much more dangerous range. Making them far worse at sieges, objectives and team fighting. An assassin or Skirmisher relies on catching you in a bad spot or their tank engaging first. Just as much as and ADC or mage relies on you making a stupid engagement or their tank engaging first.\n\nBoth are team reliant. You cannot \"carry\" if your team isn't in a position to be carried. \n\nAnd I'm sorry, when the roles are reversed and a Twitch or Lucian is super fed. A Skirmisher or assassin feels just as helpless trying to ever get on them and deal enough damage before they lifesteal it back. As an ADC feels when a Skirmisher or Assassin is fed. That is the price of hypercarry potential. You rely on your team and getting fed. When behind you feel helpless.\n\nAt least a mage when behind usually still offers strong utilities. Like my main mages Malzahar and Lux.\n\n**Edit 3: The current argument is \"counterplay\". The counterplay for all squishy carries is the same. Burst, CC, Exhaust, warding, defensive items/lifesteal and positioning. Those things are easier to apply when the attacking champion is melee. Which is why melee champions MUST have some level of mitigating your defense if they play well. Also talk about limited counterplay... ADCs do most of their DPS and healing based on typically undodgeable right clicks from 500-700 range. Mages are compensated by having AoE, burst and utilities instead. Just as mages are compensated melees get mobility and ways to dodge damage and/or CC. That is fair.**\n\n**And yes. Melees can, if not CC'd or exhausted, escape after going in. Most mages and ADCs never have to \"go in\" to begin with. Their safety is range. Yet most of them still have some form of escape or CC and items like Scimitar and Zonya's work as well on them as melees.**\n\n**A large part of why Melees \"Can't miss\" is because they are in melee range. Ahri is unlikely to miss Charm from point blank either. The difference is she doesn't have to point blank.**\n\nYet to be convinced melee carries carrying is any more unfair than a fed Twitch killing an entire team in a few AAs or a Syndra one shotting somebody from 500+ range.","replies":[{"poster":"Dabrick01","date":"2017-02-01T00:26:15.716+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":6,"body":"I wonder if that is why so many people hate {{champion:157}}.\n\nPeople just don't like the fact that a champ and deal damage and have the tools to survive.\n\nMobility and Tank Stats are a really bad match for Damage in theory.

You can stop Ryze from ulting away, unless he used Zhonyas. You can cc (or simply kill) TF while he's channeling. You can bodyblock Azirs dash.

It makes you completely unable to get away from bad situations, and is best used to avoid dying in the clusterfuck that is a teamfight. It will not save you from a juggernaut/assassin/skirmisher running your way, unless they are stupid enough to run through your whole team first. It usually just prolongs the inevitable (which I actually find rather fitting, but whatever).\nThe only champions that can use Zhonyas and still have some means of self-protection are {{champion:9}}{{champion:50}}{{champion:136}} and other champions that have a non-channeled damage- or escape ability (Ryze) that lasts either until toggled off, or until it's duration finished.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-02-01T02:28:58.548+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"ryze can use cc and walk away \n\nfizz with his playful trickster can use to engage and escape clear over walls etc \n\ntf can use gold card to stun or red card to slow you as he escapes he dont have to ult\n\napparently you didnt think this through","replies":[{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2017-02-01T02:39:43.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> apparently you didnt think this through\n\nProbably the case.\n\nI however never said they can't escape you. I also said, Fizz needs his Escape and mobility to even as much as work as what he is, which is an assassin. Not a mage.\nTF can use gold card to stun you. Sure. But he's still slow as fuck. If you really want to get on top of him, you probably can do that. You already managed to get into his basic attack range (which is rather short for a champion that needs his basic attacks as much as he does, while being very squishie)\nRyze... is just weird. He deals burst dps, has cc, movement speed buffs and a few other things he might not necessarily need to do his job.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-02-01T00:46:47.885+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.
