Champions like Jhin, Bard and new Fiora are far better designs than outdated champions like Garen, Annie and Mordekaiser.\n\nSee Linear champions aren&#039;t weak because of numbers.\n\nThey are weak because they are linear. They lack options, likewise when they do get ahead they lack counterplay. I find it amazing the number of people who complain about easy to use unavoidable damage on one champion but then complain about high skill cap champions with avoidable damage being the problem with League.\n\nThe reason Ahri for example can be balanced across most tiers with minimum number tuning is because while her kit is simple and powerful it also has options to be viable in high tier play and her CC and primary nuke is avoidable giving her counterplay. She takes some skill to play and a lot to master. But not too much to initially pick up. A similar case is Fiora. Both can be tuned by changing numbers without destroying them.\n\nOn the other side we have champions like Annie or Garen who due to only having 1-2 specific cheeses and their counterplay being &quot;don&#039;t go near them when they have x stats&quot; makes them too limited to see much top tier play without insane number buffs that would make them busted below a certain level. If you make them un-busted in those tiers they are worthless in high tier. \n\nThe good thing about champions having multiple complex/difficult mechanics, or kits with a lot of tools that include avoidable damage and counterplay. In low tiers people may not know how to play against them but playing as them is also more challenging and requires more thinking. Meaning it balances them out.\n\nWhile playing in high tiers people may know how to play against them but also know how to play as them. Meaning it balances them out.\n\nYou can tune numbers without making them useless because their strategy isn&#039;t &quot;have more numbers while being in X range&quot;. It is &quot;Play better than you, outwit you and my number advantage is a slight boost because I farmed more.&quot;\n\nThis is why the {{champion:122}} rework was mostly/entirely a success.\n\nWhile the {{champion:86}} and {{champion:82}} reworks were hard failures.\n\nI can now dodge Darius Q, play around his stacks, dodge his pull and still of course count our stats. But Darius players know this and account for it in their own play.

Had this incredible kit, with great mobility and kite and burst and juke power.. but you didn't need to use all her tools to maximum potential to succeed, you just had to QRW to kill someone, and they couldn't retaliate because it silenced.\n\nChamps with high skillcaps are silly because they seem to fall into two categories, that I think are both unhealthy.\nA. You have to be incredibly skilled on said champion to be effective, and to reward your skill you are very strong. \n        Yasuo to an extent... hence why most of them feed, but the good ones scare everyone into banning him.\nB. They are average without the skilled plays, and incredibly and overly powerful in the right hands. \n         I'd say Riven, Vayne or Lee fall into this category.

YOU decide when to engage _and therefore, when you die, that means you made a bad decision._\nIf the enemy is too strong, you just stand back, or walk away with stealth. Of course you only engage when you feel you have a chance. When you get encountered or even ambushed, you just Q away, you need not fight.\n\nShaco has high damage, Shaco has cc and Shaco has good scalings. I find little outplay in a Shaco coming from stealth, without anything decent to counter the result of it.\n\nI think any champion as mobile/slippery as Shaco will have some of the feeling you have a chance 1v1.\n_____\n\nIn my opinion the skill-cap gap between champions is what makes high skill-cap champions problematic.\nYou get champions that are\n\n* Stronger/better when played well; average when played average\n* Stronger/better when played well; below average when played average\n* As strong/good when played well; below average when played average\n\nin comparison with low skill-cap champions.\n\nIn the first case the champion will ultimately be played very well, giving them more strength over low skill-cap champions.\nIn the second case has the same problems as the first with being stronger than other champions just because the high skill-cap, here however the skill-floor is higher.\nIn the third case there is no real reward for being very skilled with such champion, except for being able to play that champion.\n\nIf all champions have a similar skill cap then there would not be a problem.\nI think the last case is the least problematic. \nThe skill floor is high, the champion actually **requires** to be played (very) well, this may~~will~~ scare some~~many~~ people off.

The issue I had with your previous threads is that they didn't really make a distinction between more loaded kits that are genuinely healthy, e.g. Darius, Jhin, Sion, etc., and kits that are truly overloaded and suffer because of it, e.g. Azir, Kalista or Yasuo: it ended up looking like you truly thought loading a kit _always_ led to a healthier, more easily balanceable champion, a mistake Riot themselves fell into when they released Camille and that extremely short-sighted dev blog right afterwards. It's good to know that that's not the case.\n\nPersonally, I think the real subject behind this isn't one of complexity, but of depth: whenever you release a new champion, you want to maximize their contribution in depth, i.e. _meaningful_ choices that they bring to _the entire game_. If you're lucky and/or have the time, resources and experience, you can end up with a champion like Lux, Morgana or new Warwick, who bring tremendous amounts of gameplay with only a relatively small burden of knowledge (i.e. complexity), but more often than not, you're going to have to layer on additional choices through extra mechanics, which leads to slightly more loaded designs like Gnar, Jinx or new Miss Fortune. You don't get depth just by piling on more complexity, but more often than not you're going to have to pay for greater depth with an additional complexity cost.\n\nWhere things go wrong is when champions are designed with improper depth: the issue with overly simplistic champions like Garen, Annie, Xin Zhao, etc. is that they have an insufficient amount of meaningful choices, and therefore lack real depth. Mordekaiser is a particular case, because his kit is actually quite loaded (just look at all the different effects and conditionals tacked on, and the small novel's worth of his W and R ability descriptions), yet still only delivers an extremely linear, binary experience with the champion. Garen himself has had his kit bloated with a ton of additional effects since the Juggernaut update, yet is still boring, unhealthy and difficult to balance, so it really is a matter of poorly applied complexity failing to give a champion depth. \n\nThe common issue with truly overloaded champions, though, is that they often provide the impression of giving a lot of choices, but those choices turn out to be less meaningful than they seem, and tend to come at a cost to their opponents' agency, thereby providing insufficient depth for their total complexity and, at times, even making the game less deep overall. Champions like Jayce or Nidalee tend to have so many options at their disposal that they essentially have an answer to every situation: not only are their choices not all that meaningful, since they don't really carry much of a cost or sacrifice, but they don't really bring depth to the game as a whole, because they tend to make their opponents' choices less meaningful as well (everything they do runs the risk of getting at least somewhat countered). A common complaint against those champions is that they make their opponent feel like they have no agency, as has been the case with Camille, and that's entirely justified: when a \"simple\" champion is too strong, they can still get surpassed by other, weaker champions who can exploit the gaps in their kits, and so don't usually take the game over completely; when an overloaded champion is too strong, their lack of hard weaknesses means they can effectively counter everyone, which makes them distort entire games around them until they get nerfed. At that point, it's really hard to balance an overloaded champion, because the developers leave themselves with only a small amount of weaknesses they can enhance on them, and can't easily strip off strengths or mechanics players have gotten attached to (i.e. the main reason why Lee Sin hasn't gotten a rework).\n\nBasically, the average relation between depth and complexity is likely more of a bell curve than just an upward slope: you definitely want your champion to do more than Annie or Xin Zhao, but you also don't want to go full Azir or Kalista and create a potentially game-warping nightmare. Camille may not be as bad as the latter two, but it's clear that she does too much, and isn't as healthy as she could be because of that. Garen and Morde are also proof that you can't just pile on more mechanics and expect your champion to be more interesting by default, so it's also a matter of trying to extract as much depth as you can out of every effect you have, something champions like Bard and Jhin do extremely well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yaskamasandwich","date":"2017-01-31T18:48:07.807+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mira I get your crusade against linear champions. I wasn't there for release Xin  or Udyr with that weird tenacity item. I was there for 5.16 Garen, and it was dumb to the point of \"whomever has Garen wins.\" Linear champions need to be on a leash and Poppyed to properly be balanced until reworked or very fine tuned like Warwick just now.\n\nHOWEVER that does not excuse to release champions like Ekko, Yasuo, Camille and perhaps many others. It's not fun to fight a linear champion and lose due to numbers. It's also not fun to fight  against a champion who is so overloaded in general, as you feel that you have no say or control. \n\nAs the perfect example, when I win as Sion or lose to one, I feel awesome! I win due to skill or lost due to being out played by a well deserved skillful player. When I win or lose against those bloated champions I don't feel great.

I wasn&#x27;t there for release Xin  or Udyr with that weird tenacity item. I was there for 5.16 Garen, and it was dumb to the point of &quot;whomever has Garen wins.&quot; Linear champions need to be on a leash and Poppyed to properly be balanced until reworked or very fine tuned like Warwick just now.\n> \n> HOWEVER that does not excuse to release champions like Ekko, Yasuo, Camille and perhaps many others. It&#x27;s not fun to fight a linear champion and lose due to numbers. It&#x27;s also not fun to fight  against a champion who is so overloaded in general, as you feel that you have no say or control. \n> \n> As the perfect example, when I win as Sion or lose to one, I feel awesome! I win due to skill or lost due to being out played by a well deserved skillful player. When I win or lose against those bloated champions I don&#x27;t feel great. I won because the person playing that champion isn&#x27;t attuned to the champion yet. If that player is attuned then there is little to nothing I feel like I can do. They hold all the keys and they hold all the locks. Even if I do have a way, the pure crushing feeling of helplessness alone is too much, especially in lonely top lane island.\n> \n> So yes linear champions are bad, very bad you can say, but that is no excuse for champions like Yasuo, Camille, and Ekko to be released. Yes Ekko is probably balanced now, have not seen one in forever though so can&#x27;t say. It did however took too long to balance him, all because it was hard because of his overloaded kit.\n\nBalanced or not Ekko is still cancer. There is nothing inherently fun in playing against him, ever. He still decides when and where-ever the fight will take place, making you reliant on mistakes on his part to even make a play. \n\nHe still has the tools to bail out of just about any situation and if whoever playing him is really good with him, you still have no chance since his design demands he makes mistakes to be beaten and even then it's something that's incredibly hard to do with any semi-binary champ that doesn't have those tools available.  That's what happens when you give a champion practically everything, bad winrates or not.\n\nAnd yes Camille and Yasuo are also cancer from a design standpoint, regardless of state of balance and will never be an enjoyable experience playing against, just as you stated, either they are good and deny you from playing at all or they are not and you faceroll them with superior stats.\n\n\nSion is just about the only semi-complex to complex champion I've seen released that doesn't ever make me feel like rippin my hair out.\nHe is truely the epitome of a complex champion that has to make trades depending on how he uses his skills, if he let's his Q wind up to about 85% of the way, he get's his aoe knockup, otherwise it's a slow and it's damage is based on it's windup time (can it get more outplayable than that?), he can use his ult at point blank for instant aoe knockup, but then trades just about all it's damage for that knockup (again making it tradeoffs based on desitions). \n\nThat's the problem with the other champions with more complex kits, they never have to make sacrifices, their skills will always have full impact no matter when and how they use them unless they just fully fuck up which is utterly fucking bonkers considering they generally have strong mobility even outside of their ults, much unlike Sion.\n\nSo I don't agree at all with OP, he/she is completely worng and there is nothing inherently healthy about bloated champions, the only way a bloated champion can be healthy is if they don't get to keep the perk of more binary champions, which is always having full impact on skills that hit, since they generally have superior tools making it easier for them to actually hit their skill(shots) in the first place.
