Then once she stops being flavour of the month, all that talk of changing her dies down, usually with no changes being done one way or another. On more than one occasion, crazy changes for her have appeared on the PBE, only to disappear pretty quickly. During the juggernaut update, Shyvana was apparently a major contender who just narrowly missed out, and (alongside Olaf) was supposed to get work later, only for that work to be called off when it was decided that Shyvana was more of a diver than a juggernaut... only to now be considered more of a juggernaut than a diver again.\n\nI realize Shyvana's not the only champion to have issues like this come up, but I still can't help but wonder why it seems to be so difficult to figure out what to do with her.

Her damage is all sustained and she has no CC whatsoever other than a very slight knockback that often does more to help a target escape than to lock them down. Like a juggernaut, she's also extraordinarily vulnerable to kiting.

The Italics are a mix of sustained and burst. Divers are overwhelmingly a sustained damage class.\n\nEvelynn and Xin Zhao should both be in italics, as both of them are fully capable of bursting somebody the fuck down, and Hecarim and Warwick are both closer to hybrids than pure divers. Furthermore, one of the primary differences between assassins and divers is that once the target is down, the assassin is squishy and more mobile and typically needs to disengage from the fight, while a diver is tankier but lacks tools to get out, forcing them to stand and fight. That's usually where the sustained damage comes in, after the target they were diving onto is dead. That's why the burst is typically of a higher priority than the sustained damage, and it's why the majority of them, even on that list, have solid burst that Shyv doesn't have.\n\nBut you're right, there are a few of them who are also pretty heavy on sustain, so let's look at CC.\n \n> So what it comes down to is CC vs Mobility. CC is peripheral to the diver class. There are divers with very low levels of CC. Evelynn has a slow, one slow. Diana only has her pull. Noct only has his fear. WW only has his long CD ult. Shyv&#x27;s knockback fits fine here, it&#x27;s about the same as Diana&#x27;s pull or Eve&#x27;s slow.\n\nIt absolutely does not fit fine. ALL of those divers, each and every one of them, has more CC than Shyvana does except for Evelynn, and Evelynn is supposed to be an assassin but is currently classified as a diver because her kit is fucked up and she's in desperate need of a VGU. Even Diana's E is more CC than Shyvana's ult since the pull has more control over it than Shyv's tiny knockback while also applying a decent slow, having a lower CD, and combines with Diana's dash ALSO having a lower CD letting her dive both more consistently and more frequently. Nocturne's fear is a solid 2.25 seconds at max rank which is good sized CC duration, and WW's ult is pretty much instant death on somebody who's out of position. They may not have a LOT of CC, but a diver's CC is undeniably effective; because it's not peripheral, it's a requirement for them to get the job done.\n\n> On the other hand Juggernauts do not have mobility at all. The next longest ranged dash on a Juggernaut is Illaoi. Think about that. Which group does she actually fit better into with that in mind?\n\nStill Juggernauts, because that dash is making up for the fact that, even amongst Juggernauts, a class which is known for having really weak CC, Shyvana still gets the shitty end of the stick. Darius has his grab, Garen can slow/silence, Trundle has pillars, Olaf (another juggernaut who's in a kind of hybrid diver/juggernaut scenario with Shyv) can chain slows with his axes, Udyr stuns, Mundo chain slows with cleavers, Nasus has goddamned Wither, and Skarner...\n\nSkarner is in fact the best demonstration of the following fact: Even amongst champions sharing a class, there are differences that make them better or worse at specific things, that give them a niche that makes them unique. Skarner's an example of a juggernaut who has way more CC than he should for his class. That's his niche. That's the category Shyvana's dash falls into, that's her niche. She is better than other juggernauts at actually getting to her target because of it, but at the cost of being one of the ones who has the hardest time sticking to them once she gets there because only Mordekaiser has less CC than she does.\n\nThe difference that makes Shyvana a juggernaut with a dash and not a diver with no CC, is that a diver with no CC can't do its job right and is fundamentally flawed from a design standpoint.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-10-19T02:23:06.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">That's why the burst is typically of a higher priority than the sustained damage, and it's why the majority of them, even on that list, have solid burst that Shyv doesn't have.\n\nIf you know how to AA rest properly with Shyv she does have solid burst. R+E+AA+Hydra reset+Q reset does a fuck ton of damage in about 1 second. It's actually more than a champ like WW or Aatrox can put out.\n\n>Even Diana's E is more CC than Shyvana's ult since the pull has more control over it than Shyv's tiny knockback while also applying a decent slow, having a lower CD, and combines with Diana's dash ALSO having a lower CD letting her dive both more consistently and more frequently.\n\nIt's also far less powerful than Shyv's ult as a CC. Shyv's ult (when it works) is a far more impactful spell since the knockback is far longer and the AOE is big enough to catch most if not all of the enemy team. All Riot needs to do is fix the ult so it works correctly and Shyv would be right in line with the low CC end of the divers.\n\nIf Riot wanted to maintain Shyvana's playstlye with buffs the best way to do it IMO would be to fix her ult's knockback, make her immune to CC while ulting and give her a Vayne stlye stun against walls. This would make Shyvana scarier in invades, better at running away in the jungle and make her ult not clunky as hell. It just seems like the best way to deal with her to me and it would push her more towards the diver class.\n\n>Skarner is in fact the best demonstration of the following fact: Even amongst champions sharing a class, there are differences that make them better or worse at specific things, that give them a niche that makes them unique.

Even if you want to call her a Juggernaut me defining her as a diver with no CC is still an apt description.

He has 2 hard CC abilities, one of which is potentially AOE. Sure he has high damage but it's not in a Juggernaut pattern, it's more in a high damage Vanguard pattern similar to Sej or Amumu, lots of damage with very low focus.

She has something that's clearly not at all present on any other Juggernaut, her dash is about 5x longer than the next longest on a Juggernaut and there are only two others in the class who even have dashes (Illaoi and Udyr) and they're both under 200 range.

Why wouldn&#x27;t you put Shyvana in the Diver class, she doesn&#x27;t seem to break any rules and seems to fit very well overall.\n\nThe signature of a class is not what their skills do, it's what their kit does when working in unison. It's not that Shyvana's kit breaks the rules of being a diver, it's that it can't get the job done. Again, a diver dives into the back line, sticks to a target, and locks them down in order to kill them quickly. Shyvana can neither lock down a target nor stick to it because she lacks CC and is too easily kited. By contrast Nocturne is going to jump in there, wreck the enemy's vision and pop spell shield so they can't peel him easily, and fear the target while tearing him apart. Vi is going to ult them, knock them up, burst them with her W and E passive procs, and Q them if they're either going to get away or need another brief moment of interruption. Jarvan is gonna pass through them and knock them up, then trap them in his ult. Diana's gonna dash on top of them and drag all the enemies in and slow them for her team to ideally wombo combo them. Hecarim's gonna ult in to fear them and scatter the enemy team apart to make him harder to peel while knocking the target around with his E. Etc.\n\nBy contrast, Shyvana's gonna dive in there, and her target's going to just walk away from her because she has no way to hold them still. If she tries to W to follow, she's probably going to get slowed or CC'd and lose the duration on her MS boost, and then she's gonna just casually walk forward being kited to death. Alternatively, she's going to just turn around and start punching whoever she's actually able to reach while trying to work her way through them the hard way to eventually reach the carries, which is the primary combat pattern for juggernauts.\n\n> Riot fucks up quite a lot. I argue against them when I believe they have fucked up. I have been correct on several occasions, incorrect on several too.Don&#x27;t just take what Riot says at face value 100% of the time. They have been wrong before and will be wrong again.\n\nI'm not taking everything they say at face value. I didn't say 'they're obviously correct', I said 'I agree with their decision'. It has nothing to do with Shyvana sharing a few basic attributes with divers and everything to do with her lacking the fundamental tools a diver requires to do its job decently. To be an effective diver, she would either require some form of hard CC, or some sort of 'I can not be kited' button.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-10-19T05:39:57.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.\n\nThis is Riot's definition of a diver. Nowhere does it mention CC or lockdown of any kind. It simply states that they\n\n* Have an ability to close on a single target ✓\n* Immediately force a reaction ✓\n* Can single out high priory targets ✓\n* Bring enough damage to be a kill threat ✓\n* Are not as tanky as a true tank -\n\nThat last one is questionable, but it's also defendable when you look at other divers. Arguably J4, Renekton and Hecarim are all about as tanky as Shyvana and they are all divers. Let's contrast that to the juggernaut class.\n\n>Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility.\n\n* March down targets -\n* Excel at taking and dealing damage ✓\n* Tough time closing due to limited mobility X\n* Low Range ✓\n\nShyvana flat out breaks one of the tenets of being a Juggernaut. Admittedly some of parts of these definitions are bullshit, for example 'They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage' seems to ignore that the diver subclass exists and does excel at both of these things, just to a lesser degree than juggernauts.\n\n>Sejuani and Zac are not high damage, and Amumu only deals damage if he builds AP, in which case he typically plays more like a mage.\n\nHave you read what Sej's and Zac's Ws do, ever? These are some really high damage abilities, I play Sej and just the DoT on her W can get up towards 1k damage lategame. It is a high damage ability, it's actually one of the highest damage abilities on any tank or bruiser in the game, hell it out damages Shyvana's W most of the time.\n\nAs for Skarner outdamageing Zac, Amumu and Sej the stats just don't agree with that. [Skarner has one of the lowest damages per game out of any jungler.](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.totalDamageDealtToChampions&order=descend&roleSort=Jungle)\n\n>The signature of a class is not what their skills do, it's what their kit does when working in unison. It's not that Shyvana's kit breaks the rules of being a diver, it's that it can't get the job done. Again, a diver dives into the back line, sticks to a target, and locks them down in order to kill them quickly. Shyvana can neither lock down a target nor stick to it because she lacks CC and is too easily kited. By contrast Nocturne is going to jump in there, wreck the enemy's vision and pop spell shield so they can't peel him easily, and fear the target while tearing him apart. Vi is going to ult them, knock them up, burst them with her W and E passive procs, and Q them if they're either going to get away or need another brief moment of interruption. Jarvan is gonna pass through them and knock them up, then trap them in his ult. Diana's gonna dash on top of them and drag all the enemies in and slow them for her team to ideally wombo combo them. Hecarim's gonna ult in to fear them and scatter the enemy team apart to make him harder to peel while knocking the target around with his E. Etc.\n\nIf Shyv's ult wasn't uninterruptible do you think she'd be that easy to peel. You can knock back Vi, J4 and Nocturne after their ults end, it's not always enough. Shyvana's problem is that you can knock her out of ult. If she was guarenteed an ult she'd also get around 4 AAs off because you can reset AAs really quick as Shyv and that makes your W last a long arse time. \n\nI'm really hoping that this is the direction they go in as well, because it's just a logical one to follow. As I said, fix the ult, make it uninterruptible and let Shyv stun against walls for a short duration. That would fix the majority of her issues and make her a strong diver while leaving the few Juggernaut traits she has in tact.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-10-19T06:18:00.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LankPants,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Bj78lEp4,comment-id=0002000100020000000000000000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-10-19T05:39:57.999+0000)\n>\n> This is Riot&#x27;s definition of a diver.

Arguably J4, Renekton and Hecarim are all about as tanky as Shyvana and they are all divers. Let&#x27;s contrast that to the juggernaut class.\n\nFixed a little mistake for you. Shyvana has no ability to single out a high priority target. Singling someone out would imply the ability to either scatter the enemy team away from a target, or CC them to prevent them from regrouping with their team. I.e. This is where the 'locking a target down' part that I mentioned as being integral to a diver working would come in. Her ult doesn't single a target out, if anything it tends to help group the enemy team together, but without the slow or half-second pull that Diana would have to make for a decent wombo initiation.\n\nI'd also argue that J4 doesn't really build that tanky, though Renekton and Hecarim do. But then, I'd also argue that Renekton and Hecarim are more Diver/Vanguard hybrids than pure divers.\n\n> * March down targets -\n> * Excel at taking and dealing damage ✓\n> * Tough time closing due to limited mobility X\n> * Low Range ✓\n> \n> Shyvana flat out breaks one of the tenets of being a Juggernaut.

Once she's used her ult, she has no other option but to march down a target. Also, Illaoi actually has pretty decent range with both her Q and her E. Not long range, but certainly not low range either. Does that mean she's not a juggernaut either?\n\n> Have you read what Sej&#x27;s and Zac&#x27;s Ws do, ever?

If Shyvana's ult was uninterruptible, that would drastically increase her consistency, which in turn would make her much more effective as a diver.\n\nExcept it isn't so the point is moot.\n\n> I&#x27;m really hoping that this is the direction they go in as well, because it&#x27;s just a logical one to follow.

Because if they did that, then Shyvana could actually be a diver. But she's not, she's a juggernaut. That's the way they've stated that they view her. That's literally the red post this discussion started in response to. So if they see her as a juggernaut, it would be illogical for them to make a change that would increase her effectiveness as a diver.\n\nThat change would be like if their solution to make Ekko less of a tank and more of a skirmisher/assassin was to give him more CC and base damage.\n\nI mean who knows, maybe that is what they'll do with Shyvana, but it certainly wouldn't be logical.\n\nIf you want to talk about a logical decision, a logical change would be something like the following:\n\n- Shyvana's fury now decays outside of combat, but builds up quicker in combat. Dragon form now drastically increases her damage/survivability.\n\nThat kind of change would emphasize her juggernaut aspects by forcing her to go through the front line and build up her fury by fighting for a while before being able to go ham and dash in, similar to Darius having to stack bleeds before he can become a significant threat. It would also succeed in making dragon form feel more impactful by turning you into a raid boss once you pop it.\n\nWould it be a good change? Probably not, I'm not a designer afterall. But if we're talking about what kind of change would make sense, it certainly makes much more sense than taking her in the opposite direction of what they've stated their intentions for her are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"go commit die","date":"2016-10-19T04:38:15.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skarner deals a lot of sustained damage.

Renekton doesn't have good sustained damage, and is only good at focusing single targets.
