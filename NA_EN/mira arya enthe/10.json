And a passive that adds nothing both to the game and to the kit itself if not additional raw dueling power by stats.\n\nIt is a very binary and straightforward pattern which is based on denying counterplay for the enemy and using some weird tools to win trades and duels.

I mean i get the theme but not only do not feel impactful enough but they onyl act as an empoerement.\n\nBy itself an empowrement is not bad, but it reducted the amount of things a champion can do by increasing the performance on what it can already do.
