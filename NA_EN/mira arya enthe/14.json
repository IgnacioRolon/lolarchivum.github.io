Riot shouldn&#x27;t bring new players into the game with incentives because your butt feels entitled... lol.\n\nReceiving a new champion is irrelevant to learning the basics of this game.  The 450 ip champions are some of the least mechanically difficult champions to play in the game.  If they want to learn the game, those champions are the simplest to start with.  If you're going to say oh they deserve a new champion because the grind sucks, then you're basically saying that new players should be given free handouts just because their new.  Then what's the incentive in even grinding this game then? Why not just have everyone make a bunch of new accounts in order to practice one champion then fill the entire queue with people who are smurfing?  Just because new players have a bad time with grinding does not entitle them to free things.  While certainly having a free champion after a certain point like say level 15 or 20 may benefit them, there's often little reason to say that the main reason newcomers to this game are having a bad time is because of the IP grind.  Nearly everyone knows that a large reason why the new player base experience is terrible is because of the higher expectations to know what you're doing when you're playing this game due to so many smurf accounts.  So stop your condescending attitude just because you think oh my friend is like this so everyone is in this situation you condescending prick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zen Ineth","date":"2017-01-16T19:12:52.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"New accounts still get the 400 free RP, right?\n\nYou can get your champion with that, of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Malevolent Metal","date":"2017-01-16T20:18:38.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zen Ineth,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b00yqOVo,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-16T19:12:52.091+0000)\n>\n> New accounts still get the 400 free RP, right?\n> \n> You can get your champion with that, of course.\n\nNope , now they start with a free hex box , whop de hoo.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-01-16T20:51:03.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malevolent Metal,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b00yqOVo,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2017-01-16T20:18:38.923+0000)\n>\n> Nope , now they start with a free hex box , whop de hoo.\n\nNot just any Hextech Chest, a Premium Hextech Chest and Hextech Key*","replies":[{"poster":"Malevolent Metal","date":"2017-01-17T00:56:10.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeszarck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b00yqOVo,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2017-01-16T20:51:03.513+0000)\n>\n> Not just any Hextech Chest, a Premium Hextech Chest and Hextech Key*\n\nHow \"lucky\" must they be.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-01-17T03:20:59.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, yeah.
