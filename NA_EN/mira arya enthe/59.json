Proper kiting has you remove the backswing of your auto-attack so you can move earlier. It's vital in MOBA kiting and chasing, where you auto-attack, wait _just_ long enough for the attack to land and immediately move afterward to do it repeatedly. You're outright cancelling the backswing to move earlier. It's effectively the same as removing the end lag from your attacks in a fighting game. It's definitely cancelling part of the animation of an auto-attack.\n\nAn AA reset is also often used during the backswing of the AA to end it prematurely for the same reason as you'd use it to kite, but to reset the auto-attack timer so you can hit again immediately rather than move. AA-Q (during AA backswing)-AA is vital for champions like Nasus and Ezreal, and also other champions who have abilities that function similarly but on different keys, like Jax. Resets are not cancels, but due to how animations function in this game an AA reset can also cancel the attack, which means you can use it to cancel the backswing and immediately hit a second time in quick succession, generally much faster than you normally can.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-01-18T23:41:27.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"not AA canceling, AA reseting","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-18T23:16:01.344+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WhoIsThisDude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=poOfBdlE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-18T23:12:39.287+0000)\n>\n> You kind of lumped animation canceling and AA resetting into the same thing, which they&#x27;re not.\n\nAA resetting is animation canceling..but with the animation of the AA instead of an ability..in which case it si often used with an AA ability anyway..\nDont see why they can't be lumped together.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-01-18T23:24:14.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaddyFantome,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=poOfBdlE,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-01-18T23:16:01.344+0000)\n>\n> AA resetting is animation canceling..but with the animation of the AA instead of an ability..in which case it si often used with an AA ability anyway..\n> Dont see why they can&#x27;t be lumped together.\n\nThey can't be lumped together for 1 reason - {{champion:92}} \n\nShe is unique in that her Q is both an auto attack reset and it's animation must be canceled with a move command (as opposed to any other auto attack reset).

Example, Rav hydra. It is often used to cancel auto attack animations, but it's not an auto attack reset, as it does not reset your auto attack timer.\nJax W Shyv Q Mundo E and Riven Q all reset her auto attack timer. After Q'ing you can instantly auto attack again. That's because her auto attack timer was reset - aka, auto attack reset.
