One is chopped into three segments. And each individual leap is very short, and also part of her damaging and tanking combo. Plus unlike much longer jumps, she can just barely leap certain walls with the last Q. All in all it does make her dodging during a fight strong, but for pure mobility it lacks the range and easy wall clearing of almost any other leap.\n\n&quot;Riven&#039;s shield scales off of her damage stat.&quot;\n\nSo does every AP caster with a shield. Many characters have a survivability talent that scales off of their primary stat.\n\n&quot;Riven does too much damage.&quot;\n\nSee almost every fighter or assassin in the game. Or every AP burst mage. She is a squishy, fighter/assassin. I&#039;d expect as much.\n\n&quot;Why did they buff Riven?&quot;\n\nLCS. She doesn&#039;t do well there most of the time. Or really in challenger at all. You have to be insanely skilled and have the right team comp to make her effective in high levels. Even then when she cannot get kills she starves.\n\n&quot;Why didn&#039;t they buff Aatrox instead?&quot;\n\nHe needs a full rework. Which isn&#039;t a good idea this late in the season. Remember the Juggernaut update?\n\n&quot;Riven players are always(confirmation bias) toxic. She doesn&#039;t deserve buffs.&quot;\n\nWe don&#039;t balance champions based on common(not absolute) player behavior. Or Nami would be the most OP champion in League. Followed by Braum and Janna.\n\n&quot;You are bronze.&quot;\n\nYes, and as a Bronze noobie who usually loses lane to Riven. I still understand she was in a rough spot in LCS and needed a buff, even if temporary, to compete.\n\nI main Shyvana, Ashe, Leona and Malz as my mastery and match history shows. But I&#039;ve been trying Riven out so I better understand how to play against her. And all this hatred for the poor character, hype over a minor buff focused on LCS, and extreme bias against all the people who play her. Is insane.\n\nI understand. She is frustrating to lane against. I agree there. But permanently overpowered and never deserving or needing buffs? No. I don&#039;t even condemn Zed to that.\n\nEDIT: And honestly I agree with people commenting here. The most toxic players are usually \"flavor of the month\" players. If a champion becomes strong or popular they all jump on it. Then get mad when it doesn't fulfill their fantasy. Then move to the next flavor. So any champion with a long streak of being strong will have Toxic \"mains\" but they usually are not actual \"mains\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-08-25T16:10:57.551+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"I personally just don't like it when she's baseline strong.
