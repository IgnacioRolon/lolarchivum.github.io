I don&#039;t pretend to be a Kayle main/player, I have only 52 games on her(because I don&#039;t enjoy top or mid). So none of this is gameplay related. It is all lore. It&#039;s more my requests with her rework thematically:\n\n**1: Please don&#039;t make her evil**\nKayle vs Morgana is suppose to be about perspectives. There is not suppose to be a good/evil side of it, but Morg&#039;s is suppose to lean more towards grim while Kayle&#039;s judgemental. This is fine. But please don&#039;t do the A-Typical modern thing and make the apparent &#039;good&#039; one evil just for the sake of *not actually* being edgy or unique as everyone else already does it already. Please make sure we are able to take either side with some level of comfort and discomfort that is mostly equal. \n\n**2: Please keep her and Morgana &#039;Angelic&#039;**\nI realize they may not be &#039;angels&#039; but a lot of us love them because they *feel* angelic. They have references to the afterlife, a general light vs dark thematic. I want them to be champions I can listen to Globus while playing. I want them to be FRIGHTENING and imposing not because they &#039;talk&#039; imposing but because of the mere implication of what it is standing before you. Something beyond comprehension that can harm or help you on levels you cannot protect yourself on. Angels are no less a valid mythology/religion than Ninetails, Dragons or Demons and should be included as well.\n\n**3: Keep Kayle&#039;s taunt in some way**\nI like &quot;Come here, I will teach you all about the afterlife.&quot;\nAs much as Shyvana&#039;s &quot;Come get a glimpse into the BELLY of the beast.&quot;\nIf it wasn&#039;t for the fact that I hate top lane I&#039;d probably play Kayle quite a bit. And her imposing and powerful attitude is a big reason why. I love this champions and cannot wait to see her rework.\n\nFeel free to post below what you think of Kayle thematically and what should stay or go. &lt;3 Especially you actual Kayle mains.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2017-04-10T23:30:47.194+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree on the \"Don't Make her Evil\".

It means everything is not clearly %100 good or %100 bad. That DOESN'T mean that everyone is equally good and bad. The only differentiation between shades of grey is that some would be darker and some would be lighter, ERGO SOME ARE LESS GOOD OR MORE GOOD THAN OTHERS.\n\nWhy is everyone afraid of actually identifying a bad guy? They exist. Bad guys exist. They exist in real life and they ought not be censored out of all art or literature just because people want to divorce themselves of all narratives involving personal guilt by claiming that nobody is good or bad and everything is a meaningless wash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2017-04-11T17:17:06.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! I'm pretty sure the writers at Rito will do a good work, they have already shown that their thinking-horizons aren't halted by stereotypes. How do you imagine these 2 guys? I would think of Kayle as someone who has internalized and endorsed the \"just rules\" of some place to an extreme extent. Overly disciplined, and maybe overly judgmental towards whoever has a different philosophy than hers (kinda like the God of the old testament?) (sounds a little too much like demacia though). Morgana on the other hand looks at this place and its rules with strong dissaprovance or disgust and has her own way of thinking of things. Maybe she belongs to a team of insurgents? Anyway I imagine Kayle having won a fight against Morgana in the past, and for that reason she bares a burden, while Morgana is feeling wrath. Both bare a big philosophy to support their ideas.\n\nI'm sorry my bad English.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2017-04-10T23:39:34.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like Morgana's current splash and in-game model don't reflect her lore very well.

Not entirely black/white issue, but more about rules and there being ONE correct way vs diversity/multiple correct perspectives and challenging the established rules/order.\n\nAlso, I think it could be a really good selling point if they kept this in mind and keep the angelic appearance. Then they could have a \"before-the-fall/angelic morgana\" and \"demonic/dark kayle\" skin to go with the updates.\n\nI don't play much of either anymore, but I used to main kayle top and morg support. Love them both. Hopefully the changes make them better and not worse. Kayle has been pulled in too many diverse directions with her kit and made into an aa-only champ with all her changes and nerfs ever since she reached that broken 3-shot anyone in the game phase a long while back. Her q used to be maxed by many for the burst damage - now it's damage is generally inferior to  simply autoing. Her w used to heal way more, but lack a speed boost. Granted movespeed can be useful, but the healing is underwhelming if you go aa-focused build. Her e is what makes her kayle - along with her ult and passive. But it would be great if kayle passive applied more pen or took only 3 hits to reach 15% pen - seeing as how champs like {{champion:122}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:62}} etc. do not need to land 5 attacks to apply the pen in their kit.\nI would like to see ap burst AND  aa kayle (both ad and ap preferably) be viable again.\nMorg's kit is pretty good but could use some scaling maybe. I'd also change her ult so champs like yi cannot simply press q and escape the 2nd proc of her ult because ONE of his targets during the q took him outside morg ult range even though the end of his q brings him back in ult range. If he didn't escape from ult range by running, flashing, ghosting out he should be stunned by 2nd proc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lux Is Mai Waifu","date":"2017-04-11T17:35:25.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can be a functional jungle or support with her in low elo/normals as long as your general mechanics are ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-04-10T23:00:37.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gameplay wise, Kayle's passive needs to feel more impactful.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairoptra","date":"2017-04-11T17:01:43.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a time a few months ago when I was a low-key Kayle main and I still had to look up what her passive was because I'd forgotten","replies":[]}]}]}
