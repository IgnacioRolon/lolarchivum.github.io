I have been playing since about mid-season 2 and my brother was actually part of the beta for this game (paladin045). For those of u that are not familiar with it, the base lore behind the actual name of the game is pretty cool and simple. the League is a collection of champions from nations around Runeterra that fought to resolve national issues. This league was established by the Institution of War after the latest Rune War. My question is where does any of this play into with the new lore coming out about Shurima and Bilgewater and a little bit of the Frejlord? We have all this cool insights into Runeterra itself but it feels very inconsistent with the purpose of the name of the game. Are us summoners just snatching these random fighters from whatever they are doing and throwing them into death matches where they can&#039;t control their actions? Like forcing Taric to fight is bro, Garen. That&#039;s rude so rude. Or having Shyvanna maim J4 or Xin? Where are u guys taking this lore, Riot? I would really like to know and I know I m not the only one who has thought of this","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-02T18:45:47.073+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you miss the whole lore retcon they did a while ago?  \n\nTLDR - the league of legends (as in the institution) has never existed and thus the actual game of them fighting (lol the game) no longer exists.  I liked it but apparelntly It became to hard to write new stories and characters in to it and really made no sense why lucian would ever be on thresh's team even if they had some super powerfull institute of war.  A good example is Bard or Aurelion.  They is pretty much zero way or reason that the institute of war would even be able to hold them, let alone make them fight battles over petty disputes between nations on one small rock.\n\nAnyways now we just have it as a universe with a bunch of interconnected characters across the different landscapes of runterra. The shadow isles, bilgewater story, mount targon story and the shurima story are part of runterra weaving the characters together with no doubt more on the way.\n\nThink of it like how the overwatch backstory and lore works but the actual game is completely separate, allowing them to put widow maker and tracer on the same team.\n\nI personally really like reading all of the new lore and havn't really minded the retcon.  The only problem is the few champs whos lore directly ties to the institute like jax or oriana (she can be changed but still ma boy jax needs some new lore).","replies":[{"poster":"Erractic Eick","date":"2016-06-02T20:47:35.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know, I forgot who, but some player wrote a fantastic article on why the Institute of War made sense. I'm not quite so eloquent, but I'll try to paraphrase: essentially, the old system ran on Influence Points, even in the lore, and by gaining influence, a champion could use his \"points\" to sway international decisions. Now, I understand why Bard would be an odd character to add, since no one is really certain what the heck he wants, but that adds to his sense of wonder and mystery, and thus would have been an effective character development move. Aurelio Sol on the other hand is forced to do the bidding of the champions of Mt. Targon according to the lore piece they released with him.\n\nThis system being retconned has left many champions high and dry when it comes to lore, however.\n\n I actually wrote a largely ignored piece on this just a little while ago, and I'm in the same boat as you, Pacman. I'm a Jax main who really doesn't understand his backstory now.\n\nSo, to conclude, I think Ninjari has a very valid question, though perhaps it could be worded better: What is the MISSION of League's Lore?","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-06-05T09:07:09.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To expand, enrich, and develop the characters, all of which is much easier when you don't have to focus on why they are taking time out of their personal goals to fight in an arena.\n\nLike Azir. He has an entire Empire to raise from the grave and then rule, not to mention Xerath to fight. Why would he take time out of that to help Demacia figure out a dispute with Noxus?\n\nAnd in case you forgot, the Institute of War actively forbid fighting between champions outside the rift, so joining to find a person in the institute that you want to kill would be out of the question.

They want to kill each other, but until their servitude is over they content themselves with destroying each other inside the rift. If they were allowed to attack each other where the deaths would be permanent, why would they bother with the rift for a second? Especially Kayle, who fears the power that Morgana was given and believes that it could destroy her world's order if it was mastered. Wouldn't she want to kill Morgana **before** she has 1000 years to practice it? (which is how long Kayle's servitude is for) If they had no such constraints, then many \"I want to find and kill you\" storylines would be resolved quickly.
