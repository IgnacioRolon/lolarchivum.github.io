These 4 are very weird and can be very hard to relate to but the fact that 3 of them are Non-verbal does not mean that they cannot communicate their emotions or have personalities that you can relate to. Have you seen the minions in Despicable Me? They all speak gibberish but they are still likable and have recognisable personalities even though they are practically indistinguishable. \n\nGnar and Bard totally have personalities. It's just that Riot is experimenting around and trying to establish their story through the \"Show, don't tell\" technique. Bard in game is happy-go-lucky with his meeps, but when you see his video he seems very gloomy at the beginning when the humans are killing each other while he is playing his horn. I guess it's hard to be sure but that's the beauty of these characters. You can come up with your own interpretation. Oh and I love Gnar. Whether it's his bipolar personality or the fact that he is very playful, naive and enthusiastic compensates his lack of lines but what really sells it is when you have a big lane bullies like Darius picking on a tiny yordle but when he transforms they just shit their pants and go \"HOLY SHIT, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!\". \n\nReksai is awesome but yeah you are right. It's hard to relate to her. Her whole kit is around primal savagery. It's hard to relate to that emotion. Kinda like Tryndamere who's always angry. You can feel it once or twice but you can't maintain it for long. \n\nI was suprised that you included Kalista on that list but you are totally right. She feels like an NPC. She has absolutely no motives except to fulfill the vengeance of her soulbound. She feels totally alien and yet she has a ton of interactions with other champions. She reads like an avatar of vengeance instead of a normal human who is bent on justice and vengeance. I guess that a bit of backstory to explain how she became like this or how she relates to other champions would help. It would certainly be useful if she could show a recognisable human emotion instead of just being cold. Even Rammus is more human and all he says is \"Ok\"\n\nOh well, like I said Blank slates are not necessarily bad. They can be very good if done right or alienating if they lack any feature. I guess it also depends on personal preferences.","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-03-23T00:02:24.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think that the lack of voices for some, while interesting and creative, is not a good story telling technique for creating an engaging character. It's very much a 'telling' rather than 'showing' way to tell lore. We are told of Rek'Sai's, Gnar's and Bard's lore and thoughts because they cannot vocalize it in ways we can clearly understand. To me a champion's own voice is one of the best forms of showing and not telling. Having a voice and personality that we and other champions can understand allows them to interact with us and each other. Without one they just kinda remain alone and don't add much to the world. Without the IoW to enable champion interactions, the need for champions to have means to communicate on their own is even greater I think.\n     \nThe new lack of voices to me doesn't make sense from an in lore point of view either. As summoners we've always been able to understand champions and their words and thoughts (with a few exceptions like when Karma casts a spell or Yasuo ults). Champions from beyond RuneTerra like Malphite and Taric have never presented an issue before. The Void creatures never spoke completely in gibberish, so what makes Rek'Sai different? Godlike beings like Kayle, Morgana and Soraka never were too unknowable in their thoughts so why is Bard? Even the most mute champion (apart from Sona), Rammus, we can still understand more than Gnar. Skarner is incredibly ancient and 'alien', but he's very eloquent, so Gnar coming from the past isn't a good reason to speak in gibberish to me.\n    \nWhen Vi taunts Caitlyn, we can hear her own thoughts and what she thinks. When Graves smoke screens Nocturne (though it is a very bizarre interaction) we hear his snark for Nocturne. Sona never actually speaks a word, we just hear her through the Summoner/Champion connection. Other champions like Braum interact so much with fellow champions and even items that we get a very nice view into their mind and personality through their own words. \n    \nOutside of game play champions can tell stories through their own words as well. The League judgments were wonderful examples of this, and the Journal (The interview with Shaco filled out so much of his character with his own words and actions). Quinn's journals helped build her and others as characters during the Freljord event, showing us much through words and pictures.\n     \nWith champions that lack voices and such, the story telling becomes much more vague and 'meh' to me. Gnar's story is all told second hand. We learned more about Rengar than Gnar in his story. Gnar's personality so far to me is very one dimensional. He's childish and sounds very happy all the time. And...that's about it. Anything else is conjecture. I'd be much more interested in finding out his feelings towards other Yordles for example. Perhaps Heimerdinger could invent a device to translate for him if language is to be a barrier. Or we could have Gnar tell his own story through cave paintings (I'd love that as a Judgement). In game I'd enjoy hearing his voice and quotes change as he gets angrier and angrier ('Don't. Make. Me. ANGRY!', 'I feel...funny. Make it stop...'), akin to how Sion changes how and what he says depending on if he's in battle or not. When Gnar morphs new quotes and personality arise, and when he changes back he doesn't remember it at all (as far as I know). He doesn't have to give up his childish and happy go lucky demeanor, but something more than happy gibberish is something I think would make him a better character.\n   \nBard's personality so far seems to be 'I work in mysterious ways. What I  do and why you can't even begin to grasp.' So...yeah. To me he's boring as a character though his kit is so much fun and his art and music are amazing. His voice, while neat, says nothing concrete and I have no idea what he thinks about anything. Again, Sona is mute and also very musical but we know her thoughts. His motivations are explained away as being about the big picture and so we have no way to get them. It's very jarring to me to go from champions that I can understand even if I don't agree with or like to a champion who is so alien that he makes Vel'Koz look normal. Experimenting with champions is fine, but I think this is a failure so far. There are many ways to write a character who is incredibly ancient or alien, has mysterious motivations (to varying degrees) and back story and with immense power, but still make them relatable or understandable at least. Doctor Who, Sandman, The Emperor and Chaos Gods, Sauron, Darkseid/Thanos, the Overmind, Merlin...all are less opaque than Bard but still with plenty to ponder I think. I don't mind mysterious, but I don't like 'You could never understand why.' It's just bad story telling to me, allowing any action to be excused with a hand wave. A character doesn't need to have every detail revealed up front, but neither should they have nothing. \n\nRek'Sai is just boring to me as a character and without good reason not to speak. Her lore is entirely second hand even if it does expand the world a bit and have a decent video and diary. She has no interactions with other champions yet and I don't see how anyone really could with her being so primal and 'GRRRRRRRR.' She seems like even the other Void characters couldn't get along with her.\nWell Tryndamere isn't always angry. He has a pretty good backstory and such as well. Not sure if his marriage to Ashe is still canon, but he does have an nemesis with Aatrox. Maybe some updated voice for him would be nice.\n\nRammus is weird in this regard, as he's so old (one of the original roster) and with so little back story that there really isn't much for him to say but we love him anyway. I'd like him to be fleshed (spiked?) out more without losing his famous 'Okay.' \n\nJust my personal preference of course.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-03-22T19:22:46.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very insightful comment.

I bet some players just like the joy of simply playing a *pure beast*, as well.\n\nI guess the gist of what I'm saying is, every champion doesn't have to be able to play a protagonist or be relatable in the *usual *sense; they can also take other important roles.

Neo from the Matrix too. and sometimes it fails spectacularly because they no longer react like us. It's true League does not have singluar point of view protagonist. I was there too when we still had the institute of war and the summoners. But in the end, I felt that the existence of summoners itself became a barrier to enjoying champions. I mean look I enjoy playing Vi because she likes to charge into stuff. So much that I don't care if she's a girl. I like Braum because I can project my own desire to protect my team mates and lead the charge, I enjoy playing Amumu because his desire to have friends strikes a chord to me and even more so because he cannot stay in lane and must always roam the map all alone. In both cases, I completely ignored the main personality of these champions (butch lesbian XD, manliness and sadness) to project my own perspective on them, effectively turning them into my blank slates. That's what I mean by immersion. In real life, I don't care about lifting weights but when I play league it's ME who's leading the assault, not a mustachioed muscular mountain man who's blocking Draven's ult.\n\nOf course, some people find it hard to connect with him what with his asian inspired influence and lack of voice lines. But in the end, I guess it all comes down to taste. I like Bard because he is so peaceful and playful with his meeps. I love that he is so free and can just imagine him saying WEEEEEE! when he takes a portal whereas Anivia who is a fucking bird cannot even soar. For me Bard does not say anything because he doesn't have anything to say that his bassoon voice cannot convey anyway. Personally, I think that Riot should have launched a Saxophone Bard skin with \"Englishman in new york\" playing in the background. But hey, that's just my opinion man.

Kalista had her own voice(s), but was pretty much so focused on one thing, vengeance, that I couldn't really feel anything about her. Gnar is obviously childish, but he can't say anything for me to relate to. Rek'Sai is just a beast and even harder for me to identify with.\n\nBard has an similar issue to me. He's so 'complex' and above mortals, and lacking a voice as well that I can't connect with him either yet. More lore might fix this and I hope it does, but in the mean time I don't really feel much for him. It's fine to innovate in champion stories and how to tell them but not all innovations are equally compelling. A godlike being with reasons beyond my understanding is...meh to me as a character. It allows any action he takes to be explained with essentially 'He works in mysterious ways.' 'Why did he not save people in the village?' 'It's beyond your scope of understanding.'\nIf I may be permitted to make a comparison, myths with things like the Norse Gods and other pantheons are more interesting to me than stories about 'God' of the Abrahamic faiths. The reason is that the former are more relatable and lively with lots of things happening with them. They are knowable to us. The latter is rather staid and boring, lacking conflict and being too advanced for us to comprehend, so I don't even try.","replies":[{"poster":"libraryseraph ","date":"2015-03-11T03:14:35.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, i think rek'sai being a wild animal worked, at least for me, but I agree with you on the others.

As a story, deities and such with more human traits are more fun I think because they interact with humans and each other in ways we can connect with. Beings like 'God' and Bard so far don't really interact in ways we can connect with. They do things and we don't understand because 'Your mortal comprehension isn't advanced enough.'","replies":[{"poster":"libraryseraph ","date":"2015-03-11T03:43:11.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also making bard incomprehensible is really lazy from a writing standpoint\n\"Oh, you want to know why Bard did this?
