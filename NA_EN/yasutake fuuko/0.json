I do understand that my behaviour is not good or sportsmanlike which I&#039;ve been working to improve ovee the past month how ever the last game I plated I was hostile towards my teammate which i can understand a chat restriction or a temporary account suspension but I feel like a simple misunderstanding caused this to be a permaban. I told the friends Leblanc to stay dead my friend which iI believe may have been taken the wrong way, I by no means wished the Leblanc dead in real life. I do believe however i should at least be chat restricted so my actions/words don&#039;t go unpunished. I do still wish to play this game and have fun doing so. Please contact me via email at RWBYYasuo@gmail.com thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"CLC Seungyeon","date":"2016-11-25T08:37:04.664+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry for your loss, but if you were toxic you deserve it.","replies":[{"poster":"KTTrollster Meme","date":"2016-11-25T08:38:24.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I totally agree with him. ^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-25T08:38:20.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take your email out of your post.
