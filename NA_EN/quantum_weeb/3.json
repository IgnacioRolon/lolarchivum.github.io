Instead, every single site buys a streaming monopoly so that it&#039;s impossible to watch what you want unless you&#039;re subscribed to every single service.\n\nIt was dumb enough when it was just Funimation and Crunchyroll, but now Netflix, Hulu (through Aniplex USA) and Amazon are getting into it too.\n\nA great example is Koutetsujou no Kabaneri (Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress). One of the most anticipated animes of the season, the streaming rights were bought up by Amazon. It is the only anime they&#039;ve bought rights for this season. In order to watch it, you need Amazon Prime Video at $8.99 (USD) per month. If you were looking forward to watching this one anime, you need to pay $9 every month. Amazon Prime Video is not available in Canada either, so if you want to watch that anime as a Canadian you either have to set up a fake Amazon.com account that you only use for Amazon Prime Video or you can watch it illegally, for free, with much less hassle.\n\nThe monopoly system in western anime is absolutely sickening. If you want to watch a few shows you need to drop insane amounts of money to subscribe to 5 different streaming services. I'm pretty sure legal anime would become way more mainstream than illegal anime if they just charged $20 for the right to watch ALL subbed anime, which is still the price of 3 of these services combined.\n\n**Tl;dr Companies buy monopoly rights to stream certain animes, charging insane prices just to watch a few, then wonder why people don't watch anime legally.**\n\nEDIT: Some people pointed out that some sites allow you to watch episodes a week after they are released free, with ads and no HD. That's a fair point which I didn't initially include because I didn't know about it.","replies":[]}
