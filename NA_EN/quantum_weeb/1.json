Seeing the problem? By building health, you are making your self-heals worth less, and your allied heals cost more.\n\n* **DO NOT** try to trade at level 1\n\nYour level 1 is extremely weak. Try to avoid trading at level if at all possible. Take W if you expect to fight, Q if you don't.\n\n*  **DO NOT** spam your Q from max distance\n\nIts travel time is dependent on distance, you will end up wasting mana and putting yourself in a bad spot for your enemy to easily sidestep it. The only exception is if you see one of your lane opponents not even trying to dodge your Q, in which case spam it on them and collect freelo.\n\n*  **DO NOT** spam your E\n\nIt is a very situational tool, however a very useful one. You should never be spamming it, as the silence and root can win an engage, secure a kill or stop a jungler from mauling on you.\n\n*  **DO NOT** underthink or overthink your ult\n\nIf you only use ult for your lane or where you are right now, you will be wasting immense global map pressure with it. On the other hand, if you're constantly moving your camera away from your lane to watch other lanes, you may find yourself in a bad spot.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\n*  **DO** build resistances (armour and magic resist)\n\nThis will make you tankier without actually increasing your healing costs, and it will actually make your Q heal stronger (in terms of effective health.)\n\n*  **DO** trade at level 2\n\nYou have an insanely strong power spike once you have both Q and W, use the opportunity to trade.\n\n*  **DO** save Q for easy hits during trades\n\nThe travel time will be nearly instant, and you can heal back the health you lost over the trade. If you do it well, you'll be able to build a zone of control, since you can trade while losing very little health.\n\n*  **DO** plan ahead to use your E\n\nSince the skill is extremely finicky, you usually don't have enough time to use it to its full ability right when you need it. Plan when nothing is happening. If a jungler where to come in right now or a a hook were to land on someone, when and where should you be placing your E?\n\n*  **DO** find the right balance for your ult\n\nMake sure you are aware of the global map pressure you have, but you shouldn't be constantly moving your camera out of lane. One of the thing you will have to get good at is using teammate portraits to look at their health, and using the minimap to figure out what is happening without moving your camera. Above all, remember that winning bot lane is more important than top or mid. If you have to choose, always use ult to save your own lane.\n\nAdd your own, and I will update the OP!","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-09-27T00:21:48.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any itemization/rune/mastery recommendations as well to make to new soraka players?","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2014-09-27T02:55:30.111+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple HP/5 quints and 3/3 Perseverance from the defense mastery tree goes a long ways early game because it doubles your natural regen rate. Some AD from runes along with a little armor pen makes that occasional banana you can sneak in hurt just a little more while also slightly increasing your damage to towers. \n\nHowever do *not* use HP/5 seals, you still need armor and HP/5 runes fall off in effectiveness like a brick past lane phase. HP/5 quints share the same odd little niche as armor quints in being more than four times effective as a single seal of the same property.\n\nWith that said, Perseverance is useful throughout the entire match given that it scales with your max HP. The problem with it is that early game on a support who literally does not want to build health is that its contribution to your survival is small, thus the pair of HP/5 quints early game to enhance your survivability. As an example, for an almost dead level 3 Soraka Perseverance would be roughly 5 HP/5 while the same Soraka only down 100 health would only benefit from an extra 1 HP/5. The pair of quints is worth 5.4 HP/5 at all times, or in other words a \"free\" health pot every couple minutes for lane phase.\n\nAs far defensive items goes, your Q and W between them have some *very* low CD times meaning you can stack a Tear into a Seraph. A 500+ health shield that can be deployed during a team fight and doesn't raise your actual health (and thus sacrifice costs) is glorious. In the same vein a Frozen Heart proves quite useful, especially feeding into a Seraph's shield extra MP to make it larger and resists to make it more effective.\n\nAs an extra tidbit... Soraka's new E combos hilariously well with J4's Cataclysm. (Remember that being silenced or rooted blocks opponents from flashing or dashing away.)","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-09-27T07:58:37.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never thought of using Tear. I will have to try this next time.\n\nEdit: Soraka's E has a ton of synergy with a variety of champions. Orianna and Malphite is another notable example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrSc0tty","date":"2014-09-27T21:47:20.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Any itemization/rune/mastery recommendations as well to make to new soraka players?\n\nSoraka is the closest thing to an AP carry support that exists, second I suppose to Lulu. Unlike her old incarnation, or champs like Nami, she actually has sizeable ratios and reasons to want AP. \n\nI build (after standard support items) Morellonomicon/Athenes, Zhonyas, and I try to stretch towards a Dcap. Basically, thanks to your Ult and Self heal on Q, each point of AP is an \"effective\" 2 points of HP. A zhonyas is almost as effective in terms of protection as a Sunfire for Soraka, AND it gives you zhonyas active for protection and it makes you heal your allies like a televangelist on a pledge drive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-27T04:53:50.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With new Soraka, i've become unsure of whether or not to buy sightstone. The amount of health it gives makes your heals less effective, yet it is a core supp item. Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2014-09-27T05:44:06.752+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sightstone is only 150 HP, that only tacks an extra 15 HP onto your W costs. That isn't like most tank items that would be tacking on an extra ~50 per cast. (Or extra 100 in the case of a Warmog...) Now the argument could be made that you'd never want to upgrade to the Ruby Sightstone though.\n\nNot to mention your recovery via Q shots landing on champions scales on missing health so you will often be getting 50% of your AP value back on top of the flat amount from the passive dependent on W rank. Thus something like Rylai's that adds 40 HP cost to your W is also adding another 40-80 potential healing from Q shots landing.\n\nYou are only penalized for building straight tank items that grant health and resistances.","replies":[]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-09-27T05:10:35.357+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vision control is worth a fuck ton more than than tiny changes in the relative power of a support's heal.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-27T07:00:26.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. thanks for the info.

So when your in the midst of battle healing your allies and your trying to get that little bit of health back...well... \nI had a Jinx yell at me mid game for an inadvertent triple kill on my part. \n\nSo play a little bit of Psychology with your Q. Your Q can be easy to dodge, but you can force a dodge that causes them to overextend, or put them perfectly in a position for your ADC to kill. Don't forget your Q is also a wonderful escape mechanism. The little bit of Zig they have to do to get around it can be the difference between survival and death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2014-09-28T01:29:26.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard someone suggest spirit visage as an item.

Since I'm a dedicated healer, I cant help unless they being damaged/focused. \n\nIMO, half the issue is that to many don't know how to lane with her either. \n\n**My tip:** If your the adc, try to trade a little bit between the enemy adc when it feels appropriate. So long as the pressure is off me, my heal will out scale any damage you receive.\n\n**Think of it this way. Instead of dealing 500 damage to you, they only deal 100 damage \"indirectly\" to me.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quantum Weeb","date":"2014-09-27T16:37:55.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, lots of good stuff here.
