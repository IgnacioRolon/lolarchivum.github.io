This of course isn&#039;t applicable to everyone because some people are too young and/or live with their parents, are in college and have no insight on how expensive life is going to be after with their loyal companion student loans, or are rich/bastard children of rich parents and don&#039;t need to do anything important.\n\n1. Buy things in bulk that you use often that doesn&#039;t have a short enough expiration date so you end up having to throw it away later, such as soap, tea, toilet paper, water bottles if you don&#039;t like drinking tap water, tissues, shampoo, toothpaste, tampons, etc, some food can also be bought in bulk if you plan on cooking in bulk as well.\n\n2. Cook your own food, it is one of the cheapest forms of healthy food that isn&#039;t highly processed and won&#039;t kill you 10-20 years down the road. For example I can cook 8 meals of pork bolognese with carrots, onions, and lacinato kale for $20, making it $2.50 a meal of healthy veggies, pasta, and pork, basically the same price of a Lean Cuisine except I know what is going in it and I actually get full from it. Look up your favorite and easy to make recipes and make them often, freeze the leftovers and voila, you save a lot of money and eat better. Cooking takes more time but there are simple and fast recipes that are still tasty and good for you that won&#039;t break the bank. Sure I can get a sandwich for $7.50, but that is 3 meals worth of food and that adds up in the long run.\n\n3. Try to buy things that you need on sale, a lot of stuff is always discounted somewhere at sometime, also if you plan on buying something that is buy one get one free, don&#039;t forget to take the free item, it doesn&#039;t cost you anything but people still forget to take it. The more effort you put into researching, the better the payoff you can get, for example I got a $800 set of pots and pans for $200 on Amazon, still new.\n\n4. Make a budget of your finances, it doesn&#039;t need to be horribly complex, but keep track of what you spend your money on such as food, utilities, rent/mortgage, internet bills, credit card debt, student loans, etc, then deduct what you usually spend per month on those things from your income and see how much money you have leftover, if any. If you want to buy something that is expensive or not in your daily living, calculate how much money your paycheck will have left over from work after all other expenses and see if you can afford it, otherwise get it next time when you saved up a bit extra.\n\n5. Try your very best to never over spend, debt sucks and tanks your credit card scores for bigger purchase in the future like houses and cars.\n\n6. If you are poor or starting off on your own for the first time ever, don&#039;t be shy to apply for benefits from the government such as food stamps, they are there for a reason, you don&#039;t need them forever and when you have a big enough income and work hard for it you can always drop them and chances are they won't give you enough to survive solely on it either.\n\n7. Conserve electricity, don&#039;t leave the lights on all day long if you are not using them, try not to go overkill on air conditioners and high end appliances that eat up energy like there is no tomorrow, you don&#039;t need to have the refrigerator at maximum coldness setting too, that usually ends up leaving you with frozen refrigerator food, unplug big using appliances like the AC unit if you have one when you are not using them.\n\n8. A lot of things that you don't even think can be bought online can be bought online and in bulk, for example I bought a 1 lb bag of organic grated ginger for $18 instead of paying $7.99 for a 1.9 ounce jar of non organic ground ginger in the grocery store, if I bought the same amount in the grocery store, I would have paid ~ $63.92 for worse quality food with preservatives. (Ginger is good for baths and Amazon Prime is OP)\n\nThose are some of my methods, any other methods you guys have?\n\nBoi!!!\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pqlIa2I.gif","replies":[]}
