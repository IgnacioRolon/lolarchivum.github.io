Almost anyone can come and go here and believe it or not but you can frequent in more than one board, forum, video game, or anything else.\n\nYou post shitty memes, you post good memes\nYou spam, you post sometimes meaningful discussions\nYou never shut up biased balance discussions\nYou circle jerk\nYou upvote/downvote whore\nYou make art and music\nYou hate and love the moderators/Riot\n\nYou are all very similar and all one big perfectly dysfunctional family, we already have a small enough community, don&#039;t complain about the boards being slow and dead if you light a torch and sharpen pitch forks every time someone from another land comes here and spit in the faces of other places, its just a really bad comedy similar to watching a dog bark in the mirror. Hopefully you learned that too much of something can be a bad thing and having variety can be good.","replies":[]}
