Inhibitors help push further down the nexus and when you take down 2 or more, you have very strong map control and can win the game by pushing down with a Baron buff with an unkillable minion wave.\n\nWith Objectives, they are always useful to go after, but when you only focus on objectives and your teammates keep dying off, that won't help all the time, there always needs to be a balance with it, likewise never focusing on objectives and not pushing down any towers/getting dragons/baron will make the game last for a very very long time because you will never get closer to winning the game and always have to defend from the enemy team and ultimately the loss of the game because you can't push down a nexus or catch up to the enemy team if they took down your inhibitors and you haven't finished the second tier of turrets or worse yet the first tier of turrets. Not taking dragon and ignoring it will lead to further problems as the enemy team will get it and keep staying ahead.\n\nTeam fighting: \n\nCertain targets are a higher priority to deal with first, usually those are the squishies and it can be the supports that are keeping their teammates alive that you should kill before the teamfight or CC during the fight to prevent them from helping and it also is the carry roles that are the most fed or have the most influential team fighting abilities. There are also initiators in the enemy team that will start off the battle that you should disable and screw up their combos first, or counter initiate so your team can get ahead and take out the high priority targets. It can help to know your enemy's abilities to wait for the worst of their combos and then come in when it is done and finish up the fight. Try to keep alive the higher priority targets of your team, even if you are playing the role of the carry, you might not be as fed as your other teammates or you have horrible teamfighting abilities, so in those big bad fights, you should keep alive the ones that run the show even if it means sacrificing yourself for it or you should be getting objectives while everyone is busy if you are behind or your team is strong enough on their own to handle the fights while picking off alone targets. \n\nTerror:\n\nWhen you or another teammate gets really really fed or if you keep winning a lot of all out teamfights, you can end up terrifying the enemy team into surrendering when they lose all hope and are convinced that the game is unwinnable, beware that this is a double edged sword, if you spend all of your time trying to terrify the enemy team and don't get any objectives, some people are too stubborn to give up and can catch up and will then win when you least expect it. Keep pushing those turrets/objectives down because this cements your win, not every game can be won with an enemy surrendering at 20.\n\nTeam Morale:\n\nNo matter what, you are fighting on a 5 man team, and sometimes that can turn into a 1 v 9 when your team morale crumbles apart and everyone is fighting each other instead of the enemy team, and then people will not want to group or fight together or help others out in teamfights and then your success chance plummets and you are waiting for the game to end. Depending on how you behave, you may or may not be able to stop the team from fighting each other and keep their morale up long enough to win the game and comebacks can be possible when everyone wants to win. It doesn't always work, and some people just won't stop raging after they see red, and in those cases you should mute them and try your best still, and just hope it somehow works out.\n\nYour Morale:\n\nDon't play on tilt, after you lost a game or a bunch of games in a row, you will feel shitty, and you should take a break so you can be at your best for future games. Remember that you are always going to be in each of your games, and depending on how you behave, that will affect your games as well, raging at your teammates doesn't do much and can set off the chain reaction of rage on your team and then no one will cooperate and play well. When your teammates are bitching at each other and won't listen anymore to you, /mute all the team, because it will only make you more upset and this will help preserve your sanity.\n\nVision: \nUpgrade those damn trinkets, pay attention to what your teammates have gotten, you should usually go for the green stealth ward trinket upgrade if you are not support so you can provide more wards on the map and help your team not get so horribly surprised all the time and sweepers upgrades will help against Teemo's Shrooms/runaway Twitches and Rengars and prepare Dragon/Baron. Don't complain about a dark map if you are not doing your part either, it isn't season 2 anymore where you can have the support buy only wards and light up the map, they can only place 3 wards, which is pathetic, and your not upgraded trinkets don't help as much.\n\nGame Knowledge: \n\nThis game requires you to memorize a lot of things, you shouldn't just know your champion inside and out, you should know everything about your team's champions as well as the enemy team's, from what they build to their cool downs and their damage and the effects of the abilities, you should have a good understanding of what they will do and take the means to counter that or be in sync with your team. Also you can left click on the enemies to learn about their stats and their passives, for example if you want to know if Anivia has her passive on or off, you left click her and it will have its passive blue and lit up, or you can find out which shaco is real or not by seeing the clone having much lower stats than the original as well as it taking a noticeably greater amount of damage than the original.\n\nTrolls:\n\nShit happens, people afk, people feed and create unfavorable outcomes, but you should remember that it happens and you should just report and move on and not say anything about it. Your good behaviors can sometimes stop someone from trolling, but it can still happen regardless, just accept whatever happens and move on, the more you play, the less of a percentage of games are ruined by them. Remember, no one can win every single game.\n\nTL;DR: There are a lot of things you can do to help you win your games, you can do it, I hope some of it was helpful!","replies":[]}
