I notice no lag while gaming and it's much easier to game when the tv is mounted because before it was higher up on a stand and I had to tilt my neck and part of the  screen was covered in plastic.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/C1Vc0x1.png[/img]\n\nAll those years of never upgrading my phone and smart budgeting has paid off, woohoo!\n(I only had two smart phones, a galaxy s4 and a galaxy s6 I just recently got for a $5 upgrade)","replies":[]}
