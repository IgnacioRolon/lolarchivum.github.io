They have this expectation that my ultimate has a 2500 range and I can ult Lux from Fog of War or that she cant cleanse my ult.\n\nI should have just /mute all at that point, if my teammates are that derpy then there is no point to listening to their drivel.\n\nCan Riot fucking nerf this shit?\n\nWill I get teammates that know how to spell their own names? \n\n\n-Yenn","replies":[]}
