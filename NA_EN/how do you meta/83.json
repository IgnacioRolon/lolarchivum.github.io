Another problem is a lot trickier to get rid of is the MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attack, but that requires me to talk to my providers personally to ask them to get me a new encryption key as mine is corrupted now.\n\nAgain, I hope it helps! East Coast pings suck enough as it is already, it sucks even more when there are things interfering with it such as greedy asshole ISPs.\n\nFunny thing is that I did the job of the support team...granted they might have responded with similar ideas, I doubt I would have been given much if any information because the last time I sent in those diagnostics, none of them read it and told me about the issues I found out for myself. Shrugs.\n\nEdit: If you are having trouble connecting to a game and saying you have been disconnected from the internet, follow these steps:\n\nGo to Command Prompt as Admin\nType:\nipconfig /release (hit enter)\nipconfig /flushdns (hit enter)\nipconfig /renew (hit enter)","replies":[]}
