Probably a glitch that will never be fixed.\n\nThis is her Q on the client\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1UQysih.png[/img]\nI mean...I have no idea what the information on her ability such as its ratios or base damage but at least now I know that an auto attack decreases its cd?\n\nI dont understand why I have to go to third party websites to find out information about the game itself because there is hardly any effort put into these descriptions. On the client it's even worse because they try even less. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to be a new player without any access to the champions information until they find a third party website themselves. ","replies":[]}
