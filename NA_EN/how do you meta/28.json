Watching someone melt under his full barrage is so fun, and he's actually one of the few champions I have a Quadra kill with (blind Q'd over a jungle wall for the triple, dropped the pool in a bush for the Quad on the fleeing support), but I find him rather... odd unless I get lucky. For one thing I find it nearly impossible to land his Q during laning phase. I have to be able to tell that the enemy is tunnel visioning to get them. The cast animation is so clear, and it gives so much warning, that you can't even really lead it because they'll just stop moving and it'll still miss. Trying to drop his pool and hit them with Visions before your ult usually gives them too much time to get out of range, and more often than not I ult someone when they're JUST out of range of the pool I dropped, or I ult them and accidentally click somewhere or hit an ability in the wrong order and completely waste my ult.\n\nBut when you're doing good with him, it just feels so damned amazing. His Visions will cut through almost anyone, his pool cuts through the rest, and you can spend all game making life awful for one member of the enemy team over and over and over. It's like Veigar but with slightly more utility.","replies":[{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2015-01-09T08:45:08.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See for me I don't find difficulty with landing his Q and using his abilities to the best potential, for some reason he clicks with my play style really well and I find him super fun because of that.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-01-09T08:48:28.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=How Do You Meta,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Iys8sXEp,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-01-09T08:45:08.264+0000)\n>\n> See for me I don't find difficulty with landing his Q and using his abilities to the best potential, for some reason he clicks with my play style really well and I find him super fun because of that.\n\nI can lead a Veigar W or land a Lee Sin Q 9 times out of 10, but if you ask me to hit a Malz Q more than 50% of the time I just plain can't do it. I feel like if they increased the speed of the cast by a smidgeon it'd make him SO much better.","replies":[{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2015-01-09T08:51:33.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is like Nami's bubble, you usually cast it behind the enemies because they instinctively turn back when they see it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-01-09T09:04:56.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=How Do You Meta,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Iys8sXEp,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-09T08:51:33.242+0000)\n>\n> It is like Nami's bubble, you usually cast it behind the enemies because they instinctively turn back when they see it :)\n\nSee, I do that but it ends up missing anyways. Either they catch onto it and simply stop moving, so it passes in front of them, or they're still able to react quick enough to get out of the way even when I'm leading it behind them. And that's if I'm not limited by the meh range on it; more often than not I'm having to cast it at max range and hope because getting in any closer is a death sentence.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-01-09T11:04:04.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Landing Malzahar's Q, outside of situations where they are actively running away or actively chasing, is totally hit or miss as it relies on your opponent reacting incorrectly.  That said you have to understand that it isn't like other skill shots.  It's actually strongest in team fights where enemies are clumped up.  It also wins 1v1 fights even when you don't have your ult because you can drop it on your opponent do huge damage and cripple them with silence while visions and ignite finish them off.\n\nAlso keep in mind that his Q is a great tool to dissuade opponent movement.  I've saved teammates who were being chased with it more times than I can count.  It either lands and takes a ton of their life causing them to rethink their chase or they see it and stop chasing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2015-01-09T09:07:58.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, I don't have that problem often enough, sometimes early game I use it to push the wave a bit to pass along the visions faster to the enemy as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-09T08:51:52.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh, havent ever gotten to play malz but i worryabout being able to land Qs as well\n\nBut im certainI can totally do the EWR","replies":[{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2015-01-09T08:53:45.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to play unpredictably so I don't set up my combo for an R so they escape, sometimes I just E R them or even R them with the R spewing out a voidling and THEN putting my E on them and watch them pointlessly try to flash away and still die from its DOT, I am just evil I guess ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-09T08:25:19.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some reason mobile melees and immobile casters appeal to me \nso Malzahar has definitely been on my radar... thats not a good thing tho\n\nCuz that means something I found OP about him that caught my attention :DDD","replies":[{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2015-01-09T08:26:37.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is so freaking fun omg :D","replies":[]}]}]}
