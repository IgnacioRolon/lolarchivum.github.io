If champions have invisible projectiles, then well thats not too bad because it's just a part of their base kit. If a skin gives you an advantage then there is a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Squey","date":"2016-12-13T00:40:06.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they will probobly fix the lux skin because it is known to offer an advantage. My complaint is other champs having abilities that cant be seen on lower graphic setting that wont get fixed. for example You can  not see ekkos animation of casting his stun bubble at all on the lowest settings.
