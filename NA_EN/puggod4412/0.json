Everything is fine in champion select. As soon as we get to lobby, BOOM black screen! Few minutes later, my friend says the game has started.....Still black screen.... A few minutes later when they remake....Still  black screen. Eventually I open task manager and close league. I comeback to see I have afk penalty... I'm being punished for your client acting up? I honestly don't think that's very fair... Having to wait 20 min 5x even though I didn't afk. The only thing I did was try and fix the bug before they remade but with no success.","replies":[{"poster":"AJRA2k16","date":"2017-01-22T04:11:54.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to me as well.Earning  a leavebuster due to that \"black screen\" issue isn't fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MegaV78G87","date":"2017-01-21T18:05:30.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is something on the server side because this issue is happening more and more, but only today and it is not in just one area.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T18:08:29.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A constant connection is required to run League in-game and via client, so connection issues are super common here.
