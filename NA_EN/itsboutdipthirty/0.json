I switched to windowed mode and back and it fixed the screen issue, but now my mouse, minimap and chat box have shrunk to an irritatingly small size, and on top of that, my mouse has slowed down to the point where I can't play league above a b5 level (not that my silver ass was much better before.) I reset defaults, maxed sizes and speeds on all the settings, and have tried every button on the in game setting page but it hasn't changed a thing. I have forced repatch, logged in on another account, nothing has worked. please help.","replies":[{"poster":"LionHartt","date":"2017-05-09T05:05:35.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem and the only way i can play without problems is in windowed mode but it is so annoying, even my FPS went down and my processor speeds up and Making the battery run out faster, That had never happened to me before, please help us to fix this problem Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vars√≠ty","date":"2017-05-13T04:46:36.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya it seems they are taking forever to fix this i may get decayed cuz of this lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-09T16:45:54.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were some issues where players were seeing a 1/4 screen, which should have been resolved.
