His ult with his W movespeed renders the enemy useless whilst pulling them very far away from their destination. I'd highly recommend not focusing on chasing people because thats generally where most deaths come from on Skarner. With the amount of dashes and hard CC in the game you are more than likely going to get stunned and killed before touching their ADC. Focus on IBG and protect your teammates with permaslow and ulti and you are a very strong useful champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Biggus Fishus","date":"2015-08-01T21:15:29.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please be kind to Skarner. He was once one of my absolute favorite champions ever, but at this point I don't think my heart can handle a 3rd rework. The main things I want to see are making W and E more powerful, and in exchange making Q less overloaded. I consider his E to literally be the worst skillshot ability in the entire game as it currently is, and the only reason I level it at all is because I am forced to in order to have a slow. Oh, and some useabilty for his ult is needed, it's really really bad right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thresh Outta Fux","date":"2015-08-02T13:11:53.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, don't change the current Skarner.
