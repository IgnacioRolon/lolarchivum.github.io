There were no resources spent on Dominion. I expect they cannibalized some of the ancient rusting server hardware that used to run Normals, and that's been the machinery powering Dominion. They probably just took it down because they wanted to recycle them for a tax return. As for network resources, that's a drop of a homeopathic remedy in the ocean that is Summoner's Rift connections.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-02-24T16:24:15.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/ab/50/22/ab5022dc485f229abca86e502d92818f.jpg\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taric the Gay","date":"2016-02-25T21:10:33.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't it obvious?\n\n[http://img1.meristation.com/files/imagenes/general/7770-0954236932-lol_l.jpg](http://img1.meristation.com/files/imagenes/general/7770-0954236932-lol_l.jpg)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2016-02-24T23:06:44.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What resources?

OP's specifically talking about balance updates and new features, neither of which Dominion was receiving. It's possible to convert resources into the desired form, but that requires hiring/training people purely for alternate maps. Considering the only mention of TT in the Dominion retirement announcement was \"it's doing okay for now,\" it doesn't seem like Riot's exactly enthusiastic about spending resources there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-02-25T12:19:19.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ressources? they ignored the map like forever...maybe they can use the intern they had watching the dom-server now have on some redecorations for the office or just making coffee.\n\nand the way they \"balance\" SR i´m rather happy if they just don´t touch TT.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2016-02-24T16:09:32.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dominion resources? rotfl","replies":[]}]}
