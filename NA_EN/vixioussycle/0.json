I have watched tons of videos, matches, interviews of players, and read countless articles in the last few months leading up to this season.  My team of choice is Counter Logic Gaming with Doublelift.  He has the best attitude about the game and a demeanor fitting of a professional.\r\n\r\nI am a geezer when it comes to gaming...  I am 44.  I have been playing video games since they became mainstream.  My house was the first on to block to own a Pong.  My first experience with PVP was Doom2 and Duke Nukem 3D back in the day.  I have owned near every system and played thousands of games end to end from PC to console all the way back to the quarter chomping standups.  There was even a lengthy stint in WoW.\r\n\r\nI will be the first to admit that even with all this experience I can't hold a candle to the youth of the day that are in their prime as professional players.  The reflexes and ability to adapt to conditions on the fly are just not as sharp as \"dem whipper-snappers!\"\r\n\r\nI would however be willing to bet on myself doing well with a team against people that are closer to MY age then my children's.  My oldest is nearly 24.   I would even pay a fee, submit a copy of my state ID, and sign an affidavit to register in such a thing just for a chance to level the playing field a bit and compete against other \"geezers\".\r\n\r\ntl;dr  -  Up vote this only if you think a 30 and over division of League which can lead its way into an LCS Seniors type of thing is a good idea and you would participate.","replies":[{"poster":"VixiousSycle","date":"2015-02-05T20:07:22.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny thing is...  if your lucky enough to live that long, you WILL be a member of the club. \n\n\nWe'll save you a seat, yanno...  just in case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2015-02-05T20:41:23.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i must admit that a lcs league with middle aged players would be great, for those of us that if born in this generation could have been pros. but seriously who would watch it we would make more mistakes because we wont just play league all night and day, we have families wives kids and obligations that teens and 20 somethings dont have. It might be more enteraining that watch us screw up lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2015-02-05T20:37:46.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really so if we are over 30 we must suck cant compete with teens   i call bull   lmao.    ive been playing games longer than most of ppl in league have been alive. and i can compete just fine. id wager that some of us old ppl can prob kick their ass as well. im sry if u feel like fast reflexes diminish that much as u age . sounds like an excuse for poor play to me. Sometimes experience can matter more than youth. im over 35 so i must be a zombie risen from the game in league terms of age lmao  lmao lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2015-02-05T20:05:24.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to see a true LCS Seniors.
