Are you using any third party programs like play.tv, overlays, etc?  They may be causing you problems here, and I recommend removing them.  \n\nFor now you can return to the legacy client in the login screen.  There is an option just below the sign in button.  You'll need to get this fixed up eventually, because you won't be able to use the legacy client forever.  Don't ever play yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Impera Nova","date":"2016-11-16T17:34:07.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client works fine in everything but champion select, it slows down way too much even without anything else open, not everyone can afford a good computer. Will there be a way to turn of absolutely every animation in champion select? so it runs faster? Right now it can take a while to get a champ and change masteries - rune pages while in champ select. (There is an animation turn off button but that doesn't help much)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T17:36:15.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I don't have visibility on this.  You'll want to post this feedback over to the client devs on the [Client Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion).
