I don't have any information on it right now, but the details were forwarded to interested parties for review and is currently a known issue. \n\nThe borderless issue may be due to the current custom resolution issues we've been having for both mac and pc players.  The current workaround is to toggle into a windowed mode instead via Alt+Enter while in game.  I don't have an eta, but a more permanent fix is in the works!","replies":[{"poster":"Christophers","date":"2017-05-05T19:49:53.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you :) do you know when this might be fixed? maybe next patch?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"0 Sensei","date":"2017-05-05T16:44:31.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep.. thats exactly how it look.","replies":[]}]}
