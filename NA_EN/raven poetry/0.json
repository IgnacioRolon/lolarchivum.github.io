How strange.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just finished a match against bots and was surprised and irritated to receive a LeaverBuster warning when I was active the entire match.\r\n\r\nClearly, something is bugged with LeaverBuster. Please pass this along to the appropriate people, since apparently I'm not allowed to post this under bug reports.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Azoray","date":"2018-03-18T21:03:26.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League needs to get rid of lower priority queue. i think its stupid that they have something like this.

Note that the Leaverbuster message was only a warning, so as long as your account doesn't exhibit a trend of going AFK or disconnecting, you shouldn't need to worry about a penalty against your account.\n\nFor a complete rundown on how the Leaverbuster system works, check out [our FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).

I searched for a game as bot and jung as my primary and secondary choices and after 3 ques that never completed due to dodgers, my next Que put me into a random position as support which was a role I never selected; I selected bot and jung. so i was like, \"ok whatever, no big deal I have a decent winrate with sona so ill just pick her.\". went through the ques, then the loading screen then just as the game started, it went straight to the game complete screen where people were chatting about how the game went and i got a leavebuster for 20 min. um, what? After my loading screen finished, you guys literally somehow made me join at the very end of a different ranked game that had been going on... and then you guys punish me for it. This isn't the first time a bug like this has happened to me either and got punished for nothing I did. \n\nIt's bad enough UX design when you die/lose in a game and the it feels like its the games fault rather than your own. But when the game outright punishes you for a 'crime' you never committed due to the game getting confused due to a bug that's the pinnacle of bad design. Also I bought a Riven statue at the LoL championships that has the promo skin code and you guys never gave me the skin. you guys keep giving me the middle finger im gonna have to call it quits.

But i just had the same thing happen to me, i think. \n\nGot a little message at the end of the game where i noticed the term 'Leaver Buster' before it disappeared. Didn't get to read the whole thing. \n\nThing is i was never AFK. I had about 100 ping all game, when usually I'm sitting on 40-50, but never AFK'd and never DC'd. (went 13/4 as draven, so wasn't even a hindrance to the team, in fact quite the opposite.)\n\nA few weeks ago my net was playing up constantly, and caused me to rack up 3 leaver busters in row where i had to wait 20 mins before a game, for 5 games in a row. Talked to my ISP and they seemed to fix the issue. But for one of those leaver busters the same thing happened. Yes i was lagging all game (i think i was spiking between 100-2k ping, a lot worse than the game i just played), but i never afk'd or DC'd. Yet at the end of the game i still got a leaver buster. Im mentioning this for 2 reasons. Firstly because it seems like i've had this happen to me twice now, where the second time i was hardly lagging at all, to the point where my team mates would not have even noticed (used to play with 250 ping back when there were no oceanic servers, so why would it give me a leaver buster for playing at 100 ping). Secondly the message that popped up may have just been telling me that my leaver buster had lapsed or something, where if i leave another game ill be back down to 5 min penalty queues, but i highly doubt that. I'm pretty sure it was a warning message. \n\nI know this is a shot in the dark, but is there some kind of independent check to see if someone is connected to the game or AFK specifically for the leaver buster system, where packet loss for that specific check could cause it to think someone is AFK/DC'd when they aren't?","replies":[]}]}
