I reviewed the League of Legends legal jibber jabber, but I'm still confused if riot allows people to use a clip from there cinematic or not. What I'm trying to do is use the Ahri fighting Darius scene from the League of Legends Cinematic and put it at the start of my video to lead into my Ahri montage. Does Riot allows this? or am I going to run into a copyright issue. If a Dev with knowledge of this topic could let me know it would be greatly appreciated. Any extra information on using League gameplay footage (which I believe is fine) would be welcome as well!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nShawarms","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T20:13:02.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a step ahead by going over the Legal Jibber Jabber page.  Scroll down just a bit down to review video creation guidelines- RIOT GAMES VIDEO CREATION & USE POLICY.  I believe the guide says that as long as you're not using Riot Games logo or receiving monetary gains (without consent) for it then you should be fine.  I do want to make it clear, though, that I'm not part of the legal team so to be safe you should contact us with your question through info@riotgames.com.  \n\nYour question can get fielded to the proper team so we can clarify anything for you (or even update the page if needed).  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Shawarms","date":"2017-02-02T20:46:06.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to respond!
