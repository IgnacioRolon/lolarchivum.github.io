The toxic player will get super fed and then blame his teammates when he dies 1v3 and gets a kill. I've been able to carry 4 players who all got beat in lane badly but were willing to coordinate and work together. The toxic player would likely tilt his teammates and make it so they are less likely to listen and work together.

It will give me some insight into your reasoning. \n\nYou entered a competition where the prize is 100,000 dollars. You are the team captain with sole power to draft whoever you want. Now your pool of choices run the gamut of really chill guys who are less skilled to really skilled hyper antagonistic super competitive players. All the players fall somewhere within these two extremes. During the drafting phase you and the other captain are left to fill the last spot on your respective teams. \n\nAmong the remaining players is a very well known and highly skilled individual. Someone who many people believe will sweep the competition and utterly crush his opponents due to how excessively skilled he is in comparison to everyone else. The problem is that he is known to be very antagonistic in game. He always tries his very best to win but has a tendency to fly off the handle and hurl abuses at his team mates when things don't go well. \n\nYour other choice is a super chill guy who everyone loves. He is very willing to co-operate, takes criticism well. Makes everyone laugh. He is just loved. But he is known for not being very consistent and is generally not considered that good a player. He knows how to play, sure but he is known for losing his lane in 90% of his games. He tends to always be the first to lose his tower. He tends to always leave lane with a score like 0-7. He's doesn't play the macro game too well. He's never where he is supposed to be and his team often loses objectives because of it. Occasionally though, he will do super well and hard carry a game or two but it's always rare sight. And he is also known for very occasional feats of sheer brilliance where he will pull of dazzling game changing outplays, this being the main reason why he is even allowed to compete. He has a lot of potential but is woefully inconsistent in his performances. \n\nNow, if it were me, I want the highly skilled player. I don't care if he tells me to off myself every 5 minutes after the game starts. I want to win and he is the best chance at me winning. I'm not trying to be his friend or anything but I will move heaven and Earth to get them him on my team. We can part ways amicable after. I'm curious, how would you fill your remaining spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-12-15T03:14:32.635+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd take the chill player, obviously.

Also if you're gonna bring pro players into the topic then you have to mention Dardoch. He's a skilled player for sure but he also has a reputation for being difficult to work with behavior wise and has bounced from team to team because of it, currently being on TSM. You are right in that being a skilled player means knowing how to work with others but it also means not flipping out and flaming people whenever they mess up (constructive criticism is fine, destructive criticism isn't). Being skilled at the game is important, but so is having a good attitude. If you develop a reputation for having an attitude problem then it becomes that much harder to find teams willing to play with you compared to those who are both skilled at the game and don't have behavioral issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Balderdash1000","date":"2019-12-28T19:17:32.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prandine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=A57k6jHE,comment-id=00060002000000010000,timestamp=2019-12-28T12:54:58.505+0000)\n>\n>If you develop a reputation for having an attitude problem then it becomes that much harder to find teams willing to play with you compared to those who are both skilled at the game and don't have behavioral issues.\n\nObviously you'll choose the person that is both skilled and easy to deal with if you have a choice, but that wasn't the point of this thread.

You can't pull aside a civil player who's playing poorly and request that they instead behave like an asshole while playing like challenger.\n\nPlaying poorly is also something that a player can't conscientiously change on a dime and it's 100% un-punishable beyond the punishment of losing. Acting like an asshole is malicious and completely within the control of the player, always.\n\nFeeding is not something that is, or should, be punished. The conscious choice to be a dick and attempt to ruin someone else's game is, and should be, punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-12-15T03:11:39.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"[I already addressed a similar point.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/A57k6jHE-poll-which-kind-of-team-mate-do-you-prefer?comment=00040000)","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-12-15T03:20:30.319+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FioraWillCarry,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=A57k6jHE,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2019-12-15T03:11:39.102+0000)\n>\n> [I already addressed a similar point.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/A57k6jHE-poll-which-kind-of-team-mate-do-you-prefer?comment=00040000)\n\nThat doesn't address 2/3's of my point. The only point that addresses is the observation that skill in the game and civility are two different traits. And all you did was confirm the false dilemma by acknowledging the other possible choices based on those two traits.\n\nYou don't address the fact that one is malicious behavior and the other is not, which is what makes one negative quality punishable and the other not. Nor do you address the fact that you're never actually choosing between the two.\n\nYou can't pull aside a player playing poorly, tell them to just play better, and **expect them to magically play better**. If it were as simple as choosing to play better, why isn't everyone in challenger?\n\nBeing a jerk to someone is completely a choice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-15T04:48:37.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to win, but after the match?

But imo, this game is really fun, win or lose. I take small victories, during laning phase, cs leads, farming well, outplaying someone, working with a team, etc. I play the game because I find it fun, otherwise I have plenty of other games I can play. Even if I lose hard, I can always watch my replay and learn from it. I can think about ways I can improve, what I could do to counteract that specific situation, what I could build instead, etc. I focus more on my own play than my teammates, tho this is a team game so I do want us to help each other. Because of that, I don't understand what people mean by \"wasting time\". I don't ever really feel like I'm wasting time (or at least, not any more than playing any other fun games, because playing games or watching TV is technically just \"wasting time\"). I'm not like a saint or anything, I do get frustrated playing sometimes (I won't be toxic to my teammates), but the fun of the game overwhelms my frustrations.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-12-15T12:57:01.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"not going to vote in your poll bc it's designed to give you the answer you want, you're funneling people into saying what you want, kinda sad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-12-15T04:49:48.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"[I had some thoughts about this a while ago...](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1620168)","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-12-16T01:37:51.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Interesting read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-15T04:59:31.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So if you're not as skilled as the competitive player, you're a jerk in his eyes.\nAnd if you're not as kind to the social player, you're a jerk in his eyes.\n\nThe point being that neither is objectively better, it's just a matter of preference, I take it?","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-12-15T05:08:35.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightsky Pirate,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=A57k6jHE,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2019-12-15T04:59:31.408+0000)\n>\n> So if you're not as skilled as the competitive player, you're a jerk in his eyes.\n> And if you're not as kind to the social player, you're a jerk in his eyes.\n> \n> The point being that neither is objectively better, it's just a matter of preference, I take it?\n\nYep.
