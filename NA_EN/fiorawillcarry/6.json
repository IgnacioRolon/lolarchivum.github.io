It's easier.\n\nFair enough. I appreciate what you guys are saying but not playing Azir is totally out of the question. If I have to get out of Bronze, its gonna be with Azir or not at all.\n\nAnd by the way, I mained Akali before. I have over 250K on her and she, like Katarina is traditionally considered a pub stomper and she didn't help me get out of Bronze. I also play other cheesy champions like Irelia, Garen and Yi. I'm telling you, its not about the champions. Funny think is, I have the most success with Azir. I have a winrate above 50% with Azir and I'm currently maintaining that over many games with him, something I can't do with any other champion. You should have seen my ranked stats for Akali last season when I spammed her relentlessly, it was atrocious. I think I was at like a 15% win rate with her or something terrible like that.\n\nAside from all that, I don't see what the big deal is. I'm Bronze and I'm fine with that. Nothing I can do that will immediately make me Gold. I don't lose sleep over the fact that I'm not talented enough to get out. Losses are frustrating yes, no denying that but over all, I'm having fun and that's good enough for me. Sure, It'll be nice to rise, but if I don't, its no big deal. Some people are more talented than others. Bronze to you might be ez pz but for me its the hardest thing in the world. I have other things I'm really good at, video games may not be among them. Its cool. I just wanna have fun.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-03-16T15:25:14.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Dunk God,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=o0x3zZk0,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-03-16T12:02:59.020+0000)\n>\n> or don't play azir in bronze 5.\n\nWhen pigs bark.

Even that one. Except I get {{item:3027}} instead of Seraphs. My reasoning is that it helps get him tanky without sacrificing damage. {{item:3027}} is the only item apart from {{item:3089}} that gives a flat 120 AP, it has to be fully stacked of course. The passive on Catalyst/ROA also acts as a kind of sustain for him in lane. Azir has really really terrible sustain and spellvamp doesn't work well on him at all due to the fact that his main damaging spell is Aoe which cuts spellvamp to a 1/3 of its power.\n\nI'm curious, why do think {{item:3003}}/{{item:3040}} is better on him.

Not to mention {{item:3040}} fully stacked gives around 150 AP and all the mana you'll ever need.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-03-17T09:54:36.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L0RD AZIR,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=o0x3zZk0,comment-id=000700000001,timestamp=2016-03-16T16:13:45.941+0000)\n>\n> If you run {{summoner:3}} and build {{item:3040}} you basically have 3 summoner spells {{summoner:21}} {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:4}}.
