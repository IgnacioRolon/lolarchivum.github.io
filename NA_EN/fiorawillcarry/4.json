I took a break from Ranked play and spammed normals. Couple days ago I decided to try for Gold. However, that hope was quicky dashed as I got team after team of extreme feeders until I fell all the way to Silver 5 again. \r\n\r\nNow at this point, I&#039;m tempted to just right it off as something out of my control. I mean, nothing I can do if I get feeders right ? But I thought about all the countless threads on the internet where someone complains about bad teams and some high elo player always says it can be carried if they&#039;re good enough. As such I decided to start exploring how.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I&#039;m racking up a considerable amount of reports due to this exploration. I&#039;m trying all manner of differing tactics in an effort to find a way to carry bad teams. For example, a couple games ago, my team started feeding, so I decide to try getting a lane ahead by sacrificing my lane to camp bot. It didn&#039;t work and we lost. I was blamed for giving up top for nothing so...reported. Another game, I started exploring hyper-farming. Basically, when my team starts feeding, I just start farming any and everything while ignoring my team. The idea here is that I&#039;m trying to get my powerspike asap so I can carry against fed enemies. Soon as I get 4 items, I start fighting. Needless to say, my entire team was angry as fuck that I was ignoring them and taking all the jungle monsters. I&#039;m 100% sure they all reported me.\r\n\r\nIf I keep getting reported for this, will I get some kind of penalty eventually ?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-05T08:34:00.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The instant feedback system isn't going to get you for that (unless you are flaming or inting along with it), but it may eventually trigger a manual review. If the person reviewing you determines that you are intentionally losing games you will be punished, but if what you are saying is true and you are playing to win then you shouldn't.\n\nAlso, when playing from behind as a top laner it is best to play passively and farm without getting caught out until you find a good chance to rotate. Don't worry so much about powerspikes because the enemy isn't going to wait for your powerspike to kill your team. Wait for good situations to fight or take objectives.\n\nIf you keep doing the same thing in one match you become predictable. If you start camping a lane they will play safe and you won't get a good opportunity from it. If you keep farming all game then they will notice you have no presence and roam without worrying. Stay flexible within a given match.","replies":[{"poster":"wei270","date":"2017-08-05T09:09:13.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"actually if seems if there is enough number of reports in enough number of games you can get punished for anything as long as it is consistent. so if everyone is constantly reporting you for playing teemo every game then you get punished for playing teemo","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-05T10:04:21.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you show me evidence supporting your statement?\n\nAny cases or statements from someone who worked on the system?","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2017-08-05T17:35:43.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2oZE0tK1,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-05T10:04:21.892+0000)\n>\n> Can you show me evidence supporting your statement?\n> \n> Any cases or statements from someone who worked on the system?\n\nSmite support singed and nunu were both punished due to being reported in over half of their games, because they /muted all on top of their off meta strategy","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-05T17:51:59.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those have both been talked about in length by reds and are edge cases at best.\n\nOne of them even had the punishment revoked.","replies":[{"poster":"wei270","date":"2017-08-05T23:42:14.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but remember they were first punished then the player apply for it to be revoked so the automated system does punished the way it punishes you\n\nstill i mean getting reported that much and that often is pretty much the outlier cases, one have to really really try and then try some more.

The case of_ “Unusual Pick that Throws A Game on Its head”_ vs _“The Teammates going WTF Is Going On”_.\n> \n> [If you’re just tuning in we previously covered this topic with a similar case in December: “Support Singed isn&#x27;t bannable, but that&#x27;s not the point”. ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/79aGu3wR-support-singed-isnt-banable-but-thats-not-the-point?comment=006b) \n> \n> We feel that the situation between these two edge cases are very similar. But it’s obvious we need to keep updating a few processes to smooth out any rare repeats in the future. And rare is what we’d call this; it’s a very unique edge case that seems to only present itself once every few months among thousands of audits that we process. \n> \n> Let’s re-iterate our stance from before:\n> \n> **Q: Can I get banned for choosing a champion or strategy that is outside the current meta?**\n> \n> A: 100% no. Choosing a champion or strategy outside of the current meta is not a factor we take into account when reviewing accounts. On any given day tens of thousands of players are making unusual picks in the game and they’ll never receive penalties in any form.  \n> \n> **Q:  So why does this issue keep coming up?  What makes it different?**\n> \n> A: Riot Gromp said it best in the previous post when they stated: “...common sense and good sportsmanship say that experimenting players need to clearly communicate intent and win conditions to their teammates.” League of Legends is a team game and sometimes the biggest challenge can be coordinating with 4 other strangers who share a common goal; victory. If a player is going to rewrite the rules for the rest of their team then there is more pressure to properly communicate to everyone what they want the plan to be, and what they think everyone should do to achieve it.\n> \n> But wait! Communication doesn’t stop after you press the Enter button on your keyboard; and that’s where we saw a problem in this particular case. All of us need to be aware of the difference of communicating “with” someone vs. communicating “at” someone. _Telling your team what you’re going to do and then ignoring them isn’t really working with them it’s holding them hostage_. Telling your team what you want to do and actually working towards a common plan is a central part to playing any team based game.\n> \n> In this case what we observed was an expert Nunu counter-jungler throwing the meta on it’s head with a respectable win rate of 53%. While pretty impressive on it’s own, we also found that nearly 50% of their games were reported by teammates as frustrating and unfun. Keep in mind, this isn’t just teammates in losing games, this is teammates across all of his games; victories included.  \n> \n> The message was pretty clear to us, this player is serious about_ Making Nunu Great Again_ but they are leaving a trail of dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger in their wake.\n> \n> Winning is not the end all be all of League. We want players to have fun but not at the expense of teammates. Ideally this means players will coordinate among themselves in a given match and react to the unique circumstances they end up in. If a player is consistently forcing “their vision” on the rest of the team **and **refusing to adapt to their needs we reserve the right to intervene. That’s what happened here (and before with the Singed case); players cried out how terrible the experience was for them and we intervened.\n> \n> Moving forward we’re going to keep updating our processes for these edge cases. We will still be on the lookout for situations where a player is creating a really negative experience for everyone else and we will intervene when necessary.  In this case it’s undeniable that TakeTheDraw wants to win even if their approach leaves a lot to be desired.  The effects on others in his games were enough for us to lock the account and we stand by that.  But our agents were not properly prepared with a process to handle this edge case when they wrote in and that is on me.  I will be working with the team to clarify an escalation process that emphasizes clearer feedback and opens the door for ban reductions if we believe that someone can make changes to their play style allowing them to continue crushing the meta but not at the expense of their teammates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-08-05T13:08:22.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if that's true.
