Like Elise or Nidalee.\n\nElise isnt more difficult at atll and nida is hard jsut because u need to compensate numbers with your own skills, the same goes for examply with yasuo, who isnt so difficult in term of using spells independently on enemy but when it comes to beating opponents, many Yasuo players fails.\nUsually when someone talks about skill floor/ceiling he ignore fact that effort one need to put in champion even after nearly mastering that champion is also thing and something I like to call as a \" SKILL SUCCESS POINT\" that I think of a certain degree of skill one needs to do well in match-up independently whether he uses or not his kit effectively. Take Aatrox as example, his skill floor, that is using kit effectively ( hitting sweet spots when possible but ofc. with mistakes in timing ), is high and his skill ceiling, that is using his kit the best way possible ( like doing things so perfectly that only deciding factor left are numbers), is also high but Aatrox player can do well even if he doesn't hit sweet spot a single time ( which I little  exaggerate but you get what I mean). In short sometime skill success point is > than skill floor and sometime its not and some time its almost equal to skill ceiling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-12-02T18:42:48.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ranga116,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mIzzAcY2,comment-id=0021,timestamp=2019-12-02T12:38:59.056+0000)\n>\n> Simple answer because hes very overpowered and very easy to play doesn't require much effort or skill plus he does kinda look cool\n\nClueless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fraggleroc","date":"2019-11-30T23:22:53.676+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everyone wants to be a Tian.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenarin","date":"2019-12-01T18:04:20.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been seeing him a lot, but also stomping him.

As a jungler you will never find Lee absurdly strong because if he is carrying hard he might be a dedicated player, but as statistics shows his performance level is basically the same as a **kogmaw in diamond elo** it is NOT a good bet.\n\nIt's more about the laners who are complaining here. But is Lee sin more absurd than the stuff that is popular in the current meta? **NO.**","replies":[{"poster":"Tenarin","date":"2019-12-02T02:27:13.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee Sin's balance is an interesting topic.  I argued for a long time that he's broken and has been for years.  After really studying him in games while climbing from silver 3 to almost plat these past few weeks (new account) I realize what it is.  It's not really that he's OP, it's just that in low elo people rely heavily on turrets, and he's very strong at diving early on.  \n\nSo I basically feel like it really throws off low elo people when this guy dives turret, jumps to teammate, or ward, gets that shield or w/e takes turret shots, kills, but is able to fly back out of there before that killing turret shot gets him...it just kind of shocks people.  So basically the only OP thing about him is his ability to dive early on and survive.  It's not really broken or unbalanced though because a lot of champs have this ability late game...he just has it early game instead.  He gets so weak later.  If you can make it to like 25 minutes he's already falling off.  So he needs a MASSIVE lead and to end fast.  \n\nSo I feel like he's just kind of Vayne's opposite...she can do insane things late as he can early.  A lot of champs are like this but those 2 are just really unbalanced at certain times of the game, but not unbalanced overall as champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
