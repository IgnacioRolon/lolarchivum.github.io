It's more of an indicator than anything.\n\nWould you consider e.g. Annie's stun counter and Rumble's heat bar to be indicators or resources? Graves expends his ammo to deal damage and can regenerate it by waiting or by using abilities, just like mana, energy, or Jhin's ammo. I think it still counts, even if only to two. :P","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2020-01-18T14:39:21.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, Graves, Annie, and Jhin already have mana as a resource. Rumble is the only one for whom a solid argument can be made for heat being a resource. In general, I don't think we are meant to consider any champion as having multiple resources in the likes of mana, energy and rage(Tryndamere and Shyvana).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
