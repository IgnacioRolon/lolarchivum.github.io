But Jungle ? Eh....just no. Teemo is DPS champ. If you want DPS, it's better to go with Kindred. The problem with this shit pick is that it's redundant. You already have an ADC that provides DPS and most likely a mage mid or top to provide magic damage. We don't need another magic damage DPS champ, we need some kind of CC, hard engage, peel.....something useful. You know how fuckin hard it is to go against a team that picks Sejuani or Amumu for their jungler and you have a Teemo. He just provides more damage, which most likely he nor any of the other carries on your team could apply because your team lacks peel or hard engage. We don't need 3 carries. We need champs to help the carries do their job and deal damage. Even assassins like Rengar and Khazix are far more useful in that they can eliminate the enemy carries. Teemo is just fuckin useless as a jungler. He brings nothing that your typical team comp wouldn't have in the lanes. Nothing at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-05T02:27:43.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bloodrazor is awesome on him.
