I guess not, though.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2020-01-18T20:44:30.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=E5uaEmrI,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2020-01-18T20:23:19.255+0000)\n>\n> basic human courtesy might still have provided a reason for you to behave.
