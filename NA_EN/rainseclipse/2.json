When it does this it's like a lag spike but it's only the animation of my champ (spells take 2-3 seconds to work after I've already clicked them, champion doesn't move for a couple seconds, etc.). I've noticed it mostly on Summoners Rift (both the winter and regular map) and in a couple Arams as well. \nThere's been times my champion just runs towards the enemy team then just stands there. I try clicking around and I cannot move at all (everything else is still moving in real time, I just can't move my champion). \n\nMy ping has been a steady 50 throughout the game so it's not an internet issue. This also started happening with the newer patch, I didn't have any issue like this before that. \n\nDoes anyone know of a fix for this issue? Or is it a server issue that we're just going to have to patiently wait for Rito to fix?","replies":[{"poster":"RainsEclipse","date":"2017-01-08T23:15:23.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Fun story short, the issue has yet to be resolved.
