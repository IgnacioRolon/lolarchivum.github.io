Do you have Windows 10?  A recent update has been causing similair issues with freezing as a result of the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) game auto-enabling.  Disable that as a first step to clear the freezing issues.\n\nI then suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up any issues blocking your connection to the game server and restore access.
