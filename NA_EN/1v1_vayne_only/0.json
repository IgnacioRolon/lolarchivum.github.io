I was doing my best to remain calm and just finish out the game although I will admit I was getting flustered when he started trolling and left lane.\r\n\r\nAfter the match I reported him and got report feedback thanking me because the negative player was punished, but then I got Perma banned also right after.\r\n\r\nI will show you the chat logs, I&#039;m sorry but I hardly think this warrants a perma ban, although I would settle for a chat lock or something.

Permanent ban\n\nEvery time you get punished, you move up one tier in the ladder, regardless of how minor the offense may have been. This means that whatever can get you a chat restriction can get you a permanent ban, if you do it frequently enough. Also, it is possible to skip the cat restrictions and be escalated straight to a 14 day or even a permanent ban if your behavior is severe enough.\n\nWith that in mind, it's more of a question of \"do these chat logs deserve a punishment?\" rather than \"do these chat logs deserve a permanent ban?\" If they do deserve a punishment, then what punishment you get is determined by your history with the system.\n\nI would say these logs do deserve a punishment. You're constantly arguing and insulting your teammates throughout pretty much the entire game. Doing that does nothing to help improve the situation, it just makes a bad situation even worse. Since you mentioned that you had a 2 week ban already, then the standard next punishment is a permanent ban.\n\nAlso, the e-mail and reform card you received for your 2 week ban informed you that if you don't reform your behavior, your next punishment would be a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"1v1 Vayne Only","date":"2016-10-06T16:31:05.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly I was already depressed this morning, I was excited I got silver II and this guy ruined my game, and also my entire short term life because league is the only thing I had to look forward to today. \n\nI am honestly struggling with suicide and I can't even log on to play when I've been doing so well in game.

I know it's far from a perfect solution, but you can play on a different account, just remember to not flame or insult anyone. If you absolutely have to, you can /mute all at the beginning of each match and just rely on pings to communicate.\n\nAlso, if you are struggling with suicide, I really suggest seeking out professional help. It's a very serious issue, and I know that life can be really hard to deal with sometimes. It's something that I have struggled with for years, and I didn't start dealing with it until I finally told someone and talked to someone about it. I mean, it doesn't have to be professional help, but try to talk with someone close to you, like a family member or close friend. I know it can be scary, but it does help in the long run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-06T20:11:52.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can still play.\n\njust start a new account.\n\nthe joy of a F2P game.\n\nIf you were doing that well, then getting up there again wouldn't be hard.\n\nthen again, the point of permabanned you is to get you to stop playing league and go elsewhere.

You are clearly toxic and this game doesnt need anymore people like you.  If someone is toxic to you or feeds, mute them and report them after the game, it wont happen every game so move on.  Its hilarious when people try to get unbanned and them post their chat logs obviously showing how toxic you are.  Enjoy your ban and seek medical attention, you are a troubled person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-06T15:31:06.604+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"You were negative to your team the entire game and did nothing but harass them about things the messed up on.
