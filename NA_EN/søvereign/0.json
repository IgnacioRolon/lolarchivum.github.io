Im pretty sure that you know more about lore than me, But... I dont think that they are given powers from the same \"beings\"... because, as far as i know, Stars are not beigns. They most likely get their powers from the same _source_, but in different ways. The Sun and Moon are not sentient creatures that can give power, Targonians and Ascended are taking the power from those sources. Even if the Targonians inside Leona and Diana say that they are the Sun and The Moon, they arent, they are living beings, not literal satelites and stars.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-06-25T23:46:45.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just my personal theory,thats why I say \"most likely\",because I am sure that they are related,but we don't know the exact circumstances.\nShould have probably worded it a bit better.\n\nEitherway we really don't have that much of an info about the exact nature of the aspects,we don't know how the aspect of the sun actually relates to the sun itself or where the power that transforms the ascended is actually coming from.\n\nHowever the way they describe the ascension ritual it sounds to me like the sun judges someone if they are worthy or not,thats why everyone says that ascension is \"earned\",so it does look like a sentient being oversees the ritual.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-06-25T23:59:17.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=f5QMoGpx,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-06-25T23:46:45.494+0000)\n>\n> Its just my personal theory,thats why I say &quot;most likely&quot;,because I am sure that they are related,but we don&#x27;t know the exact circumstances.\n> Should have probably worded it a bit better.\n> \n> Eitherway we really don&#x27;t have that much of an info about the exact nature of the aspects,we don&#x27;t know how the aspect of the sun actually relates to the sun itself or where the power that transforms the ascended is actually coming from.\n> \n> However the way they describe the ascension ritual it sounds to me like the sun judges someone if they are worthy or not,thats why everyone says that ascension is &quot;earned&quot;,so it does look like a sentient being oversees the ritual.\n\nWell, Xerath (technically Renekton) proved that the Sun doesnt really judge anyone or anything, that anyone can do the ritual and get powers from it... If the Ritual goes wrong, then they can say that they were not worthy or something. But we dont know if that is true.\n\nAnd even if the Sun itself were a sentient being, it would not be a Targonian.
