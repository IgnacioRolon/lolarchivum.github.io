I mean once you get this high the mechanics are going to be there for basically everyone. Wouldn&rsquo;t crazy good macro play from god support players climb higher/faster since they can set up their team? \r\n\r\nI main ADC and you eventually realize that supports are 80-90% of the lane. Whenever we get ahead in lane it&rsquo;s mainly because of my support setting me up. I&rsquo;ve always thought about switching but idk if I should. What do you think about this? Once you get higher elo do you think support is best to climb with?","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-03-23T03:48:09.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel supports/jg are the best for high elo, although 'high elo' relative to the majority of the player base and 'high elo' in absolute terms can mean different things.\n\nWhich of the two are most impactful probably depends on exactly how high you go. Would suggest support is best at highest end (people will probably make the most of the plays you set up, and supports tend to have better playmaking tools), while jg is better at the lower end of that range (you can still do things by yourself if it comes to it, even if you can't set up quite as well as supports).\n\nedit: This all assumes you can play those roles at a correspondingly high level of course. People generally aren't going to role swap and start suddenly being able to carry games just because their role might have more mapwide impact. If you can play adc at a high plat level, you're probably more likely to get over the hurdle to d5 by continuing to adc and sharpening your skills there, rather than learning the nuances of another role andd climbing with that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-23T03:09:48.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Whenever we get ahead in lane itâ€™s mainly because of my support setting me up.\n\nA miracle!\n\nAre all ADCs in plat this aware of supports existing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-03-23T02:53:29.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that jungle is the best to climb with, but support is a close second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"catastrophicSkil","date":"2018-03-23T03:03:31.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"High elo isn't until diamond 2+ mechanics at plat are still bad and have lots of room for improvement.\n\nIdk anything about bot lane all i know is the bot lane is the most impactful lane currently if bot wins usually the team wins. Even though support matters if they are the reason you are winning/losing the lane there is probably a good chance your doing something wrong because you're in control of how you clear the waves how you prep them freezing/pushing and how you interact with the it. You may be thinking its just CSing but its a more important than you think. How you control a wave will dictate how the junglers will respond and how the laner plays. This doesn't just apply to bot lane this applies to every lane in general.\n\nIt seems kinda obvious and basic but so many players don't know how to manage their lanes/proper back timers/proper trading/warding/ map awareness/pushing limitations like there is so much players dont do even in high mmrs like diamond and masters. If you don't believe me go watch a challenger stream count how many times a \"high elo\" player screws up even in a matchup they are supposed to win. Even in the LCS you can clearly see mechanical disparities between players. If you believe you mechanics are good thats a problem because it simply isnt true. Not that you can't be capable of pulling off high mechanical plays but I promise you that you're not even close to consistent.\n\n\nThe next best role to carry in is mid. There are a number of mobile and high impactful champs {{champion:13}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:4}} and then there are a number champions that scale really well that are meta like {{champion:112}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:69}} i mean just about every mid laner out there is good right now","replies":[]},{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2018-03-23T02:52:03.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not high elo.. I do have 4k+ hours played though so thats there, if it matters to you I'll say that In My Opinion if played right, support can easily the biggest game changing role for many reasons. You'll even probably get more respect and feel better about being a support carry, I know I appreciate support mains, it's a great role as long as communication isn't a problem for you and your team8s.","replies":[]}]}
