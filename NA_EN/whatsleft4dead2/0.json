Tell me why I get into another game and my reroll is gone? I have dealt with playing champions I wasn't in the mood to play for about 12 matches straight and finally get the reroll for a chance to get someone Ill probably enjoy....and *poof* it's gone. I'm sad now.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T21:21:10.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Under normal circumstances, if you're solo, anyone dodging will refund the reroll you used in the previous champ select. Were you in a premade with the person that dodged the match? If someone in your premade dodges, you won't be refunded the reroll from the last champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatsLeft4Dead2","date":"2016-08-09T08:23:49.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I was....but I didn't know that this was a thing. Is this said somewhere in any description or is it only on the website? Pre-game information is nice. \"Oh, if you dodge this lobby then you will not only gain a wait time but you will also possibly strip earned rewards from others you pair yourself up with. Take this into consideration before you Start a Queue and decide to Leave.\" RiP My feelings. Now I have to face the struggle. {{item:3070}} Also: Thanks for getting back with me about it so quickly, it's makes me feel nice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T16:08:32.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our [queue dodging guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging)goes over penalties for dodging in a match. It doesn't **specifically** state in plain language that \"if you're in a premade and someone in it dodges, you'll lose any rerolls\", but the system sees it as your *premade* group is dodging, therefore rerolls are forfeited. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatsLeft4Dead2","date":"2016-08-14T21:04:08.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, thank you for sending me this. Appreciate the help too! Also, I'm about to post another Help & Support Ticket about missing Ward skins.....Is it ok if I ask you about that here or do you want me to make a new Board post?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T15:37:24.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's fine to ask additional questions about other things you need help with here. We're aware of and are investigating into a visual issue going on that prevents you from seeing ward skins on your profile or in champ select. This only affects certain wards and is only a visual issue, the wards are still on your account, you just cannot see them at the moment. \n\nI cannot provide a timeline on when a fix for this will roll out, but let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatsLeft4Dead2","date":"2016-08-15T16:58:43.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok *Phew* I thought it was just me. Well, you answered all of my questions and helped me understand all of the problems x.x If there was a way to vote the help here on a 5 star scale then I'd definitely hit the 5 star.
