I normally cap my FPS at 60 and it will stay there for my entire game.  After the new patch though my FPS frequently drops to 15-20fps.  It makes the game unplayable as it looks more like a slideshow than a video game.\r\n\r\nI have tried all of the normal suggestions: updating my drivers, uninstalling the game, lowering all of my graphics settings.  Nothing has helped fix this problem so far.  I tried windowed and borderless options and neither of those could change the frequent drops I was getting.  \r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate but I won't be able to play the game until a fix is found for this as it is very unenjoyable to lose fights/games because of a massive fps loss.  I am almost positive it is nothing to do with my machine as I have tried all of the usual fixes and have never experienced this issue with League before.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T02:22:13.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear you've already tried some good basics steps to troubleshoot this on your own. Poor FPS can caused by a few different things and since you've already updated your display driver, I'd say our [**FPS Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) may be the best option at this point. You can skip the steps you've already tried at this point, but you'll want to try the rest to ensure this cannot be easily resolved by working through your windows power settings are background apps.\n\nLet me know if this caused any observable change.","replies":[{"poster":"FelbringerKSR8","date":"2017-01-23T22:18:20.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your response Targons Blade.  I viewed the FPS Guide you linked and tried the suggestions.  Defragged my PC, cleaned my registry, tried turning off game sounds, and turned off all of Windows background options that may be dragging on performance.  None of these made lasting impacts on the FPS drops I've been experiencing.  I still have frequent drops to 20fps and even lower during teamfights.  \n\nI even tried all of these suggestions simultaneously while lowering the graphics options on my computer and it was not effective. \n\nI can post the specs from the diagnostics tests that are linked at the bottom of the guide if necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T23:35:57.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before we take a look at your logs, I wanted to make sure you weren't using the new *Crest of the Rooster* Ward Skin.
