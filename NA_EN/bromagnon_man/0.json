Problem is, like most &gt;18 year olds, I have a job. I really wish there was a place to play with people my age instead of the 15 year olds who come here and cuss, say derogatory, racist things, and are the overall worst behaved people in the community. It&#039;s easy to not get tilted when you live in the real world and have a big boy job, but these preppy high school kids who get everything handed to them don&#039;t seem to be able to take constructive criticism for anything. Makes the games miserable for those of us who play a couple of games every few days and just wanna have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-09-14T20:14:37.686+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be great, except the truth is:\n\nA: Age brackets are unenforceable, kids just automatically enter 18+ any time they see an age check.\n\nB: Adults are trash, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2017-09-14T20:09:06.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bromagnon Man,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EMAmE2lO,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-09-14T20:04:58.355+0000)\n>\n> I really wish there was a place to play with people my age instead of the 15 year olds who come here and cuss, say derogatory, racist things, and are the overall worst behaved people in the community. \n\nSo you can play with people your age that cuss, say derogatory and racist things? Toxic behavior happens at all ages.

I've played with super chill and mature 13-14 year old players, and incredibly toxic 30+ year old players.
