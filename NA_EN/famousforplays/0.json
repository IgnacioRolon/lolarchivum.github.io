Resetting these settings can be done with the steps below:\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n>Delete these two files:\n>- **input.ini**\n>- **PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, leave the custom match, then hop into another one to confirm everything was fixed.\n\nLet me know if this helped resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"FamousForPlays","date":"2016-08-24T18:21:45.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg thank u u dont know how much u helped me <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FamousForPlays","date":"2016-08-24T01:01:51.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant even zoom in","replies":[]}]}
