I checked my connections after my games and they were all well. As i played the screen would freeze for a few seconds or so then return to normal. I thought this had to do with something i downloaded so i uninstalled those programs. I then came back to play and i still experienced the same problem. After games or if i wait for too long at the menu screen, the client would freeze.I wont be able to click anything or even start new matches. It stops responding and shuts itself off. Do you know what this is?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T16:48:59.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen reports of freezing like this, and it looks like a recent update with Windows 10 changed the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) and is causing problems like this.  As a first step, disable it and hopefully the freezing will stop.  I'm glad you also removed some programs, because third party apps like play.tv have been known to cause issues like this.  Let me know if that helps or not!","replies":[{"poster":"CORPZEBOMB","date":"2016-08-26T20:54:51.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i signed out of Xbox on my pc and played a few games. It didnt work at all. My mouse randomly clicks a champion or shop. When i clicked hecarim and went to lock in, it clicked kogmaw out of nowhere. And when i pinged my teammates it kept a dot there instead of saying missing enemies or on my way.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T21:10:44.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
