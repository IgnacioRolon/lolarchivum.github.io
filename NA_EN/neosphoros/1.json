It took me over a  week to get Neo to stop trying to Argue with me that Elo systems cant be used for other games.\n\n> ELO system was \"invented\" for 1vs1 chess games and is has nothing to do with RIOT system (it can not have).\n\nAnd\n\n> I know how \"systems\" works... I do not know how LOL MMR system work (this specific system). \ngeneral assumption of the (traditional) MMR system is to evaluate specific player with his game 1vs1 and it based on ELO that comes from chess system. System ELO does exist also in case of team games but there whole team can be assesed as a whole element not as a single players - which is mean that in the case of randomly slected players - it make no sense at all.\n\nThen when I finally got him to watching a video of some one making and testing a Team Elo system. One that clearly states that for it to function it needs to track each players adjustment separately. So that not every player will have the same MMR stake in a game. He ignored it, completely refused to address why that was necessary. Then went and used the part of the video showing the most common misconception people have for how it works that the author went and mathematically proved DOES NOT WORK. And acted like that's what riot has to be using.\n\nSo for this post.\n\nHow do you Verify if a system uses mmr? Look at the top and bottom of the ranked ladder. Look at the start point for a new account.  Look for who sinks and who climbs.\n\nThere's a few types of rating and ranking systems. Some use EXP = # of games played.  Some are just gloried leaderboards that track # of total wins or kills. \n\nIt is by no means difficult to judge accurate what type of matchmaker/rating/ranking system is used if you know what's out there. Its pretty easy to check. You have expectations for the system. Does the system work to meet those expectations. You Look at the game as a whole not just your personal interaction.\n\n\nHow do you verify that skill matters in a game? Look at yourself. When you first started vs how good you are now. Would 5 starter you ever beat a team of 5 current you if both sides are playing to win?\n\nWhy does Stats not matter to mmr compaired to win rates?  Because mismatched games are hard to judge. In Chess, the Fools mate. White loses in 2 moves.  Almost any one can do this, the requirement is whites just that bad. Its the quickest possible way to win in chess. There's no way to judge black players skill because whites just god awful.\n\nIn league. Its very easy to play for stats. Ward a lot. CS a lot. Use ability's every time they are off CD that you can add to your damage count. Use teammates as meatsheilds and guard your KDA.  Hilariously a lot of folks who only play for stats have awful win rates because they are unwilling to give up stats to actually win a match. Tank a skillshot and die so your carry can live.  Don't spam your ability's constantly, they are not a threat if they are on CD. \n\nAny how. I went over all of this time and time again with neo to the point he just reports me to mods for harassment.\nSo my advice is follow the Universal rules. \n\n> Leave No Player Behind \n> \n> Seek to offer constructive advice in a civil and friendly manner, and understand that things you find obvious about the game, the behavior system, or the Boards community may not be obvious to others. Have a little patience and try to help the player reach a better understanding. At the same time, don’t be discouraged if they aren’t receptive. **Some small percentage of players won’t want to listen to your advice, no matter how politely you try to lend a hand. In these situations, simply exit the conversation gracefully**.\n>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosphoros","date":"2019-01-21T22:09:32.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shiwah,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pmeL9zri,comment-id=0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-21T21:47:34.225+0000)\n>\n> The difference is, we know what matchmaking is based on due to statements back from season 1, you simply refuse to acknowledge it.\n> \n> Now, can you kindly provide papers or statements that prove it&#x27;s not the case?
