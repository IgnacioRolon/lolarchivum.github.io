Combining those two things, it's probably about once a month where my laptop will crash for various reasons, or the internet will go out.  I always try to return, and often do(Got a leaver for one where my Laptop crashed the other day, made it back within 3 mins, won the game, got punished.), but it probably averages out to once a month where I'm actually AFK for the game.\n\nI've also left during loading 3 times in the last year.  Once because I forgot smite when trading to jungle, and twice because issues came up IRL.  Leaving during loading allowed my team to remake the game, rather than auto losing due to my lack of smite or sudden lack of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosphoros","date":"2018-12-07T21:01:19.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there is only 13 players on the forum?
