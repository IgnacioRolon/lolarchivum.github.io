Having played since s2 and been around here a couple years, my Gf has been wanting to try to get into LoL to play with me but does not like the bots.\r\n\r\nWe typically take her into a duo bot or with another friend into normals and try to guide her on how to play, expecting to lose half the time as its a learning experience.\r\n\r\nWe have had a couple games like this already but I will describe the most recent:\r\n\r\nHad a gold nami grouped with her under lvl 30 adc kog(who i assume was banned on a main as he kept insulting), And i was top with my GF mid and my brother in jungle.\r\n\r\nI was against a plat nasus top as annie top, so i already figured he was gonna win lane and carry the game which was fine as we were teaching my GF... HOWEVER....\r\n\r\nAll game their grouped Elise who is silver 5 after 1200 games played continuously said things like \"PLEASE dont even\" or \"2ez\" when she would escape.\r\n\r\nOur bottom duo complained that we didnt ping that nasus walked up to their lane that they overextended with no vision in while all tier 1 towers were down at 20m. They kept asking my GF \" Why pick morg if you can't play her \" \" why didn't you mia\" \"That's a bronze thing to say\"\r\n\r\nWhile i can ignore most of that, shes new and trying to learn and frustrated... and its really sad that i have to teach her how to mute people. I am trying to show her this game as fun to play, and all she sees is the opposite.","replies":[]}
