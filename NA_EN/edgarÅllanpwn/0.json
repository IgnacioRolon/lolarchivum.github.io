It is said that every Lightshield is born with anti-Noxian sentiment in his blood. Jarvan IV is no exception, even though he is the first Lightshield born to the age of the League of Legends.","url":"http://lol.gamepedia.com/Jarvan_IV_-_The_Exemplar_of_Demacia","image":"http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/lol.gamepedia.com/b/bc/Wiki.png"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"This is the ENTIRE changelog for j4. He has been the same way pretty much for MULTIPLE Seasons. He got the s1 victorious skin, and has been fine for a long time.\r\n\r\nHe hasn't had too many major changes, and most of the balance changes in the past 2 seasons have looked at evening out his power.\r\n\r\n4.7- slight nerf(bigger really) to his passive; considered rebalancing( i agree it was strong)\r\n3.13 - big nerf to knockup\r\n3.04 - Nerf to Flag; slight buff to shield to compensate\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY IS JARVAN OP NOW? He's not.\r\n\r\nPeople sitting under there towers with 200 hp crying because they got ganked by a mobile ganker, is not op.\r\n\r\nYou not warding doesn't make a champ OP.\r\n\r\nSomeone who is fed, ganking you and hitting you for tons of damage does not make j4 op(most other champs can do exactly the same).\r\n\r\nJarvan IS INDEED a bit a strong, he always has been, but he also has defined weaknesses.\r\n\r\nDue to the items brought in since his release, going AD, or damage jarvan(as opposed to tankier) has been better at killing squishier targets, especially those without an escape.  \r\n\r\nHowever...\r\nWhy is jarvan OP NOW? Why is he \"broken\" at a time when there are FREE WARDS, More defensive items, shields, vision elements, etc?\r\n\r\nBecause people still suck.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a glass cannon adc who bought 0 defensive items knowing that an ad champ on their team is fed, or ganking often. They have 5 ad champs but i guess i'll build more damage).\r\n\r\nYou'd be surprised how well a randuins omen, or GA or other defensive items can save you.\r\n\r\nIf people want to make a better argument that some of the bruiser\\ad items are broken, that would be a better statement, but saying j4's broken now after what little changes have happened since his release...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv4.21\r\n\r\nIF HE'S MAKING A CRATER SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT.\r\n\r\n    Cataclysm.jpg R - Cataclysm\r\n        NEW ARE YOU CALLING ME FAT: Fixed a bug where Jarvan would sometimes fail to do damage if he was killed quickly after landing from Cataclysm. Note: Jarvan still won't deal damage if he's killed mid-air, but if he's able to land and create the wall, he should always deal damage.\r\n\r\nv4.7\r\nMartial Cadence now deals more damage, but the cooldown starts out higher and scales down over time. Golden Aegis costs less mana and is a flat cost across all ranks.\r\n\r\n    MartialCadence.jpg Passive - Martial Cadence\r\n        Damage: 6/8/10% (at levels 1/7/13) ⇒ 10% at all levels\r\n        Same-Target Cooldown: 6 seconds at all levels ⇒ 10/8/6 seconds (at levels 1/7/13)\r\n    GoldenAegis.jpg W - Golden Aegis\r\n        Cost: 45/50/55/60/65 mana ⇒ 30 mana at all ranks\r\n\r\nv4.5\r\n\r\n\"Cataclysm should now be more reliable for Jarvan IV to land.\"\r\n\r\n    file=Cataclysm R - Cataclysm\r\n        Utility: The walled area is now centered between Jarvan and his target.\r\n\r\nv4.1\r\n\r\n    MartialCadence.jpg Passive – Martial Cadence\r\n        Fixed a bug where Martial Cadence would sometimes trigger on towers\r\n\r\n\r\nv3.13\r\nContext: This change forces Jarvan to be more accurate with his Demacian Standard / Dragon Strike combo while giving opponents some breathing room when trying to dodge it.\r\n\r\n    Dragon Strike / Demacian Standard\r\n        Jarvan's knockup collision radius reduced to 180 from 260\r\n\r\nv3.07\r\n\r\n    Demacian Standard\r\n        Vision radius of the Standard reduced to 700 from 850\r\n\r\nv3.04\r\nJarvan has been bringing too much utility to his team, so we've removed the armor component of Demacian Standard's aura.\r\n\r\n    Golden Aegis\r\n        Shield amount per nearby enemy champion increased to 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 from 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40\r\n        Mana cost reduced to 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 from 65\r\n    Demacian Standard\r\n        Active no longer grants bonus Armor\r\n\r\nv3.02\r\n\r\n    Martial Cadence\r\n        Fixed a bug where Martial Cadence was dealing more damage than intended to minions and monsters\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.152\r\n\r\n    Base Movement Speed increased by 25.\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.146\r\n\r\n    Demacian Standard\r\n        When targeting a location outside of Demacian Standard's range, Demacian Standard will now be cast at its maximum range in the direction of the targeted location\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.144\r\n\r\n    Updated tooltips\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.139\r\n\r\n    Fixed a bug with Commando and Dragon Slayer skins that caused the game to hitch when first using Demacian Standard\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.133\r\n\r\n    Fixed a bug where Cataclysm immediately crumbled when Jarvan IV died\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.132\r\n\r\n    Mana per level increased to 40 from 30\r\n    Golden Aegis mana cost reduced to 65 from 75\r\n    Demacian Standard mana cost reduced to 55 from 60\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.130\r\n\r\n    Martial Cadence (Passive)\r\n        Damage changed to physical from magic\r\n        Damage changed to 6 / 8 / 10% (at levels 1 / 7 / 13) of the target's current health from 8%\r\n        No longer procs spell effects such as Rylai's or Spell Vamp\r\n    Increased the hitbox size of Demacian Standard when targeted by Dragon Strike\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.125\r\n\r\n    Added a targeting ring to Cataclysm\r\n    Fixed a bug where Cataclysm was dealing less damage than intended at rank 2 and 3\r\n    Fixed an issue where certain skins had inconsistent model sizes\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.123\r\n\r\n    Cataclysm\r\n        Jarvan will no longer follow the target while he is in the air during Cataclysm\r\n        Will now create the ring of terrain regardless of whether the enemy can be targeted or not\r\n        Will now be slightly more likely to push turrets that the ring lands on into the center rather than out\r\n        Fixed a bug where it could be interrupted by movement displacing abilities such as Crystallize or Pillar of Filth\r\n    Fixed a bug where Dragon Strike reduced the target's base armor rather than total armor\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.121\r\n\r\n    Demacian Standard\r\n        Cooldown reduced to 13 seconds from 12\r\n        Damage reduced to 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 from 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260\r\n    Dragon Strike damage reduced to 70 / 115 / 160 / 205 / 250 from 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.120\r\n\r\n    Demacian Standard\r\n        Armor reduced to 10 / 13 / 16 / 19 / 22 from 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26\r\n        Attack speed reduced to 10 / 13 / 16 / 19 / 22% form 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26%\r\n    Martial Cadence damage reduced to 8% from 10%\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.118\r\n\r\n    Dragon Strike\r\n        Cooldown increased to 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 seconds from 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5\r\n        Mana cost increased to 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 from 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60\r\n    Golden Aegis shield strength reduced to 50 / 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 from 50 / 100 / 150 / 200 / 250\r\n    Cataclysm damage reduced to 200 / 325 / 450 from 200 / 350 / 500\r\n    Fixed a bug where Jarvan IV's banner caused a hitch the first time it was cast\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.113\r\n\r\n    Golden Aegis' PVP.net description no longer states it triggers automatically\r\n\r\nv1.0.0.112\r\n\r\nJarvan IV released","replies":[]}
