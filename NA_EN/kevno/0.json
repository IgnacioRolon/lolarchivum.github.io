That Error in your champ select most likely caused a dodge in that match which ended your promo =\\ . There's not a lot I can do on my end to help correct that, since overall a crash is a crash, and it would have hurt your team had it happened in the actual game, but let's take some steps to try and make sure this won't happen again anytime soon. \n\nAlways make sure you're launching the client and running patches as admin, and double check the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) for some help settings those permissions up if needed. Take some time to go through this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) too, as some of the steps there can help reduce any crashes you might see.","replies":[]}]}
