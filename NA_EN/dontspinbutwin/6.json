If you're in a winning matchup, you can avoid autoing and get sustain from shield, effectively freezing lane, and putting the enemy laner further behind.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I could think of is that you can stack dorans blade, but very few champs can abuse this effectively (toplane rengar, ashe, cait, a few more), but even then ifs usually better to just build other component to a big item, like a tiamat or a pickaxe.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-10-30T22:27:58.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2033}} ???\n\nDoran's shield is good on some ADCs that are bullied in lane.
