Fight me.\r\n\r\nSecondly, i made a post on our subreddit, stating that any Darius main who was toxic was horrible for putting the stigma on the champ. The response?\r\n\r\n\"You virgin\"\r\n\"Lol grow up, if theyre trash im gonna say theyre trash\"\r\n\"You cant stop me from verbally tilting them. Its freelo pubstomp\"\r\n\r\n...and the post got removed after 6 hrs, bc the post was slowly flooding with all the Toxic Darius Mains trying to defend their toxicity.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of all of the Darius mains out there? Sorry for us.\r\n\r\n(Fun fact tho: most Darius mains typically have this setup: around 90k Mastery points, mastery 7, either the dunkmaster or (most likely) the Godking skin, and will take conqueror and ghost. They will berate you over the smallest misstep. If they get ganked twice, they say theyre getting \"camped\". Expect tons of \"/all ?\". If you run from them, expect \"Keep running P*ssy\".)","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-12-08T07:39:23.647+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"last I checked not everyone is a darius main. other champion mains are toxic too including: {{champion:11}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:24}} and sometimes {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"thefatlazycat","date":"2019-12-08T14:47:22.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well of course, those champs are just a breeding ground for entitlement and toxicity","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-08T22:59:44.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically the champs that player expects to win if they play the champion aggressively with one of the following: \n**easily** deal lots of AoE *and* single target damage: \n{{champion:63}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:161}} \nis fast/unstoppable with very high single target consistent damage:\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:2}}\ncan 1v3 more easily:\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:122}} \nassassins with great disengage: \n{{champion:105}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} \nexceptional split pusher:\n{{champion:27}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:24}} \n\nAnd then the oddball that I see as 2nd most toxic (behind Yasuo)\n{{champion:17}} \n\nSome fit into the above but just aren't typically toxic, like Illaoi.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-09T01:09:33.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are chads, don't get in their way. {{sticker:darius-angry}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2019-12-08T15:48:06.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when I started out, People who mained Pre-Rework Fiora were pretty scummy.\n\nNearly every single Fiora I saw/played against spent most of the game shit talking and would get away with it due to how bullshit that champion used to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xHeimtechZX","date":"2019-12-08T15:35:19.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is my first champ to get mastery 5 for me (even tho I definitely played far more champions than Darius but that was before I took a LoL break). I guess that technically makes him my main. The Reddit seems okay, but I've never posted there. That sucks if people are toxic there. I just upvote any cool Darius memes or clips, or find some tips.\nI've been adding Darius players I meet in my games. They seem pretty chill. \nHonestly, every community in existence has some toxic members. People will also generalize a community, focusing on the worst members. \nI see a lot of positivity on that Reddit too, like something like \"A lot of good Darius fanart lately\". Didn't think there was such a bad stigma around Darius players. \nI would love a Darius skin but I guess the Darius forge chroma is pretty good too. Darius' default skin is pretty nice imo.","replies":[]}]}
