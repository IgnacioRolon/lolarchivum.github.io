Looking at the chatlog, I did say some crappy things. However, I'm also frustrated  at the level of punishment. I'll provide backstory.\r\n\r\nRiot flagged me for 2 games, one where I went 1/10 toplane in ranked, and another where I got around 900 stacks as nasus in 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe first game, I was Darius vs Karma. I got shit on ( as expected), and our zed midlane was one of those players who are super arrogant when ahead, but super quiet when doing even/behind. He kept pinging everyone who was doing average/trash, and since I was doing the worst, he constantly kept pinging me, and my death timer every time I died. I muted him and tried to keep playing. Then he afked. My team worried that he wouldn't come back and we would lose. I simply said something along the lines of \"good. I think we have a better chance of winning a 4v5 without that toxicity. Let him stay afk\". I think he reconnected, but we still lost. He then put a discord link in the end game chat and told me to join it. I figured he would just flame me to death to avoid getting caught by the bot, so I refused. I just told him to \"get good :)\" and left. He then tried to add me as a friend, despite all my declines. ( I would eventually add him, say \"up yours! :D\" and then unfriend him.\r\n\r\nI know this makes me seem like a dick, and I get it. I won't bother trying to defend myself, and if you see me as a dick who deserves this, I won't argue.\r\n\r\nI played a few aram games to unwind from this tilt, and had some fun (I got sylas, and managed to 4 man fear the enemy with an urgot ult. It was a type of high cocaine addicts get jealous of). After a while, I decided to jump into a ranked game, as I was in a good mood. It would be this next game that got me the restriction.\r\n\r\nThe first red flag is that our jungler said he got autofilled, and was a midlane one trick. Our midlaner offered to give him mid. He said nothing, and picked lee sin. Our midlaner picked syndra. I counterpicked their malphite to nasus. I had said nothing in pregame chat.\r\n\r\nGame starts, and shit hits the fan.\r\n\r\nLee begins stating (in broken english) that our midlaner was horrible, constantly. The entire chat was full of him saying things like \"Wow syndra, I can't believe you can't hit your E\", \"Youre bad\" \"Everyone look, and know what a good midlaner is\" \"I wouldn't do that. You should have given me midlane.\" If lee was good, I would just tollerate it. But lee was horrendous, and if anything, was doing worse than syndra. At around 13 minutes, I snapped and told lee to stfu, and that he was being a toxic dick for no reason. I also tried to roam as nasus with TP, and help win teamfights, and complemented the team who was massively behind (in hopes they would play it out). Botlane looked to me to carry in star eyed glory. I know nasus can't carry, but if it'll help them play, then shucks, I'll \"carry\". Syndra is still doing her best, but has a reletively bad kda. However, despite getting trash talked by lee every 2 seconds, she kept telling everyone to stop fighting (in the kindest manner possible), and said we could win. Not once did she blame anyone else. \r\n\r\n...That didn't stop lee though, he kept shitting on her for jack reason. I stepped in again, told him he was doing worse than syndra, and that he should stfu and leave syndra alone. He then proceeded to play victim, and say things like \"I never said anything bad!\", \"Wow, I can't believe youre so toxic\", \"Ask anyone here, ask them if I was toxic\" (the entire team was doing their best to ignore the lee, but they did step in occasionally here and there and agree with me that lee was being a dick). He tried to turn the tables on me, stating things like \"Did YOU help out the team?\" (to which I replied, yes, I did in that teamfight we just had. Everyone was useful, so maybe you should stop dicking on syndra), \"Wow, youre bad.\" (I was the sole reason the game was still going, as every other lane fed. Jungle included.) This kept going on and on, with me shutting down all his accusations, me defending the syndra, and me stating to just keep playing and stop blaming, and Lee finally said \"If you keep talking, I'll afk\". I laughed and told him to do so. Told him that we had a better chance winning 4v5 without toxicity. He walked towards base (didnt alt f4). Stood still for about 30 seconds in base...then proceeded to krugs, and told me that \"he would report me for telling him to afk\". I tried to just farm and hoped the team would do the same. I eventually fell, as I build no MR against the 1 AP they had (which was unfortunately ap kaisa. I traded 1 for 1 with her). We lost. The end game lobby would be one of the most confusing toxic end game lobbies I ever had. He was trash talking me, saying I was the \"worst toplaner\", and that I should never play top again. Looked up my match history, laughed at my 52% WR and my 1/10 Darius game, and my 1/8 sylas game (which I was confused about, as I hadn't had a 1/8 sylas game). He then asked if we could duo, to which I told him to fuck off. I reported him, and while I was telling him off, I got the riot notification stating \"instant report feedback\". I laughed at him and left. I was feeling great.\r\n\r\nNext time I log in, the chat restriction occurs. Fine. I said some shit that I don't regret, but I agree I should be punished for it anyhow. However, I also got an honor lock/reduction. I went from honor level 3, to locked honor level 1. It should be noted I got honors on a frequent basis, and people really liked having me on their team...but the 2 games I had in a row apparently was enough to reverse about 8 months of hard work and reform. I had climbed from honor level 0 (I missed victorious orianna for that), to honor level 3. Now I was back to level 1, and I wouldn't be able to progress in honor for at least a solid month of playing.\r\n\r\nShould I have gotten a punishment? Yes. I did bad shit, even if justified, I should get punished. However, its beyond frustrating that I have to grind for months now because 2 dicks existed in a row in my games. And before anyone states \"Oh, you should've been more careful before you spoke\", have you ever been in either situation? 1 where you're doing shit in lane, but get berated by your teammate constantly, and another game where you crush the lane, but your teammates drag you down, and your jungler acts like he's God, when he's actually making things worst by existing? How the fuck does one \"think before I speak\" in either shit-tuation? \"Oh just mute them!\"....shut up. Muting is a horrendous solution to a toxic problem. Muting only works if it extends to end game chat, in which it doesn't. Even if I mute pings and KDA, I'll still get reported for beind unresponsive and for \"griefing or verbal abuse\", and since its a bot dishing out these punishments, all they need to see is a lack of communication/response/bad kda to throw me in the slammer. Heck, there are cases where muting might make things worse, and might build up 1 sided frustration, which might cause inting/afk (I've seen both happen).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I can't focus on league. I finally am starting to get life together, and I'm finally learning how to time manage and study. I hope to have more motivation to go job hunting in the future for a part time job as well. That leaves league as a relaxation tool for entertainment that I can play occasionally, but how the fuck am I supposed to have fun when I know I won't be getting a victorious skin I worked hard for, because I refuse to invest the grind time for league, in hopes to get my life together?\r\n\r\nI really wish that riot would just give me the chat restriction, but not reduce my honor down by 2 entire levels. I emailed riot in hopes something can be done. While they agreed with me, and sympathized with me, they told me because I responded, they couldn't do anything.\r\n\r\nFirst, my toplane's meta gets completely crapped on by cheese, and hasn't been addressed in months. Next, damage creep makes me building 300 armor useless against champions with 2 damage items. Next, I have the teams who are straight up toxic because it's in their blood, and they get off scott free while I sit here. Now here I am: studying for my history exam on monday, and wondering how the fuck I'm gonna raise my honor, or how I'm gonna even get a sustainable job in 4 years.\r\n\r\nTLDR: I did bad, and had bad games because other players ruined it for me. I got punished, and now I have no time for life and league simutaneously, ruining league's experience for the next few months, because of 2 dickhead players.\r\n\r\nIn all, this has just been a frustration rant. I thank you for your time and patience, and I really fucking hope Riot changes the honor system, because right now, I can easily see players leaving this game because of how shitty honor levels work. It's a good idea on paper, but a really bad idea in action. Either that, or its a fucking poor execution.","replies":[]}
