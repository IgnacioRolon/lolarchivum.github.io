Seriously, some of the character's write themselves in terms of r34, and it doesn't even pertain to their lore.\r\n\r\nSylar is buff and half naked. Half the job is already done for the artists.\r\nZoe is canonically thousands of years old. FBI bullet dodged, artists continue to draw.\r\nDr Mundo is a sadist, who spends his life torturing zaunites while eating toenails....yet he has an 8 pack...?\r\n_New kayle quite literally strips down in game, making me unsure whether this is hentai haven or league of legends._\r\n\r\nGive me something grotesque, something impossible to lewd. Like take reksai, for example. She has excellent lore, no sexuality, and if i look up r34, I have regret, not surprised pleasure ( and it should be noted any \"good\" r34 of her is humanoid).\r\n\r\nGive me warts. Give me flabs. Give me rotted teeth. Give me mismatched arm lengths. Have one of their eyes drip out of their sockets. Give me mixmatched boobs. I really want to see a champion who's design is so grotesque, that I can't help but love.\r\n\r\n....but then again, in the year 2019, I'm sure that creating such a character would trigger someone out there, and cause the community to cry.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-11T05:16:30.672+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember Trundle?\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/8AspKoPQCgk/hqdefault.jpg\n\nConstantly rotting and regenerating, he used his Curiously Strongâ„¢ troll regeneration to contain a plague for his tribe.

They laugh at how bad their main is, and laugh at all the bugs. Regardless, their community is quite wholesome.\n\nI get what you mean, I really do: I imagine a grotesque champion might make me sickened after a while, and it may be why such a champ doesn't exist. Then again, there are the SAW series which are full of inhumane torture games, yet they're quite infamous for that same reason: a niche that is fufilled. Someone out there might just truly love horrid beasts, and might take up the character, similar to how someone who might like boobs might be more attracted to MF or Evelynn. A smaller audience, yes, but still there.\n\nAlso, I posted this under memes and games because if I put it under serious discussion, someone might think I'm calling them ugly, they might get offended, and if it's official then suddenly the message is misconstrued.
