Its why a ryze in my hands is far less threatening than a ryze in fakers hands, or why my (former) kench is a lot less reliable than aphromoo's kench.\r\n\r\nSo I propose this: seperate patches for pro scenes. That way, you can nerf kench support in pro without gutting him in casual play, or nerf taliyah in pro play while having players in normal play struggle to fully utilize her. When a champion slowly begins to dominate in both pro scene and in normal players, then a bigger nerf should be distributed (like lissandra and pyke) for both casual and pro.\r\n\r\nNow I know this has most likely been discussed among rioters, as theyre highkey super smart, and this idea was most likely shut down to avoid confusion when watching lcs. However, I personally could give less than 2 craps about pro games, and the majority of players dont really care about the lcs and such. So simply release patch notes for the lcs. That way, those who r super dedicated can see what is different in the game they play vs the game on the pro scene, while those who dont care about pro play can just have casual fun.","replies":[{"poster":"DC50Athletics","date":"2019-06-22T04:00:29.398+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because then people who move from regular games to pro games would effectively be playing an entirely different game and would have to completely rework the strategies that they had been using the entire time?\n\nI mean, that's REALLY not a hard problem to see, is it?
