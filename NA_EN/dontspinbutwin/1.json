I'm Taric, and I embody the aspect of the defender. After I failed my platoon, well, I was exiled to die. I sought to repent by climbing mount targon, and I was deemed worthy of the defender. Now, I seek to aid as many others as I can, by using the power of the galaxy as my balm, and the stars as by impenetrable shield.
