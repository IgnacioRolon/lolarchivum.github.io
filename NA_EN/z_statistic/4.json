So this is the most damage you will do over the rampup duration.\r\n\r\nSecond model:\r\nsum[(8+9)(1+t/20),t=0,10]-43*6= -24.25\r\n\r\nt goes from 0 to 10 **ticks at 2 ticks/sec to make the duration 5 seconds (because of a similar situation as above). SF cape also has 6 ticks since it remains ticking at 1 tick per second. The base value is 8 instead of 16 because there are now 2 ticks per second.\r\nBecause the absolute value of the negative result is larger, the shorter ramp up time actually causes Cinderhulk to deal LESS damage over the ramp up\r\n\r\nThird model:\r\nsum[(16+18)(1+t/20),t=0,5]-43*6= -28.5\r\n\r\nt goes from 0 to 6 ticks at 1 tick per second.\r\nComparing the third and second models compares how much of a difference is lost. Thus, while the second model is (and should) be a strictly better situation, it is not that much of an improvement.\r\n\r\nFourth model:\r\nsum[(16+x)(1+t/20),t=0,5]-(25+x)*6= 3x/4-42\r\nf(x)=0; x=56\r\nUsing the First model but allowing champion level to vary, the fourth model is the total difference of damage after ramp up between Cinderhulk and SF Cape.  F is negative for the entire domain of [1,18]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion: the building of Cinderhulk is independent of the passive; one should only consider the health bonuses vs Warrior in order to snowball lanes with AD early and building SF cape later if immolation is needed on a champion. Whether that's an easy decision to make or not (health gives infinite returns when reaching a burst threshold and ~0 if it doesn't) depends on how skewed jungle picks are. Burst champions, like Kha'zix will have a harder time counterganking, but steady dps champions like Shyvana will come out on top.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Cinderhulk will diminish the presence of assassins and ambushers in the jungle.\r\n\r\nStill won't kick Lee Sin out though.","replies":[{"poster":"OhOkYea","date":"2015-03-11T00:09:46.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-11T00:39:07.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This man deserves a cookie.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ecneregilleb","date":"2015-03-11T00:45:31.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's *supposed* to kick Lee Sin out. They never said they were trying to, they are just trying to give some love to tank Junglers. One of the huge reasons tank junglers were hit so hard with the pre-season changes was the lack of replacement of a % bonus health item. The SF Cape aura isn't really intended for DPS in PvP, it's to speed up tank jungle clear times earlygame.\n\nSpeculating is a fruitless venture at this point. Patch comes out in less than 2 days. Play with the new item, test it out and see for yourself. Sometimes, Practise > Paper","replies":[]}]}
