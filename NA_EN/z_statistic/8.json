His personality and character doesn&#039;t need some crazy shit to make him more interesting. Everything about him is awesome.\r\n\r\nI could keep going. Every other champion between Braum and Nami has some sort of &#039;boo hoo feel sorry for me&#039; situation and even Nami has to be given some leeway because she&#039;s on some generic MacGuffin JRPG journey. It gets old when this is the MO of character design, Riot. When I look at the pattern chronologically, the ones who have a solid personality without some tragic backstory is...{{champion:119}} \r\n\r\nConflict is where people grow, but conflict before the story starts doesn&#039;t. This is why even though {{champion:21}} also falls under this problem of tragic backstory, I&#039;m much more willing to forgive this lore because she got her revenge and she went V for Vendetta on GP&#039;s ass. Same thing with Graves and TF. TF betrayed Graves in the backstory, but in the lore they made up.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know what would be **really** cool?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s release a new champion is a green as hell newbie who is happy-go-lucky optimistic and wants to change the world. We release him on day one of the event. Then day two starts and a war between Demacia and Noxus erupts. Each match with a noxian on one side and demacian on the other influence a counter. If Noxus wins more, we have Day 8 as part two of the lore event where our hero spirals into a depression. If Demacia wins, then we have a celebration of a Demacia victory. EXCEPT WAIT. TREACHERY. Day 9 reveals more lore and spits out our champion as battlebruised and horrifically changed by war in a new skin.\r\n\r\nThat how you do conflict. You actually _do_ conflict and none of this post hoc exposition about how we should care that so and so&#039;s father was beaten to death by a rogue spoon wielded by the sixth cousin of the elder warlord king emperor god.\r\n\r\nYou guys have made great strides in weaving together character relationships, but you&#039;ve not done any better since 2012 in terms of character development.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-25T22:39:04.621+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"How's a champion supposed to be a champion if they haven't gona through any trials or hardship yet? You say \"Ok Braum's normal\" but Braum's old and storied. He's done A LOT of stuff in his life. Sure his personality is grounded in reality somewhat but the dude is anything but considering I doubt any living human can attest to having punched through a mountain. Braum's a character you can easily root for but it's not like he's incredibly realistic.\n\nHere's my thing: Runeterra's a world of magic. It's a world where humans share their planet with other sentient organisms that aren't human. It's a universe where a fucking dragon made the stars. ALL of the stars. It's a world where death is a bow wielding lamb and a ghost wolf. As such I don't want normallcy. I want Riot to go bonkers and make characters that are interesting, unique and take total advantage of the setting. A normal dude? Sod that. That's boring. Give me characters worth calling \"champions\", not normal guys who're easy to root for because they're more grounded in reality. I expect my humans in a magical setting to be as bad ass as such a setting would entail. And if they're among the \"normal humans\" they better have something about them that makes them stand out from the crowd. I don't expect the main characters of a magical world to be \"normal\". I expect them to be weird. \n\nBasically, for me personally, I don't care for \"Johny Normalson\". I care for whatever weird and wonderful shit the League of Legends setting can offer me. The closer it is to reality, the more boring it is for me. Let's just go wild and make weird shit, from the weirdly cosmic to the seemingly ordinary but actually remarkable. I expect nothing less of these characters who are denoted as \"champions\" and \"legends\". \n\nFuck normal. I'd like spectacular, magical, remarkable and weird please.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-12-25T23:29:24.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok, let's take Garen and Jarvan as an example with the first level of the argument. Garen is a soldier who fought in war. He's proud, strong, and skilled. Jarvan's lore is ridiculous. His backstory is that he was happy go-lucky-prince-dude _but then suddenly something happened off stage!_ And now he's a thousand-yard stare dude. There is a fundamental difference between a soldier who is conflicted with his love for an enemy and a prince who had something unnamed bad happen to him offstage.\n\nLet's go another level deeper. Why was Trundle rewritten?\n\"Because his story was finished.\" That was Riot's official response. He had gone through hardship but now he had no room to grow. Now, I would be ok with that reasoning except one teeny tiny thing: WE'VE GONE THREE YEARS WITHOUT GROWTH. Riot does not get a license to say they want room for character growth when it's been 3 years since Kalista and she's still the same champion. The Shurima event was good for bringing old champions into the fold, as was Bilgewater, but the rate at which they occur is so infrequent that there will be no follow up, no growth for the new champions, and this is all just kicking the can down the road. How is Azir's lore any less finished than old Trundle's when he hasn't been touched since release? Hell, how is NEW Trundle's lore any less finished than old Trundle's since HE hasn't been touched since the rework?\n\nLet's go _another_ level deeper. Who is the next champion after Braum that is grounded? Vel'koz, but his character is simply just not as strong as Draven's. Why is Vel'koz better than say Jhin? Because he is: a) a regular void creature that b) came into our world to learn while c) being pyschopathically unempathetic. What is Jhin? He kills people because he suffers from a psychosis that forces him to do so on a basis of art. What is Draven? He kills people for show because he's a badass narcissist and because he loves his job. There was no defining moment in his life like Darius. He just loved his job and then went \"hey, I could get MORE famous if I went to the Institute! Fuck yeah! I love myself sometimes.\"\n\nLet's go _**another**_ level deeper. Who is the most popular character in League?\nHelmet Bro. Why? A lot of it is simply the madness of crowds and the magic of memes. However, another reason is because he's just the punching bag who keeps at his job of whatever he's doing. These bad things that happen to him are NOT a tragic backstory filled with moral or philosophical pivots in his life; they're just piece of shit he pulls through.\n\nBut let's go to the final depth of the argument. What makes a champion? A willingness to fight. Why do they fight? Well, according to Rito, everyone fights because *insert special person to them* *insert bad thing that is irreversible* happened to them. Every once in a while, it's because they were exiled or had to go off alone. And even rarer, it's simply because they do. Why does Aatrox fight? Because he's a darkin. That's who he is. That is literally all he is. Why does Braum fight? Because he is a defender. Why does Draven fight? Because he is an entertainer. It is all part of who they are at a core level.\n\nA 'normal' champion is someone who fights because. That's it. It is extremely important that there is variety in what makes someone a champion else we can just boil it all down to being emo.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-12-26T00:18:40.879+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess I misunderstood you at the beginning. My assumption was that you were looking for more relatable champions, ones closer to what we are like in real life, but no, you're looking for characters with simple backstories, one's not filled with extravagent history and complex stories that are stated and not told, but just matter of fact \"this is X and they do Y\" characters. I misunderstood there so sorry about that. When I see folks ask for more \"normal\" champions, my mind goes to people wanting things more relatable and not so magicy or weird, which is what I love most, so yeah, sorry I fucked up in understanding your post's meaning.\n\nOn to the rest of it though; you bring up champions like Vel'Koz, Braum, Garen, Draven and Aatrox as champions who just do what they do and that's that, but the thing is none of this implies those champions have \"normal\" histories. If anything their's is a history waiting to be told. Why does Aatrox fight? Because he's a Darkin? Maybe. For some other reason that hasn't been revealed? Perhaps. I mean we can go down those champions individually and ask a lot of questions:\n\n- What made Braum want to protect people? He's old so he's definetly had his share of adventures, so what moulded him to be the man he is now? Is it as simple as his mother teaching him to be a good man by everyone? Maybe it is. That's fine in and of itself, but that's not the only explanation.\n- Draven's a performer and egotistical to boot, but what made him that way? What was life like growing up with Darius? What made him take a different path to his brother? Is it as simple as just following his own desires or was there something more?\n- Vel'Koz comes from a realm of entities that legends foretell were forghed by great flesh-machinery to serve in ancient wars. What does that mean for Vel'Koz specifically, if anything?\n- Garen's history beyond being a soldier has never been explored. He was friends with Taric once, and he's Lux's brother, so what was life like growing up? Remember he's nobility as well as an exemplary soldier, so having a \"normal\" history was probably never going to work out considering how his best friend got exiled and his sister's a magical lass in a nation that is very wary of magic.\n\nI don't think that champions having simple histories is ever going to be a thing, simply because to become the champion in the first place, they had to have had something happen in their lives to begin with. The difference between Garen's background and Jarvan's background is that Jarvan's simply states his background isn't \"normal\", while Garen's gives no indication as to who Garen might've been growing up. The reason such backgrounds aren't touched on is that sometimes understanding that background isn't necessary to understand the character. You don't need to understand Aatrox's true history to understand who he is and what he's doing, but that doesn't mean his history isn't filled with astounding events. \n\nIt's not a bad thing of course for champions to be simple in that regard. Braum as your main example could just be that; his mother told him to be a good man and so he lived by that notion, which he still does. But at the same time League's champions have always been characters imbued with unique powers, living in unique situations or people in high standings, so having exorbitant histories is almost to be expected. These characters are \"legends\", and as such expecting their life stories to be anything less than remarkable is, in my eyes, underselling them. The nature of the game, of Runeterra itself means that its characters were always going to be the most remarkable, powerful and unique beings in all of the game's setting, and if they do seem normal then there was probably something else at play that wasn't all that apparent but still there. I mean going back to Braum he's probably got strong iceborn blood, which right there makes his story not so normal considering the history surrounding that heritage. \n\nTo boil all of this down to a single point: the game we're playing is League of **Legends**. Having grandiose stories and origins is pretty much part of the territory. If it was anything less they probably were never worth talking about. To be a legend is to be remarkable, to be extraordinary, to have done feats to be spoken about for ages to come. To be a legend is to be worth remembering in the first place. Having a \"normal\" history, at least to me, is doing the very title of \"legend\" a disservice. \n\nHopefully that made a modicum of sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2016-12-26T01:15:15.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qlOWkJVN,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-12-26T00:18:40.879+0000)\n>\n> Guess I misunderstood you at the beginning.

Even If it wasn't correct and his sirname wasn't Toxtrot, I don't think they care that much.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-12-26T01:59:08.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't get this thread\n\nwhat's wrong with illaoi, for instance? she is an ordinary religious lady without any tragic background, except for her break-up with gangplank","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-12-26T02:58:37.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's nothing 'wrong' with Illaoi.

Malzahar is 'ordinary'.\n\nMy point is that Riot consistently has to up the ante in order to make characters interesting and they generally do this by making them (lorewise) overpowered or by giving them some stereotypical tragic backstory. Draven and Braum show that Riot can make a character who is pretty simple in backstory but rich in personality. Riot can make a character engaging by showing us what they do instead of what they've done.\n\nThe idea of these champion stories in expanded lore that occurs RIGHT NOW is in theory a great idea. In practice, they suck because the writing is mediocre or absolutely atrocious.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-12-25T22:38:20.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heroes aren't really forged by normal lives as much.
