But where is the competitive respect?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm tired of two things:\n\n1) Emote spamming. Honestly, I'd be ok with it if using an emote caused the character to be suppressed for the animation time. If you want to taunt someone after outplaying them, go ahead. It just opens you up for you team. Besides, how many of you ACTUALLY watch the whole taunt or laugh? You just try to spam it so you can try to piss someone off and bait them. Well it works. Not for me. Actually, I'm pretty level headed about the whole thing. Sometimes it's just enough of a delay to allow me to catch you and then kill you for the 4th time. No, I'm frustrated because my TEAMMATES are doing it, and telling them to stop isn't working.\n\n2) End the fucking game.\n\nI play Go. I observe Go culture. And there is one holy rule in Go above all others: we are here for a finite amount of time; do not disrespect your opponent by wasting their valuable time. Go is much more snowbally than League and can last 2 hours, so not only is it reasonable to surrender, it's expected. It's also expected that you finish your opponent decisively. No building up your territory and slowly sucking the life out of them. Not only is it less effective than playing decisively, it's wasting the person's time since to surrender both parties must agree.\n\nWhen I see the enemy just spamming taunt or laugh outside our fountain and just letting minions whittle down the nexus, that royally hacks me off more so than the first point. Hell, it's not even the emote spamming; it's just waiting down the clock at this point. When we've tried to surrender and failed because of a stupid duo so that we can move on to the next game, when we are letting you win because 2 people rage quit and it's snowballed out of control, when we have graciously allowed you to actually hit the nexus instead of denying you the satisfaction in dealing the killing blow as quickly as possible, your response is to shove it in our face and just drag it on...?\n\n\"Oh please, Menea, you'd do the same thin-\"\n\nNo.\n\nI never do this shit. Ever. When I play League, I always hit the nexus if I can. When I play Hearthstone, I always try to deal the finishing blow in as few actions as possible. When I know I mathematically lose on the next turn, I surrender. When I someone offers to surrender, I always accept it. When I see that I can end the game almost immediately without having to do the \"fun\" bit of ramping up as my strategy, I still end it. I don't whittle down an objective so that if shit hits the fan, I can always just destroy it an end the game, whatever it is.\n\nI respect my opponent and their time. I respect their skill and I respect their desire to win. I do not play \"gotcha\" with their hope of winning. I end it there and now. I will always deal the Coup de Grace if I can. This isn't a FFA where the point of the game is to get kills ad nauseum and die trying. \n\nThe refusal to give a Coup de Grace both blows my mind and sickens me. One of my friends did this, and it completely caught me off guard. \"Because it's fun.\"\n\nI fully accept that this post may be downvoted into oblivion. If it does, know this: I am now irrevocably y jaded towards this community because poor sportsmanship can now be justified because it's fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Crazycatperson","date":"2014-12-13T04:37:51.797+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It especially infuriates me when people type \"rekt\" or \"noob\" after they get a kill.

It is refusing to surrender the match with the intention to grief others.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nOne of my greatest pet peeves, related to this, are people who refuse to surrender, as well as refuse to engage in combat, or refuse to defend objectives. Basically all they're doing is not surrendering the game, and walking around in circles to avoid being triggered by LeaverBuster. \n\nBecause if you just say \"fuck it, i've had enough\" and walk away from your system, you get punished. If you decide to stay in the game, and give your allies attitude because they're fucking idiots, you get punished. If you decide to hibernate in the well, and refuse to participate because your allies are ADAMANTLY refusing to participate in the game, you get punished. \n\n\"You have a negative attitude, towards not wanting to be our primary initiator when we've abandoned you in your initiations for the last 8 times.\"\n\nYou consistently abandon me when I am going above and beyond what is expected of me in order to attempt to achieve a game win, and you expect me to continue initiating for you? Are you ACTUALLY crazy? The physical odds of me sitting in well, FAR exceed your expectations for me to continue initiating for individuals who are not ready to fully commit to a game winning attempt. So go fuck yourself.\n\nYeah that's my rant. And I will throw the game every single time I have been abandoned more than 8 times in a single match. Don't fucking like it?

I once had the time of my life as Jax vs. Irelia top, while both of us were emote spamming. Not finishing is ok in this game as well, as there are ways the enemy can end themselves: surrendering. In this game, surrendering requires only the surrendering team's votes, so there is nothing stopping a losing team. Sometimes you just want that fifth dragon, y'know. However, there are limits. \"gg ez\" and \"outplayed\" are unacceptable. BM in chat is frowned upon.

You quit to easily.\n\nNo, you don't understand Go or how Hearthstone works.\n\nIf you have 4 health left, the enemy has a 4 attack minion, and you have no way to keep him from attacking you, you are going to lose 100% of the time if the enemy is playing decisively. If he's dicking around, feel free to bank on him dicking around. If he's not, not surrendering is telling them, \"yeah, I'm not surrendering because I think you're fucking retarded enough not to make the most obvious play and win the game in this one turn.\"\n\nIf the difference between you and your opponent in Go is larger than the number of possible points to score in the remainder of the game, it's literally impossible to win. You don't actually surrender in Go. You just both agree to end the game now and tally up the points. If there is no mathematical way to change what's going to happen, you are literally wasting people's time. Everyone's. Yours, your opponents', and your spectators'.\n\nIn league, there is much more leeway to win. Many more comebacks. If you just got aced and the enemy is literally just 30 seconds from killing the nexus before you can even respond, there is no way for you to win. When you start playing against people who actually know how to close out a game, then you will see how silly, \"don't worry, we can come back after feeding Jinx! 20 kills and Udyr is tanky AF\" is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2014-12-14T07:20:29.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what ticks me off? When someone AFKs. Not what you are thinking though.  \n\nIf my lane opponent is AFK, i do not mess around farming. I push to the turret and try to end the game as quickly as possible. Its never fun to lose because of an AFK, its even less fun for the enemy team to drag it out.  \n\nIf the enemy comes back into lane, i will not poke or harass them.  I tell everyone to stay out of my lane and kindly ask the enemy jungler to do the same. I wait until we are same level or roughly the same gold, then ask them \"Ready to go at it?\". 100% of the time this kindness is abused, last game this happened the enemy Yasuo agreed to fight and immediately i was ulted by Warwick... After that all bets were off and i asked my team to constantly kill him, if you want to play that way then so be it, it is a team game after all. We won.   \n\nWhen i AFK i get no such kindness, i dont expect it really, but when the jungler and my lane starts to dive me i do get a little upset. I do not expect you to let me catch up, but at least let me farm without getting dived and ganked the entire game for an easy kill. How is that even fun? Its even worse when you brag. Last game i played against a Riven, as Malzahar, who was level 5 by the time i got into lane, did not hesitate to dive me or go all out. We ended up 2/2 each but she was level 6 and i was level 3 so she would just Ult and kill me instantly. Every chance she got she would dive me, and i was getting no help from any of my teammates for some reason. She didn't brag at all, but her and her jungler kept killing me then Zed, who was losing, started going for me to raise his KDA. The worst part is, if i had been there from the start i would have crushed her in lane. 8 out of 10 times she fought me, she would end up with less then 200 life and she was always at least 3 levels higher then me and already had tiamat when she first dived me... We still ended up winning too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chance55","date":"2014-12-14T05:23:34.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree.  I feel like it's a total dick move when the other team is working on the nexus and blitz tries to grab someone off the podium or something.   \n    \nI just had a game that was 2 on 5, and the other team was still going out of their way not to end the game.  Taking jungle camps, dancing next to open inhibs, etc...  When we ask them to end, they say they are working on \"last hitting practice\" and stuff like that.  Then when we tell them they are acting like dicks and being rude, I get reported for verbal harassment.  Perhaps technically against the rules, but they clearly WERE acting like dicks.  At that point, they were clearly just not ending the game to piss us off so they could say things like \"U MAD BRO?\"    \n    \nThe worst part is you know they aren't even reporting because they actually feel harassed (not to mention they could either leave all chat or mute).  I pretty much guarantee they are reporting because \"LOL, WE PISSED THIS GUY OFF ON PURPOSE AND MADE HIM MAD, THEN HE CALLED US A BAD WORD, IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF HE GOT BANNED, LET'S REPORT HIM!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒæµ","date":"2014-12-13T12:54:34.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"When playing lux support Im pretty sure my muscle memory just sub consciously has me spamming laugh the entire time without even realize Im doing it haha :).. also too lazy to read the rest but meh leave taunt spamming in, why not?
