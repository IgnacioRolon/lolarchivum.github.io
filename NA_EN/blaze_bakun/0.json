Her new animations are transition animations (which I think are called -ins and -outs internally by Riot).\r\n\r\nThen, when she got updated again in the Marksmen update, she lost one of these animations: her &quot;ult-to-idle&quot;.\r\nHowever, she didn&#039;t lose it in either her Arcade or Captain Fortune skins, only in her oldest skins.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll show you with some gifs of Mafia Miss Fortune and Arcade Miss Fortune.\r\n\r\n[[Here since I don&#039;t know how to hotlink images.]](http://imgur.com/a/hgn78)\r\n\r\nAlso, Arcade used to have two sound effects for Love Tap, a &quot;beep&quot; and a &quot;boop&quot;. But recently, only her &quot;beep&quot; gets played, never the other sound.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for you guys to check it, please?\r\n\r\nThank you! ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Psylen","date":"2016-02-26T11:23:57.221+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that you noticed this is pretty awesome, good find.
