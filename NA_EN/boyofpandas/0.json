I know that I am entering the right email because i have emails saved from requesting before. However when I do the recover password/username with this account, I get the email immediately. It has always been this way with this account and support tickets take way too long to use just to reset a password. Basically the email pass/user recovery works for one account but not the other.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T23:00:48.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you ensure the right email is associated with the account you're trying to recover?
