I also came across splash art which is basically the final art work you see in game when looking at champions.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to be able to do both the concept and the splash art.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to know does the concept artist create the splash art as well? Or does a different sort of artist create the splash art and if so what sort of artist would they be? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m really in love with the idea of just creating the final art work for a character that I helped design.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2019-02-03T10:30:10.356+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi RozettaRose! I feel like I can help chime in here. \n\nMost of the time, concept art and splash art are two different skill sets. Concept art is mainly about problem-solving for a design, and the skillset is focused mainly on coming up with fresh new ideas, rapid iteration (to solve the problems as set by gameplay, narrative, etc), and communicating through visuals. Actually, 95% of concept work looks really rough and ugly! Again, the emphasis is on researching and problem-solving.\n\nSplash art is focused around telling a story through visuals, capturing the moment of the splash art that best suits that character's personality and background, and really perfecting the craftsmanship of lighting, mood, colors, and all that other fun stuff. It has to communicate that character's core fantasy in a single frame, which is really hard to do considering everything that goes into that character!\n\nSo, as you can see, they are actually two very different focuses, although there is an overlap in that both roles require a knowledge of art fundamentals as the key objective is communicating to other teams and to the audience through art and visuals. The palette is basically the same, but is used to different end goals. That said, at Riot I've definitely heard of concept artists able to help out on splash a little especially if the artist is super passionate about a certain character, and vice-versa. However, this isn't the norm, as they are essentially two full-time jobs with different specialties.","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-04T17:05:50.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will Riot ever release time lapse of splash arts anymore of them simply being created? I liked watching those. Or perhaps how their process goes for the splash arts?","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2019-02-04T19:29:33.877+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a splash artist so I can't say for sure, but I know that the time lapse splash arts were able to be created in the past because they didn't take as long back then, and also were mainly worked on by one artist. These days the process has changed and splash art involves the entire team and involves a lot of feedback and changes, so a time lapse wouldn't really be able to capture the start to finish process. \n\nHowever, you can find awesome splash artists on artstation who sometimes post their WIP roughs, such as this amazing Akali work: \n\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/d2vQ1","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-04T20:00:19.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp found out what I'll be examining for the next few hours. \none day I'll be 1/4 as good... not today. \n\nI see we are being humble only using \"amazing\" to describe the work. The splash arts Riot produces are mind blowing, magnificent, outstanding and superlative pieces of art. \n\nThank you for this, is it possible to put stuff like this on the main web site? Or at least a link to the other artist/splash arts? \n\nSide note your design/art team needs to be highly commended. You guys are the real MVP a lot of the time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-02-03T12:06:42.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really enjoyed watching the video series Rito made on this subject, watching the concept art team throw together so many visual ideas, all so varied and unique with such a simple idea of gem topped staff was super cool to see.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2019-02-04T19:25:34.575+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that's essentially what concept art is :) Coming up with all the different ideas and working to whittle it down to something that can be used.
