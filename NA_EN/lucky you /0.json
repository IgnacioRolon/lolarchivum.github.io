Any suggestions ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T17:18:15.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find a PBE account from the account you are posting from, but do see that you have an application pending.  If you had PBE that was accepted from another account, legacy PBE accounts were disabled and those players were given an opportunity to create a new PBE account via email.  Unfortunately, we aren't able to manually activate or create PBE accounts, if that is the case.  I hope that helps clear some things up, though it may not be the best news.","replies":[]}]}
