Since the honor rework came out i remain at honor 2 with no apparent progression in honor.  The patch notes mentioned something about getting rewards for games but I have only gotten keys and it feels very lacking compared to when I used to get honor capsules.  I hope that somebody will be able to clarify for me the whole honor system and why I feel like I just can't level up no matter how much I get honored.\r\n-MilkLL","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T01:05:30.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The honor reset happened not too long ago, so it might just take a bit longer to progress this season. The goal for progressing is that you'd slowly progress throughout the entire season, so I don't think we should be expecting to see any honor rank 5's anytime soon. \n\nI checked your current honor progress, and it actually looks like you've been really honorable so you're getting \"honor xp\" at a faster rate than normal! You'll see checkpoints and rank ups before too long!","replies":[{"poster":"MilkLL","date":"2018-02-01T23:00:06.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your help :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KMyL","date":"2018-01-25T21:07:40.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude:- when started this new honor season? If I'm not wrong- with 8'th season at 16'th january. Not even 2 weeks ago.\n\nI don't know how many games you played & how much honor you gained, but if you wanted reach checkpoint in less than 2 weeks, when the reworked honor system in previous season started in July(?) & reaching 5'th level THEN was easy as... Very easy...\n\nNow we have WHOLE season, it's January. Chill. I hope, that this honor system will be much \"harder\" & only the best & the nicest people will reach 5'th level...\n\n\nIf you now want at least checkpoint, then in ~April you will have 5'th level. & Then you will write things like \"why there is no more honor levels?\"...\n\nI'm getting also only keys & I don't have a problem with that. Because for bigger prize now you must work harder & wait longer.","replies":[{"poster":"MilkLL","date":"2018-01-25T21:34:57.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yah I understand your point but the thing is I kinda no lifed to level 60 when the season started and have seen no honor growth.
