Ever since his gameplay preview, I couldn't help but imagine him (or some variation of him) in League.  I actually started out by pretty much purely transferring his kit in Overwatch into the form of a Champion (and had no intentions of posting it as a concept due to its glaring similarities with how he was in Overwatch), but over multiple iterations he lost more and more of his Overwatch-based identity.  With that came a different name, Satoru (his working name was Hanzo, unsurprisingly), and a far more fleshed-out idea of a potential League champion.  I won't link you to anything Hanzo-related lest it be misconstrued as Overwatch fanboying, but I encourage you to look him up if you're wondering what the basic inspiration for this concept was.\n\n----\n\n#Satoru, the Slumbering Dragon\n\nhttp://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/054/1/5/the_bowman_of_esgaroth_by_romantiquated-d5w02w0.jpg\n(ok, no more Hanzo picture, too many misunderstandings.  This, albeit vague and minimalistic, is probably a better representation of what I'm going for--he looks older, taller, and just generally like the sort of guy you'd expect to be a bowmaster.  Better, folks?)\n\nSatoru is a warrior and a teacher in the art of wielding a bow and arrow.  Formerly a soldier in the Ionian army that achieved a reputation as a peerless archer as \"The Dragon of Ionia\", he retired from a life of conflict to seek a more peaceful path, in the mountains as a secluded teacher.  With his reputation preceding him, the school he established soon teemed with prospective students, with him watching carefully among them to pass on his ways to the next generation.  Those who seek to disrupt the peace of Ionia, however, have come to colloquially refer to as \"The Slumbering Dragon\", for though he stays his hand on the surface, there is no telling what hell he may unleash if he, or his people, is threatened.\n\n----\n\nIn-game, he serves the purpose of a ranged AD champion as another AD carry.  He thrives on the edge of fights, constantly unleashing a barrage of arrows on his enemies, interspersing well-timed abilities to either increase his damage output or escape from dangerous assassins.  There are many hills and valleys inherent to his playstyle, especially in drawn-out fights, and proper usage of his windows of strength will separate the good Satorus from the great Satorusâ„¢.\n\n#Note: I purposely avoid numbers in this concept because they're not for me to balance.  This is all in general terms.\n\n> Passive - **Pristine Grace**\n> For every auto attack against an enemy champion, Satoru gains a stack of Pristine Grace.  Each stack of Pristine Grace gives Satoru additional Attack Speed, and at maximum stacks, Satoru's next ability gains an additional effect and resets his Pristine Grace stacks back to 0.\n\n> * *This is Satoru's primary contribution to his \"hill/valley\" playstyle.  The longer he attacks, the more attack speed he gets, so he ramps up over the course of an extended fight.  Conversely, when he's at maximum stacks, he has to juggle between retaining his stacks (for DPS) or using his empowered abilities, whether they be for burst or escape purposes.  Once he uses his ability, the cycle resets and he enters his ramp-up period again, leading to a methodical playstyle with peaks and troughs that a good Satoru player can abuse but a good opponent can also use to their advantage.*\n\n---\n\n> Q | **Dragon's Fang**\n> Satoru nocks an arrow and fires it in the target direction after a brief windup (he cannot move during this windup).  The arrow explodes into splinters upon hitting a target or after reaching its maximum range, dealing physical damage to all enemies hit.  Generating a stack of Pristine Grace reduces Dragon's Fang's cooldown.\n> **Pristine Grace**: Satoru fires Dragon's Fang instantly, with no windup.\n\n> * *And here you have it, his main damage spell (surprised it's his Q?  /s).  Ideally, it'd be a pretty fast-moving projectile, with the trade-off being that it has a short wind-up time that renders him immobile and will telegraph where he's firing it.  This is also why its Pristine Grace bonus seems trivial (it doesn't increase its outright damage, just makes it easier to use), since it does multiple things at once: circumvents the inherent immobility of the ability, while also allowing him to fire it toward his enemies without telegraphing it with a wind-up.  The trade-off here is the same with any other ability empowered by his passive: he loses his Attack Speed bonus after using it this way.  Peaks and troughs is the name of the game here.* \n> * *Also up for debate is the cooldown reduction with Pristine Grace stack generation.  With how his passive works, Satoru will inevitably run into a problem where his abilities are on cooldown and he's at maximum stacks, leaving him with no real choice but to use his stacks for the Attack Speed.  Since it's no fun to be forced into that situation, tying his stack generation to the cooldown of his main damaging ability (even if it's only a small reduction) will mean he has more strategic options with generating and using his stacks rather than the typical \"ADC right click things to death.\"*\n\n---\n\n> W | **Serpent's Wrath** (Passive)\n> Auto attacks against enemy champions apply Serpent's Wrath for a short time, which can only be applied once to the same target in a given time frame.  If one of Satoru's abilities hits an enemy affected with Serpent's Wrath, the ability consumes the debuff and deals additional damage, as well as grants Satoru additional Pristine Grace stacks.\n\n> * *I want to immediately say that this \"additional damage\" was not % health damage (as has become so popular) in theory.  In my head, I imagined it as \"the ability you procced Serpent's Wrath with does X% additional damage\", rather than proccing a % health damage like, say, Varus or Gnar.  This retains some meaningful counter-itemization to Satoru, as his abilities will still be doing physical damage, just perhaps a bit more of it, avoiding the Varus situation where a tank has trouble building Armor or Health because of how his W works.  Oh, and I'll also take this opportunity to say that, themetically, Satoru is quite similar to Varus.  Hazard a guess as to why after reading the lore and his quotes, eh?*\n> * *I also chose to tie his procs with his passive because it has no meaningful tie-in otherwise due to not being an activated ability.  This is also why I didn't make his Q cooldown reduced by auto attacking, but rather by generating passive stacks--ideally, you can generate multiple stacks by proccing his W and reduce his Q cooldown by a significant amount all at once.*\n\n----\n\n> E | **Wyrm's Cunning**\n> Satoru fires an arrow in the targeted direction, hitting the ground a set distance away from him with such force that it creates a shockwave, dealing physical damage to all enemies in the area of effect.  Satoru rides the edge of the shockwave, vaulting backwards a distance.\n> **Pristine Grace**: Satoru's adrenaline surges after vaulting, granting him additional movement speed for a duration afterwards.\n\n> * *\"MOBILITY CREEP #BIGSORRY\".  No, but seriously, with the hyper-mobility meta of the current day and his inherent immobility outside of a Pristine Grace empowered Q, I felt Satoru was really lacking in the mobility department so I gave him a little boost.  The idea is that it gives him a small amount of mobility and playmaking potential, whether it be for catching up to someone or running away from an assassin, but the brunt of its mobility boost will be tied to whether he empowers it with his passive for the extra movement speed afterward.  If he does, he loses his attack speed and loses his opportunity to use the stacks for more damage abilities, but also gets himself to safety.  Meaningful trade-off, I'd say.*\n\n---\n\n> R | **Heavens' Verdict**\n> After a brief windup, Satoru fires a unique arrow with such force that it creates a shockwave in the shape of a dragon, dealing physical damage to everything in its path.\n> **Pristine Grace**: Satoru puts so much force behind firing the arrow that it stuns all enemies it hits.\n\n> * *This is, admittedly, one part of Overwatch Hanzo I just couldn't let go.  Come on, summoning a MASSIVE AIR SHOCKWAVE DRAGON?  I'd be remiss if that didn't become an integral part of Satoru's identity.  In my head, I'm visualizing a non-global Ezreal ult (channel time included).  Its passive-empowered effect is the only CC in Satoru's kit, and it's tied to his ultimate meaning it won't always be up to save him.  That said, it does massive area of effect damage, which, tied with Satoru's Q AoE, makes Satoru a pretty damn mean teamfighter when his passive is used correctly.  Also, did I mention MASSIVE AIR SHOCKWAVE DRAGON?*\n\n---\n\n#Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nSo, with all that said, what are the strengths and weaknesses I foresee a champion like Satoru having?\n\nSome of you may read this and think, \"well, what can't he do?\"  Well, aside from tank (which should be a given), I think it's important to realize that I designed Satoru to be good at quite a few things, **but only under specific circumstances**.  His passive is integral to his playstyle and plays a massive role in not only what Satoru decides to do, but what his opponents try to do to counter him.  He has great mobility, but only if he uses his passive-empowered E.  He has good on-the-spot burst AoE damage, but largely is only reliable with it using his empowered Q.  His teamfight potential is pretty insane, but that assumes he can remain safe and secure enough to use an empowered R for the stun, much less hit people with it due to its obvious, telegraphed nature.  And keep in mind that, after using one of the above things, he cannot use any others until he ramps up again.\n\nRemember how I said peaks and troughs were key to playing as, and against, Satoru?  Monitoring his passive stacks is crucial to get a read on what he's capable of at any given moment.  If you're going through the pokefest before a teamfight worried about a potential Satoru ult stunning your whole team but you suddenly see him use his empowered Q, then voila: he's weak on both the escape and the teamfight front and perhaps it'd be an advantageous time to engage.\n\nAll this is to say that yes, Satoru has strengths--a lot of them.  But they all hinge on not only how the Satoru player chooses to use his passive, but also how his opponents choose to force him to use it.  His passive is unforgiving in the sense that, at maximum stacks, your next ability is *forced* to proc it, and that's not because I hate quality of life changes, it's because it encourages smart play both as and against Satoru based on how he uses his passive.  Counterplay, yay!\n\nIt goes without saying that this is all theory-based.  I could be entirely wrong and this, if it was ever actually made a champion, could very well be the most overpowered champion in the game.  I designed him to be fun and balanced, but without numbers like mana costs, cooldowns, and damage, it's hard to foresee exactly what the repercussions of these ability and passive mechanics would be. \n\nWith that in mind, and the actual champion concept out of the way, feel free to read on for the various Satoru lore and quote shenanigans I spent way too much time on.\n\n---\n\n#Lore and Quotes\n\nI feel as if putting the 3 page lore story I wrote would be too much (the post is already quite long counting the quotes, which are next), so I'll link you the google doc  I wrote that has the entire champion concept in it, including lore and quotes.  And while the quotes are in there as well, I do want to put some here just to give you a glimpse of the personality of the Satoru I envision.    The google doc in question starts with lore, goes into the abilities (which you can skip, of course, given that I trust you've read them already) and then goes into quotes and whatnot.  It's not comprehensive since there's only so much you can do with a champion concept done purely for fun, but hey, I was probably a lot more thorough than I really should have been.\n\nAforementioned google doc with everything in it, albeit not with pretty LoL Board formatting nor my dull personal commentary on everything (pending, Google Docs hates me) (ok Dropbox it is) \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/wrsu2ix4bknzk6r/satoru.docx?dl=0\n\n**Selection**\n\n> * *\"Leave yourself behind... become the arrow in flight.\"*\n\n**Starting the game**\n\n> * *\"Even a teacher must learn.\"*\n> * *\"My quiver is full.

The largest and most consistent problem I heard raised is his ult stun: an AoE stun on top of his massive damage could be pretty stupid, and it may force Satoru into a \"hold-passive-stacks-for-ult-at-all-times\" playstyle, which is hardly fun and ends up being quite oppressive.  There are a few potential ways to balance this, not the least of which being to make the stun fairly short or to cut down on the ult's damage itself (though I think that would be a poor way to balance it and essentially force him to using into using it with his passive to make it worthwhile).  I justify such strength thusly: every usage of his passive is an opportunity cost in a lot of ways, and being that it's his ultimate,  it won't always be up to break the game.  But hey, I'm just putting the concerns out there to acknowledge that they do exist and I don't claim that this champion is anywhere near perfect.\n* **Dragon motif.** Dragons have a fair bit of representation in League, and it may occur to you that I might've overplayed the \"dragon\" theme a bit (without him actually being a dragon).  This is for a few reasons: the most important one being that I wanted his signature ability to involve MASSIVE AIR SHOCKWAVE DRAGONS.  Given the immense flavor of such a spell, I thought it only fair to center his identity around it, through both his ability names and lore.  I would also like to mention that League has yet to have a dragon-themed champion or ability that conforms to the Asian dragon mythos, which is quite a different take on the dragonkin we're familiar with, like Shyvana and... well... Dragon.  And while Ao Shin may become a thing sooner or later, perhaps that could just be another way Satoru ties in, since he quite likes his dragons, as it were.  Suffice it to say that I played and concentrated on the dragon motif for a specific reason: I wanted Satoru to have an unmistakable identity and flavor about him.\n* **Stereotypical**.  \"Wise Japanese man with bow giving vague and esoteric advice on how to become a master\" didn't have a nice ring to it as a name, but I'm sure it's not lost on many of you that Satoru conforms to a lot of stereotypes (this sort of connects with the above point).  Putting aside that this shouldn't be a problem given that at least half of the champions on League are based on stereotypes and common lore throughout the world, I do want to mention that I chose Satoru to follow this stereotype largely because I don't think I could've given him as much flavor elsewhere.  While he is based off Overwatch Hanzo, his lore is significantly different (actually, Hanzo from Overwatch is more similar to Yasuo lore- and personality-wise), and that's due to my attempts to give him a flavor that hadn't yet been filled in League.  Now we have our very own Japanese sensei, though.  No, Master Yi doesn't count because he has swordboots.\n\nAnd probably ten other problems I'm not thinking of.  But that's for you guys to decide.  Otherwise, I hope you enjoyed reading my far too in-depth commentary on literally everything, and let 'er rip with criticsms.","replies":[{"poster":"Sett It Straight","date":"2015-02-25T19:52:04.706+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the way he treats other adcs who don't use a bow and the way he talks to varus and just the way he talks.

I think the real difference between them would have to be proven in their gameplay rather than how their spells are designed.  I've compared it before to Yasuo and Riven's relationship, where there Qs are almost entirely the same spell but different enough and with different importance within the context of their kit as a whole that they play like almost entirely different champions.  With Satoru, I view it much the same way.\n\nAs for an interaction with Yasuo, I thought of it (given the two are nearly related just by how they conform to those classic \"pensive lone wolf master of swords/bows\", and his quotes are by no means finished.  I stopped perhaps midway through brainstorming quotes because I figured I had enough, but interactions with other Ionians (not just limited to Yasuo, though he'd be the first on my list) is certainly not out of the realm of possibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Definety","date":"2015-02-26T07:38:20.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, the W is fine since every champion here and there will have similar skills. But as for the ult, I think the idea of launching a dragon shaped shock wave into the air and landing as a huge AOE would be a bit cooler and will differentiate it between Varus' and Satoru's ultimate. If you're having a hard time imagining; I guess my idea of the ult would be similar to that of Ziggs' ult or Panth's ult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"causeimdabatman","date":"2015-02-25T20:25:58.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"LOL WOW KID nice taking hanzo from overwatch and trying to make him a champ without giving credit to blizzard.","replies":[{"poster":"Gandeeva","date":"2015-02-25T20:37:29.361+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you... did you even read the first sentence?\n\n>I want to preface this by saying this Champion Concept was heavily inspired by Hanzo from the upcoming Blizzard game, Overwatch.","replies":[{"poster":"causeimdabatman","date":"2015-02-25T21:19:10.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gandeeva,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=cA8sxwiR,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-02-25T20:37:29.361+0000)\n>\n> Did you... did you even read the first sentence?\n\nYes i did read it i was just trolling and he didnt even bother to at least alter the concept, it is literally a picture of hanzo.
