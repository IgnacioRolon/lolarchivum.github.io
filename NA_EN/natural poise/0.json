It never gets to the screen to begin patching, closing just after the League of Legends logo flashes up on the screen. Seems similar to an issue I had with a previous patch, in which my antivirus was blocking the patcher, but this time of course the LoLPatcherUx.exe is already in my antivirus' exclusion list. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-25T22:44:35.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, you're selecting the LoL icon but the patcher crashes after launching.  If tihs is the case then there could be a corruption with your patcher that's failing to launch properly and get you to the login screen.  I suggest using our[ patching issues ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)guide to help get this fixed up.  \n\nIt could also certainly be a security setting with your OS or antivirus that's not allowing the patcher to open, and in this case you can use our [permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) article to allow access.  I would still recommend going over our patching issues guide first, though.  Hopefully, this gets you squared away!","replies":[{"poster":"Natural Poise","date":"2016-08-26T00:20:12.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response. I have tried some of those items, though not all. I don't think it's a patching issue, I think something external is forcing it to shut down. There is no error message or etc, it starts to run then just disappears. Screenshot shows how far it gets, sometimes the progress bar starts to move, then it immediately dies. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6cWom","replies":[{"poster":"Natural Poise","date":"2016-08-26T02:37:09.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like it must have been a hard drive error, running the repair seems to have fixed it.
