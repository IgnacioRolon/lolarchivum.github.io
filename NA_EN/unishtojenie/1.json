The rate of hextech key fragments have not changed with the new honor system.  The only difference is the addition of more keys via level 3 Capsules.  Per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, you should see about 12 about every month.

Per the guide you'll get roughly 12 every 28 days.  Once you get to Honor level 3, you'll also have a chance for capsules with even more, which does not count towards the 12!","replies":[{"poster":"unishtojenie","date":"2017-07-29T19:58:16.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yaay but il probaly not even make it to level 3 :p","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
