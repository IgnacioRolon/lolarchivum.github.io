I have several ways to prove this is my account, but when you guys go over 24 hours to reply to my ticket, I get the feeling you're trying to contact me through the account or e-mail I have no access to. I'd really love to get in touch with either Riot OR Yahoo, but yahoo doesn't accept almost any form of contact and the only way I can call for you guys is either through said ticket or this post. I've spent way too much money and way too much time on this game to just have it slip through my fingers like this and I'm freaking out. I'd really appreciate something from you guys. If you can help at all, please contact me through this account/e-mail.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-19T01:26:16.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo TPP,\n\nWell, our support system does reply by email. You still need an email to get emailed updates from your ticket. If you log into the same account you used when you created the ticket, you should be able to see any and all updates to the ticket that have happened since then. Even if you cannot access your original email, if you create a ticket with an email you are using, you should be able to get any and all updates relevant to your issue there!","replies":[{"poster":"TPP Grimboja","date":"2016-04-19T01:58:21.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ticket is open on this account.
