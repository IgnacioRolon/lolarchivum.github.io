Spawn voidlings, then allow Malz to die. You will see his voidlings disappear instantly 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nThis should not be how Malz&#039;s voidling act... they should last the full duration after he dies.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-12-07T05:56:14.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....That's how it's intended to work.\n\nThe skill is working correctly.","replies":[]}]}
