EUW for a example with a similiar name (that has been taken before me) suddenly thinks of changing to the NA servers, will i loose my Summoner name (Turning it into a Temp name untill i buy another Summoner name change) ? \n\nAnd if the person in EUW don't change servers, will i be able to keep the name similiar/same?\n\nJust curious that i don't waste money on changing my Summoner Name if someone on the other server's have the same name as i do.\n\nPS. Sorry if this is in the wrong Sub-Category, wasn't sure if to ask here or in Miscellaneous.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-06-24T00:41:07.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner names are only held on the server they are registered to.
