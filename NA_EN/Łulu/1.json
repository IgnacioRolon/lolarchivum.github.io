FGM and Ranked, nope nada. its pissing me the god damn off im about to rip my hair out. i cant have ONE DAMN CHILL GAME OF NORMS without having to reconnect everytime i kill a minion leading to my laner getting easy farm and destroying my other allies. thus leading me getting reported. this is so unfair, i didnt do anything to deserve this. i just want a nice game of league..\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/m9VSMbP.png\r\nLast game's network log.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T22:07:28.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really strange that you'd have to connect through 4G, so I'm curious if maybe there is an issue with the device or anything else that may be connected to it.

Lately due to the anger i get on with this problem, ive kinda gotten toxic towards questioning people asking why i keep reconnecting and just through uncontrollable anger, it just comes out with a little too far toxicity and i really dont want to be mean to ppl or toxic or anything so im hoping to get this fixed before it leads to bans on my account. Really dont want to lose this account after spending so much on it and the first ban popping up.","replies":[]}]}]}
