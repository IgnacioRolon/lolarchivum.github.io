Was able to play for about a week, and now, when I try to load the game, as soon as I click on the LoL icon on the desktop, I get a Windows error saying \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.\" I can't get past this screen at all. The patcher won't load, the launcher won't come up, nothing. That screen is all I get.\r\n\r\nI originally played LoL on a Mac, but was so sick of the problems like constant bugsplats, being disconnected, and having crappy FPS that I decided to install the client on the Windows 8.1 Bootcamp partition I had already installed for other games. I wanted to use Razer Cortex to boost the game, which helps, but now I can't play.\r\n\r\nThe client works just fine on the Mac partition, but now that's the only way I can play, even though I wanted to get away from the Mac client in the first place. What's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-27T21:58:40.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Shawizzle!\n\nThis is actually pretty odd due to the fact that you are running Windows through a partition on your Mac.  Usually when Patrcher Kernel errors appear, it is due to some odd admin permissions settings found on the OS, blocking it from running normally.  To that end, just to rule out some possible root causes, can you try completing all of the steps in our [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)?\n\nIf it is still consistently giving you the same error message, make sure to reply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Shawizzle","date":"2015-03-31T23:39:02.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Dartagnan. It was a problem with the administrator settings. When I got to the step that told me to right click and run the program as an administrator, it loaded right up. Which is odd, since I only have one user on the Windows partition and it is an administrator user. So my issue is resolved. I'm just not sure what changed exactly. I didn't change any permissions on my user at all.","replies":[]}]}]}
