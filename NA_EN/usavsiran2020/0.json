First Game I was just talkin' trash to the enemy mid laner I was going against because he started talking shit to me. I really don't think I crossed the line anywhere. Maybe calling him a noob was toxic enough for chat ban? idk. I just dont understand because Riot has a loading screen quote that encourages banter. I just don't see how I crossed the line between banter and \"extreme toxicity\"\r\n\r\n2nd game: I get chat ban for bitching about yasuo? I wasnt being toxic I just fucking hate that champ. How do I get chat ban lmao wtf. Also idk how I even get in trouble for that game in the first place when we had two players rage quit before 5 minutes into the game so it was a legitimate 3v5 lmao.

Also, do you not find it ironic that you dismiss someone for being Silver, and then get onto someone else's case for dismissing someone for being Bronze?\n\nBecause I find that very, very ironic.\n\n> 20th Account Ban: kindred u lost lane just deal with it\n20th Account Ban: youre losing this game kindred sorry\n20th Account Ban: u r\n20th Account Ban: u r\n\nUnsportsmanlike behavior, general harassment.\n\n> 20th Account Ban: such an easy game. thanks for the free win kindred\n20th Account Ban: youre the one that played a ranged mid\n20th Account Ban: nah he flamed earlier\n20th Account Ban: so he deserves this\n20th Account Ban: no i wont\n20th Account Ban: i havent said anything bad\n20th Account Ban: riot encourages banter and trash talk, just not toxic\n20th Account Ban: ez\n20th Account Ban: love a free win\n20th Account Ban: lmao\n20th Account Ban: u muted me?\n\nAnd the rest of the game proceeds with more of the same; being a sore winner and harassing Kindred, and getting into a detrimental argument.\n\nBear in mind, none of what you said throughout the match is banter. There's trash-talk, certainly, but you also cross the line into inflammatory behavior pretty readily. And no; regardless of whether or not they flamed, Kindred did not deserve you harassing them and beating them down over losing lane.\n\nSportsmanship > trash-talk. If most of your chat involves trash talk, you're probably doing it far too much.\n\nGoing on to Game 2...\n\n> 20th Account Ban: yas such a noob champ lol\n20th Account Ban: zero skill require for yas\n20th Account Ban: but gg mf ragr quit\n20th Account Ban: But like honestly yasuo needs to be removed from game\n20th Account Ban: why\n20th Account Ban: ?\n20th Account Ban: cuz yasuo requires zero skill\n20th Account Ban: and is insanely op\n\nExcessive complaining about Yasuo, which is pointless and detrimental. I'm not sure what you expect to accomplish by voicing your opinions in-game, but whatever it is, you didn't get it.\n\nAnd on top of that, negativity through calling an early \"GG\" and pointing out a teammate disconnecting.\n\n> 20th Account Ban: its 3v5 lol\n20th Account Ban: yo if u look at the score\n20th Account Ban: thats what the team is right now\n20th Account Ban: ok\n20th Account Ban: i just called them\n20th Account Ban: they said no\n20th Account Ban: is yasuo not the most broken champ riot has ever created or nah\n20th Account Ban: then why does every bronze player ever play yasuo\n20th Account Ban: ive played like 3 kass games ever and thsi guy mains yasuo\n20th Account Ban: so?\n20th Account Ban: i said that cuz u were flaming me for my cs\n20th Account Ban: i dont care bout this one\n20th Account Ban: i just hate yasuo\n20th Account Ban: for certain champs sure\n20th Account Ban: yasuo tornado has a huge hit box\n20th Account Ban: one of the hardest to dodge in game actually\n\nAnd the excessive negativity just really doesn't stop at any point here.\n\n> 20th Account Ban: ok go play mid then\n20th Account Ban: im going bot\n20th Account Ban: and?\n20th Account Ban: u said hes easy\n\nLike, there's not a single line in this chat log that isn't some degree of excessive, pointless negativity or detrimental arguing.\n\n> 20th Account Ban: surefire phrase to get banned but ok\n20th Account Ban: how? i just lost\n20th Account Ban: me losing lane is less re*ortable than you falmign me all game\n20th Account Ban: no it snot\n20th Account Ban: complaiing about a champion being op is not\n\nFrom the first line to the last, it's just non-stop complaining and bickering and arguing. If you need to vent, get a friend and ramble at them, don't spill your negativity into chat.\n\n> I just dont understand because Riot has a loading screen quote that encourages banter. I just don't see how I crossed the line between banter and \"extreme toxicity\"\n\nA quick Google search should prove pretty enlightening on that front.\n\n> **Banter**\n> _noun_\n> - the playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks.\n>\n> _verb_\n> - talk or exchange remarks in a good-humored teasing way.\n\nNone of what you said in Game 1 was good-humored, friendly, or playful. You were just insulting a player for the sake of rubbing salt in the wound when you beat them. That's neither banter, nor sportsmanlike behavior.\n\n> I get chat ban for bitching about yasuo? I wasnt being toxic I just fucking hate that champ. How do I get chat ban lmao wtf.\n\nWell, to start with, you spent nearly half the match complaining specifically about Yasuo (12/32~ lines of chat), and the rest of the lines you spent complaining about the general state of the match being a 3v5 or otherwise arguing with your teammates.\n\nIf you hate Yasuo, talk to a friend about it or make a post in the [RANT](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/rant) subforum. Or, if you can get into nitty-gritty details without being hyperbolic and point out flaws or issues in his kit that needs addressed, you could try your hand at [Gameplay](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance), but bear in mind that the standard for posts there is fairly high.\n\nNobody wants to play a match with someone who spends way too much time complaining about a given Champion being \"OP\" or \"broken\" or whatever else. That kind of negativity detracts from the game and makes your teammates _not_ want to work with you - and when you're already down two of them, you're definitely shooting yourself in the foot by annoying the other two.\n\n> Also idk how I even get in trouble for that game in the first place when we had two players rage quit before 5 minutes into the game so it was a legitimate 3v5 lmao.\n\nOther people breaking the rules doesn't give you free reign to break them yourself. Unless you can find a stipulation somewhere in the [Code of Conduct](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#code-conduct) that says \"These rules are considered void if other players break them first\", but I've breezed through it a couple times myself and haven't seen anything of the sort.\n\n> We ff 15'd with 3 votes.\n\nGood to hear you at least got out of that match relatively early enough, but that doesn't change the fact that all of your chat in that match was exceedingly negative, pointless, and detrimental, and that someone reported you for it.\n\nAs stated above, there's no stipulations in the Code of Conduct that consider the rules void at any point or under any set-specific circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"USAvsIRAN2020","date":"2020-01-19T10:19:54.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Well thanks for the breakdown.

Also had no idea that if two players on your team rage quit 5 minutes into the game after dying twice, you aren't allowed to say anything about it in chat otherwise its an auto-ban for simply stating that they rage quit.

I think this is a borderline example of the system's judgement being wrong. The program didn't glitch, it is simply becoming skewed in what should constitute punishment by report saturation.\n\nThere were enough trigger words that you said to trigger the system. Over time, the program identifies phrases and words that you use in games that you are reported in. The repeated use of those words will be considered more toxic by the system, which, without understanding of context (which the rules specifically say context does not matter, rule established after the ban program was implemented), will eventually punish you for.\nThe only way to avoid this is to try to not get reported or don't say anything remotely negative. At all.
