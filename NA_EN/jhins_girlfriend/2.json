She's a strong contender for my favorite, and given how much I love Zoe and Tristana, that's an accomplishment.\n\nI do have one suggestion, though: I feel like Zoe's familiars _not_ matching her heterochromatic eyes here is a missed opportunity. You took the step to give her two differently colored familiars, and one of them even seems to match one of her eyes.

The pink, curly hair; the bow on the back of her outfit; the way her dress looks like icing on a cake. Her eyes even feel like the right shade of pink and blue.
