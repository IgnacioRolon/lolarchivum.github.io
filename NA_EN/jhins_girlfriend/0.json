She is my favorite too. \n\nHowever, Riot said that they wouldn't change Miss Fortune's base skin due to one main reason. Riot confirmed that Miss Fortune has two outfits that she wears around Bilgewater. One is her Captain outfit that she wears while on official business as seen in her comic and during the Burning Tides event. Her current classic skin is Miss Fortune's bounty hunting outfit that she wears while she isn't doing pirate-y stuff. \n\nMainly, her current classic is her Bounty Hunter wear.
