This bug has existed since 5.12 (the Nautilus VFX updates).\n\n**Video**\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2nVTmON6oKw?t=1m23s\n\n**Steps to reproduce**: Pick Nautilus, use W (Titan&#039;s Wrath).\n\n**Expected result**: The shield graphics (the window grates) should be coloured correctly.\n\n**Observed result**: The shield graphics have no texture and appear almost completely black.\n\n**Reproduction rate**: 100%. Have also tried repairing and completely reinstalling so am sure it&#039;s not a problem with my game files.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-28T00:23:46.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya BurnOutBrighter,\n\nThanks for the well-documented report!

However on earlier skin spotlights you can see the shield has the same colour scheme as his skin - black and gold.","replies":[]}]}]}
