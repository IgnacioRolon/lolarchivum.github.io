Pings to google get me between 24 and 26ms and all other games have a similar ping to that. Just league is sitting at 98ms consistently. Before this patch I was sitting at 24-29ms every game. Pretty sure it's gonna be on my end but I have no idea what could be causing such a high ping for only one game. I'm on windows 7 if that means anything. Any and all help would be appreciated because I love playing this game.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, my ping does go up if I start downloading or whatnot. So I do know that I can manipulate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-01T21:54:52.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've received quite a few reports on this, and it looks like there's currently an issue with ATT causing an increase in ping for a few players.
