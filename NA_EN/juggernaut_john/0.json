However, if your intent is _obvious_ and you end up getting manually reported. Then its not the bot but an actual PSS scanning your report. Which means that you can no longer evade the punishment. \n\nAlso, even if they aren't manually ticketed. Once reports accumulate, someone is definitely going to have a look at what's going on. And if they get to see you evading ZT words or using racial slurs by misspelling words intentionally. Then its likely going to result in a punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-06T14:22:26.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He’s not right.
