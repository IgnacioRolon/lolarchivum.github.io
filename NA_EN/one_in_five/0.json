LOL. \n\nI need to know, does league not use a graphics card to run? That seems to be what is going on here. I know League is undeveloped and sort of poorly put together but really, whats going on here? Dont tell me to turn off V-sync or something stupidly obvious cause that's not the problem. Yes I've went through your little troubleshooting guide and none of that seems to fix the problem. Where is my 500 fps? I will post my DxDiag to see if anyone can assist me in resolving the problem(:\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Smashy","date":"2017-10-26T12:07:10.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just recently bought a gtx 1080 ti and I am experiencing the same problem :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Townslave","date":"2017-06-06T01:00:24.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing with 50-70 fps for 3 weeks now, I always had 200 before and I have a gtx1060.

It sounds a little bit like a slap in the face for the ones who might take gaming seriously and have these higher end computers that they have spent a bit of time building. I didn't spend money on this computer to play league -thank god-. but for someone who might, would it be a good idea to at least send a disclaimer that this is a problem? Now. The second I opened league for the first time and saw 500 fps in the top right corner on my 165 hz 2k monitor was freakin amazing. it was so smooth. I saw that once right when i booted it up and never saw it again. sad. anyways. hopefully riot can fix this issue or at least throw out a disclaimer so people don't get a little surprise after building a computer. \nThanks!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Okarin 001","date":"2017-06-08T21:06:21.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What helped me a bit with a jerky image:\nhttps://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-turn-off-game-bar-windows-10-a.html\nAll in one - turn off the Win+G Addon.
