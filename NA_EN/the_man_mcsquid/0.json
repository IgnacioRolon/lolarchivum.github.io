A friend of mine told me there would be a refund but i haven't had a way to get online for so long i don't think i received anything. Please let me know what i can do, or if anything can be done for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T05:00:56.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kokua's got the gist of it; basically if you had a large sum of Runes purchased before a certain point, you would receive a mission that could be completed by playing one matchmade game. Doing that would give you Hextech Items that essentially gave the Runes-worth of Blue Essence to your account. The same was true for any Rune Pages your bought; you would receive Blue Essence for those bought with IP and Epic Skins for every 4 skins rounded up.\n\nLooking at your account, I can already see you completed and received the Hextech Items as well as 2 epic skins. You've actually not used the Orbs containing that Blue Essence yet, so open your Loot inventory from the home tab and do that to get your earnings! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-05T03:30:16.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runes were removed and people were given a quest to complete to obtain a sum of Blue Essence proportional to the runes that were removed from their account. Don't expect a full refund if you purchased the runes before they announced the runes update. If you purchased pages, they gave rewards depending on how many you owned.","replies":[]}]}
