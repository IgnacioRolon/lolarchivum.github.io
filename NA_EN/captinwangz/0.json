Also, very few people are offended by anything you say. We are annoyed and don't want to play with you, not offended.\n\nYou meaning whoever is being toxic, not necissarily OP.\n\nEDIT: I don't know much about Shaco's builds or how they have changed, sorry for my ignorance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2017-02-11T09:13:56.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Game is still fun, we just have to tread carefully and hope we dont offend some punk little kid when we tell them to stop dying so much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptinWangz","date":"2018-08-08T10:07:14.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY TOXIC!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptinWangz","date":"2017-02-14T19:10:35.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TOXIC!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptinWangz","date":"2017-02-13T08:15:23.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just getting the bump to keep those Toxic downvotes going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptinWangz","date":"2017-02-11T11:48:31.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying as much as \"WOW\" or \"OMG\" or \"WTF\" will get you labeled as toxic and get the 12y/o raging and not playing. It's pretty impressive how much these games cater to those people anymore.\n\nDefinitely not everything is viable in 3's, you either play the most op/staple champs or lose. It's really that simple. Every one in idk 5 games you can get away with a non T1 champ as long as someone is carrying you, that is. Just not fun. OVER 100 Champs and you fight the same 10 endlessly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptinWangz","date":"2017-02-11T10:51:49.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't forget to write toxic while you downvote!","replies":[]}]}
