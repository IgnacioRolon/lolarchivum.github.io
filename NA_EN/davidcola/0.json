I then expected to get honor 4 as well, but no luck. I have been playing for about 1-3 hours a day, honoring people every game, and I don't suspect I get reported. People seem to have gotten honor 5 easily, but I'm stuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-01T21:19:56.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone is going to progress through the Honor Ranks at a different pace simply because they play a different amount of games and get a different amount of honors in each game. Some may have ranked up faster because they played more games every day, others might have been getting honored 4 times in every match.","replies":[]}]}
