Darius? Thresh? exactly)... if it were me, I would chunk his movement speed from 340 to 325 to magnify his weakness (No dashes/mobility) and let him benefit from his strengths (Burst/High synergy with masteries/etc.).\n\nBut that's just me, who knows what Riot will do to bring him into balance with the others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2015-11-17T07:31:20.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did you come up with the idea they're doing anything to Brand?
