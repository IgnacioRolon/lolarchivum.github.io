Then i build for hexdrinker always. Use E on a minion and poke with q, get out quick, harass him to make sure he gets decently low. And then surprise burst him, ppl usually have a gard time relying to the crazy burst talon has and greatly understimate the damage he can do. But fizz is still a motherfucker. What is nice is that rake goes through minions and has a higher range than what is shown+ fizz is melee.
