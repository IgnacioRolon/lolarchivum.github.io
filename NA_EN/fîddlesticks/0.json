It did't even give cdr at the time. That is how bad assassin itemization was back then XD\n\nAs for the topic creator, nobody would make that item even with the movespeed and magic resistance. Compared to their current items it would not provide the damage needed to be a staple and would be too expensive to put in a counter build.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
