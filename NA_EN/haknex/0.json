That might mean something was going on with your ISP or the network stability in your area, but regardless let's go ahead and troubleshoot a bit to cover some basics.\n\nGo ahead and make a couple adjustments to your Port Forwarding and DNS settings to see if we can get you a smoother link to our game servers. If you aren't sure how to make those changes, check out those two steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and test them in a custom/practice match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"50ShadesOfPlay","date":"2017-11-02T21:30:18.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, i have had 50 ping all day and all of a sudden right now I have 800 ping.
