Roam collapsed because a 1v2 against a strong ADC with solid Support backup was untenable.  EU didn't show it to NA in Worlds.  It was already a thing by March or so if memory serves.  Months before World's rolled around.\n\nThe main difference between the EU and NA metas in Season 1 was that NA was much more team-fight focused while EU centered around Poke/disengage and split pushing particularly with TF.\n\nIt took about eight months from ranked being released for people to find the ideal *lane positions*.  Team compositions, however, have been largely mercurial and have shifted with the game's over-all balance.  Because of the five *lane positions* the range of *team compositions* that are viable are sharply limited on Summoner's Rift.\n\nDominion doesn't have that issue because it has two lane positions, not five.

There being no set lane positions doesn't matter, in the previous example NA couldn't on its own discover the best synergistic format for roles, so it's preposterous to assume a much smaller group of people will in dominion.\n\nYour example is wrong, though.  And it's a faulty analogy.  Because the game kicks off as a 4v4 top there are always going to be counters and counter-counters to various types of team composition.  Because objectives don't favor any specific champion archetype, nothing is shoe-horned in.  In a Draft Pick environment your only concerns are synergizing with your team and countering the enemy team's composition.\n\nYou're stuck thinking that Dominion is like Summoner's Rift.

Over five thousand of games of experience vs a guy talking out his ass?  The examples you bring up are wrong.  Your whole argument is vacuous.  We might have fewer players, yes.  But our games aren't tainted by snowballing and we regularly grind our way through five to ten times as many team fights and skirmishes as the average game of Rift.\n\n'Oh but it took Rift players so long to figure things out!'\n\nWe had four top one bottom revive only final destination nailed down within six months of the map being released.

There's nothing inherently stopping it from happening.\n\n >Because objectives don't favor any specific champion archetype, nothing is shoe-horned in. \n\nI don't know about this. Any of the current widely-used archetypes, sure. But most archetypes are somewhat (if not completely) subjective.

But unless champions are balanced EXTREMELY well, which I highly doubt, there's going to be an optimal set of them that outclass others to some degree. Maybe not in every way, or in every possible teamcomp imaginable, but there are champs that are better than others.

I have a thing about spreading misinformation.  Suffice to say, this wasn't a thing that popped up from EU.  In fact, in a thread that popped up on the old boards while Support/ADC was really cementing itself a Rioter dropped in to mention that they had been running comps like that in their internal play tests for the past several months.\n\nDoubt I could find the thread again, but I figure if Riot's handful of testers were able to find the optimal lane positions despite being a pretty small group of folks then the Dominion player base, which is comparatively larger, should be able to do just fine.\n \n> This isn't true. It's completely possible for an optimal team comp to emerge that simply has no counter. One may not exist right now, but with balance changes one may in the future. There's nothing inherently stopping it from happening.\n\nThis is possible.  It is also possible that the universe is in fact made of chocolate pudding and our senses are lying to us.  Simply because there exists some chance that a thing may be does not mean that a thing is.  Given how many moving parts League has, I strongly doubt there's such a thing as an unbeatable team comp.\n\n> I don't know about this. Any of the current widely-used archetypes, sure. But most archetypes are somewhat (if not completely) subjective. And it's clear that the objectives favour some champions, for example, defending a point is much easier as Kog'Maw than as Tryndamere. \n\nTaking objectives is champion neutral.  But some champions are certainly better at defending points than others.  Of course, defending a point isn't always the best plan.  Sometimes you're better off falling back and finding somewhere else to attack.\n\n> Snowballing isn't inherently bad.\n\nSure.  Some games snowball (Chess) others do not (Baseball).  But in a game like League, snowballing is the direct cause of quite a bit of toxic player behavior.  It also obscures the raw mechanical strength of champions.  Because players in Dominion are on more or less equal footing, it is much easier to get a feel for relative champion power.\n\n> Sure.

I met many people who said we will lose just because we have AN ADC in the WHOLE team. And when you look at ADC-s, the best ones on Dominion will always be Miss Fortune, Sivir and a well played Caitlyn. They are safe, they have high mobility, and good long range poke to disrupt enemies captures. They also are great at protecting towers.

Sivir is okay.\n\nEzreal is *almost always* built Blue or AP with 45% CDR, so the cooldown on his blink is next to non-existent.  Both builds often boast most damage done in a given game.\n\nCorki is good, but the lack of Essence Reaver really hurts him.  Riot *really* needs to add the BF Sword items to Dominion.
