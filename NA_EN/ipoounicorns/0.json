Its also less damage than electrocute (which has a lower CD) and Dark Harvest can outscale it easily (especially on Kayn, practically the best farming assassin jungler to have ever existed on sheer raw capability to pull in CS, especially with his godlike waveclear in the mid to late game with his W being able to 1 shot not just casters, but also melee minions, while they are still in line formation).\n\nFor me, the general Kayn setup is Electro-Sudden-Zombie-Rav-Celerity- and either Scorch, or Gathering Storm, depending on how long I think the game will go based on general comps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharp Chedarr","date":"2018-03-11T19:22:15.312+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"whoa thanks for the chart.

Only maybe the Tiamat, Gunblade and BorK are the items you get at the early game and out of those, only the Gunblade can be abused for its lower cooldown.\n2) Rune still needs to stack up, which means you need to get kills / assists for it to work well, which isn't always the case.\n3) Most of these actives aren't as useful, or do not really need the extra CDR. For example, a Stoneplate doesn't really need it. You use it, you win a fight, then you push, take Baron etc and you will have it back up regardless of the extra CDR. Sure, you can say that having Protobelt more often means you can go for more often aggressive trades with someone like Ekko or Vladimir, but you need to realize that you probably need to have your ult up to all in effectively, so the Protobelt will have its CD reset by the time you get your ult back.\n4) Most importantly, not a lot of champions make effective use of this tree. Supports who could definitely use a more often Locket / Redemption / Mikael's etc will rarely go into this tree. ADCs generally go for 1st + 3rd, Mages go for 3rd + 5th, top laners go for 4th + 5th mostly etc. You get my point.\n5) The extra movement speed you get, even out of combat, is really important. Early game, where you probably back often, will help you get back in lane and not miss a lot of cs, later it will help you rotate fast, assuming you have stacked it already, and is really good for junglers who spend most of their time roaming around the map.
