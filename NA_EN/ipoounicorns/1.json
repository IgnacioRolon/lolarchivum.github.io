I find it to be much more enjoyable than the other game modes. As someone who played Dominion religiously, this game mode fills the void Dominion left, and I feel it's much more approachable than Dominion was to the average player.\n \nChampion diversity is much better on this map than it is on Summoner's Rift, and a good team composition is vital to winning. Enchanter supports are surprisingly powerful, tanks are actually able to tank, marksmen are able to come online before the game is over and fighters, assassins and mages are still strong enough to be viable. The only champions that really struggles are Juggernauts, split pushers and champions that have been dumpstered because of pro play.\n___\n\n**Event Timing**\n\nEvents do not have a consistent start time, often the first event will be announced at 4:00 and start at 4:30, but it will occasionally be announced as early as 3:30 and start at 4:00. This disparity makes for quite a bit of awkwardness, as often times players will find themselves at level 5 rather than level 6 when the first event starts.\n\nI suggest that the events have a fixed Announcement / Start Time of:\n\n* Event 1: 4:00 Announcement, 4:30 Start\n* Event 2: 8:00 Announcement, 8:30 Start\n* Event 3: 12:00 Announcement, 12:30 Start\n* Event 4: 16:00 Announcement, 16:30 Start\n\nThis would bring clarity and consistency to the game mode, similar to how Baron always spawns at 20:00 minutes on Summoner's Rift.\n___\n\n**Event Breakdown &amp; Proposed Changes**\n\nPrize Fight:\nI love this event, though I do have some issues with it.\n\n* Everyone should be given 5 seconds to shop at the start of the event.\n* Each contestant should start with full health and mana.\n* The mini arena should be cleared of all spells, traps etc at the start &amp; between rounds. Starting on top of a Zoe bubble, Teemo shrooms etc just feels terrible.\n* Allow teams to choose who/when they fight in the time leading up to the event, while this might be difficult to implement, it would add more strategy and prevent undesirable pairings of teammates (ie tank + support etc)\n* Tweak the burning damage/conditions, often times it has the opposite effect of its intentions of forcing the contestants to fight. Especially when a player has to win a 1v2 followed by a 1v1, the team with two players will spend as much time as possible making the opponent burn to guarantee a final fight victory, or the final contestant the 1v2 wins the first fight and starts the next fight with less hp, but the remaining player on the other will refuse to fight and let the burning effect do the work. I suggest changing the damage to % current hp. Additionally, the burning damage makes keystones / effects that depend on being in combat either worthless or too strong.\n* Disable the event after 10 minutes if a team is ahead by ~5-10k gold or more. When it happens later in the game and the winning team has huge lead, it's essentially forced inting for the losing team.\n\nScuttle Crab Racing:\nThis event is decent, but not my favorite, and I wouldn't change much about it.\n\n* Reduce the effectiveness of flat movement speed increases on the scuttle crabs. Due to how they have such low base movement speed and how movement speed works, % movement speed buffs don't do very much to the scuttle, while flat movement speed increases drastically increase its speed.\n* Increase the tenacity of the scuttle crabs. While the displacement adjustments vastly increased the quality of this event, stun locking the crabs still seems a bit too effective.\n* Disable the event if a team has lost their inhibitor turret. If the losing team has lost their inhibitor, this event is impossible to contest without losing their Nexus towers outright. Additionally, the winning team has the luxury to kill the scuttle once, then ignore the event while destroying the rest of the enemy's base.\n\nBardle Royale:\nI like this event, but a few things make it feel terrible:\n\n* Paranoia is awful, plain and simple. I don't think I've played with anyone that actually enjoys the Paranoia version.\n* Lower the initial shrinking speed when the center of the circle is in a team's base. Too often members of the winning team will respawn/recall as the event starts and immediately die because they can't keep up with the circle.\n* Remove all minions / disable minion spawns during the event. Often times the winning team has taken the losing team's inhibitor before the event starts and the losing team is forced to lose towers/their nexus to stay inside the circle.\n* Disable the jungle towers during the event\n\nKing of the Hill:\nThis event almost never happens, but I enjoy it when it does happen.\n\n* Seriously, just increase how often this event happens.\n* Potentially add 2 more zones to control to make it a bit more interesting.\n\nUrf Deathmatch:\nThis event is rather cheesy, but still fun.\n\n* Change the spawning mechanics to allow the players to move at a reduced speed while respawning, being stun locked the moment you spawn is dumb.\n* Adjust the burning damage/conditions. The issues are pretty much the same as those in prize fight, but it seems that being in combat does not stop the burn if you aren't being damaged by the enemies.\n\nWandering Enemy:\nI do not enjoy this event, but a few tweaks would make it much better.\n\n* Reduce the gold granted by 50%. The enemy is worth a total of ~10k gold, which snowballs the game way too much.\n* Disable the event if a team has lost its inhibitor turret, the event becomes an uncontested 10k for either team depending on where it spawns. If its outside the losing team's base, free 10k gold to the winning team, if its inside the losing teams base, free 10k gold to the losing team. Both of these situations are dumb.\n* Make the enemy immune to Syndra's W, she can pick up it up repeatedly to bring it into her base.\n\nPush the Cart:\nThis event has the potential to be good, but often times feels terrible.\n\n* Disable the event if a team has lost its inhibitor tower. Being on offense and having to push the cart past inhibitor is nigh impossible with how much of a choke point bases are, and how close the entrance of bases are to the fountain. Teams are able to run back and forth between their Nexus Turrets and Fountain to contest the event almost indefinitely. \n* If the cart is within range of a tower with one member of the pushing team on the cart, and the tower is destroyed, it should be counted as a win.\n\n___\n\n**Rewards**\n\nGuardian Angel:\nNot a huge fan of this reward, it sucks to have to kill the enemies twice or avoid them altogether, and it also sucks to have it expire while in combat with champions. \n\n* Lower the duration to 60 seconds.\n* Pause the timer while in combat with enemy champions.\n\nBF Shields:\nI hate this reward so much, having it last indefinitely makes it too difficult to play around without having significant poke. Additionally it is easily wasted if you want to clear your jungle camps.\n\n* Reduce the shield amount by 50%\n* Make the shields regenerate while out of combat.\n* Lasts for 90 seconds rather than until it is broken.\n\nBlessing of Blitzcrank:\nStupid reward, I hate it whether its on my team or the enemy's.\n\n* Just remove it, too unreliable, and often times benefits the enemy team if they have a strong engage tank.\n* Replace it with the Blessing of Kha'Zix (stealth &amp; movement speed upon entering brush)\n\nCatapult of Champions:\nSolid reward, but slightly too strong.\n\n* Reduce the range to the center of the map.\n\nPoro King:\nPretty worthless unless the enemy team is too dumb to kill it.\n\n* Slightly increase the damage to towers.\n\nBattle Sled\nMy friends and I have nicknamed this the int-mobile, as it often results in the people in it dying.\n\n* Remove the knock back on the players inside of it\n\nMega Ocean Drake\nMore often than not, I forget that I even got a reward from this event.\n\n* Add +100% Base Health &amp; Mana Regeneration while in combat.\n\nMega Cloud Drake\nSolid reward, no complaints here.\n\n* No changes \n\nStatic Shock\nGood reward, the waveclear is perfect, but the damage it deals to champions is a bit too overbearing.\n\n* Reduce damage dealt to champions.\n\n___\n\n**Map Specific Items**\n\n* {{item:4401}}  \n * Far too strong with how good the Spectral Cowl items already are.\n * Increase its cost or decrease its stats. \n * Add a counter part armor item.\n\n\n* {{item:4402}} \n * The regen from this item is game breakingly overpowered.\n * Health regeneration: ~~8%~~ --> 5%\n\n\n* {{item:3005}} \n * Suffers from awkward build path.\n * Replace pickaxe with Jaurim's Fist.\n * ~~25 AD 30 Armor 30 MR~~ -> 300 Health 30 Armor 30 MR\n * ~~In combat .5% - 2% HP to AD conversion~~ -> 1%  HP to AD conversion out of combat, increased up to 3% while in combat.\n * Total cost ~~2900~~ -> 3100\n\n\n* {{item:4302}} \n * Way too strong, especially when both bot laners take it.\n * Reduce how often it gains stacks, increase the added delay on gain on stacks when killing minions without a stack.\n\n\n* {{item:3128}} \n * Not as strong as I suspected.\n * Lower the cooldown to 60 seconds.\n\n\n* {{item:4001}} \n * Walls are too small on this map to make these effective.\n\n\n* {{item:4004}} / {{item:4003}} \n * These items are fine, aside from their interaction with Camille / Skarner ultimates.\n\n\n* {{item:3161}} \n * Seems to be in a good state, but I'd like it to be melee only with an increase radius activation.\n\n\n* {{item:3172}} \n * No issues with this.\n\n\n* {{item:4403}} \n * Complete noob trap of an item.\n * Likely impossible to be a balanced item.\n * If anything, decrease the stats &amp; cost.\n\n\n* {{item:3131}} \n * Incredibly powerful while the active is used, but unnoticeable otherwise.\n * Very tough to balance.\n * Make critical strike damage reduced but scale with lethality and reduce its cooldown? \n\n\n* {{item:3029}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3008}} {{item:3007}} \n * All of these need to stack a lot faster.\n\n___\n\n**Terrain/Jungle/Champions/General/Misc**\n\n* While there are a lot of walls, they laughably small, making Kayn, Talon and Ghostwalkers pretty useless.\n* Base entrances are far too narrow of choke points and the bases themselves are too small. This makes minion waves take up the entire base at times and completely unnavigable.\n* The jungle towers feel unnecessary.\n* The interaction between the large wolf explosion and other jungle camps should be removed.\n* Jungle camps are too slow to respawn at the beginning of the game / too quick of a clear.\n* Jungle items need to grant increased gold &amp; exp from kill camps and reduce gold from killing minions.\n* Rift Herald is too easy to take for how powerful it is (giving both baron minion buff and the actual rift herald), it also lasts for too long.\n* Support items should cost a bit more to offset the increased gold gain / minion gold share.\n* Kindred getting double stacks on killing marked champions is too powerful, this buff belongs on ARAM, not Nexus Blitz. If anything she should get double stacks from killing buff monsters rather than killing marked targets.\n* Some of the bushes on the map will not be revealed by wards if the ward is placed on the edge but still inside the bush.","replies":[{"poster":"michaelchan","date":"2019-01-07T17:32:38.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Mortdog","date":"2019-01-07T20:26:41.909+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this!

After about 100 Blitz games across various accounts, I would add a few more changes. I'm interested to hear your feedback on these:\n\n1) **Make the mid-lane wall thicker, reduce the size of its click box, or both.** This part of the map is exceedingly frustrating to navigate because you can click what appears to be brush but is actually the edge of the wall. As a result, your champ paths its movement to the other side of the wall; most of the time this means your champ turns and runs is the *complete opposite direction* of your cursor. It's like trying to move close to the wall inside Dragon pit....for an entire lane phase.\n\nThe same issue exists in bot lane, but instead of reverse-pathing, your clicks are just non-responsive if they're inside the wall.\n\n2) **Bardle Royale:** This event is far too capable of deciding winners and losers based on spawn area. I also think that minions/monsters and turrets should go into stasis upon event start for the reasons listed in OP but also because they're too obnoxious and impactful without any real way to de-aggro them with range.\n\n3) **Itemization:** I think they need to bite the bullet and restrict access to certain items based on class. There are just too many abuse cases with combinations of AD, bruiser, and tank items. \n\n**AP:** I'm a mage main, and I think AP damage is just way too high at baseline but without any real answers to fighters or drain tanks. To solve this I would replace Void Staff and Deathcap with a well-rounded anti-tank item (eg AP, Mana, CDR, Dot effect, and stacking % pen) and a well-rounded burst item (AP, CDR, flat pen, spell vamp). There's also a very distinct lack of healing available to APs, and this disadvantage becomes extremely obvious in events that force fights and/or have a death limit \n\n**Armor:** Multiple MR, lethality, and hybrid AD/resist items were added, but there's a conspicuous lack of effective anti-AD items. The SR armor items are already pretty ineffective on SR, but with the amount of armor pen in Nexus they feel like noob traps.\n\n**MR:** Items are great if you're anything other than a mage. Overall, I think MR itemization is far too effective against AP assassins and not effective enough against artillery mage attrition. This is a particularly frustrating item gap for immobile mages without artillery range. Example: Ziggs can spam Q every 2-3 seconds, and landing *one Q* puts you in kill range of his ult. The item system provides no answer to this.\n\n**AD:** Great itemization. Everything I could ever want, including all sorts of poaching options to cover any conceivable weakness of every AD subclass! Only exception is the lack of AD/mana regen starting item, and I think Nexus matchups are varied enough to justify its addition. \n\n4) **Events:** I generally like these, but I also think each team should get to ban one event or reward in an All For One-style ban phase. The issue here is that certain champs or teams are too prone to auto-losing events on an RNG basis. Like, a team full of assassins might want to ban Cart or Scuttle; a team of ADCs and supports might want to ban Prize Fight or URF; a team of mages might want to ban Bardle Royale.\n\nI also think that it's kind of a problem that events that force team fights don't refund (or reset) health, mana, and cooldowns. In the case of Bardle Royale, for example, the event forces a fight and has a 1-death limit without resetting hp/mana or removing NPCs. The result is a gargantuan advantage for tanks and ADs who can easily heal up as the circle shrinks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"In Borke Veritas","date":"2019-01-08T16:13:52.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two questions.\nWhat do you think of the final event with a moving nexus?

Paranoia is the worst true just feels like a random coinflip\n\n- Main issue with the event is that it is NOT FKING FUN.... idk what else to say. It is just not fun. \nThis mode is all about **camping **or waiting till everything shrins then AoE-ing\n\n- Imagine all the posibilities you can do Riot. It feels like you lack imagination in general with this modes. Just go crazy dont be afraid\n\n- Often times this MODE JUST FORCES A WINNING TEAM TO TOWERDIVE. And towers tend to turtle bad players it just pisses me off\n\n\n** King of the hill **\n- True this thing has lower spawn rate\n- A decent capture the mode quest but nothing amazing tbh\n\n- Capturing one circle can be rather boring. Make it so that people have to capture 2 circles for points\n- Perhaps multiple layers of circle (Middle one captures slightly faster, boosts tank viability)\n\n\n** Urf deathmatch **\nYeah I agree with your suggestions. Movement before spawning, also there are probably better alternatives to burning\n- DO NOT START SHRINKING THIS MODE THO. Burning can even be fine but, a player who is stronger should have an option to show it. \n- So rather then just both players running in which the one running is weaker but it doesnt matter since they are both burning and he ll turn once both players ll have a 200 hp For a not so interesting to watch coinflip\n\n\n- In both Prize fights and Urf Deathmatch\n- **Put something in a middle (Like a dummy)**\n\nDummy grants Stat Increase if you hit it and heals you the more damage / strikes you make\nEvery attack against a dummy pushes it (Sort of like graves auto). Dont feel like explaining this one with wall of text just trust me\n\n\nSo a dummy in the Urf/Prize fight center\nHitting it grants 1 armor, 1 mr, 10 hp, 1.3AP, 1 AD, 4 gold per hit\n\n\nSo you can keep hitting it to reduce the burn as it gives HP. and also to empover yourself\n\n\n** Wandering enemy **\nMy favorite event\n\nBut there are some issues\n\nFirst Teemo and Veigar ** arent the best chase options **. I understand that they are \"iconic\" eventho RIOT is forcing so hard to make veigar a League mascot \nSecond try to make spawning more fair, but this a general tip I know you people ll get better with so I feel kinda pointless suggesting it\n\n\n**Third and this is general League issue which applies to summoner rift**\n\n* SMITE COINFLIPS ARENT FUN, NOOOOOOOOO THEY ARE NOTTTTTTTTTTTTT\n* This game mode has many coinflips on map central positions\n\nRedbuff coinflip, Blue buff coinflip, Scuttle coinflip, herald coinflip, Wandering enemy coinflip\nA single unskilled buttom press (smite) shouldnt create such a snowball (Granted in case of redbuff and blue buff its small and tolerable)\n\nThis is an issue on summoner rift with Baron/Dragons to\n\n\nBuff steals arent fun to do / watch / have it happen to you \nI am saying this as a syndra main (Level 1 cheese) and with general 30 000 games of experience since season1. \n\n** Buff steals and in general how coinflipy they are are cancerous for league and an Issue Since inception **\n\n** I already posted a fixes to it.**\n\n* ** One is if jungler is damaging a Big objective for 2 seconds his smite damage is increased **\n* ** Second one is a team which does more damage to Big objective gets it unless they are all Dead **\n\nBut at that point Baron reward does need to go down which is good\n\n\n** Second suggestion is probably better. Since it actually creates teamfights not just random FAKE hype baron steal attempts **\nNot to mention that removing Baron coinflipness would allow us to have weaker baron buff. Baron buff is cancer strong atm\n \n** Its also better because even with stronger smite I still wouldnt trust my jungler, nor should junglers have such pressure on them **\n\n\n\n** Push the cart **\nSo many issues \n\n* It moves to slow, it could even grant a bit more gold (5 more per sec)\n* Tower Choke point in which no team can do anything and cart is just standing there (It zooms at the end of it doesnt it? well it still feels bad)\n* Destroying 200 HP tower is quite pointless (Old rift Herald esque issues)\n* The idea is just badly excecuted and can be improved \n\nFk often times I just ignore this mission and play the map out due to how non rewarding it is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** ITEMIZATION **\n{{item:3172}}  - Noob bait dont let anyone tell you otherwise. Mainly the tenacity being ASS issue, \n{{item:3005}} - STOP MAKING ITEMS/RUNES WHICH REQUIRE HEALTH TO BE GOOD BUT DONT GIVE ANY HEALTH. NOOB BAIT UNLESS YOU ARE SION\n{{item:4403}} - Giga noob bait. Even noobs know this is noob bait\n{{item:4004}} - Quite well balanced infact lethality items in generaly are. I want it at Rift ;P Shouldnt build out of stopwatch. Skilled active items are fine but stopwatch feels like the only 1 we see because league doesnt have many so it pisses people off hard since its a CLOCKBLOCK item\n{{item:3131}} - Quite well balanced\n{{item:4401}} - This was noob bait in season 1-2 and still is\n{{item:3128}} - The only AP item we got. Kinda dissapointed with that grasp is fine tho. Would like to see skillshot version of this on rift (Does less dmg if target is CCed)\n{{item:4001}} - Love it, well balanced. ADD it to rift\n{{item:4402}} - Love it well balanced. Would reccomend it on Irelia over trinity even\n\nGive us more items\n\n\n\n** As far as the rewards go **\n\nShield reward is to good (To high shield )\nStattick shiv reward is to good (To high damage, doesnt need to waveclear)\n\n\nI agree on Intmobile self stun being bad\nAlso make intmobile deal 300 damage to towers (catapult kinda outclasses it)\n\nAlso I SHOULDNT HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER INTMOBILE to spawn just because someone is already driving it\n (Make it spawn every 6 sec, quite sure it was like that for some time tho then you people changed it)\n\n\n\n\nMain things I dont like about the mode\n\nTower turtling of bad players\n\n- tower proximity and damage (The damage issue applies to summoner rift to)\n- Smite coinflip win cons (Stated how I would change it above\n- Battleroyale paranoia/pushing the cart\n- Juggernauts are to weak. infact they seem helpless and cant reach anything. Create a dash item\n- Sometimes Objectives spawn in an unfair way (sure this is something Riot ll change without anyone suggesting it tho)\n- Some rewards are to strong. Weakest one is ocean drake reward btw\n\nDash item\nStats\n\nHp, armor, mr\n400,50,40 \n\nYour champion can dash 600 range. Your champion cannot dash/blink 4 seconds afterwards or prior to the activation\n\nBuff Rightous glory ms stuff by 40%","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2019-01-08T12:16:18.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with your opinion on smite.

It used to literally be frame perfect. If you had zero ping and pressed smite, it would smite **_on that frame._** If a monster was low enough hp to be executed, it would literally just vanish from existence that frame (I don't think monsters had death animations yet?). There is absolutely a delay now.\n\nI don't have video software set up at the moment, but I managed to get a screenshot in practice tool. So assuming screenshots work properly (capture a single frame as it appears in game): \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gNTBqTt.png/img\n\nYou can see the smite animation. You can see smite is on cooldown. But the dummy's health bar (top left corner) is still showing full hp. The damage has not been dealt yet. (Although for some reason the DPS has registered the damage - perhaps because the spell is locked in and will hit no matter what, assuming the target doesn't die before it registers).\n\nHere's 2 more (health bar is above the monster):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/emT5s6j.png/img\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aPWUjZV.png/img\n\nAnd here's one more (health bar is on the top left too this time): \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YvbhuAv.png/img\n\nIf you have video software that can capture every frame, and you want to go through it frame by frame and prove me wrong, go ahead. There is a (small) delay before smite deals its damage.
