Looks like you are Bronze at the moment according to opgg. You won't get that skin if you are not at least Gold5 at the end of the Season.\n\nHowever, let's say you reach Gold: once it's added in your account (most likely end of November), you can contact Player Support and say you don't want it, they may be able to help you.","replies":[{"poster":"xXxAltaïrrxXx","date":"2016-10-05T19:06:40.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said on my main.
