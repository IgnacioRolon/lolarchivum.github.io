Please don't just tell me to get a PC. Believe me, I would if I could- playing league on a trackpad does a number on your wrist.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm having is that when I launch LoL, the second lil icon pops up and starts jumping for a bit, but when it stops, nothing shows up. Mousing over tells me that it's just not responding. I've tried the whole forced repatch thing with no success, and half the files it asked to delete weren't even there in the first place.\r\n\r\nI also don't think this has too much to do with the new patch, since the game worked just fine right after the last update. It's only since a few days ago it wouldn't launch.\r\nI'll reinstall if I have to, but my computer is pretty old and extremely messy, in a sense. If at all possible I'd rather avoid it.\r\nI hope someone here can help me. Surprisingly enough league really helps me relax every day, it'd suck to have lost it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-22T22:37:55.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play what you want friend, nobody here is going to judge you for that.  :D  Based on your details here, it sounds to me like a connection issue might be blocking your patcher from reaching us, so nothing is loading.  My suggestion would be to start with each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure it's configured.  Give it a go and let me know if you run into any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"dirtyhanlu","date":"2017-04-23T02:45:48.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding so quickly! I tried as many of the troubleshooting options I could to no avail, so I just went ahead and reinstalled the game. It's taking its time setting up but it's working! Thanks for the help ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
