Fixing this issue as effectively as possible is a sizable priority for me at the moment. \r\n\r\n When I first started playing, the game's performance was pretty average. My ping stayed around 32, and my framerate seldom dropped below 15 even in the most demanding team fights. This was when I was much further away from our router. \r\nFast forward to about March and I've changed rooms. I'm now across the hall from our router. And yet, since then, everything's gotten significantly worse. \r\nMy ping hardly goes below 50, and spikes around 900-11,000ms. My framerate plummets to 3fps in some instances. The game can run decently one game and spend the next giving me the \"attempting to reconnect\". \r\nThis is pretty infuriating. I love this game and I look forward to rising in rank with my friends over the next few seasons, but unfortunately it's a bit impossible when I can't even leave the fountain. \r\n\r\nI should also point out, though I don't think it's the issue, I play on a 2010 MacBook Pro (yes, I play on a trackpad. It's not as bad as everyone seems to think). It's a wonderful machine and its had no trouble until recently running this damn game. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime I'll try reinstalling league, but I'm not sure how much good it'll do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-27T01:41:02.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes those ping spikes getting over 10,000 is preeeeetty bad. The only time I've heard of it hitting those kinds of levels is when you've either lost your connection completely or if you're having some pretty significant packet loss problems. Check out this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to check for packet loss first. Try to grab a screenshot if you can and post it here so I can see the results as well.","replies":[{"poster":"dirtyhanlu","date":"2017-06-27T02:28:32.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if there's a better way to post this, but here: http://imgur.com/a/HziWM\nIt's from my game a few hours ago, when I spent all but the first two minutes attempting to reconnect.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-27T02:40:59.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh whelp, yea 80% packet loss is DEFINITELY no good.
