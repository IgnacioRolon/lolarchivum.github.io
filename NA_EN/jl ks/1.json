So I message her to try to help her out. Right off the bat she seemed pretty knowledgeable about what champions were meta and which weren't asking questions like, Should I play diana I heard she is op, \"Is shaco a good jg\"? and \"How do you build shaco?\" I told her that i would prefer to build shaco AD in jg. And she preceded to tell me that probuilds said to build AP shaco. I checked and she was right, Im thinking to myself... ok she knows about Probuilds... do new players know about probuilds...mmhh.. anyways after a few days of talking on twitch and me giving her advice. She asks me to add her on league, I said ok and we played an intermediate bot game together, and she had more cs and kills then me when the game was over... im like mmhh... ok. So after that bot game I checked her match history and She was lvl 6 and Her match hsitory STARTED with her playing against intermediate bots(Someone who isnt new would skip to intermediate bots because they would be bored af playing intro and beginner bots, and intermediate bot tend to be a bit hard for a player who just started playing the game) . Not intro or beginner... intermediate. I hit her up and chat and she asked me how I think she did. i told her I don't think she is new, and she replied by saying she watched alot of videos before playing the game and that she swears she was new. Im like ok. This bot game happened last week 12/8/19. Today is 12/12/19 and she hit me up to play again and im like oh that's the \"new girl\" and I said ok. I checked her bot match history and she was 10 kills and up in every single one of her games, and this game she invited me to play was her first ever game outside of playing against bots apparently( She invited me to Norms draft not blind pick, autoing norm draft is second nature to smurfs or people who have been playing for awhile because we know how annoying blind pick champ select can be), so thats another mmhh moment I had when I saw she invited me to draft and not blind. So we get into the game and Im akali vs Garen and im getting slayed in lane the entire time(g2 support main) I landed all my abilities against this garen, all he does is do a little spin and ults me and I go from 100 to zero...ok balanced.. but anyways, she is playing tali jg. I look in jungle and see this 'New Girl\" kiting camps like a pro, Every single gank she made she got a kill, she ends the game 16 kills 5 deaths got more gold then me and the rest of the team ect. Anyways we lost the game. I hit her up after the game and asked her why she is preteneding to be new, and she continued to try to make me believe she was brand new to the game. I Asked her when she learned how to kite and she said she watched a video on how to kite ect. She just soo good because she watched videos ect. She ended up getting mad at me for not believing her bullshit and unfriended me from league, but I still wonder why a smurf would want to make a new acc and pretend to be new. Smfh no life. This girl is level 10 and Im a g2 support main and she plays better than me... But she is new... ya ok.","replies":[{"poster":"MarijaCarry","date":"2019-12-21T15:43:53.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Akali player I need to tell you that you did something wrong that game, Garen can't get close to you, your kit directly counters all of his abilities, also I doubt she is girl.

Way back when before Facebook was a thing, I used to tell people online I was a girl so I'd get special treatment. 95% of men online are thirsty simps.

I actually don't even care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revech","date":"2019-12-14T12:45:38.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably for content","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sea Slug Menace","date":"2019-12-14T10:46:03.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any previous moba experience?  \n\nI played heroes of the storm to try it cause my friend liked it, and had been playing it for a while,  first 4 games in a row i got MVP, and i hadn't even watched a video on the game, the other 1/5 game MVP was to my friend who was ranked silver in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XAltinaOrionX","date":"2019-12-14T21:12:30.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well I've know league since you kids were still in high school or elementary school doesn't matter my age tho lol.\n\nFor the last 22 yrs I've been an solo gamer. i remember being a halo god back in my younger days XD.\n\nThe point is people can easily tell if a player is smurfing. I can instantly tell based on CS and positioning. I was Gold in 2014 before they screw everything over, from thunderlords ,free runes, warding masteries etc.","replies":[]}]}
