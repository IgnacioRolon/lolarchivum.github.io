AI Mode| Progression Bots","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":36,"down_votes":6,"body":"**Imagine Being Hard Stuck Against Bots**\nIntroducing a new CO- OP VS.AI mode where  players go into a game 1v1 VS each and every bot champion in the game. (_But really, its more like Player vs AI_)\nThis mode starts out with every bot at level 1 difficulty, after defeating that champion the next time you face that same champion, their difficulty will be level 2. So to be clear, you go in game fighting every champion 1v1 (2v2 for supports) at level 1, then after you have proven yourself against every level 1 champion you fight every champion in the game at level 2, After you have defeated every level 2 champion in the game you will progress to level 3 and so on. \n\nYou can exit this game mode when ever you like and it will save your progression where ever you left off at. The next level champion will be slightly better in different ways whether that be rune choice, positioning, diving turret success rate, csing, items built based on match up ect, for example, against level 1 bots you have a 95 percent chance of winning as opposed to a level 100-110 bot you have a 5 -1 percent chance of winning. It would be cool to also add a feature that shows other players what bot level you have reached on the _**Profile Page**_. \nWhen ever a new champions gets introduced into the game you have the option to start level 1 against that champion, other wise It will be at w.e level you have reached up to that point.\n\nThis game mode is especially good for new players who do not have a clue what champions do, So they will for sure get exposed to every champion in the game and what they do by playing their way through this game mode.\n\n**MAP**\nFor champions like Kindred, Bard, Zoe, Taliyah, Talon and Skarner, I imagine RIOT would address the map accordingly to maybe add monsters or objectives for kindreds hunt, and skarners crystal spawns. Nothing too big but I would like to see a **single lane**, **player vs AI** map that has a mini river and jungle, a map that also allows players to hop over walls, fight for objectives, and have some form of out play potential that the players and the AI can both use as to their advantage..\n\n**_*Features*_**\nBot level 1 - 110\n1-10 = IRON\n10-20 = BRONZE\n20-30 = Silver\n30-40 =Gold\n40-50 = Platinum\n50-60 = Diamond\n60-70 = Master\n70-80 = Grand Master\n80-90 = Challenger \n90-100 = Pro\n100-110= Bot Gods/Lords (_comment below what this level title should be called_)\n\n***Single Player Game Mode**\n\n***Bot level Is displayed in game above the bots health bar  For example \"Lucian Bot L60\"**\n\n***Game mode keeps track of your progress and you will begin where you left off**\n\n***Progression bot games work in stages, after killing a bot you move on to the next bot stage, you dont exit the game.**\n\n***Bot 1v1 Border** added to **SUMMONER ICON &amp; BORDER SELECTOR** section.\n\n***Bot mastery level in Profile Section\n**\n**\n*Undeated: # Win Streak Displayed In Profile Section (_hover over Bot mastery icon to see highest win streak_)**\n\n***Current number of champions in the game and how many champions there are left to defeat to make it to the next level is displayed before each match.**\n\n***After reaching a certain level you have the option to play against any level below the level you have reached.**\n\n***Rank doesn't reset at the beginning of the season, Like Your normal level, You keep your bot rank for ever  **\n\n***Higher level bots offer slightly more XP per bot champion defeated**\n\n**Supports**\nFor players that play supports, or for when players are up against a support champion, the lane becomes 2v2, The player will be accompanied by a random AI support, and the AI support you are up against will be accompanied by a random champion out side of the support role.\n\n**For example: **\nYou are level 43 playing **Yasuo** and the bot you are up against in this stage is **Yuumi**.\n**Yasuo vs Yuumi** is pretty unfair.\nBecause yuumi is a support champion that relies heavily on there being a champion to support, So in this case player vs AI becomes 2v2.\n\n**Yasuo** and **Janna Bot L43**  vs ** Yuumi Bot L43** and **Sett Bot L43**\n\n\n****\n**XP Explained**\nI imagine 1v1's against bots being quick and easy at early levels, so earning xp would also be pretty quick as a result, this could be good for players who are smurfing and trying to quickly get their account up to level 30. Their are currently 148 champions in league of legends, if the base xp for level 1 bots is 50xp, You earn 7,400xp after defeating every level 1 bot which would put you at lvl 14 in the game. It takes 40,080xp to make it to level 30.\n\n[Click here to view summoner experiance](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_(summoner)) | Scroll down to where it says **Experience Required**, that section will show you how much xp is required for you to level up.\n\n**XP scaling examples: 148 Champions**\nlevel 1: 50xp Per defeat (7,400xp)\nlevel 2: 55xp Per defeat (8,140xp)\nlevel 3: 60xp Per defeat (8,880xp)\nlevel 4: 65xp Per defeat (9,620xp)\nlevel 5: 70xp Per defeat (10,360xp)\n\nAfter defeating every champion levels 1-5 which amounts to 740 player vs AI stages, you will have earned 44,400xp and you will be past level 30 which requires 40,080xp to obtain.\n\n_After defeating the same level bot X number of times xp earned decreases._\n\n \n**Rewards**\nXP gained scales based on bot level defeated\nBlue Essence\nEmotes\nSummoner Icons\nBorders Based on AI Level Acquired \nChampion Shards\nTokens\nChests\n\n\n\n**One comment suggested Levels 100-110 ranked name should OPEN AI**, That actually would be pretty cool for bots to be able to learn how to improve on there own. Below is a youtube video by OPEN AI. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4O8pojMF0w\n\n> For those of you who want to know the number of consecutive wins you need to reach the peak of level 110 it is 16,280. That is the number of current champions which is 148 times the number of levels which is 110. \n148 x 110 = 16,280.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusef","date":"2020-01-19T06:05:18.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Amazing idea but a couple of problems. There are 155ish champs and some are stronger than others a level 6 corki might be weaker than a lvl 5 fizz. Maybe if there placements kinda of and you were put into a higher level to begin with but starting at lvl 1 would be extremely tedious for people who are still new to the game but ranked level yet. I believe the best way to improve and learn matchups is to play more games. The experience matters more. Also bots don't simulate real people or other players. A bot probably won't flash q ignite for a kill.  Doesn't matter if you can beat a lvl 70 orn bot with yasou if you get ganekd by 2/0/0 jhin. In short, this mode wouldn't simulate everything and norms can complete the same job. I think that mini practice modes should be created like kiting and a cs practice mode. This makes more sense because let's say I am trying to practice csing with a character with a slower attack speed than I usually play like mundo or something (idk), then I don't go 0/6 cs in my first game as him and hopefully at least 3/6 cs.","replies":[{"poster":"JL KS","date":"2020-01-19T15:47:52.648+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not understanding how new players would find playing against lvl1 bots too tedious, Me personally I would have loved to be able to go through a game mode like this when I first started out, but ok.... moving right along.

Now if im misunderstanding what you are saying im sorry, If you are telling me that higher bot levels should include a random champion ganking at random times in the 1v1, that actually sounds pretty dope.

For people who don't want to play pvp but do want a challenge, this mode gives them that, intermediate 5v5 bots don't quite do it for me and that's how my idea surfaced. \n\nAlso if you view my profile you will see that I made a board post going over new training modes (which include csing under turret, skill shot dodging ect.)

The tiny population of co-op players has occasionally asked for more challenging bots for many years, but Riot can't even manage to add new bots (remember e.g. Yasuo and Aurelion Sol bots?) or display the correct summoner spells on the load screen (Cleanse + Smite). It isn't happening, even if you get a suspiciously large amount of votes in a short amount of time.\n\nThomas Edison developed the light bulb because it would be widely used.
