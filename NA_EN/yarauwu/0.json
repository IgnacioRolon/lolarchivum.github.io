Being a giant mecha-like suit composed entirely of biomass would be such a drain of energy that it wouldn't make sense to be on a host anyway.\n\nYou might say I'm giving too much credit to the designers, but you've gotta remember these are people who are character designers for a living. \n\nI'd be absolutely shocked if they didn't take direct inspiration from _Guyver: The Bio-boosted Armor_, but where a bulkier frame makes sense on something that was specifically designed as armor and supplies _additional_ energy to its wearer in _Guyver_, the opposite is true for their idea of a parasite on Kai'sa.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2019-06-09T15:34:28.820+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Perhaps it went off of a subconcious image Kai'Sa herself had, or has just taken care to make sure she matures properly?

And additionally reads like like Kayn (who's theme they were trying to avoid) if they work together. If u WANT 2 sell the fact that she wears a void skin and has normal human skin, then have her show more human skin all around, mostly at her extremities, such as her forearms and lower legs/feet, bc those can be replaced by Void growth, as the game progresses have the suit cover more of her up like and shift as needed for abilities like Galaxy Slayer Zed.\n\n Look i commend u for your valiant effort to validate Kai'sas poor design, but, its doesn't hold up. I will say how ever that ur point for the \"chest lumps\" (lol) does make sense to a certain degree. However u fail to consider the fact that the Voidling would have no idea what a prime human looks like...sure u COULD argue that it was in her head, but then why does her design sell how Hot she is rather than how Athletic she is?
