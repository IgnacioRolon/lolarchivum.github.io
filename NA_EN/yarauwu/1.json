Im gonna take a break because that is the most frustrated i have been on this account ever. \n\nBut for fucks sake if their jungler is camping the living fuck out of top making the lane a fucking 2v1 then do the dragon please or fucking abuse mid and bot lane you dont even need to get a kill just bully them. Or take their junglers farm please dont let me get camped to the point of not being able to farm but not punish their jungler from being away from everything actually relevant. You dont even need to be good at jungle because if their jungler is always in one lane your free to abuse and farm the bottom half of the map.\n\nIts so fucking frustrating i actually want to puke because its a shitty tactic that is easily exploited and only works if the other jungler refuses to use fucking logic. Im way more mad then i should be but that last match was fucking idiotically frustrating and pointlessly lost.

Nerfing jungle camp exp means sapping lane exp is the superior option, so might as well camp that lane as well.\n\nIf you gank too much you can actually fall behind in levels. It's a double edged sword because you can be several kills ahead but if your laner makes nothing of those leads down the line the enemy jungler starts being able to invade you by outleveling you and the other lanes that are doing well easily shut you down.\n\nIn fact, one of my pet peeves as a jungler is when I'm like 5/1 by minute 6 and my teammates keep pushing needless fights when I need to get around to clearing my camps, because team fights are always a gamble and even if we win it, if I die during that teamfight I'm falling further and further behind in xp if the enemy jungler is being smart and taking advantage to counterjungle.\n\nTake your ganks when they come and let the jungler at least clear most of his camps before you choose to get caught out 4v5.\n\nI don't think laners understand how reliant on staying up to date with the camps a jungler is for not becoming lower level than even the bot lane.\n\nI used to main mid lane and totally get the hate for afk farm junglers, but laners do this crap as well where I'm contesting a crab, or my jungle gets invaded, or I'm warding off the enemy jungler from collapsing on my bot lane via tri bush and all my bot lane does is stay farming minions while their team rotates onto me. So I understand when junglers choose to just farm when it's obvious all of the lanes either always push to turret, making them ungankable, or they play completely passive and don't force engagements when you're arriving, so you go in and get killed first because they took too long staring before they engage with you.\n\nAFK farm laners exist as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-06-16T07:37:21.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, if you FARM you fall behind in levels, if you GANK you put both laners (top and enemy top) behind in levels as you get ahead.\nGanking is the superior farming strat now because if you \"accidentally\" kill the entire minoin line with your q e on vi *cough, you get 2 full camps worth of XP.","replies":[{"poster":"Crescent Dusk","date":"2019-06-16T16:32:55.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eonslegacy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5ubNceOG,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2019-06-16T07:37:21.438+0000)\n>\n> No, if you FARM you fall behind in levels, if you GANK you put both laners (top and enemy top) behind in levels as you get ahead.\n> Ganking is the superior farming strat now because if you \"accidentally\" kill the entire minoin line with your q e on vi *cough, you get 2 full camps worth of XP.\n\nThere is no guarantee of a kill in a gank. If I put my top laner behind in xp that's actually worse since most meta top laners scale far better than any meta junglers. Jax, Irelia, Riven, Tryndamere, Fiora, hell even a Poppy who's ahead serves as a better tank than my Volibear or any other jungler champ for that matter, and who end up doing more damage by far.\n\nMy job as jg is to beat up my enemy jungler by contesting river or invading them to remove pressure from the map and get just enough ganks to get my lanes ahead without falling out of relevance myself.\n\nI also like to stay caught up in farm because there will be games where all your solo laners can't win lane on their own, so you will be forced to babysit some lanes so much and they won't even do anything with it that you might as well not let your enemy jg invade your jg for free to get massively ahead in levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-06-17T08:20:40.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo. jax cant jg?

Usually jg champs are niche picks with good ganking toolkits that can supplement a role like tank or assassin, but couldn't cut it in actual lanes. Camille, Wukong, Hecarim, all could be top laners but they get trounced in top lane by the meta top laners, so they're taken jungle where they are less likely to get stat checked since jg spend less time fighting each other than laners do. Khazix couldn't hope to lane mid at all against another assassin.\n\nA top laner doesn't have to waste an item slot on smite enhancements. A jax top is substantially better than a jax jg.

This is amplified by the fact that even though 3/10 times a gank could work, if it doesn't the other 7/10 because of what I said above, you get flamed as-if you had any control over the lvl 9 irelia 2 shotting the lvl 7 jg.\n\nSo then you try to focus mid/bot, but your bot lane is also getting smashed and has 30%hp while the enemy has full hp, so you can't help there either which leaves mid. A very hard lane to gank most of the time and rarely successful unless they have no sums.\n\nThat is the current state of JG right now. Helping someone behind in lane is a very precarious decision that more times than not leads to a grey screen for the JG and the enemy getting a double-kill, especially if there is a counter gank.\n\nHaving said all that, I usually DO still try to help if the stomping isn't too bad. However, if it doesn't go well I won't be back the rest of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2019-06-17T02:14:12.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here’s the thing, a lane being camped and a lane being killed are two separate things.\n\nThe scenario is enemy jungler is camping top but the top laner is playing smart and not dying to ganks but he also can’t get a lead because it’s essentially a 2v1 lane.

I guess you might have noticed that she hasn't bought any items since her quadrakill, so maybe you think you can take her since she's got a lot of gold doing nothing for her and you're the same level. .. Turns out, no... Fortunate for you, she doesn't clear your ward. .. Unfortunately, she's backing right by it to cash in on a full Trinity Force. \n> \n> She returns to bottom lane for a kill, then Talon thinks he can 1v3 for some reason, .. +2 more for Vi. At this point, towers don't mean much to her (she is a diver after all) but Trist does manage to get a shutdown on her. \n> \n> Unfortunately for you, Irelia is now able to win trades with you. Then Evelynn comes in to clean up. You were almost respawned, so I guess that doesn't REALLY absolve her of the \"unanswered\" charge. \n> \n> 14:00, and Gank #4 top. .. Your control ward IS still in the river bush. You even have vision of Vi with it, but you still think you should start trading with Irelia. You do have Flash up, maybe you're safe. .. Hm, .. you aren't even trying to retreat. .. Maybe you figure you just all in and trade 1 for 1, ... You do almost get Irelia, .. buuut, .. no,.. she Flashes out and Vi cleans up. \n> \n> If you weren't already tilted, which that play screams \"TILTED\" .. You are sure to be after this point, .. so I'm going to stop with the play-by-play at this point. \n> \n> Speaking of tilted, .. you might be seething with me at this point. I hope you're not, honestly. .. because there is a lesson to be learned here. It's pretty healthy to watch your gameplay videos and learn from them. It's also healthy to take constructive criticism. (I'll apologize now, because I'll admit, I have been a tad snarky, and it's not the best way to GIVE constructive criticism) So here it is. \n> \n> In this game, I'm not watching your others (unless you want me to) you showed a tendency to be overly aggressive when you have no vision or safe means of escape, which is practically ringing the dinner bells for junglers. \n> \n> Now, I get it, Morde is a monster, and that early showing of power makes you think he can snowball right away. He is also new, so it isn't easy to know when he falls off, and how hard. Also, your teammates made some major mistakes, and Vi happened to be there to capitalize on them. THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. In fact, if she wasn't so fed, it looked like you might be the one to carry your team, which is all the more reason for you to be more cautious. \n> \n> Hope this wasn't totally infuriating, and you find it at least somewhat helpful. \n> \n> Peace\n\nI mean this is gold. I dont think top laners ever rly play around jg matchup or pathing knowledge. But in OPs defense if the jgs skill levels were closer eve couldve done something with the pressure vi exerted top. But the eve was a 40% silver in a gold game, with no eve games played, and only positive winrate being on lulu... \n\nIts not effective at all to focus on how bad ur teammates are, but sometimes in solo q the matchmaking is pretty absurd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-06-16T07:51:36.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the meaning of the story is, Dont fight laners you beat, because you MIGHT get ganked, give up all lane pressure, sit under turret, dont farm because you might get dove, dont even play the matchup, give up everything if enemy jg is not in vision, and meanwhile, irelia CLEARLY was willing to fight him and force his flash, so CLEARLY, she didnt respect enemy jg so why is his jg not there to counter?\nThe problem is simple, eve didnt gank durign the 6 mins vi ganked, vi got a lead, and wasnt put behind for ganking, Vi beat eve in power, even tho eve farmed strictly to GET power, eve didnt win 1v1, vis ganks single handedly won the game for their team, and eve wasnt useful at all to their team. im sorry but jg dictated that game entirely, yet mid isnt(assasin reworks and mage update) allowed to do that, top isnt(irelia/jax nerfs/toxic design rework), adc isnt(nerfs to most adc/redesigns/releases that hunt adcs down) and support isnt(ardent meta), so why is jg constantly allowed be so oppressive.(lvl 3 ganks turn to lvl 2 ganks)","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2019-06-17T20:09:04.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... What?\n\nNo, .. did you read what I said? I understand, it's a long comment, but I never said anything about not fighting. I even said, \"I understand why you would want to be aggressive\" and \"You were most likely to carry\" \n\nMy point was that when they were out of position with low health, no vision, and no escape tools. Morde is super immobile unless he has his passive, which requires that he be in a fight, and against a fed Vi, his passive wouldn't be enough. \n\nThe point was, it was their aggressiveness that encouraged Vi to gank. It was their lack of vision that lead to the Vi getting an early lead. IT WAS ALSO their teammates poor decisions that further put Vi ahead. Then it was their continued lack of respect for Vi's strength that allowed her to repeat gank again and again. \n\nAnd again, THEY WERE BEING OVERLY AGGRESSIVE and constantly pushed into the enemy tower, which made it practically impossible for Eve to gank top. The only time she was able to come top and get a kill was after Morde died and Irelia continued to push while she was low health. \n\nI'm definitely not saying that nobody else on the team contributed to the loss, .. but Morde certainly wasn't without blame, and it WAS their actions that caused the things they are complaining about.\n\nFurthermore, their actions are the only things they have any control over. By identifying your bad habits, you can prevent someone else from taking advantage of them.
