My ping is ALWAYS 30 - 33. of course once in a blue moon it will spike but I imagine that's on my ISP. for about a week it feels like im getting a bunch of server side lag or packet loss. I've run 2 different speed test/ ping test/ packet loss tests multiple times and all of the results are the same, perfectly fine. Not one packet out of place. I've tried reinstalling League, rebooting my modem and router and monitoring my connection in different games and still no issues elsewhere. I'm stumped. \r\n\r\nAny idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T22:29:00.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection to different servers take different routes, and therefore can run into issues to one server but not another. Before we take an in-depth look at your route to the NA servers, I'd like you to first ensure you local network settings are up to spec using our [network guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if your issue persists through those changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"REDSUPERCARR87","date":"2016-10-02T18:27:40.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no clue. I had 39 ping solid a week ago then this week its 200 ping solid. I quit for 3 months because of this lag honestly it's so bad. Even in a custom game where I MADE IT! I still get 200 ping. That literally makes 0 sense. Knowing Rito, they will tell you \"It seems like this is due to your ISP. Send us a support ticket.\" Don't fall for their shit. You will tell them the same shit waiting for a reply for 2 days then get a reply saying \"we have no clue what is going on, sorry.\" I'm literally so fucking bored without League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2016-10-02T04:15:55.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ran a speed test to Chicago?
