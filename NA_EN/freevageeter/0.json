Managing his heal in lane was crucial, and since it wasn't a ridiculous heal? You could actually lose more hp than you gained trying to go in for it. Not to mention it requires autoattacking, which would push the wave by default unless you strictly last-hit, which would leave you with even less hp at the end of each wave. Simultaneously, you had to manage your blood well passive, which was generally stacked with blood price. Can't heal if you do it that way. Also gotta stay in combat so the stacks don't deplete, keep the wave AND your opponent in a good position where you can leap on them and either trade or kill them. Aatrox's Dark Flight was very buggy and could be interrupted on the rise-up but not on the collapse, would sometimes take you over walls and other times not, his E was inconsistent and using it for harass never worked since it'd mean pushing the wave, thus opening yourself to a gank. Old Aatrox was pretty mechanically intensive and a lot more than just \"dive and attack lol durrr\".\n\nNew Aatrox is thematically different, not even remotely similar mechanically, and in fact counterproductive to what his theme states him to be. His ultimate is Aatrocious and his revive ends the second the ult expires, and it's not a very long duration, all things considering. His E has not even half the range his Dark Flight has, and his initial two Q's require him to be far out of melee range for maximum damage - which is counterproductive to a melee duelist.
