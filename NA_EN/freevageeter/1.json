After all, as common as it is to insinuate that women belong in a kitchen, it would be problematic to flag the word 'kitchen' for obvious reasons. It's a regular word that people use outside of a sexist context. \nSexist remarks suck, and I've seen my fair share, but I'm not sure what else can be done about it besides reporting people who break the summoner's code.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-07T08:28:32.679+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} what she said","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-06-07T15:40:17.899+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"if you were a male, ppl would downvote you for the exact same post rofl","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-06-07T15:42:43.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"double standards and irony amirite","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-06-07T19:04:58.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"yup. i myself said the same thing before and ppl were like \"thats such a braindead argument its like saying a woman showing cleavage means she wants to be raped\"\n\nbut when a female says the same thing? +1 totally fine lol","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-06-08T07:27:21.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can't say I read (or remember) your posts on the subject, but there's a subtle difference between giving sincere advice on how to take personal precautions and victim shaming.\nI've never seen a post downvoted that fully acknowledged the problem and suggested a band-aid fix, whether the author was female or male.
