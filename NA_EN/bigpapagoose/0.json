Why should other classes be able to use items meant for an ADC, even in extremely niche cases?\n\nI used to build IBG on champs like Lulu and Sona in rare circumstances. It wasn't optimal, but it was the right choice for the time. Every champ shouldn't lose that option because if Ezreal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myren Quiddle","date":"2019-08-13T08:00:41.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unpopular opinion: make all items available for everyone","replies":[{"poster":"figold666","date":"2019-08-14T14:37:27.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ravenous Hydra Runaans Twitch","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monstermushmush","date":"2019-08-13T17:59:24.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao.

Currently (at least for the ADCs) there is Maw, Iceborn or BC, and 2 of those are in dire need of a balance pass.\n\nWell, what we really need is to get out of this ridiculous damage-meta where building any defensive item on a carry is a waste of item slot and gold efficiency...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-08-13T05:32:27.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, this is not needed at all.\nJust fix Ezreal.\nMind, I love Ezreal, but he is far too powerful at basically every stage of the game with almost no way to punish him (Unless you are a certain couple of pro players that always get caught out....).\nIn lane, him plus any good poke support makes for a horrible laning experience and if he knows how to play late game, he can easily win the game.\nThey are nerfing him but I wonder if it will matter..
