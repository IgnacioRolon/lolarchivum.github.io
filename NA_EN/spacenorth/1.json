Thank you for all the feedback we&rsquo;ve gotten so far on the new cursor. We&rsquo;ve been reading through all of it and making a bunch of iterations internally, and today we have a fresh version to share here and on PBE to get more eyes and feedback.\n\nCursor Comparisons\nhttps://i.imgur.com/p4x7bvE.png\n\nEnemy Hover\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qC6PpD4.png\n\nEnemy and Ally Hover (GIF)\nhttps://imgur.com/a/x87c7UQ\n\nComparisons with Angles\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YDMj34p.jpg\n\nNote: The version you see here is not the final art - we&rsquo;re focusing on shapes right now, and then will polish after those are locked. :)\n\nAs you can see from the gif and images, we&rsquo;re trying out a few things here. Let&rsquo;s talk about each one.\n1. Shape change on Enemy Hover\n2. Different angle\n3. New shape with internal cut-out\n\n**1) Shape change on Enemy Hover**\n\nThe most common piece of feedback we got was around needing a shape change on Enemy Hover to get that instant feedback. We&#039;ve tried a bunch of different forms for this internally&mdash;other color changes, switching to a targeting reticle shape, and a couple others.\n\nAfter those attempts, we&rsquo;re testing out an update to the existing sword-shape for multiple reasons: It gets us a clear shape change without significant distraction, it can work at similar angles to the primary cursor, and of course we get to benefit from everyone&rsquo;s existing familiarity with this shape.\n\nThat being said, the old sword had a few problems of getting lost in minion waves and during team fights because of its slimmer profile, which is part of why we were looking at other shapes originally. We&rsquo;re trying to mitigate this by having a flat, bright space in the blade, but are definitely interested in feedback there.\n\n**2) Different Angle**\n\nWe originally started with a 45 degree angle because that&#039;s what the legacy gauntlet cursor uses. However, even though the gauntlet was set to a 45 degree angle, the asymmetrical shape of the hand makes the overall form look like it&rsquo;s pointing more upward than 45 degrees. \n\nSince the new cursor has a symmetrical shape, its weight is evenly distributed along whatever axis it is placed upon (45 degrees in this case), avoiding the optical illusion of being pointed at a different angle. This led to the new cursor sometimes feeling like it bent to the left, especially when interacting with flat interfaces like the store. By tilting the cursor so the left edge is on the 0 degree line and the right edge is on the 45 degree line, it should feel more familiar to your experience both in and out of League (the 0 degree angle is what most applications and operating systems use).\n\n**3) New Shape with Internal Cut-Out**\n\nWe&rsquo;re also trying out more of a diamond shape with an internal cut-out. We saw some minor feedback about the first version looking too simplistic, so we&rsquo;re hoping this version feels more interesting (and more fitting with League&rsquo;s other UI) without giving up clarity.\n\nHaving the cut-out in the middle also gives us a useful space to communicate non-critical information where a shape change is overkill. For example, the internal diamond could turn blue when hovering over an ally, as shown above.","replies":[{"poster":"PrismaHDS","date":"2018-06-17T20:21:59.259+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here my opinions regarding the new cursor:\n\n1)       I liked the first iteration of the cursor update much better! \nThe first iteration had a much readable style than the new one. The new cursor is to slim. Its strange, and Assassin's Creed like new form makes it in my opinion, very difficult to distinguish it from abilities (especially in team fights).\n\nThe new cursor proposal doesn’t improve visibility at all and is at the same poor level as the vanilla cursor.\n\nFurthermore, because of the change of the width, I had the impression,  the cursor had changed colour compared to the last cursor version. After a comparison again the old and the new version, it turned out to be the same colour. Or is it really the same colour?\n\n2)        For the sword version of the new cursor, I still do not know what to think of it. On the one hand, I find the idea (looking to the first cursor update) that no matter if attacking or moving, the cursor remains the same was appealing and improves clarity. However, I suggest making the colour changes more visible.  Making the colour change of the cursor more visible was absolutely not achieved in the 2nd cursor update. In respect to the cursor change, the 2nd update is a step backwards in comparison to the 1st proposal.\n\nOn the other side, I think that as it is working right now in the game: having a sword indicating were able to attack sometimes is very helpful. I guess that for beginners who have just started playing the game seeing the sword is a useful feature. For the sword to work out better, I suggest the sword has to be broader or bolder. At the moment the sword is much too thin and inconspicuous. For example, it could become wider going up the top (a more tapered form of the sword). Also, the handle of the sword seems a bit too pointy... a rounded variant or design might look better.\n\n3)       With the new angle, I do not like it at all. It is just terrible! Especially sword cursor angle, it is very noticeable and gives a static and optically false look and feel or perception. Please do not do that to us!!!\n\n（ミ￣ー￣ミ）.\n\n4)       Here a few ideas for the casting of the abilities to allies/ or your self:\n\n- For the healing function, it would be cool if the cursor would change to an \"ambulance cross\" icon:  e.g.the red cross logo/icon might be an easily understandable connotation for the healing function. Also, the colour could change to green, but it would be ok if the cursor stays in the new brown look and feel. I guess that the player understands the brown icon as well somehow.\n\n- For the shields:  it would be nice/OK if the cursor simply changes to a shield. Keep it simple. \nIn regards to the cursor colour/shield colour: \nMaybe you could use a light blue or a white colour.\nA light blue reminds you of your allies.\nOr the white colour reminds you of shields.\n\nIn case you can also do the same as you did for the healing:\nStay to brown for the sake of visibility.\n\n \nI tested both current versions on the PBE and hoped that you at Riot will come up with a design, that everyone can enjoy. Keep going.\n\nPrismaHDS","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-13T20:57:49.600+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Generally a huge improvement. I'm a little thrown off by how much thinner the sword is though, and would encourage looking at ways to make that a bit wider so your eyes adjust to it more easily. I'd also consider making the portion of the ward indicator that changes color a bit more obvious (possibly an inner ring or the 0/3 text?) to make it more immediately obvious you're safely in the bush.\n\nFinally, a tiny bit of color splashed on the enemy indicator might be good, just 'cause people are used to the color change currently -- and, on that note, the blue on ally-hover could probably be more prominent. I actually missed it at first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Small Boobs Ahri","date":"2018-06-13T21:22:54.274+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"will the cross when one clicks on the ground such change too?\n\nhttps://www.zupimages.net/up/18/24/6jxc.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2018-06-13T20:54:12.091+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now this is way better than what it was!\n\nBUT at this point this is just a reskin of  the legacy cursor, a facelift if you will. Which is not bad, it was needed to hammer out some issues that the old cursor had.\nNow allow me to ask some questions which probably wont get answered, but anyways:\n-Are you guys planning to add a feature to change the cursors color to our liking? I'd instantly change it to purple to make it **absolutly** distinguishable in any situation.\n-Are you guys planning to add a feature to where i can change the shape of the sword? I'd actually prefer the bulkier one(last one in the picure with the angles)\n-Are you guys planning to add a feature to where i can change the color which the cursor appears at in different situation? Now its stays white even when hovering an enemy.\n\nOnce again: You guys are making a cursor that will stay with us probably years. Take your time and implement features, since you have the opportunity now. Make it futureproof. Allow us to make the cursor feel good.
