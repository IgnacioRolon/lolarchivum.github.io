We&rsquo;re Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high ranking League players whose job it is to play the hell out of things (lane tests, competitive testing, etc) and give actionable, objective feedback to designers.\n\nEvery two weeks (concurrent with the release of patch notes), we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game because, as we said, it&rsquo;s our job to analyze it from all angles.\n\nToday, we&rsquo;ve got a grab bag of topics for you, with a follow-up on our sleepers post from last patch, predictions on the jungle meta after the Runic Echoes nerfs, and what the hell is happening to all of our beautiful markspeople.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**One More Sleeper**\n\n[Last week we put top lane Nautilus front and center in our predicted sleepers](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/oFQnH7Ag-patch-chat-with-playtest-patch-63), and it seems like many other players had the same idea, waking the Titan of the Depths from his slumber. His play rate spiked by 125%, and his win rate climbed another percent, to just above 54.5%. Did you pick up top lane Nautilus last week? Tell us about it in the comments!\n\nBut there&rsquo;s another best-kept secret just on the horizon, and it&rsquo;s more than just OK. How do you deal with a meta where ADCs can go top, jungle, and bot all at the same time? Rammus, of course! With all that AD, this armordillo has powerballed to the top and is poised to take on all comers.\n\nWith the exception of Malphite, Dr. Mundo, Nautilus, and Vladimir, 16 of the 20 most-played top laners are AD-based. And while a few of them have the potential to bully, the notorious trio of snowballers, Renekton, Darius, and Riven, are all sitting below 50% win rates.\n\nRammus may have a weak laning phase but, with no bullies around to punish him, he&rsquo;s taking his lunch money and cashing it in for some serious armor that most top laners and ADC&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t crack.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rumble in the Jungle**\n\nThe jungle has been more than a little mercurial lately, with juggernauts, devourers, and mages - oh my! - dominating the top 10 in both win rates and play rates, leaving tanks and warriors out in the cold.\n\nUdyr? Let&rsquo;s not forget that he&rsquo;s getting his own personal nerfs!\n\nOnce the runic echo nerf hits live, however, we expect those AP junglers to take a decent hit, which means that the devourer junglers that aren&rsquo;t nerfed (sorry Xin Zhao) will probably take the throne. My top bets? Master Yi and Shyvana.\n\nThose champions have proven harder to deal with than expected, thanks to massive mixed damage: physical (auto-attacks), magical (Devourer/Guinsoo&rsquo;s), and even true (Master Yi). But if you can&rsquo;t join &lsquo;em, beat &lsquo;em. Devourer junglers are weak gankers early on, and early pressure junglers have a chance at snowballing lanes out of control.\n\nBut one champion has been absolutely burning up the jungle: Rumble. Everybody&rsquo;s favorite scrapper is getting some serious changes, so we sat down with playtester (and former LCS player) Nicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith for his opinions on the new and improved Rumble.\n\n> _I think this should be a pretty big playstyle change; it&rsquo;s definitely a buff, but his win rate may drop to start as people figure out how to play it.\n> _\n>  \n> _Rumble has more leeway on heat. For example if he gets up to 80-heat or so, he no longer has to ult immediately or wait for his heat to go down; he can drop one E for the slow, then ult, then finish off with the second E.\n> _\n> \n> _Rumble&rsquo;s poking game is also definitely stronger now, but it&rsquo;s not as secure as other poke champions. Like, if I&rsquo;m playing Nidalee, those spears have sick range; I can sit back and throw spears and if I hit a fatty one, that&rsquo;s money. If not, I&rsquo;m not at risk. Rumble&#039;s low-ranged poke leaves him open to picks, but the strength of his counter initiation with Equalizer gives him some serious options to punish opponents who think he&#039;s an easy kill.\n> _\n> \n> _Of course, he should also still find a place in top lane, and these changes should buff him up a few percent, but he probably still won&rsquo;t be a top-tier top laner thanks to his steep mastery curve.\n> _\n\nWhat do you think? What new junglers will rise to the top?\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Hitting the Mark**\n\nOur ranged auto-attackers are getting some serious changes in this patch, but two champions&rsquo; changes really stand out.\n\n**Jhin, The Virtuoso**\n\nJhin has struggled in solo queue, despite already seeing LCS play. \n\nAfter his games on the champion, Nickwu thinks that Jhin should feel significantly better on 6.4, thanks to an underappreciated change:\n\n> _The biggest change to me is probably the Movement Speed. Since every auto-attack matters, moving around and picking the right auto-attacks will feel more fluid. On a character that absolutely needs to hit his autos at the right time, Movement Speed cannot be underestimated.\n> _\n> \n> _Deathfire Touch already does big damage on Jhin, thanks to his ludicrous bonus AD. Making his ultimate single-target will allow him to cash in some huge snipe shots in the late game, but might not be relevant in teamfights if you&rsquo;re already getting the Deathfire Touch off on earlier auto-attacks.\n> _\n> \n> _There&rsquo;s some nice usability buffs in there two; traps and the root are both easier to use, which should ease some player frustration.\n> _\n> \n> _Finally, Jhin&rsquo;s passive is brought into consistency on towers. You already expect your 4th shot to be a fatty crit, so this should make Jhin feel more consistent when taking towers.\n> _\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Caitlyn - The Sheriff of Piltover**\n\nThanks to her synergies with Hurricane, Statikk Shiv, and Rapidfire cannon, Caitlyn has been seeing success in mid game teamfights and turret sieges. Traps are already especially potent around turrets, and this trap change is a buff that exaggerates Caitlyn&rsquo;s strengths. We should see her dominate in fights around turrets and epic monsters. Maxing W increases Caitlyn&rsquo;s highs, and will make it much harder for teams to claw their way back into the game when Caitlyn abuses her early game strength to get a lead.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat do you think? Who are your sleepers for 6.4? Are AP junglers still going to be strong on 6.4? Is Jhin OP or situational? Tell us below in the comments and feel free to ask any questions you have for Playtest Team at Riot, whether they be about balance or what exactly our job is! We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nIsaac &ldquo;_Azael_&rdquo; Cummings-Bentley\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nScott &ldquo;_Sickoscott_&rdquo; Hong\nMattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\nNicholas &ldquo;_Drecker_&rdquo; Shapiro\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_Ex Shepherd_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"2PaCeD5","date":"2016-02-24T22:21:56.536+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":61,"body":"I think Kog'Maw has waited long enough. \n\nThe little buffs and stuff are nice and all, but when is he going to be viable at the pro level? For starters, his Q needs a complete overhaul because it is completely worthless. It has very little damage, not enough range, and no special properties, how nice. His W doesn't give him nearly enough attack range to make it actually GOOD at killing like it is supposed to be. His AP scaling is all-around waaaaaaaay too low; so what if he can attack 5X a second, the don't do anything! And yes, I know if you have Hurricane and Rageblade he can do some pretty good damage, but it takes 20-30 mins before he can even complete 2 items, assuming he doesn't get super fed in the beginning. He doesn't even work as a good JG because he's both too slow and because he can't do anything without those 2 items. Since his slow doesn't even work unless the enemies are walking on it directly, it doesn't really help at all if you go bot because it's just not enough slow for that tiny space.

I am, however, a pretty consistent juggernaut player. If a champion can just run at you endlessly until you pass out from exhaustion and I smack your lifeless, exhausted body with marginal damage until you die, I'm happy. Even better if I have a shield so spammable that short of heavy sustained damage, you never hurt me. Skarner, Poppy, Hecarim, Udyr, Volibear, those champions are my jam.\n\nAnd I agree, those champions - more than any other - are knowledge based. If I pick a bad fight as Lee Sin or Rek'Sai, I can simply dash away over a wall and be fine. If I'm Skarner and pick a bad fight, I'm probably dying (even if it's slowly). As such, You have to knew exactly who is going to win any trade before you pick it.\n\nUdyr doesn't actually have that weakness. Udyr's movement speed and shields are so strong that he will probably get away from you. But even if he can't escape, he doesn't have to choose fights all that carefully, because his base tankiness and base damage are so high that - even built tank - he will just consistently outtrade you while you struggle to touch him. Nerfing the shield and Phoenix damage will force you to actually choose fights carefully - as befits the game knowledge fantasy. If you know what fights you win, you get to feel smart.

For example it's rare to see a Sona massively fuck a game up by throwing, The only way for Sona to throw a game is a bad flash ult, compared to someone like Thresh who can at any point go superman on a hook and lose his team the game.\n\nBasically Sona promotes a playstyle that is conducive to winning.\n\n>If she is so weak then why does she out damage every support except the \"supports\" (Vel, Brand, Annie, Zyra) and Karma?\n\nBecause she builds AP? Sona builds Lichbane, of course she does more damage than other supports. If Nami was gimped into a situation where she relied on an AP item to function her damage would spike up, that doesn't mean she'd be more powerful.\n\n>Why does she get so many assists and kills? Her assists and kills don't make up the difference between her having so much more gold than some more popular supports, why is that?\n\nBecause her aura's make it easy to get assists. If I give someone a worthless speed boost as their AA flies through the air to kill a target I get an assist, that doesn't mean I helped them at all. \n\nAs for kills that comes back to she builds more AP and does more damage because of it. Once again this doesn't make her more powerful than someone like a Thresh with a locket, The Thresh brings far more in terms of utility.\n\nI'd also advise http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/ over OP.GG. It gives better control over the data you're looking at.\n\nFor example [mid Sona](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/sona/middle) does barely any more damage than [support Sona.](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/sona/support) If I had to guess why I'd say it's because support Sona and mid Sona build almost the same. Compare and contrast this to Lulu, who when she plays [support](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/lulu/support) deals significantly less damage than [mid.](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/lulu/middle) This is because Lulu has options to build non-AP items as a support and in fact [often does.](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/items/lulu/support) Sona on the otherhand tends to build [a lot of AP.](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/items/sona/support) This is why you really can't just look at their damage numbers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"An Angry Kayle","date":"2016-02-25T01:49:05.636+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"You CANNOT look at competitive play as a basis for whether a champion should be buffed.

That's only true when we're NOT discussing the support class, which we are.  Support champions ARE balanced around not having items, except for Sightstone.  They have high bases and lots of utility to make up for this and low scalings to avoid being abused in solo lanes.

Her ult doesn't even make up for this, because fact of the matter is that it's amongst the weakest CC ults in the game:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=A Wild AP Sona,realm=NA,application-id=u1cO6oFT,discussion-id=hUj8b74R,comment-id=00360000,timestamp=2014-07-02T06:02:30.008+0000)\n>\n> you have no clue what you are talking about for sona\n> she needs a damage buff not less damage\n> \n> _and her ultimate is stupidly underpowered_\n> _it has one of the weakest stuns in the game and the travel time is so woefully bad that anyone not bronze 5 simply flashs out of the way when they see it or uses a tumble like vayne\n_","replies":[{"poster":"Unumalum","date":"2016-02-25T17:38:16.135+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not so much that items are a \"crutch\" but rather that those items are really good with her kit.

In Assassin metas where supports don't take as much damage she is very strong due to her peel and the damage she can naturally do to squishies. She gets weaker in the meta's we have gone through since 4.13. In the bruiser meta she can't deal that much damage because of the tank items that a lot of champions are picking up and their innate durability also there there tend to be much more collateral damage that can wreck her if she is positioned near her adc (a'la VI, Panth, J4, ETC.)  In tank metas she can't deal much damage yet again and the damage tends to trend towards AOE so even if she isn't being focused she can take a lot of collateral damage which is devastating to someone as squishy as sona (i think she is one of the 10 squishiest champions in game) also the prevalence of merc treads in the previous tank meta reduced the effectiveness of her ult. and in the current ADC meta even when she isn't being focused most damage is sustained so there is always damage that can be turned toward her when the rest of her team falls and she typically lack enough damage to kill anyone in a single rotation so the life steal that ADC's build mitigates her damage. Also due to the ranged nature of ADC's it is more difficult for her to get a good ult off as they are unlikely to be both clustered and within her range.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-02-25T01:05:44.795+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've made this point before but Sona is in every way mathematically weaker than Nami assuming Nami can land her bubble.\n\nShe winds up comming out weaker in terms of Burst Healing, HPS, Healing/Mana, Poke Damage, Burst Damage, DPS, CC, peeling, MS boosts and every single base stat. The only point where I think Sona comes out ahead is Damage/Mana, but that's not enough to stop her being completely outclassed by Nami.\n\nI do not think Nami is a partcuarly strong champion either, I think Nami's slightly under the power curve and probably needs small buffs to help her out a little. Sona's just even further underneath that, her competitive pickrate shows this too. [She's been the longest unpicked support in the game.](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/List_of_Most_Recent_Games_By_Champion) Even Taric has been picked more recently than her.\n\n>In Assassin metas where supports don't take as much damage she is very strong due to her peel and the damage she can naturally do to squishies.\n\nThis is untrue because most assassins can kill Sona with a stern look. A Zed can kill Sona without ever even ulting her, just his basic abilities and a single auto would remove her from the fight entirely. That's before mentioning that Sona has the worst peel of any support.\n\nAlso if this was true Sona would be having her best results for years right now because Assassins are really fucking popular right now. There is no meta that Sona can thrive in because she's just a very weak champ.","replies":[{"poster":"shadowsrayn","date":"2016-02-25T01:53:39.298+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now, I am a relatively recent player to League, and I have to agree. Throughout the entirety of my time playing Sona has felt highly under-powered. I find she is pretty fun to play and decent use if you are playing games with people who really don't know what their doing, however one skilled opponent makes her feel as if she has no place in the match, except in giving small heals ever once in awhile and it is rather depressing. I would like to know if Riot has any plans to fix this, or if she is just going to fall off as other champs get re-balanced and possibly stronger?","replies":[]},{"poster":"An Angry Kayle","date":"2016-02-25T02:24:17.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"might i mention she's the least picked pro support due to the fact that she doesn't provide anything desirable to a pro player adc, she provides little cc, moderate damage, moderate healing, moderate movespeed, and she's extremely squishy, there are many other champions that out class her in the desired area, alistar proves MUCH more cc, janna provides the adc a shield while buffing their damage, and giving movespeed, taric provides a point and click stun, a damage buff, added resistances, and a moderate heal, the only thing stellar that sona provides is an AOE dance off stun, and a damage debuff that is quite situational, she's not even good at communicating with her team.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-02-25T02:31:55.406+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You've mentioned it a few times, that really doesn't make it any less wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spykz","date":"2016-02-24T23:38:58.712+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey Riot.
