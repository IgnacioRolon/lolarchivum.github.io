Want to know what we think is OP? Curious what it&rsquo;s like to work as a Riot playtester? Have any questions about how we feel about the most recent patch? We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\n[Patch 6.13](http://leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-613-notes) brings significant changes to support and top lane, so especially ask us any questions you have about our predictions or thoughts on the new support/top landscape!\n\nAdditionally, Nicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith and Trevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes will be streaming Wednesday, 6/29 from 6PM to 8 PM PDT, so if you want to join them for custom games, or just continue the discussion there, tune in to [the stream tomorrow](https://www.twitch.tv/leagueoflegends)!\n\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nPreston &ldquo;_Hinder_&rdquo; Bunker\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nDon &ldquo;_Aesah_&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;_Gleeb_&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;_Penguin_&rdquo; Hardison\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;_Bao/Siegil_&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;_RobertxLee_&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_S0be_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"LolShrimpDaddy","date":"2016-06-28T21:01:28.447+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"I understand what they are doing with the support items but i still feel that they are underpowerd and just utility for your team late game i just feel like some champs that are played as support drop off hard mid to late game and are only used to clear wards or reposition people such as {{champion:53}}","replies":[{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2016-06-28T21:22:13.704+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really sure what you're asking here but you touched on something that peeves me as an active support player. Yeah- as support you don't have as much raw power as a mid laner or top laner. You don't have as much access to gold and exp and you are required to spend a chunk of that gold on stuff that doesn't have any clear benefit for your power (sightstone, aegis). But this does not make you a less effective champion than your allies by a large margin. \n\nChampions like Blitz have an uncanny ability to carry games with nothing but mobility boots. Thesh has the ability to make massive highlight reel plays and murder even the most fed carries with very little gold or exp required. Soraka, Nami, Sona, Janna can spoon feed even the most nooby marksman gold until they become useful. Playing Support, in my opinion, is not about getting powerful or vacuuming up as much gold as you can so you can carry the game. It's about empowering your allies to smash the opponent and disabling your enemies to make them blind and helpless, and you can do all of this with almost no gold in your pocket.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextor","date":"2016-06-28T23:00:33.103+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":20,"body":"Well that said i still can't agree with you. Your point '' that support champs don't need as much exp or gold'' is totally irrelevant actually. You will not see that in other rpg's. I can understand that supports would not get as much money as your marksman or mid but that's only because money doesn't grow on trees exception: {{champion:57}} , it does on minions Duh (You can't just throw in an infinite supply of items that generate more gold). However Riot should look into a way to help supports stay on par for exp. As a party in rpg's the exp is split equally why should it be different with LoL, why should supports be weak or punished? Maybe the exp could be fixed through support items much like gold is for junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2016-06-28T23:20:40.615+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you read the patch notes you'd see that we are, in fact, giving supports more exp.

There is nothing about support class champions that says \"they gain less XP\".\nHowever, unlike in an RPG, a lot of their role involves roaming and controlling vision, which moves them away from the main sources of XP (minions).\nThat being said, the changes to XP while dead or XP when behind should help supports somewhat, but certainly not to the point where supports will keep even pace with other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextor","date":"2016-06-29T00:17:00.111+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"I understand that Gustaf but i believe supports should be able to stay on par with marksmans for exp since they share the same lane as them and the level of a champion can be much more critical to a fight than items.

I know that's my opinion and I love what riot's doing to the support items and exp. Its more rewarding to do your job and that's what supposed to happen. I doubt you play any support and if you do its probably not well seeing how greedy you sound in your play.

I suppose disrupters scale so hard with cooldown reduction, any core item you provide would have to compete with that, and thats probably not possible unless it was a double cast or something.\n\nLikewise, there isn't an item that is dedicated to the agenda of a skirmisher, which according to the subclass dev blog is to \"shred through any nearby enemy that approaches, but lack in high end burst or reliable ways to close on high priority targets\". The closest item that supports that agenda is last whisper, but it a generalist item not an item specifically tailored to the needs of skirmishers.\n\nSo here is my question:\n\nCan we get a core item for artillery mages and a core item for skirmishers please?\n\nIn case you are wondering what I am thinking by \"core\" item for skirmisher and artillery mage, I mean something that really orients or even commits your champion towards the skirmisher/artillery agenda:\n\nSalamander Saber (melee only)\n20% attack speed\n20 attack damage\n20% crit chance\nunique passive: \"Converts some of any physical damage dealt into a damage over time effect. 20% as true damage over 4 seconds.\"\n\nMagic railgun\n300 mana\n80 ap\npassive: \"hitting any enemy champion with an ability builds 1 charge.

Thanks for your analysis :)\n\nYour post is a bit of a long one but it's on my *favorite* topic in LoL, so I'm going to give it a similarly detailed response. But I'm just sitting at work spitballing, so it will be a bit scattered, and there's a chance I'll make some silly mistakes or say something that's only partially true or leave out something cool I'll wish I'd elaborated on, so I hope you don't mind! But the TL;DR is that you're pretty spot on that we haven't reached full role-item array saturation. Whether or not full saturation is a good or a necessary thing is a bit harder to say, but let's start from the assumption that it is (this aligns with my personal beliefs). \n\nWhen LoL started, class distinctions were very blunt and vague: AD carry, AP carry, tank, bruiser, support. As such, the items were relatively imprecise: did you want AD, AP, tanky stats, or team-assisting actives. I believe the first real distinction that started getting made - itemization-wise - was with melee champions.\n\nPeople used to get into arguments over what a \"tank\" was all the time. One set of people just said tanks were any champions who built tanky. Back then, people would call Dr. Mundo and Jarvan and Nautilus all tanks. It was an imprecise world. The other side was saying that there were two types of tanky champions.\n\nOne class of \"tanky\" champions was gold hungry; they built the exodia build of Warmog's Atma's Trinity Force and scaled pretty well, to the degree that they became one of the most frustrating classes in the game. Soon, the name \"bruiser\" stuck.\n\nThis stood in stark contrast to \"tanks\" could build nothing but gold items and still do well. Of course, it was actually even more complicated than that because junglers like Mundo and Shyvana would build jungle items *and* build tanky AD.\n\nThe other contrast was ADCs; you basically had two classes of ADCs; BT first and IE first champions.\n\nFast forward a season and you get Black Cleaver and the Youmuu's rework and people started to realize that AD Assassins were a class that had just needed items to function. We stopped calling AP Assassins at some point and started calling them burst mages because AP Assassins tend to have CC while AD assassins don't.\n\nTo avoid this being a lengthy history lesson, over the last 12-months or so, Juggernauts got their items, and then ADCs got their itemization rework, and then there was Mage Update.\n\nWe've been working on the class list behind the scenes, and as you can guess from those three updates, plus the upcoming assassin update, one of the big initiatives at Riot is updating each class to have a clear identity. A lot of things determine what classes get updates.\n\nJuggernauts got theirs because they were probably the least supported class in LoL. We just overweighted them with stats because the game systems didn't allow them to function.\n\nMarksmen got theirs because the class was relatively indistinct. You mostly just picked one of the marksmen that was strong at the time because they were so similar that style rarely mattered.\n\nAssassins, on the other hand, are getting their update because they're one of the most frustrating classes to play against, so there's a huge impact on live to their existence. \n\nWhen we update a class, we typically want to hit three things: kits, items, and systems. For example, with juggernauts that looked like this:\nKits - Removing excess mobility, changing scalings, \nItems - making more mobility items, introducing items to match those scalings.\n\nAnd that leaves systems. What do I mean by \"systems\"?\nYou'll note that many juggernauts scale with Base AD (rather than Bonus) and Health. This is intended, and allows us to tailor items to them by loading them with those stats. But here's the problem. When we reworked juggernauts, we didn't also rework every other champion. There are plenty of other champions with Base AD or health scaling, and those champions *also* love the juggernaut items. Given that those items are overloaded at their goal of filling the weaknesses of the juggernaut class, they often ended up heightening the strengths of champions who could take those items without having those weaknesses. For example, Darius needs Dead Man's Plate to chase most champions down. But if a champion like Jarvan can take that item efficiently, he can just chase you down with all of his gap-closers. And while Titanic Hydra is aimed at juggernauts, other melee champions who like Base AD and health can grab that and go on to also build damage and be this weird tanky never-dying champion who can still one-shot you (Fiora got pretty scary for awhile there)\n\nArtillery champions benefit highly from regular AP items, and it's quite likely that the reverse would be true. And so it requires a good deal more care to make sure we don't accidentally make it impossible to balance all other mages just to give Artillery champions their items. Or it may even turn out that Artillery champions don't have differing itemization needs from generic mage items because their class already hits its niche so hard. Same goes for skirmisher.\n\nI hope this gives some context: you're definitely right that those classes don't currently have class-specific items. It's a bit harder to say whether that's a problem. It's even harder to turn that problem into a design solution, especially when there are more pressing - or more easily solved - problems nearby for us to tackle.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-28T23:00:30.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gentleman Gustaf,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=lKFQipoE,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2016-06-28T21:56:54.252+0000)\n>\n> Same goes for skirmisher.\n\nI totally disagree here. I'm actually quite surprised that Skirmishers weren't on the short list for class updates next to Divers, Assassins, and Vanguards since they are usually straight-up bad unless they're balanced like an assassin (Jax) or balanced like a diver (Fiora). They have this desire to attack targets and a way to get to the target, but unless they kill the target instantly (which they're not supposed to do) or are weirdly tanky (which they're not supposed to do) then they just fail.","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-06-28T23:20:45.625+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should have been more clear, but by \"same goes for skirmisher\", I mean \"it may turn out that their issues are not itemization-related\", not \"The class is fine\".
