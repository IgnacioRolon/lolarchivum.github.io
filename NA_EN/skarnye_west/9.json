We&rsquo;re Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high ranking League players whose job it is to play the hell out of things (lane tests, competitive testing, etc) and give actionable, objective feedback to designers.\n\nEvery two weeks (concurrent with the release of patch notes), we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. **Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game.** As Trinity Force is getting changed in [Patch 6.11](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-611-notes) to build out of Stinger and Zeal, we&#039;re especially interested in the impact this will have on its purchasers.\n\nPatch Chat has been running for several patches now, but we&rsquo;re still iterating on the format. With two new members starting in the last few weeks, we&rsquo;re taking the opportunity to introduce ourselves and ask for any feedback about the format of Patch Chat. What do you like about Patch Chat or wish to see in the future? What do you hate?

I thought [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/mBL8eh6n-ziggs-feedbackproposal?show=flat) was a cool idea. His W has a really low AP ratio and it makes it hard to make more aggressive Ziggs plays which justify the risk of blowing his only escape (especially with that CD).

Syndra creep blocks (for the lack of a better term) herself.\n- When you Q/E combo, the E cone hitbox is pushing the enemy away at very strange angles causing the stun to miss even though you aim it head on.
