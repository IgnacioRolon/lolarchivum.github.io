We&rsquo;re Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high ranking League players whose job it is to play the hell out of things (lane tests, competitive testing, etc) and give actionable, objective feedback to designers.\n\nEvery two weeks (concurrent with the release of patch notes), we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. **Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game.**\n\nPatch 6.9 was a massive first for Playtest Team. With new items, 15+ champions being worked on, and systemic updates to objectives, jungle monsters, and buffs, it&rsquo;s one of the biggest set of changes we&rsquo;ve worked on as a team. However, unlike the overhauls of the Preseason, there&rsquo;s a lot more pressure on us to be as precise as possible so as not to disrupt the game midseason. And unlike the Preseason, we don&rsquo;t have a followup Preseason patch to correct midway.\n\nAnd so the project began early. Our first playtest of the new mages was on November 30th, 2015, back when &ldquo;Hextech Protobelt&rdquo; hadn&rsquo;t even been thought up. That mage was Brand. Vel&rsquo;Koz and Malzahar followed shortly on his heels, and over the next two months we would play the six core mages (those three plus Vladimir, Zyra, and Cassiopeia) over 100 times.\n\nIn late February, the new items began arriving.\n\nAccording to Nicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith, this was what was most difficult about the Mage Update: working on so many things as much. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t possibly get enough games on every update to be confident in each new update&rdquo;. This was a sentiment shared by Mattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman, who pointed out that &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t so much that I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d have the patch ready eventually. It&rsquo;s that I never knew how we all felt about every change on a given day because there was so much to keep track of&rdquo;.\n\nWith two months to go, items in flux, more new changes coming in every day, Blake &ldquo;_Ex Shepherd_&rdquo; Soberanis and Trevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes spearheaded the project that probably resurrected our confidence in the whole patch: alignment meetings. As a new team, we&rsquo;ve been expanding our process with each patch, and learning from our mistakes the hard way. But one thing we hadn&rsquo;t had to do yet was tackle a constantly fluctuating project with a full team.\n\nIn these meetings we would highlight 5-7 core issues we wanted to increase confidence on by the next meeting, detailing the steps we needed to take. Sometimes this meant a specific context for our upcoming playtests to resolve a difference of balance opinion, other times it meant crystallizing our group opinion to deliver more specific and justified feedback to designers.\n\nWith a renewed sense of confidence under our belt, we would end up running more targeted tests over time, testing the six core mages another 150 times over the next two months, while simultaneously getting 250 games on the other mages, not to mention lane tests.\n\nObviously anything which introduces change into the game adds some degree of uncertainty and imbalance. But as we honed in more and more on the more egregious outliers, and as we each started to enjoy aspects of the update, we became more and more certain that we were creating positive player experiences and trimming out the severe imbalances.\n\nSo what are we excited about now that the patch is finally hitting live?\n\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\n> My favorite rework is Viktor because I love that champion, and I think these slight changes make him more viscerally exciting. The pulsing ultimate is extremely satisfying compared to the sustained damage of the old ultimate and the speed of the laser feels fantastic. While Aftershock is much harder to hit by yourself, the payoff is much higher and rewards you for following up on teammates&rsquo; CC or landing a W stun. \n> \n\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\n> Vel&rsquo;Koz. Because true damage.\n> \n\nBlake &ldquo;_Ex Shepherd_&rdquo; Soberanis\n> Athene&rsquo;s Unholy Grail. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of heal/dps hybrid battle-cleric type of characters - you should see my D&amp;D character! - and Athene&rsquo;s allows champions to better fill that battle-cleric role. It&rsquo;s particularly fun on Nidalee, Karma, and Kayle.\n> \n\nMattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\n> I don&rsquo;t really play mages that often, but Warmog&rsquo;s Armor making it easier to get non-armor linked CDR on tanks has me pretty excited.\n> \n\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\n> Teemo buffs will always be #1 in my heart\n> \n\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes\n> Zac. His new passive duration is gonna be rad\n> \n\nWhat do you think about the Mage Update? Have any questions about what it&rsquo;s like to work as a Riot playtester? Maybe some questions about 6.9 as a whole? As usual, feel free to ask any questions about balance or what exactly our job is! We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n \n\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nMattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_Ex Shepherd_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-05-03T20:08:53.463+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"> My favorite rework is Viktor because I love that champion, and I think these slight changes make him more viscerally exciting.

He called Viktor being sleeper OP (after his rework, before he showed up in pro play).  Sure enough it caught on and had quite the impact on mid lane for multiple patches.  This one will definitely take some getting used to, but can still do everything he needs to.","replies":[{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2016-05-03T22:34:31.559+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the reasons for Viktor's last changes were to make him smoother to play, since he was horrifically unpopular due to being ungodly clunky to play...is Riot at all concerned that changing Viktor to be clunkier to play will only make him never picked once again?\n\nNot being professional game devs, it's really hard for a lot of us to appreciate elements in a kit the same way you guys do. If Vikot ends up being clunkier to play and has a hard time hitting stuff like Aftershock or the full damage on his ult...well I can tell you that a lot of us are just going to stop playing him and play someone more satisfying instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2016-05-04T07:52:04.558+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":23,"body":"I have seen the word 'clunky' mean a lot of different things.  In the sense of the responsive-ness of his button presses (the most common meaning of clunky) they all cast the same way they do on live.  If by clunky you mean that things are harder to land, then yes, the E2 is harder to land.  \n\nIn regards to the ult changes specifically, one of the more ridiculous things Viktor could previously do was instant burst people similar to how annie would.  This is a play pattern that I would call unhealthy: if Viktor holds on to his abilities, squishy targets aren't allowed to move forward in fear of getting 100-0 bursted.  While his new ult is unable to do that to the same extent, he can now pretty aggressively zone out   high threat targets with the ult alone.  \n\nAs an AD player, I actually feel like I have options against this version of Viktor, even though I think it is overall stronger.  What it basically comes down to is removing the unhealthy/unbalance-able portions of Viktor's kit (super burst combo that he can consistently get due to reliable wave clear) and adding in more sustained damage/zoning potential.  \n\nWith all of THAT said, there are so many moving parts that it is incredibly difficult to know where he will actually land, so we will be keeping an eye on how he performs regardless with the intent of doing any necessary follow up work","replies":[{"poster":"Scramrail","date":"2016-05-04T16:13:22.109+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Its actually pretty easy to determine where Viktor is going to land. He is going to be incredibly strong in organized play, where a team can be built around him with heavy, preferably AoE CC, allowing him to land his clunky damage potential.\n\nFor me personally, I consider a kit clunky if it doesn't really work well on its own. Against even marginally skilled opponents, landing your stun from your W is rare, and because of that his ability to land his aftershock/ult ticks is going to be equally as rare.\n\nRiot has turned Viktor into a champion that will likely be borderline OP in an organized environment with a team built around him, or UP bordering on a troll pick when played by a solo.\n\nWhile he has a TON of THEORETICAL damage potential, when you really get down to it he is likely only ever going to be getting off half of it in unorganized play, which is where the majority of this game takes place.\n\nI can understand wanting to shift some of his power budget to be more spread out over time instead up upfront, but I cant for the life of me understand why you decided to put such ludicrously long delays on that damage. His E aftershock having a 1.25s delay is a long time considering its on one of the skinniest skill shots in the game. His ult having a 2s delay in a meta that sees almost every champion with over 400 movespeed is just ridiculous. Is there any other champion that has to wait such insanely long times to do their damage AFTER using their ability on their opponent?\n\nIn a straight up 1v1, Viktor is likely only going to reliably land the initial damage on his E, the initial damage on his ult, and his Q. If his opponent doesn't have flash then maybe he can get one tick from his ult.\n\nThe thing that really kills me is that you could have just as easily given shorter delays on his E/ult, but you simply chose not to. I would absolutely LOVE to see a comprehensive post about WHY his ult damage tick is on a 2 second timer instead of 1 second, and his aftershock is on a 1.25s timer.\n\nRylais is going to be a core item on Viktor now, likely rushed first or second, and it provides him absolutely NO sustain what so ever, which is a pretty big deal considering his E costs 110 mana at rank 5.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2016-05-03T23:06:21.246+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Viktor was *always* sleeper OP.

Especially during the rise of the mobility meta.\n\nThese changes clutter up Viktor's liquidistic motions for no good reason. I've played Vik since his release (nearly). I welcome change. But lowering his teamfight potential to... increase his teamfight potential?\n\nViktor's potential damage was never the problem.

I don't think these changes fix the underlying problems with Teemo, in order to do that I believe we would need to do much larger scope changes. \n\n“Hey guys, are you really, really sure that these Teemo buffs are going to be a good idea? I mean, he's already pretty close to balanced”\n\nTeemo has been out of the meta for a while now and currently has a low average winrate + experienced winrate, these aren't the only things we go off but they are decent indicators that point towards him being slightly too weak. \n\n“none of the items he builds are getting nerfed (some he might build are even getting buffed!), and the major MR items are getting nerfed to shit in the very same patch.”\n\nThe midseason update will be a pretty disruptive patch that will be hard to accurately predict but will hopefully be ironed out in the next couple patches. I think the biggest change with items that will affect Teemo's performance will be the QSS changes, certain squishies could have trouble dealing with the R + E damage while conveniently dealing with the blind (QSS will still deal with blind) when they previously had an option. \n\n“It feels like with all these indirect changes the direct changes are going to put him over the top.”\n\nOverall the Q, and passive changes should feel like quality of life changes that will help the teemo player feel a little bit smoother on the rift. The R changes will most likely be the biggest buff on the changelist while still being fairly minor, they reduce the recharge time by a little over 10% and lower the mana cost. The mushrooms will still have plenty of counterplay options like red trinkets, pink wards and human sacrifices (just kidding… mostly). My hopes are these changes bring teemo up to a more level fighting ground and if they heavily miss their mark we would definitely take a second look. Like I mentioned at the beginning I don't think these changes fix some of the underlying problems and in his current form could cause higher frustration than most champions when he is “balanced” or slightly strong.\n\nCheers, \nI Am The IRS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brutusness","date":"2016-05-03T20:31:53.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can anyone inform me of how Swain feels now?

I think he's probably a little stronger in top lane than mid lane. His waveclearing is definitely stronger and his last hitting, while still not great, is certainly better. He's lost a lot of the bullying potential he had in the old Swain, but he's gained a much stronger late game (MOAR ult birds, higher ratios). He also synergizes pretty well with lockdown with the damage from his Q, and the flat damage amp on E makes it possible to focus on leveling other abilities with better incentives (Q -> W -> E imo). His zoning is cool now too, and he's capable of locking off areas of a fight now that Beatrice lasts for 4 seconds in a given zone.\n\nAll in all, I actually really enjoyed the rework once I got used to the power shift. That will probably be the biggest pain point for Swain players - understanding that his lane bullying is just straight up worse, but he's received more ability to waveclear and more power later in the game in return.","replies":[{"poster":"Brutusness","date":"2016-05-03T22:01:26.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you're saying is, play safer and use the easier waveclear to rack up cash, and hold out until late-game to go full bird mode?","replies":[{"poster":"Cezium","date":"2016-05-03T22:31:37.475+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much.

Right now there is a lot of access to sustain- both systemically via masteries and itemization and in meta champion picks (Soraka, Janna), and turrets are not hugely tanky. That being said, Poke mages will still be able to find in 6.9 just like they were pre-6.9; they need to fill a specific niche in a team or used to counter specific champions (Azir) to be most successful. I feel like poke mages will be just as strong as they were before 6.9, and they might actually be getting a nice buff from some updated mage items like Tear, Morellonomicon, or RoA.","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2016-05-03T21:57:09.724+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"So basically, no improvements.  Maybe a better late-game at the cost of early nerfs (better damage from Archangel's in final builds, but far later Luden's).  On itemization, all of the poke mages will need Tear-Morello's for mana sustain equivalent to old Morello's, but that delays the powerspike from Luden's (which they also need).  RoA isn't bought on poke mages right now and it's getting nerfed, so that isn't happening.\n\nI mean, are you guys looking at this at all?  Poke mages are pretty bad right now (Xerath has a pathetic ~52% winrate at 125+ games played), and in the supposed \"mage update\" they received next to nothing outside of minor, personal buffs.  Their favorite items got nerfed or effectively removed, they still have no keystone....when are we going to see anything for this class?

I actually recently described it as the least enticing dragon that probably has the most potential/possibly the 'strongest'.\n\nThe thing about Baron is that he has a lot of defensive stats/reduces your damage dealt.  Turns out true damage doesn't care much about any of that (the value of the true damage is calculated pre-mitigation, so it is actually more than a 10/20/30% damage increase.  The speed at which you can simply burn down Baron is pretty surprising.\n\nI agree with your analysis of it being a lesser option when behind, although if you have 1-2 earth dragons, are behind, and happen to win a team fight, you can DEFINITELY rush down baron easier than before.

Like building his ult at regular intervals is almost pointless with the overall damage reduction. He went from being a fun and strong mid lane mage to one that essentially is either a good jungler, or a good top laner if you wanna get the most out of his main source of Damage due it the need to now build Hybrid over AP.","replies":[]}]}
