You have to think hard about what spells you use and in what order you cast them to be most effective.

I am assuming other players especially low elo ones have that problem too. So I noticed some people have been asking about a good tutorial from Riot. I was wondering that too lately, have you guys thought about taking a short break from all this huge content and focusing on a good tutorial for all players sometime in the future, tutorials on objective control and items etc, I would guess that would help the entire player base, all the different elos, in general alot.\n\nCheers to you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2016-07-12T21:07:15.654+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an interesting topic. \n\nOn one hand I like the idea that we could offer players some basic way to guide them if they want help, particularly with more of the arcane stuff like itemization, build order, runes, and masteries.\n\nOn the other hand I don't think most players want us telling them what to build and how to play, and there is a massive wealth of LoL guides out there to help players (although it can be a pain trying to delve into that mess and find a good guide, especially if you're not already familiar with the topic of the guide eg. only a good Kayle player will be able to recognize a good Kayle guide while a noob might not be able to tell the difference between the two).\n\nUltimately the decision of whether or not we create Riot supported guides for things like itemization, objective control etc is not up to our team (Playtest) but I like the thought behind your idea and think players could benefit from such a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-07-12T23:18:27.497+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what i think would be good is a few more tutorials or at least one when you unlock smite.

Riot isn't going to stop changing the game, one of the reasons it stays popular and fun for most of us is that it's almost a new game every two weeks, and once or twice a year it changes substantially. In order to make guides or tutorials they would have to assign a fairly large team to maintaining them with every  update. They are barely keeping up with updating the recommended item pages for each champion when something changes substantially. There are guides out there that are helpful, and as SoBE mentioned the good ones aren't always easy to find but you can always try more than one until you find something that works for you. There are also a lot of video's out there to help with basics. \n\nIn regard to the \"new\" AD items, I can give a quick rundown:\n\nitems that build off of Zeal: (All Zeal items increase attack speed, crit, and movement speed, the exact amounts vary by item)\n\n**RFC (Rapid Firecannon)**: This zeal item builds up a charge, when fully charged it increases your max attack range for a single attack, this attack also does bonus damage. RFC in my opinion is somewhat over rated. But there are times when that extra range can be exactly what you need.\n**Statikk Shiv**: This zeal item builds up a charge like RFC, but it doesn't affect your attack range. When Statikk Shiv reaches full charge it releases a burst of AOE damage. This AOE damage can crit, and does extra damage to minions. Shiv is the best zeal item for AD champs that need extra wave clear.\n**Runaan's Hurricane**: (ranged only!) Causes your auto attacks to also hit two additional targets for 25% of your base damage, effectively increasing your auto attack damage by 50%. This Zeal item is intended to provide maximum aoe damage during team fights, it is most effective on champions that have an \"on hit\" effect like Kog'maw with w active, Ashe with Ranger's focus active, kindred with... stacks, Jinx with rockets active, it will apply poison from Twitch and Teemo.\n**PD (Phantom Dancer)**: This is the \"dueling\" Zeal item, it provides the most benefit in 1v1 scenarios, it provides the least movement speed of all the zeal items except when close (550 range) to an enemy at which point it provides the most movement speed of all the zeal items, it also makes you take 15% less damage from the last person you auto attacked.\n\nBlood thirster still provides the most life steal.\nInfinity edge still provides increased crit damage.\nDeath's Dance provides 15% health back on physical damage, and converts 15% of incoming damage into damage over time. It's an interesting item but I only use it in certain cases.\nEssence Reaver is the main item to build for CDR and mana regen for AD champions, it gives crit, and requires building more crit to reach full potential, so it's mostly good on champions that are going to build IE (if you're going to build crit, might as well make the most of it) and at least one Zeal item.\nBlade of the Ruined King hasn't really changed much, it still helps against champions who stack a lot of health.\n\n\nThe newest AD item is Duskblade of Draktharr, it's intended for assassins, but it provides a good amount of AD and flat armor pen, I will often build it instead of a last whisper item against a team with no real tanks.\nYoumuu's Ghost blade also provides damage and flat armor pen, with 10% cdr and a nice attack speed and movement speed active with a fairly short cool down.\n\n\nBlack Cleaver is a good mix of offense and defense with stacking armor pen and 20% cdr, it's good if you want cdr on an AD champ but don't need crit. Or if you want a more defensive armor pen item.\n\nI didn't think about just how much there is to cover. There's also Maw of Malmortius, Mortal Reminder and Lord Dominik's Regards\n\nMaw provides some defense against being burst down by AP champions, plus AD and flat armor pen.\n\nLord Dominik's Regards (LDR) is the go to item to allow you to do damage to tanks.\nMortal Reminder builds off of Last Whisper and Executioner's Calling and is the item you want to counter insane life steal and healing (ie vlad/swain/soraka/aatrox)\n\nI haven't even covered Trinity Force, Iceborn Gauntlet, sterak's gage, Frozen mallet, Ravenous Hydra, Titanic Hydra... but I've spent way too much time on this already, good luck, have fun!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wobly","date":"2016-07-12T19:13:23.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What situations do you find yourself using the new Ryze ult in?
