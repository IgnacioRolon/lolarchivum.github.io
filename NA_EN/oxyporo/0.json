They want the game to be more like it was and less like it is, so their memory is making the game less fun for them.\n\nIt's still a fun game by itself, but there's six years of variety behind it that are sometimes too much for people to get over.","replies":[{"poster":"Demiqas","date":"2016-07-18T16:59:02.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"just no, now you are assuming things work the way you think they do. go ask why previous seasons were better and you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of reasons. you're just going to shrug them off and say \"lol no ur reasons are wrong ure just thinking it was better hehe xd\"?","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-07-18T17:26:41.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not assuming, I'm stating my opinion based on my own experiences.  I've played this game since season 1 and I've seen many friends come and go for a number of reasons.\n\nI haven't said that anyone is right or wrong, or that the game was or was not more fun in the past.  I didn't even say that I'm speaking for a majority here.  All I said is it's currently still a fun game, and many players don't think it's currently fun because of how it used to be.  Perhaps you should stop making assumptions and just take my words at face value.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"niuguh","date":"2016-07-18T16:51:59.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bigger issues? like what?
