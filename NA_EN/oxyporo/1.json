Opponent isnt playing for your fun, he is playing for his fun. You play for your fun. Some people have fun playing against slippery assassins, outplaying them gives great satisfaction (i myself personaly love Leblanc matchup when i play Morgana mid). Every champion in game is \"unfun to play against\" for some people. Rammus is unfun to play against when u are Yasuo, Riven or ADC or similar. Galio is unfun to play against when u are immobile mage. Teemo is unfun to play against when u are Nasus. Nasus is unfun to play against when u wanna snowball. Vayne is unfun to play against when u are juggernaut. Trundle is unfun to play against when you are tank. Riven is unfun to play against when u are Wukong. \nI agree, if you play something like Ziggs, sure Leblanc is unfun to play against. Same way Leblanc wont have fun if you play Kassadin... Every champion has counters, has ways to outplay it. Every champion has strengths thatyou have to learn and weaknesses that you need to exploit. Except Yorick. You know what happened when he walked into bar.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CppL","date":"2016-06-27T08:45:21.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her dmg is fine.They could fix her E hitbox.And remove the slow.i mean its already has a 1k range. its impossible to break the chain.Unless you have like 600 range dash.","replies":[{"poster":"OxyPoro","date":"2016-06-27T09:10:44.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CppL,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pPEakd0q,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-27T08:45:21.923+0000)\n>\n> Her dmg is fine.They could fix her E hitbox.And remove the slow.i mean its already has a 1k range. its impossible to break the chain.Unless you have like 600 range dash.\n\nI think her kit is toxic af. Everything from the double dash, to the stupid dash resets, to the stupid leash is incredibly frustrating to deal with, she does similar burst to Annie, but I don't see Annie being a slippery d*ck dashing and reseting around half the map while holding the potential to instantly decimate a team, it's just bad design and leads to toxic gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-27T09:19:23.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leblanc doesn't have any resets.","replies":[{"poster":"OxyPoro","date":"2016-06-27T09:36:41.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pPEakd0q,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-06-27T09:19:23.944+0000)\n>\n> Leblanc doesn&#x27;t have any resets.\n\nShe has a position reset attached to each of her dashpads.","replies":[{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2016-06-27T09:38:28.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OxyPoro,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pPEakd0q,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-27T09:36:41.553+0000)\n>\n> She has a position reset attached to each of her dashpads.\n\nWhich is one of her weaknesses, u know exactly where she will dash back","replies":[{"poster":"OxyPoro","date":"2016-06-27T10:26:38.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=alasarcher,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pPEakd0q,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-27T09:38:28.705+0000)\n>\n> Which is one of her weaknesses, u know exactly where she will dash back\n\nLol, 4 seconds is half an eternity in LoL and far too long to be considered a weakness, it would be a weakness if she only had 1 and had to use it withing a far shorter timeframe. Currently, she has all the time in the world to decide wether or not to use it and given how leblanc plays nowadays, she will most likely have not one but two pads out meaning you would literally have to have 3 hard cc champs all spreading out just to limit her juking potential, given how this is an assassin we're talking about I don't think I have to explain why that would be a very bad idea. \n\nAlso she gets all the cdr she needs now without having to sacrifice anything thanks to MYMU, meaning she gets more mobile earlier than ever and thanks to the new masteries she's bursting harder than ever and doesn't fall of at all.\n\nShe needs to be adjusted.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"B00B00","date":"2016-06-27T08:36:55.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not defending LB, i do think she's extremely easy to play, difficult to master like Zed as fast, efficient use of her distortion is very difficult (like zeds shadow) and the sheer amount those two can actually ''do'' makes them have a very high skill-cieling.\n\nhowever thats not what i replied to discuss, do you know how here ''one shot'' mechanic works? i only ask, as this helps play against her.","replies":[]}]}
