You should be able to launch the client in '**low spec mode**' which should reduce your computer resources used significantly.  Additionally, if you are having trouble in-game, you can turn on the '**close the client in game**' toggle in settings.  This will close the league client UX process during the game completely.  \n\nAfter the game ends, it will re-initialize back to the end of game screen and pick up where you left off :)\n\nLet me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-13T19:48:32.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it actually possible to have the client relaunch after the nexus gets destroyed, instead of upon clicking \"ok\"?\n\nThe relaunch is so slow and is the only thing I'm hating in the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2017-04-17T20:01:48.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kei143,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=axJgacml,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-04-13T19:48:32.354+0000)\n>\n> Is it actually possible to have the client relaunch after the nexus gets destroyed, instead of upon clicking &quot;ok&quot;?\n> \n> The relaunch is so slow and is the only thing I&#x27;m hating in the new client.\n\nSo if you uncheck \"close the client in game\" it should launch quickly after game ends.  If this isn't something you want to do, there's unfortunately a small trade-off that requires the client to wait until game is closed before it launches.\n\nIt's technically doing its prep work as soon as game ends, but won't show itself until you click OK to avoid soaking up CPU on closing the game client.  We've been working on a smoother way to handle this, but it's not quite there yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-18T18:14:38.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya, but if I uncheck the \"close client in game\", then the clients starts to eat into my resource after 3-4 games and I start getting FPS / lag issues.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HEISEN8ERG","date":"2017-04-19T09:03:53.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please Rito give us a way to disable the animations and give us an actual hours, min, second first win timer, not the bs hour timer or you have to play a match to know the exact time.

If that doesnt work then play on legacy until the next few patches slowly improves these issue. Be patient. Things like this take time.

Being as you are in software engineering, you could try to find what is causing these issues and maybe help to improve on it if you find anything.  \n\nJust to make sure, do you have low spec on as well as the client closing when you get in a game and are your background programs taking up space as well as the background cosmetics most operators have.\n\nI will not apologize for stating what I said.
