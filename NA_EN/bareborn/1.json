But after every game my pc restarts, but not a full restart...it's weird. It blacks out my screen and I have to manually restart my machine.

As your first step, if you recently updated Windows 10, disable the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been known to cause freezing for some players.\n\nSecondly, third party programs that interact with league can cause problems like this.  If you have any like play.tv running, disable them.\n\nFinally, black screens usually indicate a network issue having trouble maintaining a conenction to the server and downloading assets.  If the above steps fail, go through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up.\n\nThat's a few options that will get you squared away!","replies":[]}]}
