This is the first time this has ever happened.  I just updated my video card so that might have caused it.  But when it minimizes, it goes straight to another application on my other monitor.  It's as if those other clients (chrome, sound mixer, etc.) have priority when I plug or unplug the battery.  \r\n\r\nYeaaaah, help please :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T16:38:21.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not familiar with this issue, so I can't say for sure if it's a power setting problem, OS settings, or with your new graphics card.  As a first step to help rule out possibilities, make sure that your graphics drivers are updated.
