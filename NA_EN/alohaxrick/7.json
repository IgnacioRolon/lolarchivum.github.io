I'll try to explain it in English. \n1) Go to your desktop and right click on the LoL pictogram. \n2) Fix compability problems (not sure how to translate this properly).\n3) Use recommended settings.\n4) Test program.\n\nSince the Windows update I have to start LoL every time this way. The theory behind this, according to someone else, is that it runs LoL through a Windows 7 version.","replies":[{"poster":"Alohaxrick","date":"2016-09-25T22:04:26.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have Windows 10, does that method still work?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T23:56:56.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alohaxrick,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=achtF8P7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-25T22:04:26.323+0000)\n>\n> I have Windows 10, does that method still work?\n\nThere are 2 features inside Windows 10 that may be causing issues. The first is the windows game bar, which recently had a feature enabled called *Game DVR*. I recommend [disabling the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if this fixes the issue. If it doesn't I suggest [disabling the SmartScreen filter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/930168) that has been causing similar issues for some Windows 8 - 10 players as of recent.\n\nLet me know if either of those worked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dadron3","date":"2016-09-25T16:47:23.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please confirm if your symptoms are similar \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ewAGq5Xv-game-is-taking-up-1-2-mbps-dedicated-yet-running-very-slowly-freezing-disconnecting-glitching\n\nTried running it in compatibility mode as admin as suggested by \"I CRY RIVERS\" (windows 7)  no changes..","replies":[]}]}
