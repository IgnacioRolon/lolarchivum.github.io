I get into game, everything is working fine and alright..but then, sometimes when I hit the 30-40 minute mark, the sound in my game gets cut off. For example: \"You have----slain and enemy.\" After that, my FPS drops to 01-10. I don't know what I'd happening. I know I have a LOT of problems with my game. Haha. Thanks for anyone who helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T18:53:02.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be happening for a few reasons like outdated drivers, but also the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been known to cause sound and freeze issues.  As a first step, I recommend  disabling that if you are on Windows 10.  Otherwise, I recommend going over the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to tune things up.
