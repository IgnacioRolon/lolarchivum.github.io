I feel like i play so well, get fed in lane and EVERY FUCKING GAME I lose because of autistic inbred mongoloid retarded asshat morons.I don&#039;t understand how winning games comes down to personal skill. I can go 600/0 in lane, but I still lose because my team ignores ALL pings and chat messages and thinks they can fucking solo the fucking enemy team. \r\n\r\nWhat more can I do? I&#039;m on a 15 game loss streak because of people who just kill themselves. How do people get diamond in a game where yoou are SO reliant on retards like this. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has some insight on how to win games that im missing, please share. Because ive been playing since 2010 and league has never been this terrible before. At least in season 3 and 4 you could actually win games you were ahead in. But no, now it feels like the enemy laner does the same damage as you even though you are 5/0 up on them.\r\n\r\nDo i need to contact high level players to get carried? Do I need to buy coaching sessions from challenger players to win games? I cant figure it out.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-08T22:19:04.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wait for season 7 and hope riot reverts the exp changes that let total noobs start in Silver I","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2016-10-08T22:14:08.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try not calling players, retards.
