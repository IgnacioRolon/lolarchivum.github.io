We usually get together on the Friday-Sunday and play all day throughout the entire day. We are looking for an ADC or support (i can do either and wont mind which one you pick). Obviously we will sometimes play stuff like one for all and even a few Arams are alright every now and then (but dont coun't on us playing it all the time). We do play for fun mostly, but sometimes we do go \"tryhard\" into ranked, but for the most part we are just fun and sometimes a bit salty, but we dont let each other rage. With that being said we are looking for someone fun and laid back willing to join us (any and all ages are acceptable). \n\nP.S we are all 16 year old dudes going through Highschool, fair warning to any older members of the community.\nP.P.S We dont get weird around women\n*edit We do use skype and would prefer to add you there first, or you can post on this thread and tell me abit about yourself. I dont usually add people that just send me a friend request without saying anything","replies":[{"poster":"Deko The Gecko","date":"2016-05-08T00:37:49.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, currently LF an ADC/Supp for some fun normals, Skype would be nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deko The Gecko","date":"2016-05-08T00:30:50.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deko The Gecko","date":"2016-05-07T18:03:00.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"will be adding most of you and playing a game with each and seeing how it goes from there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"9tt2","date":"2016-05-07T16:53:58.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sup Main, not a smurf but add me if you at least want to try out a couple games.
