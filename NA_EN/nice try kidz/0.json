Anyone agree?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"For the third time ive been penalized because i left a game. I believe this time i left 2 games within a 2 week spam. This is outrageous how i have to wait 20 min before im in que, and if i miss my que i have to wait another 20min! You guys are treating this like were all kids and we all leave because of rage or frustration which is not the case. I recently have 2 newborns (twins) and sometimes i have to leave. I dont like it and i feel sorry for my team but i have a life that has unexpected things to come up. Sometimes im on call for work, and if i get that call i got to go in a rush. I feel like you guys have taken this to far and im seriously ready to uninstall this game. Im not putting another dollar into this game until this is resolved. This is not fair to people like me. Life happens. I understand maybe 5 min but 20min?!?! most nights all i have is 3 hours of free time and i dont wanna waste 20 min waiting. im paying consequences because im living my life. This is outrageous riot, someone please help me reduce this penalty or remove it. Im so frustrated with this.    Is anyone in the same boat as me?","replies":[]}
