My normal ping in League is around 47-50 stable, but yesterday night and today I've been getting ping spikes from 48 to 200+ and sometimes even jumps as high as 3000+ and gives me attempting to reconnect warning multiple times during game, making the game totally unplayable, I cannot even control my champion for more than 1 minute.\r\n\r\nAt first I suspected it may be someone using my internet without my permission or someone in my family using it, but nope.\r\nThen I thought it could be the newest windows update I did right before I started getting these ping spikes... But I just went to Overwatch 1 or 2 minutes after finishing a League match with 500 ping and i got 34 stable ping, no lag whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do anymore...\r\n\r\nEDIT: and no I'm not downloading anything, not even background windows updates or anything. I checked the task manager and nothing is interfering...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T01:29:14.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice first steps in your edit, that helps to narrow down some of the possibilities. Since your internet is still working normally, there might actually be something blocking your connection from communicating with our servers very well. Grab your latest network logs from a game that had the ping spikes, and toss them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take a screenshot if you can, and post it here so that I can see what's going on!","replies":[{"poster":"MrBluePants","date":"2017-07-17T15:22:08.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sorry I left you hanging but I wasn't expecting such a quick reply and it was super late where I live so I went to sleep. XC\n\nI tried to play a custom game today a few minutes ago and it is still happening but anywhere else and in other games it's fine.\n\nI also used the Log Reader you told me to and these are the results from this custom game I played for a small amount of time:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zdFcqag.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wn6gmcr.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qwtXfVe.png\n\nEDIT: Windows Update changed some things about Windows Defender and Firewall but I checked and the Firewall isn't blocking connection to League or any of my games. I'm gonna try to reinstall League now since repair did nothing for me yesterday.\n\nAlso used the Log Reader on some logs from yesterday and it was ridiculous...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f0y8Uo0.png\n\nEDIT 2: other games still working fine with stable 36 ping on Overwatch... no problems watching youtube videos either. It's only on League that i'm having this problem. \n\nEDIT 3: game installed and reinstalled 2 times, last time in the default path and the problem still persists... other games still working fine with no lags. i even tried and hextech repair tool and even that didn't fix it.\n\nNow I really don't know what else I can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T20:33:01.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh so that packet loss might be the root of all your troubles. Essentially, it just means your connection is only having problems when its coming to our servers (which we kind of already knew =\\). Sometimes we can tweak a few things in your pc to make things smoother, but often it lies on your ISP's side. Reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with those logs for some more troubleshooting!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MK UItra","date":"2017-07-17T02:21:01.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am experiencing the same issue and using the log upload provided completely inaccurate results compared to what was experienced in game.  As soon as I disconnected from the game my ping instantly went to normal and my network speed stabilized.  As soon as I started experiencing the issue I started a ping to 8.8.8.8 and my ingame ping both exceeded 1500ms.\n\nAre there other tools/actions I can take besides calling Verizon and upgrading my router....","replies":[]}]}
