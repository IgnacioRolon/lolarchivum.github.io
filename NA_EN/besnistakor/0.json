Also downloaded a new install for good measure )\r\n* Tried repairing from client.\r\n* hextech tool ( fails with a \"don't send\" error )\r\n\r\nLoL is allowed trough my firewall and AV.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can chip in with any ideas It'd be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-28T15:52:44.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grats on your new rig!  Since you have a new setup, you'll want to make sure your OS and drivers are current,, which our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide can help with.\n\nSpecifically with your error code, that's usually caused by security settings blocking your game files from being read properly.  Looking through your firewall and AV settings are a solid step, but I also recommend going over each step of our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to troubleshoot.
