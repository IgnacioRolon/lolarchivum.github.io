His peel is very strong when used by players who can coordinate and know what they're doing.\n\nBut I remember a point where he was never really even touched in LCS games, nor was he ever given any noticeably strong buffs. So why he started to have an impact that he had before the nerfs is beyond me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-20T03:52:26.029+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The most iconic part of his kit provides easy access to untargetability for champions that were never intended to have it.

Nerf the Q, put some offensive power on the W, and something for his E and small early game ultimate buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Damoklese","date":"2019-08-20T08:09:06.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Id like to see a rework on him personally.  Though I completely understand why hardcore Tahm players would hate that.  \n\nPersonally I love him from a conceptual point of view.  He has an entertaining aesthetic, and I love extremely durable champs that have annoying ways to poke, and ruin the enemy team's plans.  Plus any champ that can walk away from a 1v2 gank, possibly even with a kill, is aces in my book.\n\nMy complaints though are that in team fights he lacks impact.  His ult is useful about 1/10th of the time.. and the rest of the time is a liability if you even attempt to use it.  I also find his devour to be a little finicky with its targeting.    Personally id love it if most of his kit stayed the same.. but they made his devour a little more \"restricted\" (I.E. you cant devour teammates anymore, and when devouring, it prioritizes eligible enemy champions over creeps), and give him an ult that can be more impactful in team fights.   Possibly something that boosts his team, or debuffs the enemy team, so that he can be a bruiser top lane, or a support bottom.","replies":[]}]}
