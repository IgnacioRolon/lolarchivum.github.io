The permanent chatbanns\n\nI have a contention with the permanent chatbanns. It was tried in NA for a while, with the rusults being that people \"started to find other ways to harras people, i.e. intentionally feeding, afk\".\nThere are a two of problems, which i will list here. \na. recognition of offences\nb. full chatbann\n\na. Recognition of offences\n\nThis is a huge issue with the system, there is no way to definitly say that someone is intentionally feeding, as one doesn't want to bann just straight up bad players, it is a lot easier have a bot looking through the different chatlogs and getting hits on the words used. \nBecause of this people who flame get banned faster than people who intentionally feed. \nAs this is the case, people who have been in the situation of having a permanent chatban might as well be people who intentionally feed or go afk, which is harder to detect. So there are 3 groups which can be sperated. Players who 1. Flame 2. Int and go afk 3. do both.\nThe permanent chatbann won't lead flamers to become inters, they were beforehand and weren't recognized as such, because the system recognizes inting to slowly.\nSo the results that riot attained aren't showing that flamers evolve, it just shows that there is a portion of players who are flamers and inters at the same time. \n\nb. The full chatbann\n\nThe chatbann, as it is, still shows the chat, which used to be necessary for communication and you even can type a few messages each game. As before all the different pings were implemented into the game it was needed for people to actually participate. \nThese days though, we can pretty much communicate every cooldown, where we want to go and what to do, without typing anything. The pingsystem was a great introduction and leaves the possiblity for Riot to actually cut someone off of the chat fully. One could either show the chat, without being able to interact or just cut it off fully for players who have a permanent chatbann. \nAnother upside is that these accounts will be monitored quite closely and if they intentionally feed they will be found out far faster than normally. \nThere is also the sulution of just being able to mute yourself for others, so you can type out what every you want, without others reading it. This would let people vent without having the person on the other end feel bad about it and it's shown that having a vent, letting out emotions is better than conceiling them. \n\n\n2. The apathy of players \n\nPeople who come back to league of legends after having their main account permanently banned will most likely feel a lot less interest in being a rolemodel and will start to be a lot more toxic. How often have i met people who just \"brought an account\" or \"created a new one and don't care because their main was banned\", which leads them to start inting if behind and just not caring about other people who try to climb their way up. \nThis is especially bad for people who are climbing and get mad at these people and start flaming, who then in turn get banned and become the same kind of person. \nBoth my 14 day suspension and permanent bann were due to people inting in my games and me in turn flaming them. (the 14 day suspention was justified, the permanent one not so much, though as it was in quick succession and as i'm from euw no way to appeal.)\n\n\n3. People who are invested\n\nThere are a lot of people who are extremely invested in this game, they sink their time into it, try and climb and get better, only to be trolled or inted at certain points. There is a reason why there are a lot of toxic people in higher elos, as they play more than the average player. The average player, playing around 5-10 games a week will be mostly mildly annoyed by someone flaming or inting and just brush it off. \nPeople who play this game for 6-10 games straight will become increasingly more vulnerable to such behavior. They start to get mad at the people and can't remain cool about it as easily. \nThis leads them to start flaming, and sometimes inting. I don't agree with inting in any way shape or form, but people who become mad because someone is once again inting them for the 5th game in a row are somewhat close to home for me. \nThem then getting banned for flaming lets them become apathetic to other people who play this game, which leads to the cycle of the apathy of players. \nThis is a huge problem, which could be solved either by being able to detect inting people more frequently, or giving people different options than a permanent bann. I agree that some people just want to ruin the game for others (like interes and so forth) and those do deserve an IP bann in my honest opinion, but flaming is something that can be handled in a very different way. \n\n\nMaybe i am biased in this whole thing, as i too have been banned, but there are so many issues which aren't accounted for, the way banns are handled leaves people in a much worse state, as they have nothing to lose and will start to be the reason for others to become what they hated.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-06-07T16:53:17.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">The permanent chatbann won't lead flamers to become inters, they were beforehand and weren't recognized as such, because the system recognizes inting to slowly.\n\nThere **was** no [edit: automated] system for intentional feeding back then.

In other cases they decided to feed or play against their own team in order to \"prove a point\". \nBut what I find most interesting is that of the players we chat restricted last week (and there were a lot!)we only had to place manual suspensions on less than .05% of the players. By and large, the vast majority of players had no problem adjusting their behavior in game with limited chat.\"\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000\n\nIt really breaks down into two categories.\n\n1.) Helping players reform\n2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n\nWe used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely.\n\nWe were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n\nWe also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n\nThe sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n\n\nAs i can remember people who had the huge chatrestrictions back then inted to get more restirctions, making it a game to see how many one could accumilate, which waters down the numbers of people who's behavior actually got better.\nNow we do also not have the numbers on these cases, but as the suggested in the first link, it seems that people 0.05% of people acted toxic when being chatrestricted, as they don't have the means to do so. \n\nNow if the bann would shift to an indefinite chatbann, people wouldn't have the insentive to look who can get the most restricted games.\nAnother thing that is faulty with this reasoning is, that they didn't take into account that players who were in the 'large restriction' already had permanently banned accounts, therefore having no reason to behave better. \n\nAs my biggest contention is the cycle of creating new accounts and becoming more and more apathetic, whilst also increasing the number of people becoming like them, this setting/experiment wasn't conducted in a to me satisfying mannor. \n\nNevertheless i must apologize, i hadn't read the second link upun till researching for further sources.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-06-07T21:34:07.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of that backs up what you say. In fact, none of those quotes actually talk about their methods.\nAnd both quotes actually feature phrasing that suggests that the decision to intentionally feed came after the chat restriction.\n\nIf you want to argue that the setting/experiment wasn't conducted properly… but you are still basing this opinion on how you **assume** the experiment was conducted. And it seems you are basing your assumption of how the experiment was conducted based on your idea of what the results should have shown.\n\nThis is confirmation bias with extra steps. You claim to dismiss the experiment based on the methods, but you assume which methods were used based on the results. That means in effect you are simply dismissing the experiment because its results don't confirm what you believe to be true.\n\nYou are even going as far as inventing theories that do not make any sense. Why would people even believe that inting would make yield additional chat restrictions?\n\nSo again, I kindly ask you: Back up your claims with sources.

Not the playing bad and losing, but purely intentional. Also i've had a lot of those people, i believe i was in the promo to plat 1 13 times before i got it in season 6. Mostly due to afks and trolls. \nAlso you may not have heard of it but there are things like inting lists in higher elo, people you don't like and just play sightly worse with so that you lose whilst it's not detectable. \nI don't have as much issue with bad players, more like you said with delusional ones. People who start flaming when they are losing the game alone, or can't take fault. \nBUT and now a big but, it isn't juse beacuse of my bann that i'm writing this, i believe there are other ways to get this community to a state that these sort of behaviours aren't as normal. \nThe problem with not being able to mute yourself, the permanent chatbann, NOT being tried fully, and the cyclic nature of people becoming toxic and creating more toxic people are here and could be worked on. \nIP-banning people would be the right choice in my mind and then giving them banns that take a year or something like that to expire. \nThis whole nonsense about Permanently banning an account will just lead people to become apathetic to the players and the game itself.\n\nOh and on the point of reason for playing part:\nSaying that it's not an investment is not true at all, people GAIN ranks, which is the outcome of the time they invested. Others want enjoyment, a leisure activity, which are 2 different worlds. \nEquivicating those 2 is really disingenuous. \nThough for the point i was making there, is that people who invest time to GAIN elo, makes them them vunerable once they lose elo. Toxicity, inting, being ignorant, all of these things build up a lot more. \n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-07T17:51:58.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number 1, nobody owes you an explanation or a reply.
