Making it unfun for the majority of the players trying to play.

And it's not like you can't queue up as a support yourself if it makes you salty waiting or you can go play a different game mode. The whole point of Team Builder was so you could BUILD your TEAM, so I think you missed its point. But whatever. Enjoy your new \"solo queue\" against 5 man teams with good coordination against you and the other 4 solos.

XD\n\nAnd sorry, but my queue times on the new champ select are practically instantaneous , so I still get fast games.  Got to love being a support main.

Normally? waiting on a support. New champion comes out? every other role is impossible to find. Oh and the matchmaking was just amazing, always getting placed with random Elos, which was commonly brought up here before lol. Now everyone misses it because something came out that's much better and more streamlined, with more ways to get you into game faster","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Socialist","date":"2016-01-15T06:36:29.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Have fun never playing League again then.","replies":[]}]}
