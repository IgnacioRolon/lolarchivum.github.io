The account was ranked and i ended up in the same league as it and now it always glitches out my profile showing two of me, one with my old accounts stats and another with my own. I have to refresh to see my real LP but even though I doubt it, I was wondering if anyone can help me out with this. Tried emailing support and they told me to report it as a bug and that doesn't help me at all.

When you said that you deleted your smurf account, did you submit a ticket for those following our official deletion guidelines?\n\nAlso, your description started to get confusing when you started talking about your other account.  Is your main problem that your Summoner Name doesn't show as updated on the client?  Or that your profile doesn't show your info properly.  When you go into your profile, what do you mean when you say there are two of me?\n\nI understand I'm asking for a lot of information, but this isn't something I normally hear of and am trying to wrap my head around what you are exactly seeing and what the problem specifically is so I can help.\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Adolf is Jewish","date":"2016-05-23T23:40:07.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I know i worded that awkwardly. Anyways, yes I did delete the account through support following all the guidelines and it was deleted on the 15th i think. But what happens is it basically shows duplicates of the summoner names to people who were friends with the deleted account but if they click on it it links to my current profile. But, since the account was at 41 LP in Silver 2, every time I go to my profile on the client it shows that I have 41 LP and I have to refresh it a couple times for it to show my real LP. Also when i click the leagues tab it shows two of the same name, one at 41 LP with my other accounts stats (wins/LP) and another with my new one. I hope that makes a bit more sense. Thanks and I appreciate any help I can get, as this annoys me so much.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-25T00:16:12.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it definitely sounds like a limitation of the client when it comes to how we handle deletions.  To be perfectly honest, with the League Client Update coming currently/later this year, this is probably not going to be resolved before that.  I wish I had better news, given how damnably annoying this seems to be :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}
