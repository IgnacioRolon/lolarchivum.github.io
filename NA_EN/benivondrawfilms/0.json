There was no problem until the screen (the picture ) said: The client update has begun! this update went very fast but after that i came into the login-screen and at the left side of the top also was an update and already yesterday i tried to update it aswell, but it took to long. However today i also tried to update it but there stood: ETA 219 mins. So now i want to know if there is any way to skip the long Download? (i also already triedto open the riot games folder, click at lEague of legends and try to do the same thing as an Administrator but it also doesn't work!{{champion:32}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-21T16:42:10.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your client is trying to update to the new version, but something might be blocking that from happening.
