If the ADC was busy focusing on enemy champs and your top laner did the most damage to structures then they deserve credit for it.

I think it's more representative of how much tanks and shield heavy champions actually contribute, because I've had games as Taric (pre rework) against very AD heavy teams where I take almost full aggro in late game fights and take borderline laughable damage because I just had so many resistances, and in the post game 3 teammates took more damage than me because I simply reduced so much damage instead of actually taking it. \n\nThis would also benefit supports like Sona and Janna who aren't healing focused and instead rely on mitigating damage with shields more so than healing actual wounds (though Janna and Sona can both heal decent amounts. Would probably be better for say, Thresh or Blitzcrank who don't have actual heals). And since it wouldn't just be something like \"Shields applied to allies\" it would only count the damage that the shield would absorb, meaning that timing shields to block heavy instances of damage contributes a lot while just shielding allies at random wouldn't really do anything, this way it would accurately show how much damage you kept yourself and allies from taking since a shield that blocks nothing at all isn't really helping anybody (The exception being Black Shield stopping CC from abilities that deal physical damage, but CC is not damage, I have no idea how to properly credit that one).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surr20plz","date":"2016-10-05T07:20:59.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This ^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2016-10-06T03:06:38.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, both as a base concept and especially with the LoL community;\n\nAll our stats and the like just shouldn't be available for others to see at all.\n\nNobody else should be able to check your match history, only you should be able to check how much damage you did after the match, etc. etc. etc.\n\nOur stats and information should be private.\n\nAs for the towers, being that it's an objective of the match, it really isn't necessary to specify who toppled it, just say it went down.","replies":[{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2016-10-06T07:08:52.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"North korea and trump agree with you. \n\nThough from a competitive point of view that is just silly, having damage numbers but not being able to compare it to other people in the same game or even a different game would make it hard to see where your strengths and weaknesses are on a given champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2016-10-07T19:06:11.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What should be provided is averages and/or normal values.
