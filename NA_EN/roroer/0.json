{"poster":"roroer","date":"2014-07-23T21:20:40.735+0000","title":"Topic of \"Old School Mages\" from Statikk's thread and thoughts on how to fix them","subforum":"Live Gameplay Balance","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hello there fellow summoners! Since I never got to post this in the Statikk Thread (I didn't get to it before it ended), I decided to post it here since this is the only other place I know that discusses it. I have thought of some ways to fix this problem of \"mobility over AoE\" in the mid lane meta discussed in Statikk's thread on balance, and think some might make it so that AoE teamfight mages like {{champion:1}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:112}} and {{champion:101}}  have a chance in the meta where it is all based around who can get to dragon the quickest or gank bot lane the most times.\n\n1. **Have an alternate form of a defensive mage item for mid laners**. Currently, the only defensive items on APs are Banshee's Veil{{item:3102}} , and Zhonya's Hourglass{{item:3157}} . Both are good, but no mage rushes Banshee's in mid lane, and Zhonya's is an item used as more of a self peel from AD assassins diving onto you before you can use your combos. So to fix this, there could be an item that is a Mercurial  Scimitar{{item:3139}}  for mages, but instead of a simple cleanse + movement speed, it could make it so you are immune to CC for a short duration (1.5 seconds or so), BUT only allowing you to cast abilities (so no auto attacking), so marksmen won't pick it up and become even bigger of a threat. This would allow champions with combos such as Brand{{champion:63}}  or Malzahar{{champion:90}}  to get their combo off since they don't have a support to guard them 24/7 like marksmans. They need some personal defensive items while they get their damage off, and something like this would be a great way to make them able to contribute to fights before getting killed. How it is now though is if someone does pick a champion like this, they are instantly focused out of fights in a matter of seconds with no chance of survival other than Zhonya's, which doesn't allow them to use their combos. It could also give some mana regen, which would fix another problem that these mages have currently, which is a severe mana problem. This item could possibly build out of Chalice{{item:3028}}   & Quick Silver Sash{{item:3140}}.\n\n2. **Buffing Banner of Command{{item:3060}}  to make it a more viable item.** This item, if balanced around a more current mid lane item, could make it so that \"old school mages\" could cause mobile mid laners like Yasuo{{champion:157}}   or Ahri{{champion:103}}  to be punished for being mobile around the map by pressuring their lane hard. Currently this item just doesn't work at all in the meta, but if it were reworked, I feel like this item that is based around buffing your minions to allow sieges to be easier could be very good, even in late game for those final pushes onto the nexus  turrets. I don't know exactly how to change it, but something maybe like increasing nearby minion's armor/ attack speed while giving mana regen and ap/ slight cdr (unlike now where it's just 20% cdr + 80 ap). Or possibly even having a new active where it gives nearby minions truesight, allowing old school mages to defend themselves better from stealth champions like Rengar{{champion:107}}   or Evelynn{{champion:28}} . This is just a thought for the remake, and you can have a completely different idea for this item, but currently this item has a good concept, but not good execution.\n\n3. **Make Cleanse{{summoner:1}}  more viable**. I haven't seen this summoner spell used in a long time, and I really enjoy its idea, but heal just outclasses it in every way (MS + total mitigation of the damage). If you were to make it so that it would  give movement speed like heal, I think this spell would be a lot more viable to pick up. Another possible change would be removing the Initial CC clear on it, and making it just 1 second of CC immunity. This would make using it take much more skill, and could be used as a preemptive summoner spell used right before a champion uses a combo/ channeled ability like {{champion:90}} ultimate. This would also make some marksmen that also have a \"combo\" like Miss Fortune{{champion:21}}  or Graves{{champion:104}}  more viable aswell. This would also make for more diverse picking in summoner spells among heroes instead of champions having the exact 2 summoner spells every game (currently {{summoner:4}} + {{summoner:7}} on every carry). This would add a different playstyle based on your summoner spells, where {{summoner:7}} is a much more defensive summoner spell, while {{summoner:1}} would offer a slightly more aggressive play style but still acting as a defensive tool, and take some skill on timing to use but be much more useful if used in the right situations. The reason Cleanse isn't picked currently is due to it only removing CC on you. You still take the damage, and you have to be CC'd before you can use it, meaning you still got stopped temporarily. Yes, it does have the 65% tenacity, but you still are getting CC'd in it, meaning you still got slowed down in your attempt to escape, or your channeled ability is still interrupted. While {{summoner:7}} just makes it so that if you do get stunned, all the damage you take is completely mitigated in lane, and you just run away with your increased movement speed and avoid the rest of their damage. Right now Carries just have 2 get out of jail free cards. BUT if the change where {{summoner:1}} would prevent CC happening to you for 1 second, but not remove CC on you were to happen, timing of this skill would be crucial, and could get you out of situations where even the slightest stop in your movement means instant death. It would also double as an offensive skill, where you can pop it right as the enemy team shoots off their CC to pull back from the engage your team is about to make. With this change there would also be plenty of counterplay. Since the Initial CC removal from it would be gone, if someone with cleanse were to get CC'd by surprise, they wouldn't be able to get out of it, and could just get CC chained until they are dead. So now you may be wondering \"how does this affect the old school mages\"? Currently, the reason these mages don't work is because they aren't mobile enough to not get caught or to roam into other lanes like more popular mages, but the new cleanse would help them deal with the problem of their lack of mobility, and make it so 1 stun doesn't mean the end for you. I know this change  might be a bit too powerful, but without ever trying it, you won't know if it is truly game breaking or not. If Riot thinks this idea is a little too farfetched and gamebreaking, then atleast give {{summoner:1}}  the movement speed {{summoner:7}}  does.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and hope any of this helps :)\n\nEDIT: If 1. were to be added, these are some thoughts on making it a balanced item and not completely game changing.\n- Make it share a cooldown with {{item:3157}} so people wouldn't just stack these two to be almost invulnerable.If this were not implemented, then make it have a long cooldown so using this would be a big deal, and not just something you use every single fight (120-180 ish). \n-  Make the final piece of it have a large cost, so people would have to think about whether to farm up one of these or to play it safe and go for a more defensive {{item:3157}} .","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-07-24T12:28:58.141+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:55}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:34}}  and {{champion:84}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:105}} :  \n\"Let's talk more about that first idea of yours...\"\n\nSeriously, item based CC immunity is a bad idea for ADs already...and now you suggest it for APs, too?

The only thing they need is proper initiation...so maybe \"buffs\" should focus on making (hard)initiation more accessible, as it is really limited to very few champions like J4 and Malph currently - maybe even removing the crucible (and the goddamn blackshield - any designer please just rewatch the alliance vs fnatic match from yesterday to see how the shield alone nullified every attempt from fnatic to start a fight on their terms completely, winning the game for alliance all by it´s own) from the game again, as it really is a way bigger boon for mobile-champs as it is for immobile ones...if your initiation get´s counter with a mobile team it´s no biggy, you´ll just try again to flank 10sec later. With an immobile team you might never get in such a good position again. Also, if you release someone like ez from a cc he can step away and will be save - while removing cc from malzahar still leaves him on the same spot, and probably won´t save him.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-07-25T16:53:50.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree, a buff to hard initiation and most of all cc-heavy frontlines(tankjunglers...) would already help alot, as those mages would then have someon else to peel for them and the cc would help them alot to land their combos\n\nmaybe with the uprise of mao and gragas top we can also see more play from midrange mages","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sYe21ajYHk","date":"2014-07-25T23:18:44.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gonna have to disagree with you.  It's possible to pull off, it just requires careful balancing.  Let's say you want to make some kind of CC immunity item.\n\n**Example CC Item**\n-No stats\n-Unique Active: Makes your champion immune to CC effects for 1.5 seconds. (60 second cooldown)\n-2000g\n\nActive effects can be prices extremely high and offer little stats to balance out their strength.  This item wouldn't be purchased by all that many champions because they can't afford to spend 2000g and come up with no stats to show for it.  Sure, you'll be able to stick on a target, but you'll be blown up INSTANTLY, and you won't deal that much damage to them.  This item would only really be purchased by champs who don't need any stats to do damage, don't care all that much about survivability, and need help sticking on another champion.\n\nNo effect is \"too broken\" or \"too powerful\" because we can always raise the costs and downsides associated with it.  This example is obviously extreme, but you can do the same thing with slightly more stats (200 HP or something random, etc.) or slightly lower costs.  Eventually there will be a tipping point where champs who really want it can afford to go for it, and other champs don't receive the needed benefits from it to bother.  Effects like CC immunity aren't strong on every champ, you'll see just how important it is to someone when you make it come at a steep price.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2014-07-24T00:21:23.796+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am sorry CC immunity on any item is a horrible idea.\n\nMages already have {{item:3157}} to avoid plenty of CC with skillful usage, a mage with this item on top of that would be completely game breaking disables exist for a reason unstoppable champ ults like {{champion:30}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:161}}  {{champion:20}} would be hilariously OP. \n\nThe other changes, you can't give out CC immunity on anything you're gravely underestimating how powerful it is. Though {{summoner:1}}  does needs buffs or changes, CC immunity though isn't the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"roroer","date":"2014-07-24T01:09:25.273+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Notice how none of those champions are picked competitively on a regular basis. Why? due to their ultimates being able to be canceled with such ease. It wouldn't make them overpowered, it would make them actually viable picks. Most of those champions would have longer ultimates than the duration of said item, still allowing counterplay to them. Also, CC immunity doesn't mean invulnerability, they can still die. If this were also an item, it would obviously need to be a pricey pickup due to its very powerful active, and have a long enough cooldown to not make them unstoppable. \n\nCleanse on the other hand, I do agree if it were to just have 1 second of CC immunity it would be slightly overpowered, but I also said that even just giving it the movement speed that heal currently has it would be much more viable.\n\nAlso, {{champion:30}}  ultimate is used half the time while in the safety of your base or while in his passive.

This would require more skill on the person trying to cancel it, but it wouldn't be impossible to land a stun in a 2 second window compared to a 3 second window. This item, on activation, would cancel channeled abilities, so you would have to use it at the beginning instead of right when you get CC'd\n\nAs for the Morgana/Kayle part, this would make for a combo that would be powerful, but in competitive you can pick around team comps like this by doing things like picking poke comps, pick comps or even split push comps. That would be the point of this item though, so that large teamfight comps with mages like {{champion:161}}  could actually have a scary teamfight, instead of teamfights being decided on whether or not {{champion:60}} stuns {{champion:161}} right as he ults. It would allow the old school AP mids to actually contribute to fights without getting blown of the face of the earth in a heartbeat.\n\nThe main idea behind an item like this is so that the \"Old School Mages\" ( {{champion:69}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:112}} etc) would actually have a role in the current meta. The only other options I have heard of was reworking {{item:3151}} & {{item:3116}} , which is also another way that would make these mages have a larger teamfight contribution.\n\nAlso, A support {{champion:9}}  would often not have enough ap to make this item a worthwhile pickup, along with a support {{champion:161}}.

Many problems have more than one way to solve, and I know this might not be the most effective way to solve this problem, but I was hoping to just spark some interesting questions with this.\n\nI had been playing other mobas and noticed that league didn't have any CC immunity except for {{champion:25}}  shield, while the others had it show up more often. This being one of the many reasons why she is so oftenly picked in any level of play, and think she wouldn't be such a threat if this CC immunity was in different areas other than the bot lane on one specific champion. Then after seeing the Statikk post I thought that maybe the immobile mages/carries aren't as effective in this game as they are in others is because they have no reliable peel through things not in their kit. This lead to me brainstorming of an item that would solve a problem they alone would have so that assassins wouldn't pick this item up and be even more powerful- Chalice, which would solve a lot of the mages mana problems, a dissarm so that carries wouldn't abuse it, and a reliable self peel / protection while they do their usually close to mid range combos/channels.\n\n\nOne last thing aswell, 1 second of CC immunity compared to {{champion:25}} Shield duration is close to nothing if it is not broken (i believe it is 5 seconds or so), and also it having a very minute cooldown compared to the item I had thought up or the cooldown of cleanse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-07-25T12:28:07.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's possible to buff midrange-mages with itemchanges or summoner changes, as there will always be anotherclass abuseing those items, pushing those midrange mages away.\nJust like what happend with the try of buffing ad-casters/assasins with an spellvamp/ad item.\n\nThose champions sadly have an outdated kit that doesn't work to well in the current enviroment cause of how the game developt\nThe lack the save range of ziggs,lux,xerath and other **long**ranged mages, the mobillity of mage/assasin hybrids like ahrie or lissandra and the survivabillity of supportive mages like orianna or lux(thx to their shields).\n\nThey rely on comboing skillshots or channle skills to deal their damage, and if they miss one spell the combo gets interupted and a huge loss of damage or cc comes with it(like brand not getting his 2sec stun, anivia not getting double damage for E).\nThey also have loose selfpeal and a rather low range for that, so the are incredible vulnerable if their combo fails.\nWith the current state of mobillity creep, those combos can be avoided rather easily, and it's even more easy to punish the midrange-mage afterwards.\nhowever, pure buffs like faster casts/skillshots, or more mobillity on those champs wpuld probably make them op, as theri damage and cc potential usually is insane.\n\nI think most of them need some smaller changes to their kit that make them less hard-countered by mobillity while reciving a small buff to there own mobillity, either bound to an abillity(e.g malzahars E granting ms if it affeckts an enemy champ), or simply more base ms, but they need to loose some damage and cc to compensate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWildflower","date":"2014-07-23T21:24:28.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cleanse gives 65% tenacity for 3 seconds after using it if you didn't know","replies":[{"poster":"roroer","date":"2014-07-23T21:26:59.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes I do know, but you can still be stunned with 65% tenacity, which could interupt channels like Malzahar ulti.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pharrøw","date":"2014-07-24T00:05:30.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think I've blabbed on the boards long enough about this, but I would love for a tweaked {{item:3170}}  to hit SR.\n\nIt'd bring a whole lot of old and immobile champs up to speed.\n\nLike, (and I'll add the somewhat mobile ones/mobile ones here, too...)\n\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:131}}{{champion:82}}  {{champion:60}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:161}} \n\nMy only fear is that the tweak aren't enough and that some champs will become OP with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2014-07-25T19:25:50.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with CC immunity... there doesnt need to be even more ways to counter Malzahars ultimate... the damn thing gets cancelled by almost any form of hard CC cast at the same time because it is so slow.
