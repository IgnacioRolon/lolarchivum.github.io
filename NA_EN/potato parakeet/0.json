Basically what happened is that I was talking to a Rioter and they told me I was toxic, and when I asked them what I said they gave me this: \"I'm STILL not getting any help\". That is why I got suspended? And in the comments, someone asked for the chat logs because they didn't believe me. So I'll leave the pastebin here of my chat logs. If anyone wants additional context or my side of the story, feel free to ask. I will say that the ezreal (in game 2, which was played before game 1) was the same as the zed (adc), who decided to troll because he lost to me in game 2. The entire team was telling him not to troll, but all he did was blame our support after literally inting. That's about as toxic as I got, I believe. Anyways, here's the pastebin: https://pastebin.com/8vX0ctrQ","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-02-28T23:51:51.860+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You tilted from champ select and spent all game flaming.
