To tell the players that it'll be fixed in a month (Nov 20th) and then to overdraw that date by TWO MONTHS already, plus probably more, AND not keeping us properly updated, is horrifying from a customer service standpoint. Lucky they have such loyal players, for most companies a faux pas like this would leave them losing big time. \n\nI myself have been waiting since October when I moved to transfer this account to NA and my main to EUW from there. That's 40â‚¬ in Riot's pockets on a whim from just one player, stemming from a basic service that requires little to no input from them on a daily basis. I would expect that to now either be discounted by like 90%, if not even free by the time they finally get it fixed. I've missed out on quests, projects, leveling and masteries relaunch, and ranked preseason on my main account now, because the ping is so bad that I can't play properly here, hence the smurf.\n\nI'm pretty saddened by how this whole thing was handled by Riot. I mean,  there have been glitches in the past that haven't been handled in the best manner, but this takes the cake in my eyes. \n\n{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dytoni","date":"2018-01-17T16:04:15.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope this rolls out soon - I've been waiting quite a long time. xD","replies":[]}]}
