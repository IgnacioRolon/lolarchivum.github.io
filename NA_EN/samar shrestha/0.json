If the money for the RP is refunded, it means the content is no longer paid for, so it it's then removed from the player's account. \n\nAs for the tech issues you're having, that's a bit out of my area of expertise. I'd [ask Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=34190). They have some good troubleshooting methods that can help narrow down why you're having these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Samar Shrestha","date":"2015-11-11T14:35:24.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oo I get it now.
