Thats lazy and uninspired.\nWe have plenty of gay champins, who are 100% fine. Taric, Ezreal, Vi, Cait. Cool ppl. And now we have this stupid lizard, with nothing but &quot;IM GAY&quot; personality. Some people will try to defend it, but im gonna ask you one question. Have you ever encountered some quote in league from, for example, garen, that he want to bang some chicks? This literally never happened. (It&#039;s fine with Evelynn cos she&#039;s a demon of lust tho). But now we have a lizard who shouts on every corner that she want to have some lesbian love. And thats fucking disgusting.","replies":[]}
