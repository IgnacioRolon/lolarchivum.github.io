One of the ways you actually get things to change is by taking steps to normalize things that some people choose to consider abnormal. You can never *get* to a place where a gay champion *isn&#x27;t* politicized without being willing to come out and say &quot;yep, this champion is gay, and it really is just part of who she is. It&#x27;s not a big deal.&quot; Without that, you make it so every gay character has to be coy and vague about it, and you can never just say &quot;yep, this is a part of the character.&quot;\n\nSo then it was a statement?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-26T18:34:13.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hi ìm groot,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=bXO6bO9L,comment-id=000c00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-26T18:32:53.703+0000)\n>\n> So then it was a statement?\n\nIt was a statement, yes.

Ezreal makes flirty comments at Lux, and Zoe makes flirty comments at Ezreal. Illaoi talks about how easily men break. Do those comments serve a purpose? Not really, save that they help to sell the character&#x27;s perspective on the world. The issue here, to me, is that it feels like this statement is coming from a point of &quot;straight is the normal,&quot; so anything that steps outside that needs to serve a purpose. I don&#x27;t think it does, any more than the fact that Zoe or Ezreal is straight needs to serve a purpose.\n\ni guess? i dunno, neeko just seems a bit off with those comments","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThreshHub","date":"2018-11-25T15:57:11.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"1st you did use terms they told you not to use.\n2nd I agree about neeko.
