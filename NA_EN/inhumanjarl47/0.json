It first occurred after the Star Guardian update to worlds 2017. I tried to look into it a bit more hoping it was an easy fix, but unable to find a perfect solution. It happens right after champ select into the loading screen. it causes my computer monitor to turn black for a few seconds then turns back on resulting into a blue screen shutting down my computer and restarting it. I have my computer up to date and everything is fine. It only occurs with league. I play other games to test it seeing if it was my graphics card, but it was clearly not the problem. I don't want to stop playing this game and seeing other people had the same problems in the past. I tried everything to fix it ,but not going to go to great lengths risking high damage to my computer. I would like to see if anyone else completely restored the issue and continuing to enjoy the game. Help please it would be grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"CamdenJaxx","date":"2017-12-04T01:14:09.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the exact same boat as you, @InhumanJarl47. Since the last update, I've experienced my computer shutting down directly after champ select, while the loading screen is running and everyone's at 0%.\n\nMy computer is beyond capable of handling League, which is MS Paint compared to some of the other games (and programs) I throw at it. My CPU temp never spikes, I've got 32GB of RAM readily available, and my graphics card handles it at a minimum of 60FPS (which usually hangs out around 100FPS). The only difference is I don't get a blue screen; straight to a black screen and then the computer just shuts down completely.\n\nI've tried what I've found in older threads: updating all drivers, lowering graphics, reinstalling League from the ground up, ensuring my tower isn't flooded with dust, etc.. None of these have helped in the least bit - League just does not like the loading screen, period. At this point, it's safe to conclude that there is something wrong with the client itself. We can't all be facing the same situation and being told it's our computer's fault when none of us has had any form of issues prior to the patch jobs.\n\nRiot needs to look into this and take it seriously, not simply disregarding this issue as a user error. I'm tired of being marked as a bot and/or harassed because the client is bugging out; anyone who's on my friends list can attest that I'm not a bot and, as I've stated, my computer is more than capable of handling League. I'm looking forward to a proper response from the support team on what's truly causing the issue instead of having the finger pointed at my computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEAMANSPRAYER","date":"2017-10-14T18:22:57.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you ever find out a solution? last time I sent in a ticket, the advice they gave me didn't work so I gave up on them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T04:07:36.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eeeeeeee blue screens are never a good sign.
