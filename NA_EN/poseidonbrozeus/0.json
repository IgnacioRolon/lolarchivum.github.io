So one day eve was banned so I played Master Yi. In the game I had 120cs, NO  turrents or wards destroyed, but got 2 triples and 1 double and an ace and in the end getting an S-. I don't know if Im just being paranoid or something, but I was just wandering if doubles, triples, exc. do any better for your grade.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-22T04:13:21.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's \"bona fide,\" by the way. As in, \"in good faith.\" \"Bonified\" is not only the incorrect spelling but also the incorrect pronunciation. Imagine if lots of people didn't know how to pronounce \"sushi\" so they pronounced it \"suh-shy,\" and then people who had never seen it written out heard this incorrect pronunciation and proceeded to spell it \"sushy.\"\n\nActually, there's a real-world example of this: the word \"maven.\" It comes from a Hebrew word meaning \"wise person\" and is pronounced more like \"meh-veen,\" but lazy transliteration led to it being spelled as \"mevin,\" followed by lazy pronunciation along the lines of \"mey-vin,\" which led to the currently-recognized spelling of \"maven.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-08-22T05:23:31.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes triple kill is worth more not in gold value its more directed towards the removal of enemies in a timely fashion and it gets one person ahead signifigently while just 3 kills is 3 separate  times they died NOT in a coordinated fashion so there towers will be well defended still. triple kill = lesser threats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuponya","date":"2019-08-22T04:48:16.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Triples would technically have more impact than 3 kills in terms of in-game influence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-08-22T04:06:23.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they do.  A good way to see how to improve your rating is to go into your league client stats.  This gives a breakdown of all the criteria they look for as well as how you compare to other people playing the same champion at the same rank.  This will give a good idea on what you need to work on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-08-22T04:05:26.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there are specific stamps that get put on your matches in op.gg if you have for example a triple or quadra kill.\n\nSo its not too far fetched to atleast assume that its being tracked in some way, but maybe not directly, could just be the website going (oh this person had a bunch of kills in a short amount of time) rather than league itself feeding them that specific information.","replies":[]}]}
