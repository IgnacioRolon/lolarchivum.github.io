I did so in a somewhat exaggerated and humorous format as is my typical personality, even in real life. The post got a fair amount of attention before it was removed by the boards mods, with a message saying to redirect it to the RANT section of the boards, stating all I was doing was complaining. Honestly, mods seem to be finding any excuse at all lately to crack down on posts that represent balance in a negative light. I was wondering, do any of you guys see this as unsuitable for the gameplay section or did the mods overreact?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ER182if.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bby4QFf.png\n","replies":[]}
