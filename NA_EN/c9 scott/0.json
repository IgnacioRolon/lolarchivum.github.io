I'd like to clarify that this is not a rant post, and I will keep my personal judgement about Riot's decisions to myself. Earlier today, I made a post discussing how I believe that the game is not fun to play anymore due to the current overload of high damage champions. When I returned hours later, I found that my post had been removed for \"not meeting the guidelines\" of the Gameplay sub-board. I do not understand why my post was removed. It was not offensive, did not use profanity, did not threaten anyone, and was related to the balance of the game, therefore relating to gameplay. Does anyone know why this post, in particular, was removed when there is another post at the top of Gameplay that is stating that Riot has a poor attitude towards feedback? I find this post an odd choice to remove.\r\nHere's the proof:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/zYUzoC3\r\nhttps://imgur.com/YLNGqvq","replies":[]}
