It sounds like something with your configuration messed up, so I suggest resetting it as your first step:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to re-do any bindings as a result.  Let me know if that helped!","replies":[]}]}
