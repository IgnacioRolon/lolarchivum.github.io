So we load into the game and start playing like normal. However after about 9 mins in my wifi just stopped working. So I restart the router and try to load back in. Finally the wifi comes on and I shutdown the client and game through task manager to restart them. Right before the game closes a message popped up, the only word i saw was \"future\" on the far right so I load the client again and it doesn't put me immediately put me back in the game. So i thought that my team must have surrendered but i check my match history and the game doesn't show. I even checked ranked (because I was in my promos) but the game had disappeared. So i don't know what happened but I was hoping for an answer. thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"IC Icarus","date":"2017-07-23T00:22:46.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T00:11:53.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh it looks like the game you're talking about w/ Soraka had some kind of weird hiccup server side and sort of crashed for everyone. No worries, nobody will be hit with any penalties at all for that game, and you should have been able to queue back up for another match just fine. Let me know if you're having problems queueing up or if you saw any penalties caused by that game.","replies":[]}]}
