I was playing arcade MF which has a distinct love tap SFX, I do not know if this was happening with her other skins. It did happen every game I faced a Cait, however.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T19:08:23.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Shaughtgun! \n\nThanks for the report!
