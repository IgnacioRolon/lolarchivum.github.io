We engaged in some &quot;friendly&quot; banter (was kinda over the top tbh) and some of us might have said offensive words. We jokingly reported him after the game so he gets a chat restriction, because we are friends like that lol. What surprised us after the game was that he actually got permabanned on his account. Now this wasn&#039;t the 10th time he had been suspended, it was actually the first time since season 4 where he got suspended for leaving too many games. \r\n\r\nWe feel really bad right now because he had played a ton of games on that account, and really does not deserve the ban since it was just friends talking shit to each other, which happens in all games. You can contact every single member of both teams to make sure that we knew him, which you guys probably have all the usernames in the game logs.

Google is a great starting point but should never be your ending point.\n\nEDIT:\nBigoted speech does include racial slurs and if you actually took the time to read through some of the posts and red comments, they included hate speech.\n\nRemember that Person X can be a bigot by talking about Person Y to Person Z while Person Y is not present. But that's not how you think. You're limited to the first google result that isn't even a complete definition. Thanks for chiming in but try again.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-02-12T19:42:41.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YerroFever,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7GAyQVIA,comment-id=001600000000,timestamp=2017-02-12T05:20:26.074+0000)\n>\n> If you actually look at the full definition of a bigot, it is one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) \n\nNope, fail.\n\nMerriam webster\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot\nIntolerance or unwilling to accept the behavior of others, as you do.\n\n\nDictionary.com\nstubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one's own\n\nShall we continue? your argument is trash and once again, the irony stands; That you display bigotry against a target you called bigoted.... heh","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-02-13T00:44:58.480+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dominick Destine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7GAyQVIA,comment-id=0016000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-12T19:42:41.471+0000)\n>\n> Nope, fail.\n> \n> Merriam webster\n> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot\n> Intolerance or unwilling to accept the behavior of others, as you do.\n> \n> \n> Dictionary.com\n> stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one&#x27;s own\n> \n> Shall we continue? your argument is trash and once again, the irony stands; That you display bigotry against a target you called bigoted.... heh\n\nYou actually go to the link and here's the image below.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/d1bai\n\nClearly you don't read parts that actually go against what you believe because you don't want contrary evidence. We don't need to continue. Your argument style is like \"hey ignore actual stuff but only look at a few things I say and disregard the rest\"\n\nWhen the red post says it was \"hate speech\" it doesn't just mean offensive, it means much more than offensive. However, you may disagree with the definition of hate speech and if that is the case, then please define what you think hate speech is.\n\nEDIT: If your definition of hate speech is \"being offensive\" then I can understand why there is so much of a disagreement.\n\nREEDIT: I've just looked through your comment history and you're just a troll. You're going to disagree to the bitter end and then when I disengage after this because you're not worth any more time, you'll say you have won.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-02-13T07:31:42.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YerroFever,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7GAyQVIA,comment-id=00160000000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-13T00:44:58.480+0000)\n>\n> You actually go to the link and here&#x27;s the image below.\n\n\nDid you even bother to read that definition? because it seems to me you didn't.\n\nWhich is a hilarious demonstration of your confirmation bias.\n\n>If your definition of hate speech is &quot;being offensive&quot; \n\nWhat the fiddle sticks are you even talking about? I gave you three sourced definitions and in none of them was the core premise \"This is offensive\" , you are not very bright, sir.\n\nNo, I said , maybe the chat logs are against the draconian system by virtue of being \"offensive\" but not \"bigotry\" by any means. YOU are bigoted, not him and this is operating based on the multiple definitions I provided and I can provide more, Oxford dictionary also concurs with the other three defitions I provided and your definition fits in nicely as well.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is, despite many attempts to inform you, you fail to understand  or accept the actual meaning of the word \"bigotry\"... ironically.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
