If you have any issues with the ticketing system, you can also reach out to support by sending an email to support@riotgames.com.  If your boost isn't showing up on the updated client, double check the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThe updated client is still in testing so some features or notifications may not be up yet.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
