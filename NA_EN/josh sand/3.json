A million times better. A \"Drawn out\" fight makes cooldowns relevant (They also need to remove a load of CDR from the game, cooldowns are supposed to be punishable by the enemy), roles distinct, and allows more than one instantaneous opportunity to demonstrate \"skill\".  A longer fight isn't necessarily a bland fight. Particularly when you're watching really good players.\n\nDrawn out != Bland. At all. I disagree wholeheartedly with what you imply with that statement.\n\nSkill at the moment is all about minimizing interaction with the enemy, waiting for your chance, and just... smearing your buttons. Killing everyone in one momentous all in is not \"original\", particularly if even the damn \"tanks\" (Hi Malphite) do it just as fast as the assassins. There's no trading, no tactics, the game of chess has been turned into a DBZ fighting game. The fights happen too quickly to even appreciate what's going on. \n\nBland? That's not a fight-length issue, that's a champion issue. People not exploding into confetti in one second allows a lot more diversity of playstyle. There are bland champions to watch, but better tank itemization and vision options makes the fights we do see much more interesting, not more bland.\n\nI don't understand why folks hate more \"passive\" LCS games so much, either. Seeing the strategy, team play, income efficiency, map control, vision control aspects are still incredibly vital, interesting, and important things to see. Then the fights that do occur are worth something, the team earns it.\n\nFurthermore, what good is making LCS more fighty if you obliterate nearly everything that made the game as magical as it was. League is no longer the biggest multiplayer game on the block, nor is it growing. \n\nIt is shrinking and dying, and this is almost entirely due to the abysmal balance decisions made by Riot.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slogg","date":"2019-10-06T16:04:28.063+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just gunna say this, and it could be totally inaccurate, but it was how the game felt to me.\n\nBack when it was tank meta, it felt like only certain tank champions were broken.

There is so much nonsense in this game now that it's hard to know where to start. The damage is out of control, the CC is out of control, the snowballing is out of control, etc. If we are to stay in this meta, Riot needs to do what Blizzard realized very early on in WoW's PvP, and introduce a trinket that everyone can get with a cooldown to remove cc from you.

Then you go down to something like silver or iron or bronze and the CS is completely crap, abilities don't hit anything and the only reason people die is because they run under turrets or have a 2 minute long fight around a dragon, which is beating on both teams and doing more DPS than any player in the game. \n\nThe skill gap between pros and the average player that it seems like a 'burst 1 person and GG' at pro play  because of vision and map movements that were set up minutes ago, to average play of face checking bush and getting destroyed by 4 people sitting in the bush; is huge.

That game just proves the main point made by OP:\n\n> Right now, the tempo of pro team fights look really similar to the clown fiestas in solo q. Just run around until you can instantly blow one enemy up, then get into a mad scramble to win a 4v5.\n\nAlmost every teamfight/skirmish played out that way. Here is a (non-exhaustive) breakdown:\n\n14:25 - Skarner (DFM) Flash+R on a flashless Nautilus (ISG), under full vision for Team Blue (ISG). Nautilus gets deleted during suppression, the fight is over.\n\n17:20 - Skarner gets deleted almost instantly by (ISG) Nautilus + Xayah (Gragas last hits). Gnar and Rakan (DFM) try to salvage, but Gnar gets killed in one of the few relatively \"slow\" deaths of the game, taking around 5-6 seconds to die (in Mega Gnar form). No one dies from ISG, other members of DFM can't do anything.\n\n27:30 - The only teamfight which somehow looks like a teamfight from previous seasons, but only due to the fact that Gragas + Naut couldn't kill Gnar (Xayah wasn't in range and ISG Syndra got suppressed by flash+R of Skarner and then killed), which got a chance to at least use Ult. Gnar still dies, by the way.\n\n28:55 - Nautilus gets Skarner, but then Skarner gets Naut. Guess what? Both get deleted.\n\n36:30 - Xayah gets caught. Gnar, which acted as a frontline for a while (mind you: with the hyper-fed Xayah being dead), just barely escapes death from Syndra R. Gnar also used stopwatch.\n\nStarting to see a pattern? Yeah, you get caught, you instantly get deleted and there is nothing your team can do to turn the tables. You frontline? You either barely escape with few hp, or just get deleted for having attempted to actually do your job, i.e., tank for _at most_ 5-6 seconds, most likely this value is bloated due to either stopwatch, skills which make you untargetable, maneuvering time for the carries, etc.\n\nNow, the _game itself_ was back-and-forth, sure, that's a fact. The game lasted long, due to the hyper-fed Xayah getting caught, thus artificially prolonging the game. Give the same scenario to a korean team and the game would have ended much, much quicker. Let us not forget that Korean teams closed out games at around 25 minutes during the seasons considered \"boring to watch\", where the average pro-game (for other regions) was 5-10 minutes higher.\n\nBut the teamfights? They were fast, catch-based and mostly one-sided (outside of the rare outplay).","replies":[{"poster":"SFHFWill","date":"2019-10-06T13:35:41.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not even remotely true.

How many rotations should a front line absorb on one champ?\n\nAre we talking about the same game?\n\nGnar, in Mega Gnar form, which is _one of the tankiest thing in the game_, **just barely** survived a rotation of two (2) champions: GP and Syndra. At around 36:30, Gnar absorbed:\n1. From Nautilus: R (and no more);\n2. From Syndra: 2 Q, 1 E and 1 R (Gnar stopwatched Syndra W);\n3. From GP: 2 barrels, 1 or 2 autos (it's a bit hard to see).\nHad Gnar actually absorbed a full-rotation from Nautilus, or even the first tick of GP Ult (which didn't even scratch him), he would have died.

Theres no back and forth play that used to happen between all of the players before. \n> \n> In teamfights of the past, you would see players adjust their position throughout combat, baiting people to overextend, or closing in after critical cooldowns have been spent.\n> \n> Right now, the tempo of pro team fights look really similar to the clown fiestas in solo q.  Just run around until you can instantly blow one enemy up, then get into a mad scramble to win a 4v5. \n> \n> Pro teams used to make a name for themselves with things like smart map movements, objective trading, clever gank routes, intelligent team fighting, or just relentless aggression. \n> \n> Now that the main requirement to win feels like its \"just blow one guy up\" theres no nuance or distinction between the teams' ability to team fight. It feels like its more about the first salvo than anything else, and that is insanely boring. \n> \n> There used to be so much strategic nuance to this game, that it took several minutes for someone like Zirene to break down a team fight that lasted maybe 10+ seconds. \n> \n> Now it feels like its just, \"catch and kill a wandering dude before everyone in the shed starts throwing grenades at each other. \"\n> \n> Not a fun viewing experience when you know what this game used to play like.\n\n\n\nwell, this is what happens when you delete tanks and healers from the game, and just put everyone on PHAT DMG\n\nturns out tho, most of the playerbase prefers playing as PHAT DMG and not as tank/support","replies":[]}]}
