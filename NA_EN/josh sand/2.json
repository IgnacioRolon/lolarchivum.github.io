If it's possible to ditch the snowballing garbage and keep bot lane dynamic, I'm good with that.\n\nAnd to add onto your point, they've also strangled out vision, especially in the early game.  Vision was one of the few ways you could stop the bleeding somewhat, and get a pick against a team that was pushing too far forward too fast.  But now you can't even do that - You have people walking around with Duskblades, getting free ward clears over almost an entire jungle quadrant, regardless if they mentally carried the intention of actually clearing vision.\n\nRemember when they put in the little destroyed ward marker so you could track an opposing team's warding habits?  Why do you even need that now when you can just have your assassin autopilot through the jungle and knock out all the wards that happen to be within 750 units of their path.\n\nYou can't even buy a Sightstone anymore (not that it would help against the invisible junglers), and so now that everyone's vision has been standardized in the early game, you can't safely force aggression on the opposing duo unless you happen to know exactly where the jungler is.  \n\nI remember before that an aspect of the lane phase also consisted of feeling your lane opponent out... testing them to see if you could risk an all-in.  Nowadays I don't even bother with probing for weaknesses because I can't afford to all-in, because I often can't guarantee 100% that I know where the enemy jungler is.  So instead, if we get an advantage, we just freeze them off the wave and put the lane in a state where we are no longer interacting with our opponents.  Whoop Dee Doo\n\nBut yea, every freaking snowball is the same.  I can't keep vision up because they have two Duskblades and they just derp their way to vision contol, so we just sit in the base while we wait for them to get baron and close out the game.  Or we can facecheck and die.  Neither of which are exciting or interesting options.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-06-30T02:57:39.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vision has been up in the early game ever since they introduced trinkets in season 4. It has \"slowly\" declined A BIT with the change to trinket cooldowns and such but vision until first back has been VASTLY higher than the earlier seasons. The problem is midgame and beyond where trinket timers are on too long of a cooldown and wards are too hard to defend meaning the winning team SHOULD almost always keep the map black for the enemy team ESPECIALLY if the winning team is on blue side where red team can't even dream about contesting a control ward in baron pit. \n\nThe only \"real\" problem with Duskblade is the cooldown is arguably too short since it even rivals the red trinket in that regard or that it can POTENTIALLY clear multiple wards, but as an item it makes thematic sense and the users of the item is so very narrow. \n\nAnother thing is that the sightstone change is STILL largely irrelevant since all that happens is you get your sightstone maybe 2 minutes slower, but that really doesn't matter since bot lane still has access to an absurd amount of vision potential prior to that with 4 trinket charges and AT LEAST one control ward. The problem is still the fact that you can't do anything to \"get\" more vision as anyone without a support item. Control Wards generally don't last long enough and are USUALLY only good when you are ahead and with the recent trinket changes, while you might be a little bit safer in lane since the ward lasts longer, at any point after that your ward USUALLY doesn't last long enough to warrant the huge spike in cooldown since there are generally 2 sweepers running around on each team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-06-29T18:41:29.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly it, imo. The changes to crit may have some problems, but they have strictly no relation to the current state of damage and snowballing, since those problems were identical prior to that update. Whereas Riot had been starting to tone snowballing down around Season 5, it came back in full force come Preseason 6, with increasing amounts of damage, and nerfs to durability, being implemented in the process. A ton of champions since then have received changes to become more snowbally, and so by Riot's own admission (e.g. Ahri's mini-rework a little while back). If the game is to be snowbally, it needs to tone down its existing snowballing mechanics in place, not reinstate marksmen as the de facto masters of bot lane (especially since marksmen were/are a prime source of snowballing themselves).\n\nI also very much agree that the addition of snowballing has backfired spectacularly. More snowballing means more risk, and if there's one thing pro players hate, it's risk. This is why ratcheting up snowballing has caused pro players to go increasingly deeper into strats that minimalize interaction with the enemy team, namely with turtling, and now gold funneling, and which often have the side-effect of stretching games out far beyond the point where they stop being interesting. On the flipside, standard play's a mess, because most players don't know how to play from behind, or at least from statistical disadvantages that can ramp up so quickly, and the net result is a game that, to most people, is about stomping or being stomped.\n\nPersonally, what I think is the crux of snowballing in League is how so many mechanics in the game award power with more power. If you get a lead, you get a whole bunch more stats, not just from items but also from runes themselves scaling with items, and that causes champions to spike way too hard. This, in turn, leads said champion to have an easier time getting gold through kills, towers, minions, etc. which only accelerates their power increase. Players on the losing side, by contrast, have increasingly fewer options, particularly since engaging enemies with a gold lead quickly becomes suicide. As such, games quickly devolve into a state where one side can steamroll the other at will, and the other feels trapped in a match where they've become utterly helpless. What's bad as well is that this isn't the point at which the game ends, because one team needs to either surrender or push to the nexus. Because players at most levels don't really know how to capitalize on leads to push hard either, there often ends up being this time period where one team should have definitely closed the game by now, but didn't, creating this awkward state where there's only really one possible outcome, but where everyone's just waiting for it to happen, compounding frustration. Because of this, I think League needs to start seriously toning down stat-based advantages, and instead reward victories with pushes towards the enemy nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2018-06-30T09:13:00.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> the best part is, that these mechanics are entirely pointless to make pro games more interesting to watch. because all it did was make them play even more passive in fear that a slight mistep is costing them games and their jobs.\n\nMan, this part really made me feel bad for pros.

I used to play primarily fill. I played every role. Originally, I wanted to be a top laner. I found that consistently, ADC and Support were the least wanted roles. Maybe there were times here and there, like that really weird point right after the ADC update where no one really wanted to play mid. BUt usually, the least wanted roles were Support and AD. Whenever Riot would release little blurbs about their match data, especially after the fiasco of dynamic queue, it would corroborate this. \n\nSo it was actually the players of every other role who JUST HAD to get their lane--and the AD/support was what you had to do if you didn't get your lane. No, tops, mids, and jgs did not learn by playing their champion in every role. That's absolute ass. That's something one-tricks do, and also PEOPLE WHO MAIN THAT ROLE, not the champion, while trying to earn chests on that champion. So many people from other lanes DO NOT know how to play adc at even a basic level. You are saying the opposite. But by far the most phrases I heard while filling was \"OH GOD DONT MAKE ME ADC\" or \"please not support\". You have it absolutely backwards. How many people in other roles do not even know the basics of orbwalking? How many people do not weave in autos effectively because they have never had to practice animation cancelling on every auto? For so long, I always tell people just learn how to do this, it's a basic part of the game, and that they will also be able to play adc a bit more competently. They don't listen.\n\nAnd this is why ADC mains often specialize. Because they TAKE THE TIME to master a basic mechanic that nobody else really wants to learn unless they are actually smart. Meanwhile, with the exception of the brunt of the shield meta, support mains were basically doing the rest of the game a goddamn favor because no one wanted to play that role for years. \n\nNo one complained about ADC and support only players because there was a shortage enough as it was. It was so bad, that I went from fill, to basically a support main, because with the role picking feature, support is generally the role that keeps queues long because no one likes it or knows how to do it properly.\n\nAnd the times that I had fill supports that weren't me? Well everyone has horror stories of the top laner or mid laner \"support\" that doesn't know how to support , and just picks their main champion, and basically afks unless they can take an easy kill. So yea. You are way off base. I still would find myself feeling like I have to q for support even when all I really want to do was play mid like *everyone else*.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOnionRouter","date":"2018-06-29T17:11:07.119+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> quoting hashinshin in earnest\n\nOpinion discarded honestly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nipsahoy","date":"2018-06-30T15:31:08.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SomeKat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qv0i56sl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-29T14:15:46.893+0000)\n>\n> The &quot;I only play support&quot; and &quot;I only play ADC&quot; people were the worst people in the game anyway. The game dynamic is fluid, and they demanded linear strategy based around them instead, every game.\n> \n> If you don&#x27;t know how to play Nasus or Zed Support, and if you don&#x27;t know how to play Irelia and Yasuo AD carry, then you don&#x27;t deserve to be shotcalling your team to be making plays around you when you&#x27;ve experimented the least of anyone else. The way Nasus players get better at Nasus is by playing him in 5 different roles and 3 different lanes and the jungle. I&#x27;ve yet to see Nami and Tristana do this the same way every other Champion develops in skill.\n> \n> And the Irony of AD carries is best left with Hashinshins response, it&#x27;s almost like they are mad some other role came into their lane, bullied them with counter mechanics, and pushed them out of their own lane(Like how AD carries that go top lane, counter top laners.) It&#x27;s such a shame Bruisers use a strategy employed by literal AD carry players against top laners, but when it&#x27;s in bot lane, all the sudden the game is &#x27;unfun&#x27;. It&#x27;s revealing of how boosted and propped up they are that they think they can complain like that. If you don&#x27;t like it play ADC mid...\n> \n> The real joke is just teams have to find coordinated AD carries that can play multiple lanes now, most of the people complaining only understand the games win conditions in a linear format and that is the main reason they are upset. If they have double bruiser bot, get a strong jg and place your AD carry on toplanes island to farm, against a character he directly counters, and you should win the game as easy as moving a lane. Don&#x27;t just send your AD carry(the person that the whole team is trying to carry and protect) directly against 2 bruisers at the start of the game -_-. Or are we going to assume that&#x27;s a fair dynamic and nerf bruisers so ADCs can compete with that? If they take 2 bruisers and sacrifice lategame range, isolate your adc and farm idk why it&#x27;s so complicated. The entire reason jg adc funnel works well this meta is because their farm is isolated from duo bot lane bruisers, top lane and mid lane are pretty much just as acceptable.\n\nQuoting Hashinshin the guy who only plays top and complains endlessly until the champs he plays are the only viable options.  Legitimate opinion.  It's ridiculous that bullshit melee champ can power spike off one item then build defensively and still have lethal damage to squishies.  You delay the power spike for ranged carries to 3-4 items so they don't become viable until games are nearly over if they even make it to that point.  Awful design.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-06-30T02:48:39.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wtf i love bushido blade now","replies":[]},{"poster":"KazaJhodo","date":"2018-06-29T16:25:16.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Funny.
