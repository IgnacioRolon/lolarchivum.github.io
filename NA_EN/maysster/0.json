Sometimes it shoes me the \"attempting to reconnect\" sign that we all love, and sometimes my champion just stays in the movement order i gave him (keeps walking in the same direction or stays in the place) while all the rest of the game keeps moving (but in a laggy way..). I can still see the dmg signs and stuff like that (again, in a laggy way), and can't control my champion.\n\nMy Laptop:\nWindows 10\n16GB Ram\nIntel Core i7-4500U 1.80GHz-2.40GHz\nI think it's enough.\n\nI always had a better experience of LoL, and it just started happening lately (about 1-3 weeks ago).\nI don't have network issues in other programs\\websites.\nI live in Israel.\n\nI Tried some things that didn't help me:\nChanged my internet supplier\nChecked my internet foundations\nGot a new, better router (my previous one was really bad tho) (of course, i forwarded the LoL ports right after I got it)\nPlayed from my iPhone's personal spot (i used to do this before the problem and it's pretty playable, as long as you don't get a message or a call mid-game)\nChecked that there is no other programs that are using my internet during gameplay\nChanged my video setting to the lowest settings possible\nDisabled movement prediction\n\nAs I said, none of these helped.\n\nAnyone has a solution or an idea where this problem comes from?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-24T20:24:46.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your higher ping and outright disconnection sounds like your network is having some major issues reaching the game server.  I know you've tried some steps already, but I suspect that there might be a more local issue causing these disconnects.  My suggestion would be to additionally go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  This will help troubleshoot as well as rule pout possibilities.  Test it in a custom game, and let me know how it goes.","replies":[]}]}
