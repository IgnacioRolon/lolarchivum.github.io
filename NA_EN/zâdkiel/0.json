As I said, it would be really great to get some exposure on this post since the new Vi skin (Warring Kingdoms) has so much potential, but it needs to be executed better.\r\n\r\n1) Her hair looks weird, color scheme and the hair physics do not pair well with the rest of the skin. \r\n\r\n2) Her recall animation really leaves something to be desired, especially compared with Azir&#039;s and Garen&#039;s recall animations. \r\n\r\n3) Her colors seem a bit dull in general, give the fists a glow as well as their green coloration and it would look much better. This goes hand in hand with her Q that needs more of an *umpf*, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n4) The W and Ultimate indicators really need to fit the color scheme. I understand that this might be difficult due to gameplay issues, but I feel matching the W and Ultimate indicators with the fists colors seems imperative, in this case making the indicators green. You could always change the fists to a ruby red which fits the Warring Kingdoms theme, but I feel may be too reminiscent of Demon Vi. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, bring the skin down to 975 RP, but really I just wanted these improvements implemented since the skin has so much potential. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d just like to justify my posting this here, since I&#039;ve been talking with people on Twitch/Discord, etc. and these seem to be in some form or another common gripes people have with the skin. \r\n\r\nAlso, it seems that there is no more preferable place to post this than here, since it seems you need a PBE account to directly post on the boards regarding the skin in development.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nP.S. Would just like to say the splash art looks amazing, considerably superior to the in game skin :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LoveStrut","date":"2016-12-09T22:22:50.663+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya, Z창dkiel! Thanks for the feedback!\n\n_1) Her hair looks weird, color scheme and the hair physics do not pair well with the rest of the skin._\n\n* We changed the hair to a darker color to match that in the splash! Hopefully, it looks better to ya'll now! Unfortunately, we cannot change the hair physics with the way Vi's skeleton is currently set up without introducing animation and model issues, so we won't be changing the hair physics.\n\n_2) Her recall animation really leaves something to be desired, especially compared with Azir's and Garen's recall animations._\n\n* At this point, we can't really drastically change the animation itself, but we've added some particle tweaks to the animation to hopefully make it feel better!\n\n_3) Her colors seem a bit dull in general, give the fists a glow as well as their green coloration and it would look much better. This goes hand in hand with her Q that needs more of an umpf, in my opinion._\n\n* What about the colors makes it feel \"dull\" in your opinion? As for the fists, we can't add a green because that leads to gameplay clarity issues, since a glow would make it look like she has a buff activated--specifically, it would make it look like her Excessive Force (E) was activated. As for the Q though, I'm in talks with Gameplay and VFX to see if what we can improve her to give her more of that \"umpf\"!\n\n_4) The W and Ultimate indicators really need to fit the color scheme. I understand that this might be difficult due to gameplay issues, but I feel matching the W and Ultimate indicators with the fists colors seems imperative, in this case making the indicators green. You could always change the fists to a ruby red which fits the Warring Kingdoms theme, but I feel may be too reminiscent of Demon Vi._\n\n* After some talks with Gameplay, we managed to get some of the W circle indicators changed (can't change the final hit though)! You can see those hitting the PBE with the next build. As for the ultimate indicators, these need more of a strict clarity read given the spell's impact. Again, I'm still in talks about these indicators, but there is a chance that we may not be able to change these.","replies":[{"poster":"Z창dkiel","date":"2016-12-10T00:18:46.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi LoveStrut! Thanks for the reply!\n\nPretty surprised this got a Rioters attention considering where it was posted, even though it seems like you were really active on the PBE boards, unfortunately only those with PBE accounts can comment on there.\n\nAbout the hair it's a shame, but matching the splash better will really even out for the \"physics\".\n\nIn terms of the recall, I guess once posted on the PBE you only really want to add minor tweaks and keep the team working on new skins. Although adding some particle tweaks will really make it better!\n\nIn terms of dull, I meant that Garen's sword and Azir's spear have a more vibrant green, whereas Vi's is a bit more dull - I'm sorry if that's a terrible explanation I can't really think of a better way to put it (Maybe a more emerald green on the fists which would be more similar to the splash, whereas now they are more jade green). \nI can definitely see that issue with giving the fists a glow since it would be too similar to having E activated, that also applies to making it more vibrant as it may be harder to see when E is activated though. \nGreat to hear about her Q, truly shot by shot you can notice the scales that would represent a green Chinese Dragon (fitting the overall theme of the skin), however during the actual animation it's impossible to appreciate the detail.\n\nIncredibly, the W and R indicators look amazing, in retrospect making them jade green may actually be counter-gameplay since it would make it hard to see in the jungle, river, etc. However, the team has found a perfect shade of green and I must say looking at the changes it looks amazing! \n\nI would just like to say thank you for your endeavors, honestly, Warring Kingdoms Vi already looks much better!\n\nAlso, thank you for taking your time through the NA boards to find this post!\n\nKeep on with the good work!\n\nHopefully, will be hearing from you soon about final adjustments to give the skin a perfect 10. But I must say, I'm sold :P\n\nKind Regards,\n\nZ창dkiel.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mosaickle","date":"2016-12-09T10:32:38.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like overall her gauntlets are just too big as a whole, rendering the rest of her body/head/legs a bit too 'forgotten' in terms of skins go.
