The Assassins and the Mage classes have been the first classes to be reworked and so I believe that we should give some love to our beautiful supports since they are the main reason why our ADCs get fed and win games ! I also believe that the supports should not be left for the last class update because to this date almost nobody wants to play support in the normal queue because of theese beautiful updates of the classes that are picked so often. In order to balance that you should do a support rework. This could make players pick support more often !","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-11-12T13:49:46.800+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports all have unique play styles and do not need a class rework.\n\nJanna does not play like Thresh\n\nSoraka does not play  like Alistar\n\nTrundle does not play like Nami","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excalibait","date":"2016-11-12T12:25:54.704+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha, joke's on you! Rito is updating Supports silently on the side note of everything as they know that no one cares about us Support Mains in first place and non-Support Mains only care about dealing damage, because that is literally all they can do as they don't have that any clue of how peeling and cc'ing (and most importantly teamwork) works. ok, maybe a few Top Laners may still play tankish Champions, but that's pretty much it.. \n\nSo we got Sona, Leona and now Alistar getting a mini-rework already, without losing many words about them. Taric even got a full VGU with the Targon Story. Annie, Zyra and Brand got changes in the Mage Update and especially Zyra was updated with Support as main role in mind. Tahm Kench had changes to his %HP bonus dmg which is mainly useful for his Lv1-5 as Support in lane.\n\nAlso Support Items got changed quite a bit in Preseason as Locket is pretty much dead for now in my opinion. Face of the Mountains Shield got changed so it shield target ally and you simultanously and the 2 new items Knights Vow and that Medallion-like looking thing (forgot the name) are actually really good.\n\nAs you can see, Riot actually does care about Supports and tries to have them in a good spot already. There are other classes that really need more help and I personally hope that they will work on Divers next, so poor Aatrox and Irelia will get a few new toys to give them a new meaning in life.\n\nJust the two cents of a true, selfless Support main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decimús","date":"2016-11-12T11:43:22.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Silver V opinion ... \nNext class update is going to be fighter/initiator ;)\n\nSupps are in great spot mate , stop this nonsense .","replies":[{"poster":"Silverjust","date":"2016-11-12T12:15:10.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh there are enough support-player at the moment? \nI did not know that \n/s","replies":[{"poster":"Decimús","date":"2016-11-12T12:27:26.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe not in your Elo .\nFact is , you dont know the game that well mate hence your opinion is somewhat ignorable , sorry harsh turth.\nAgain , supp class is fine as it is ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Silverjust","date":"2016-11-12T12:42:29.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In what elo are you, that there are always enough support players?","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-11-12T13:41:38.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2200 normal MMR feels like there's more supports than midlaners","replies":[{"poster":"Decimús","date":"2016-11-12T19:40:39.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-11-12T11:47:02.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Revert supports to season 2\n\n\nNo need of items when you can 1v1 the adc until lvl 7/8\nNo need of items when your kit is designed to work without scalling, without items, {{champion:37}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:12}} to be overpowered in early game forcing ADC to be weak until some items which is working as intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenny69fizz","date":"2016-11-12T11:31:38.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i totally agree... even me being a support main\neven the que... matches dont get set up cause of less support players ...\nthey really need to improve the supp","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemothHymside","date":"2016-11-12T11:24:41.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People don't like picking support because, outside of maybe catching a few people off guard with a bot lane APC support who gets fed, you can't carry a team no matter how good you are.

There are perhaps some champions that could use some work, i.e. Sona, Lulu, Soraka, etc., but even those champions tend to be in a better state than, say, Aatrox, Pantheon or Warwick. If they had to receive work, it would be to their items and to larger game systems that allocate gold, experience, etc., in order for them to feel better. Whereas several of the current class update recipients had issues with both their champions and their items (juggernauts and assassins didn't even really have their own items until their updates), supports have both good champions and their own itemization, so in some ways they're a step ahead. I do think there's a lot that needs to be done for supports, but it would have to have a format very different from the standard class updates thus far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2016-11-12T12:56:10.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, who would be the big four they would update?
