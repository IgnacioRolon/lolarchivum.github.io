Now i did this in a game with pre-made Normal game with 2 friends where one of them banned my champ and I told them if they don't dodge i'm running it down mid, then asked said friends if they were ok with it then i did it cause they said go for it. I will say that i was a respectable league player for 5-6 years had the highest honor since the honor system came out. I lost all that in a single game and got a 14 day suspension, and a threat that on the 2nd offence against the \"rules\" of League would result in a permanent ban. Now in some regards i can see how this is \"fair\" in others i don't see a point in building up honor if it means nothing in the long run. {{summoner:13}} \n\nNow for second the reason I'm sharing this story is Yesterday i played in a ranked solo/duo and I had a player said in lobby and in game multiple times that he is trolling and he went lane to lane stealing farm and exp as jungle and feeding enemy lanes. I'm quite sure my entire team reported this jungle, however I'm also pretty sure that the enemy team didn't report him ether due to laziness or because they got free lp. {{summoner:11}} \n\nNow this is two different situations one in normals and the other in a ranked game. Which game mode really matter when you troll your teammates and which deserves a ban or temp ban more so? If anything both do. But the way the report system works is if at least 6+ people don't report the player in this game then riot isn't even alerted to the situation, unless they are reported in their next 10 games. {{summoner:3}} \n\nSo my question is that shouldn't riot be alerted to reports when your entire team reports them? Cause again you wont always get 2 people from the enemy team to report said player. {{summoner:21}}\n\nAlso wanted to add that the system is broken to a point. They need more room for error, after all we are human. We all get mad at the game and we all have bad days.\n\nLets say i have another bad day, like i lose my job, a family member or something of the sort. I get on league and i have someone flaming me or they have bad timing and say something like \"I hope your mom die of cancer for giving birth to you\" And a flip switches in my head and i ether flame him/her back or start feeding to ruin the game cause at that time i wouldn't give a shit. At this time Riot would permanently ban me forever because its my second offence no matter how far in the future it may happen. could be a week from now could be 10 years. The offences never dissappear.\n\nin our society no matter the sin we are taught that it can be forgiven and we can grow. This goes for robbers, rapist, murders, so on so forth. And i was hoping to write this response because i hope that riot does change this or at least puts limit on their bans. Something like Temp ban from 14 days to A month, to 6 months, to a year. so on so forth.\n\nI have spent over $9000 on league and i didn't know they changed their eula so hard that they only give us two chances for our entire lives. That boggles me i cant imagine being banned from my account for the rest of my life, i love and hate the community. Its grown on me for so long that i can accept trolls like tyler1 in my game but rather then trying to help change the community the way they changed tyler1 they jump right to permabanning.\n\nTyler1 was banned from league for a years time he would make new accounts get them banned over and over. He didnt care. but look at him now he still kinda rages but he doesnt run it down when you ban draven. Why is that? Its cause he was given a second chance and he has grasped it by the freaking balls and manned up. If league gave out long term bans instead of perma bans o honestly think the community would grow.\n\nP.S. Sorry im very passionate about this subject ever since i realized how the system has changed since tyler1's return.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-01-30T03:32:26.485+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> For starters i will say about 2-3 months ago i raged and ran it down mid lane. \n\nWhatever disappointments you have in the ban system are completely, utterly, 100% irrelevant. Everyone, and I mean **everyone**, has zero tolerance or patience for intentional feeders.\n\n> Lets say i have another bad day\n\nYour problems are not anyone else's problems. Nobody is required to have your shit inflicted on them because you're having a bad day.\n\n> in our society no matter the sin we are taught that it can be forgiven and we can grow\n\nWe are? Because in the society I live in, nobody is **entitled** to forgiveness or absolution (which are different things, and you're expecting the latter). I sure as hell don't forgive or absolve rapists and murderers for their crimes. Riot has rules. You broke the rules. There are no feelings involved here.\n\n> I have spent over $9000 on league\n\nThis entitles you to **nothing**.\n\n> Tyler1\n\nTyler1 never got a single account back.

It's absolutely absurd that you think it's ever acceptable for you to take your frustration/bad day out on other people. That is selfish and horribly rude.\n\nThe rules have never changed. Intentionally feeding has **ALWAYS** resulted in a 14 day ban on first offense and a permanent ban on second offense. The reasoning is you shouldn't *need* a warning that it's unacceptable. If your response to frustration is to ruin other people's day, **then Riot does not want you to play League**. Riot is not going to give more chances, because **you don't need a warning**.

That's a fictional movie. Mental illness is NOT a growing problem. It's becoming more UNDERSTOOD. Many people have mental illness and are not violent. That's actually offensive to think anyone with a mental illness = violent serial killer. I think you're the one that needs to wake up and see how society really is.\n\n2.) If you're having such a bad day that you think of harming someone irl then you should seek professional help and I mean this in a non-insulting manner. That is not normal.\n\n3.) Just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you should take it out in other peoples' games in League of Legends. Why ruin other peoples' days because your's is bad? Why not make it better for them and actually be a good player? \nYour punishment is justified, don't whine because you didn't follow the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"DecayedPenguini","date":"2020-01-30T20:09:26.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"again not reading my post im not saying my punishment isnt justified by any means i think you should be punished for any wrong doing. But their shouldnt be a lifetime of 1 chance. Look around the execution law doesnt exist anymore for a reasoon. So why should perma ban exist. Again im personally not banned from league i havent been in months. i just want to share my opinion on this subject. Giving 1 lifetime chance to any player then banning them seems unfair.\n\nAlso let me clarify im using the bad day as an example. When i ran it down those few months ago i was just having my own fun with those friends i was playing with. The only bad part of that day was me being banned.\n\nEdit: also its my bad for how i worded that, i just meant the joker as an example and the moves growing concern as an example. Its not mental illness that people already have thats a concern. Ive survived a life of bullying and i have protected people from it. I do not get online and do such things ethier. But bullying can lead to a form of mental illness and thats what league is turning into. If you bully someone over that edge even to a point where they defend themselves in said game,  Riot has the right to ban you permanently for defending yourself against toxic players, because defending yourself is more toxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-30T04:49:09.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's not an excuse.
