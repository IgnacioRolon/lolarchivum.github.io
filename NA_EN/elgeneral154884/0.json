It's really important to get you updated to the updated version to resolve any of these issues.  Generally, the launcher not opening is caused by a security setting preventing it from opening.  I recommend a PC restart just in case it crashed, then to run through each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore access.\n\nOnce complete, my suggestion would be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a clean reinstall.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
