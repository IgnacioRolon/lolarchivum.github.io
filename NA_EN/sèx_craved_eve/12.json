Almost makes me wish his attackspeed still scaled with cdr.  His actual stab animations for soldiers feels really satisfying, too.  Biggest gripe is the range decrease, but that&#039;s mostly because it got me killed early game.  Don&#039;t think he&#039;ll be played in LCS because of the waveclear and range nerfs, but he feels like he&#039;s really close to being a decent soloqueue pick.\r\n\r\nPossibly, even a simple metashift might make him viable.  Dude&#039;s nuts.","replies":[]}
