They're like the bread and butter of his kit.\n\nAnd right now, they feel terrible. I feel like there's a thousand ways to outplay them and no ways for me to be creative when using them. The way he plays mid right now feels bad and clunky. Damage nerfs I can at least adapt to, but changes to the way his mechanics work and feel are horrible, horrible nerfs. I feel like it punishes good Malzahar players, because they were the ones using these tricks to begin with.\n\nOftentimes, the way you play is by waiting for someone to mess up, and if you can't adequately punish people for going in on you, then you just get poked down or dived until you're killed. It's already very easy to just pay attention to which bush Malzahar warded, and duck into the one he doesn't have vision of to quickly de-aggro the voidlings until his E runs off, which guts his damage.\n\nIf you must nerf voidlings, it would be nice to get a compensatory scaling buff on his q. A ratio buff on his q would help mid-lane malzahar a lot. Mid Malz focuses q second, where support Malz focuses that last. Mid Malz would benefit from the scaling, whereas support Malz still builds a lot of support items and therefore has less AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vaxxus","date":"2017-02-01T06:07:41.538+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so Malzahar is an anti-assassin mage right?\n\nAssassins are supposed to be quick and strike hard\n\nIf you delay Malz's voidlings thats going to change his identity as well as his effectiveness against assassins\n\nThe gradual slowing voidlings sure, Mal'z isn't a long range harasser I get that BUT he needs to be as quick and responsive as a mage to be an ANTI-Assassin (especially considering he's already non-mobile)\n\nNow I may be a little biased being a Malzahar main but do understand that when a Talon, Zed, Rengar, Akali, Diana, etc jump on an anti-assassin mage I shouldn't have to go 'Well my next move is to E them then wait .5 seconds for my friends to join the fight.'
