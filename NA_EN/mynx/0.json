We will be looking for a serious attitude towards the game and towards team commitment. For the time being, we will take as many applicants as possible, and divide up accordingly (Note: If you choose to join, and prefer to be placed with another applicant, leave a note at the bottom of your application). As for Communication, we use either TeamSpeak or Curse Voice, so please have at least one of these minimum. As the teams progress, they will be assigned a Higher Elo Coach to either critique their play or help plan team comps.
