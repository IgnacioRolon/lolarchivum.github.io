She's fucking horrible in teamfight scenarios, is utterly destroyed by hard engage teams, gets completely fucked in all ins if you outplay the spear which is incredibly easy to dodge and is super squishy. She's extremely mana dependent(not sure why you'd think otherwise, her excellent clearing requires her to use her 3 human abilities which devour her mana) and has insane issues dealing with beefy teams, especially when you get the player that isn't a fucking idiot and builds mr item+warmog(bonus points if your jungler or support gets aegis). No safe waveclear, She has zero crowd control + peeling abilities and no actual way to engage fights. Her poke has been reduced severely(and as mentioned, is majorly cockblocked by a strong frontline) and her main damage output requires her to cougar.\r\n\r\nIn the end every salt thread related to Nidalee has just been a bunch of players bitching about shit that is flat out not true or highly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nNidalee is a problem atm, but for entirely different reasons that most of this playerbase doesn't understand how to abuse, its only because no jungler can match her early game gank/2v2 pressure if she lands her shit similar to jungle Aatrox in his prime combined with the fact that she outspeeds every jungle in clearspeed and movement, and even then she isn't exactly pick or ban. That's literally it. You hit one of those two things(early game damage/jungle clear) and Nidalee will be shit tier, and yet you think she \"excels\" at everything? ffs even her poke is garbage compared to Xerath half the damn time, and much harder to land! and only hits one target! and even has higher cooldowns! \r\n\r\nAt this point I want her nerfed - not because I hate playing against her - because its infuriating to hear you idiots complain and fabricate shit you know nothing about because \"nidalee is unfun waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah\" even though practically every soloq stomper/competitive pick is much more frustrating to play against than her. God forbid you fucks learn how to outplay a champion who every aspect of their fucking kit can be outplayed, but then again that would require you all to actually learn from mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"WÃ®nter Fox","date":"2015-03-13T13:44:07.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to realize most of the complainers just take a spear in the face, get leaped on, see a chunk of damage, and just start crying promptly afterward.
