There are less things you can tweak, of course, but that also means there are less things to worry about when you do a tweak. When you nerf X thing, you don't need to worry about how it interacts with A, B, C, etc. There's a reason champs like Elise and Yasuo (among the game's more complex, loaded champions) have been dumpstered (Elise remains dumpstered) while champs like Garen have been basically fine for ages. When Riot tries to balance a kit that can do a lot of things they tend not to know what to do (just look at what they decided with Elise: \"Make literally everything worse\" was their philosophy). \n\nNerfing a less complex kit has always worked out better, I can't think of a single \"simple\" champ they've utterly destroyed recently whereas the more complex ones have had very drastic drops in winrate lately - look at Kass and Azir, Syndra, etc. \n\nI really don't see anything that supports complex champs being easier to balance correctly.

He has only one mobility spell (Even if its really annoying) and the rest of his spells needs proper targeting, positionning, and the enemy to postionnate wrong (Q, W and R). That gives him alot of counterplay. Riven on the other side is clamed broken, because too many mobility and powerful shield when AD, making counterplaying hard because we dont have any spell countering mobility well, and there is few you can do.\n\nSame for LB, since she's point n' click, she care less about her or enemy's postionning and either burst hard, or fail to burst, making her pretty much binary and either useful of complete bs.

Do i rend now to get the slow so i can get in more auto attacks before they get to the safety of a tower or do i go for the execute but take the risk of the fight being turned under a tower. \n\nOr another example since the forums are filled with the tears crying for ekko nerfs. Ekko has to choose whether to use his ult for damage or survival. That is a pretty big decision that offers far more interesting potential to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiimahrii","date":"2015-06-01T14:19:54.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't even argue about ideas, Riot is a huge company and they have a section for new champion ideas in every freaking language, every day are posted champion and skill ideas that do not get even scrolled over.

Empirical evidence shows that's not the case: most of the mechanically and strategically complex champs (Yasuo, Elise) have either gotten their numbers trashcanned or are pick/ban (Thresh, Nidalee, Gnar) because it turns out that there's no way to balance the inherent strength present in their kits. You can say, sure, there's more levers to pull, but it turns out that either 90% of those levers don't actually do anything, or that unless you delete the champ, they're unbalancable.\n\nEven if Thresh did zero damage he'd still be a significant threat.\n\nMeanwhile, simpler champs like Garen, Annie, Irelia, etc. are easy to fix because all you need to do is change numbers in a reasonable area. Changing numbers conservatively doesn't do shit to Yasuo, Elise, Thresh, Nidalee or Gnar; they're either OP or trashcanned.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-05-31T22:25:12.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9EYvAEKx,comment-id=001e,timestamp=2015-05-31T10:00:59.059+0000)\n>\n> Meanwhile, simpler champs like Garen, Annie, **Irelia**, etc. are easy to fix because all you need to do is change numbers in a reasonable area.

The entire reason \"Better nerf Irelia\" became a meme was because Riot kept levying nerfs to her kit when people weren't even complaining about her. She was, in the *community's* eyes, okay, but Riot knew better.\n\nThe ~~best~~ ~~worst~~ ~~strangest~~ main thing about about her nerfs, though, was that they didn't actually affect her viability. And she took *a lot* of nerfs. Her Q damage is much lower than it used to be. Her W didn't need to be active for the full sustain effect. Her E and R dealt more damage, and her R had *much* better sustain and scaling.\n\nShe could take more nerfs now, and they wouldn't actually stop her unless they made her absolutely worthless.\n\n*That* is a kit overload.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-05-31T21:16:12.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As soon as people stop defending champions like Yasuo, Kalista and Ekko.

Thats preety much how a simple champion works, all they're abilitys do on thing an one thing only, its either \"TONS OF DAMAGE\" or medicore damage, which doesn't feel rewarding, and you have no options for upping that damage since they are simple champions, and you can't make plays with simple champions, and if you try you wont be rewarded for any of your effort since all they're ability are just based off of that 1 X.","replies":[]}]}
