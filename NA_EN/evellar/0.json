The riot team is probably already aware of this seeing as we are a week into the patch but I figured Id make a post just in case.\n\nBard is capable of using a Magical Journey on the side walls inside of a base on summoners rift.  By doing so Bard is able to travel from the spawn point to the inhibitor turret within a second, with homeguards on he could return to lane very fast.  I was unable to take a screenshot of it as i do not play or own Bard but I did witness a player on my team performing this maneuver.   \n\nI personally feel like this is an unintended use of a magical journey and  was thinking Riot should make it so Bard is not able to conjure a Magical Journey on the sidewalls of the bases,  at least when hes at the spawn point.    It should not effect his playstyle within a base it just puts him on even footing with everyone else that has to run down the stairs.  \n\nHowever....if this is intended then ignore my rant and so be it.  I trust Riot to recognize overpowered ability use and if this is found to not be over powered then have fun using it Bard players and enjoy your quick return to lane.\n\nPlease Comment or add a +1 to this thread...would like riot to read it and not just have the thread die.

Then another to skip between the mid brushes using the little bump there. Unsure if there are any others. They said they'll likely up the spawn rate of chimes if Bard is horrible on ARAM, cause he's mostly lacking a skill because of that. I'd say..just don't level it till you have no choice but to level it. ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2015-03-18T16:12:05.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's almost the inhib but yea I noticed it too.
