Surrender is something out of place in this arena.  Its like you&#039;re going to the superbowl;  Oh except you can at any moment get scared and decide to run with your tail between your legs.  \r\n\r\nIn every game there is winning and losing.  Surrender takes out the healthy experience of loss.  There are good defeats and bad defeats but everyone one of them teaches you whether you like it or not.  A lot of negativity in league is from people being stressed out.  Not learning to lose gracefully only adds to this negativity.  Also there are plenty of mechanics within the game that actually reward tenacious plays.  You get to see none of those when you cut down your games.\r\n\r\nNow life happens and people have to go or whatever.  After all ranked is not LCS so perhaps allow one surrender a day when IRL requires people to leave early or you are about to get hit by a hurricane or the like.","replies":[]}
