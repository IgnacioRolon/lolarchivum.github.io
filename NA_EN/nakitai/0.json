Anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T21:42:24.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhhhhh that's pretty weird tbh! It might be some kind of weird sound delay going on, but that kind of music does play when you enter the queue as well so maybe that's what's going on. Try running a quick client repair if this doesn't stop though!","replies":[]}]}
