Restarting your client should help get you updated to the current version, but if that doesn't help we also have a manual workaround:\n\nLocate LeagueClientSettings.yaml within C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen it with a text editor (such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Notepad++) and find gameflow-patcher-lock. It should have a number there.\nChange the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\nSave the file.\nRestart the client.\n\nHopefully this will do the trick, unless there is a more underlying issue reaching our game server that caused your disconnection in the first place.  Just in case, I recommend also going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection is healthy. \n\nI know that's a lot of steps, but it should get you squared away!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nesui","date":"2017-05-24T16:47:46.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having same issue, alltho i dc in middle of a ranked game and now (i will prolly loose) but i can not login at all and the client now and then tells me that ive been restored to an older version of the client and it will try patching, but nothing happens.","replies":[]}]}
