Loading circle spins around my mouse for a few seconds and then dissapears. Game doesn't start even after 20 minutes since i first clicked. What do I need to do? Game was working just before too, so I don't know if it's related to the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T18:05:55.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent windows or software update may have changed your OS security settings, so it could be preventing the patcher from launching.
