I was playing a close ranked game, and as we were engaging in the game deciding teamfight, my game started freezing up and everyone was teleporting around seemingly randomly. It got really crazy and I don't even know what happened. It was 100% not internet, as my internet was working fine, my songs I was listening to were still loading and playing, and when I tried to DC/REC to fix it, I could connect to the network and I could chat, but when I tried to reconnect, it wouldn't let me and saying I should check my network! This lost me a ranked game I am mad riot please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:43:54.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The description of your symptoms is consistent with those of packet loss or high packet buffering.

Additionally, services like youtube don't rely on syncing actions and data with the server every second, so you're much less likely to notice packet loss to those services.\n\nI definitely recommend working through that guide to ensure we've checked your local network settings properly. Let me know the results of those steps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Parnstar King XD","date":"2016-09-14T22:49:07.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=YxAu9Z1m,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-14T22:43:54.534+0000)\n>\n> The description of your symptoms is consistent with those of packet loss or high packet buffering.
