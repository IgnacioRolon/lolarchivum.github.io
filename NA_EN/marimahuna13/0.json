As the title says, I think the Hextech keys are bugged. I have been getting them the first 2 months of the release, but for 2-3 weeks I haven't gotten one. My friends get them very often. I play with them but never get one. Is this a bug or did the keys become extremely rare all of a sudden?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T21:03:55.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and took a look into your account to get a better idea of what the issue might be.  From looking at it, you actually acquired a lot of fragments earlier to mid May.  Keep in mind that every time you earn a fragment the chance of earning another one reduces dramatically until it resets after 30 days of when you received your first fragment.  For more information about this, you can read about it in our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233).\n\nI hope this removes some confusion!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
