She is a mage of light who - because of her profession - is more or less connected to the concept of elemental mage. But there are some other characters who would fit even better than Lux to this concept and more - look even cooler than her. One of those characters is Aurelion Sol - a beautiful, eary dragon everyone loves so much.\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1920/0*a5Llkp5i3KqVoxjn.\n\n---\n---\n\nAurelion Sol base skin brings to mind the Azure Dragon of the east (_cang long_ or _qing long_) from Chinese mythology and astrology. He lies in the night sky as one of four biggest constelations and is extremely important mythical being who brings spring.\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/e1cf/f/2007/089/b/9/chinese_constellations_by_kirbywithamasamune.jpg\nChinese Constellations by Kirbywitha Masamune\n\n\nBut in Chinese Mythology there is a lot more kinds of dragons which could be an inspiration for an Elementalist skin for Aurelion Sol. Those are:\n\n 1. **Tianlong**, the Celestial Dragons, are the celestial dragons who pull the chariots of the gods and guard their palaces.\n https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20180222/17/kirarinfairy/75/1c/j/o0414060014136605494.jpg?caw=800\n 2. **Shenlong**, the Spiritual Dragons, control the wind and the rain.\n http://i.imgur.com/Emfjcm1.png\n https://scontent-amt2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3aa2a7daf1ff50a21b93a81b9ddb32dd/5B678434/t51.2885-15/e35/28751087_776131062587307_5713040612375134208_n.jpg\n 3. **Fucanglong**, the Dragons of Hidden Treasures, are underworld dragons which guard buried treasures, both natural and man-made. Volcanoes are said to be created when they burst out of the ground to report to heaven.\n https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/the-demonic-paradise/images/3/36/Fucanglong.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160504115941\n https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragons/images/5/59/Chinese-dragon-black.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090603191055\n 4. **Dilong**, the Underground Dragons, are earth dragons whose task it is to preside over rivers and streams. According to some accounts, they are the female counterpart of the Shenlong and they fly only in order to mate.\n http://pm1.narvii.com/6299/ff9405ebc360c077f659e0763307889738f16e27_00.jpg\n http://wallpoper.com/images/00/37/94/85/deviantart-fantasy_00379485.jpg\n 5. **Yinglong**, the Winged Dragons, are the oldest of all eastern dragons and the only kind with wings.\n https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-523b1a04f6de13c4674d7d043d3c6d14\n https://img00.deviantart.net/a0ef/i/2013/014/8/3/yinglong_by_fafnirx-d5rgp2t.jpg\n 6. **Qiulong**, the Horned Dragons, are considered to be the mightiest dragons.\n https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/one-piece-fan/images/a/a5/DarknessDragon.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140802183450\n https://pm1.narvii.com/6474/29fa9693b3582966525551c498eec70911d8a9e5_hq.jpg\n 7. **Panlong**, the Coiling Dragons, are water dragons believed to mostly inhabit the lakes of the Orient.\n https://gfx.gexe.pl/upl/1/2014/6/15111633.jpg\n https://t00.deviantart.net/1k9yRhnrvE8ZSBCybRgAUfqcjSw=/fit-in/700x350/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/ce07/th/pre/i/2017/215/2/4/greatest_water_dragon_by_leekent-dbipqy5.png\n 8. **Huanglong**, the Yellow Dragons, once emerged from the River Luo and presented the legendary Emperor Fu Hsi with the elements of writing. They are known for their scholarly knowledge.\n https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wingsoffire/images/4/42/Golden-dragon-9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171104173556\n 9. **Lóng Wáng**, the Dragon Kings, are rulers over each of the four seas, those of the east, south, west, and north. Although their true form is that of a dragon, they have the ability to shapeshift into human form. They live in crystal palaces guarded by shrimp soldiers and crab generals.\n http://s61.radikal.ru/i173/1112/9b/fd6f0e5719b1.jpg\n https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/ethics_online/0082/_res/id=Picture/Dragon.jpg\n http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b4JKfojeyiw/VMzm1K9ryAI/AAAAAAAAL0c/_wYL7SLRrak/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/ao%2Bguang_2.jpg\n \n It would be awesome to incorporate those inspirations into Aurelion's Elementalist skin. A water dragon, an air dragon, a nature dragon, a fire dragon, a magma dragon, a spiritual dragon, a dark, underground dragon... all of them would look absolutely awesome. Imagine wind around Aurelion as stars or chunks of rock or spiritual orbs instead of them. That would be totally awesome!\n \n \n   ---\n    ---\n\n\n #Other popular dragons in media as inspirations\n \n As many surely noticed, Riot uses for their models inspirations from popular movies and games. It's only natural to do so since every of us wants to play with character that can recognize and like (especially if we are fans of those). This is why I will point out some very known dragon characters as inspiration for our favourite Ritos:\n \n **1. Shenlong from \"Dragon Ball\"**\n I probably don't even need to introduce this character.\n https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcrossroads/images/8/82/Shenlong_%28Earth-65%29.jpg\n \n **2. Discord from \"My Little Pony\"**\n There is a lot of fans of little ponies in LoL. They just never ever admit it.\n https://orig00.deviantart.net/df3e/f/2013/065/e/4/scroll_style_discord_by_tsaoshin-d5x77uf.png\n \n **3. Falkor - Dragon of Luck from \"Neverending Story\"**\n Some old buddies will remember it.\n https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/t/56b0dcfa356fb04503e8e5a4/1454431490757/?format=2500w\n \n **4. Haku from \"Spirited Away\"**\n Haku - a silver dragon and spirit of the river\n https://katherinevaspersmusings.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/spirited-away_00307203.jpg\nhttps://pa1.narvii.com/6523/2fb83eafc378887d3965850020ab61e6a21a8ea0_hq.gif\n \n **5. Lady Rainicorn from \"Adventure Time\"**\n http://jakeandfinn97.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/8/0/22804230/6950910_orig.gif\n  \n **6. Trico from \"The Last Guardian\"**\n http://images.bit-tech.net/content_images/2016/12/the-last-guardian-review/guardian1-1920x1080.jpg\n\n**7. Eevee evolutions from \"Pokemon\"**\n  https://pre00.deviantart.net/299f/th/pre/f/2018/170/f/9/eeveelutions_by_redrie-dcetbl0.png \n by Redrie\nhttps://pm1.narvii.com/6338/ff2e5ca04a0313be35d5651bcce0f698c43541f4_hq.jpg\n \n **8. Sandworm from \"Dune\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/g67oD4m.jpg\n \n  ---\n---\n\n  \n  #Dragons in cultures\n  \n  Dragons are very important part of our cultural heritage. In the ancient times, before any civilization was made, dragons were symbols of water, rivers and rain. They were pictured similar to snakes but had horns which help them collect and transport water from the underworld into the sky. Dragons were also water itself, they were flying from the sky as storms and on the ground became rivers and streams.\n  \n  Dragons in European and Asian cultures were also celestial beings pictured as enemies of the Sun who caused eclipses. They were Lunar Nodes and they were imagined as invisible beings following the Sun and then when the time was right eating it and fighting with it. In India they were called _Ketu_ and _Rahu_ - the head and the tail of great being who wanted to be immortal and equal gods.\n  \n  Because of their strong connection with underworld in Europe dragons got fiercy and evil nature, similar to erupting volcano (which was actually also pictured as a breathing fire dragon trapped in underworld). Dragons in many cultures were guardians of sacred tree with magical golden fruits which grows in the middle of the afterworld. So dragons were also guardians of hidden treasures.\n  \n  Dragons were also pictured as winds, roaring spirits which fertile animals and plants. Well, sometimes also attacked houses during stormy wheather and stealed souls of people, who later became ill because of it (so remember, you needed to be cautious during windy weather and wear scarfs).\n  https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2871116435_16.jpg\n \n \n ---\n ---\n\n\n #Inspirations from League of Legends\n \n **0. Baron Nashor Aurelion** - it can be a funny limited skin, everyone loves Nashor so it can be interesting as 'easter egg'\n \n **1. Lunar Revel Aurelion** - I probably don't have to write it but Lunar Revel Aurelion is a must during a year of the dragon. Please make him amazing like the lion from new Garen's skin &lt;3\n \n **2. Elderwood Aurelion** - Aurelion would look wonderful as a forest spirit. He could have leaves in his hair, branches-like horns, atmosphere of wild deep forest around him. Instead of stars around him it could be will-o'-the-wisps or just autumn leaves. \n \n **3. Dark Star Aurelion** - it would be great like Dark Ice Anivia. Dark Aurelion with burning almost black dark violet black holes around him. A lonely, dark dragon bringing destruction.\n \n **4. Blood Moon Aurelion** - that would be super scary and cool demon as Aurelion. Perfectly fit to this kind of skins. White and red dragon-demon with _oni_ mask on his face. Red bloody moons circling around him.  If you meet him during a night, beware.\n \n **5. River Spirit Aurelion** - we have River Spirit Nami, Aurelion would be also great and more than perfectly fits to the role of river spirit. Colorful watery spirit with water globes around him. He would be beautiful. (There is more possibilities in this, you could also link this theme to Kundalini one).\n \n **6. Shurima/Sandstorm Aurelion** - great sand beast of the Shurima dunes, this theme sounds neat. Spirit of desert, you can see him sometimes foating with newly forming dunes. Dusty monster who has power over sand and wind.\n \n **7. Furry Aurelion** - Aurelion dressed as cute animal as for exapmle dachshund, corgie or basset. If he would be a doggy, he would have doggy balls or treat bones circling around him, during ulti he would bark or howl. Nice, little, funny skin to make people smile.\n \n **8. Festival King Aurelion** - there are lots and lots of festivals with dancing dragons, dragon boat festival and so on. It's pity to not use it. Festival dragon, colorful, dancing, with firecracker particles and atmosphere of chinese festivals.\n \n **9. Sweetheart Aurelion** - dragon of love and sparkling hearts! :D He could have hearts circling around him, and pinkish-red-silvery theme of his design. Who said dragons can't be sending love from heavens.\n \n **10. God Aurelion** - a bit transparenty and glowing like the Sun skin similar to God Lee Sin skin or God King Garen skin would look absolutely smashing on Aurelion and preserve spiritual feeling about this character. Globes aroud him could be tranparenty-glowing little suns.\n \n **11. Nightbringer or Nightchaser Aurelion** - Aurelion as Azure Dragon is constellation illuminating a dark night sky, so he rules of all eastern sky. It's a beast of a night, surrounded by infinite darkness, big and extremely powerfull. This could be a dark theme added to his character. \n \n **12. Snow Day Aurelion** - white fluffy snowy dragon with a warm scarf. Snowballs circling around him. His roar is freezing cold and his stun turns a ground into icy and frosty.\n \n **13. Infernal/Wildfire Aurelion** - a wild fire and magma dragon, it could be a bit similar to infernal Drake, red and black in theme, with fire in his mane and fire sparks as globes around him. A beast from underworld fueling volcanoes, torturing sinners and guarding most valuable possesions of afterworld.\n \n **14. Prehistoric Aurelion** - magical beast of the past when as mighty dinosaur Aurelion descended to earthly life, fighting for survival in harsh times of Jura.\n \n **15. Undead Aurelion**\n \n **16. Poro Aurelion**\n \n **17. Hextech Aurelion**\n \n **18. Neon Demon Aurelion**\n \n **19. Temple Dragon Aurelion**\n \n \n What do you think of those ideas? Maybe you have some of your own. It would be awesome to share a lot of inspirations so maybe something will inspire Rito and make them super enthusiastic about making Aurelion skins.\n \n Here, have a cute picture of a bunny:\n https://wallpapercave.com/wp/2Fc0vzs.jpg\n\nEdit: Added details of LoL inspired skins.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-06-20T11:34:49.156+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot really should finish and release the model of Ao Shin as a skin for Aurelion Sol.\n\n* Change his Q into a growing tornado.\n* Change his W into 3 clouds or something similar rotating around him.\n* HIs E just need a \"wind\" particular effects to replace the \"star\" effects on Classic.

It's easy to be tempted, so to speak.\n\nASol skins most likely won't sell nearly as well as Ahri skins, but it nonetheless I wouldn't have doubt on whether or not it would make a profit given it most likely can given the above; and the PR \"revenue\" Riot could get from making skins for niche champions is still something Riot has to consider, too, as it together with the skin may very well pose a higher total value in opportunity cost when compared to simply spamming skins for popular champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-06-22T06:33:34.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you severely underestimate the cost of producing a skin.\n\nElementalist Lux for one was very nearly a money sink for them.

Ofc, it had a very steep profit curve, massive even, compared to all the other skins, and even for the other Ultimate skins for that matter.\n\nRiot did that because they know Lux has that insane of a following to make it out with profit and then some despite this insane revenue bar the skin was tasked to clear.\n\nWhat this shows is not that ASol is a dead horse waiting to be beaten by releasing a skin for him, and that the resourced poured onto him is just money down the crapper, but instead it just shows that ASol shouldn't receive a skin of that Elementalist Lux level and should go for a smaller scale to ensure profit, which I don't think anyone was arguing against to begin with.\n\nI mentioned the opportunity cost of PR, because it does matter. If all the players see is Riot selling skins to their milk machines, what do you think would be the opinion the players have towards Riot? Even the dumbest company, excluding blatant hack-jobs, can see value in appealing to niche audiences every now and then (even EA sort of gets this. Yes, EA!). Because again, PR is also a part of the equation; and Riot KNOWS this, which is why they've been on a spree of making skins for nicher champs as of lately, after a long rush of skin milking that evidently didn't leave that many players impressed.\n\nIMHO, with all being said, ASol skin is imo probably just going to be a matter of time. I have a strong feeling that it might arrive before the end of this year.

But if skin of niche Aurelion is only matter of time then Rito should be strongly interested in listening of players opinions, of what they truly desire for Aurelion Sol since there will be not many skins for him. It would be also truly wonderful if players would be bravely saying what they really want and discuss about it so Riot would rather make gem everyone wants than go easy.\n\nAlso, what you said about Ao Shin skin for Aurelion. I was nearly sure that Ashen Lord Aurelion was made to imitate Ao Shin. But when you noticed that Ashen Lord is not a storm dragon I understood I was wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YHWH Adonai","date":"2018-06-22T08:05:39.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terozu,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uBnpQiQL,comment-id=0000000400010000,timestamp=2018-06-22T06:33:34.577+0000)\n>\n> I think you severely underestimate the cost of producing a skin.

I would also like to see what is dependancy of making new awesome skins and playrates, for example if playrate of Kog'Maw rised after they made Pug'Maw skin.\n\nBut anyway however it is, Rito just have to do something all the time as developing company which employs people. I think skins can be more profitable even than new champs and also new Aurelion skin would be better than 10th Ahri or Sivir skin, because a lot of people already have at least one skin for popular champs and there is nearly no choice for people playing Aurelion. There is a lot more skins for Nunu or Aatrox who had really poor playrates not that long time ago. Also there is a lot more skins for Corki (also Arcade skin with chromas) or Kalista and Skarner.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YHWH Adonai","date":"2018-06-21T18:13:48.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terozu,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uBnpQiQL,comment-id=00000004,timestamp=2018-06-21T17:38:02.370+0000)\n>\n> They wouldn&#x27;t make millions off a champ who has a 1.2% playrate...\n\nI understand, but Aurelion has literally one skin.

I wanted to edit last part of text to explain how I would see those skins because I somehow forgot about it, but I wonder now about it. I mean those are just inspirations.

This character has so much potential. His base skin is already extremly beautuful. Any serious skin would look majestic, awesome and mind blowing. Funny skins would be really great on this character too but we are waiting so long for Aurelion skins that definitely some of us want to have something absolutely mind blowing first. If Rito would make some skin similar to Ultimate Lux's skin for Aurelion I'm pretty sure they would be rich in no time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Star Placinăm","date":"2018-06-21T08:37:46.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EquyNoxius,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uBnpQiQL,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2018-06-21T08:36:23.860+0000)\n>\n> I think any **serious** theme would look super cool on him to be honest !\n\nAka I would be extremely disappointed if he were to get a goofy skin like pool party.
