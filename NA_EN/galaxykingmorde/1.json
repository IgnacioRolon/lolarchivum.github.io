They also aim at even lanes, to tip the balance. Your first death at minute 2,3,20,4,4,2 creates a pattern where the jungler would generally not want to go to your lane.\n\nYour CS is generally fine, so you have room to sacrifice. Recall more often, which will sacrifice some CS, but it can prevent giving kills to the enemy team. You'll make your lane more attractive for your jungler. They may be able to help you get more kills early, which will give you the ability to catch back up on the farm you sacrificed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2020-01-07T12:36:49.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope I'm never on the same team as you.
