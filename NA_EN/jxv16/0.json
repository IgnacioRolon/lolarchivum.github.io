I've tried re-installing league multiple times, and sometimes i even get a blue screen. I've tried to fix this for about a week but with no luck I've run out of options. I'm hoping a rioter can shed some light on what i could do, as i've followed nearly every step in the trouble-shooting guide.  Hopefully someone has a solution, Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T03:53:48.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where does the patcher seem to fail during the process and when you say blue screen, do you mean a windows blue screen or the client is just a blank screen?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JXV16","date":"2017-02-14T02:28:39.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanted to give this a bump hoping i can get a response from riot.","replies":[]}]}
