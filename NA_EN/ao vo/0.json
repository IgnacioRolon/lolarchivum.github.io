On my other PC, I had unlocked multiple ward skins. I recently bought a bundle that came with a ward skin, and wanting to try it out, I equipped it. The day after, I switched over to this PC because my other had Hard Drive problems. Once I downloaded league on this PC, I wanted to use some of my other wards, but I only saw the option to equip the last ward I had equipped from my other PC, and the default ward. I had looked all around the league client but couldn't find anything that had anything to do with this problem, besides buying other wards, which I was not interested in.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If anyone could help with this problem, that would great\r\n@AoVo","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T17:52:42.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reports, friends!  This is a known issue that we're looking into.  Specifically, some ward skins are not selectable even though they're unlocked on the account.  We'll be posting updates on this on our [server status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.  I hope this news helps bring some relief!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Isanaki","date":"2016-08-11T03:46:47.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ward skins have also disappeared.
