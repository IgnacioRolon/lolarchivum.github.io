Before an average league game used to take around 30-50 MB of data but recently and by recently I mean for few months it has been consuming tremendous amount of data! When I was in my hostel where we only had 2 GB data usage daily, I used to get time to play only 1 game a night and it would take around 30-40MB UPLOAD and 300+ MB Download data, consuming in total over ~400 MB Of data per game. I thought this might be some problem about my college net so I waited till I got home. At home I have 16 mbps speed and 125 GB limit per month and unlimited after that but with 512 kbps and I am playing league nearly every day around 10-15 games per day.  I am the only one who uses the net at home. My parents and sibling combined would even hardly use 1-2 GB per month. But as we get updates when our data limit is gonna get depleted soon, I got the notification that 90 GB has been used in just 12 days. I checked the data usage they showed me and it strictly showed a regulated 350~500 MB consumption of data  for a 40-50 minute stretch which fits perfectly with the league games. Keeping youtube videos(360p), surfing aside and combining the usage of the said activities for 12 days to around 10 GB at max, even then 80 GB data was consumed by league in just 12 days. Now my speed has been reduced tremendously and I can't even play properly. I played a game, it started okay but then my screen kept freezing, my ping was the same and fps was 50-60 but still I kept lagging and then obviously even lost the game. Tried another game and the client started lagging at the champ select and because I couldn't select the champ I got kicked out of the queue.  I had a lot of work to do as well which required high speed net &amp; data which has been halted due to this as I have to ask for more data until the 11th of June when my data limit gets refreshed :/ \r\nI've been playing league since 2011 and don't want to quit playing it. I would be highly obliged if anyone could help with the said problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Kruger92","date":"2017-11-03T16:54:54.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting the exact same problem on my GF's mac. we had no problem a week ago with ping and bandwidth usage or anything. Now all of a sudden her macbook pro is using 300 KB/s while LoL is open. Not even in game, it's just constantly using 300KB/s. I have a wifi monitor so I can see who is using how much so It's not anyone's phone or something like that. When we use activity monitor>network on her mac it shows LoL is using all the bandwidth. restarting it doesnt help. wtffffffffff our ping is over 800 when we play now...","replies":[{"poster":"Kruger92","date":"2017-11-03T17:39:10.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resolved this issue from another thread.

Even with preserving your data, you might want to reach out to your ISP to see if there could be any upgrades or plans more accommodating for you.  You are also playing from a very far distance, and no matter how much you troubleshoot it can't exceed the limitations of being overseas.  Would it be possible to transfer to a closer region to see if that can alleviate some of this pain?","replies":[{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2017-05-24T06:51:05.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel this guys pain! I'm in exactly the same situation. And if he is playing off an Apple machine, there are no accessible servers in Asia with Mac support (depending on exactly where you are located: Japan is IP locked, Korea requires region specific details; Thailand and Singapore Garena don't support Mac). I wish Riot would ditch Garena and set up their own servers....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-05-23T19:04:34.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First thing I am thinking is that you are uploading/streaming while playing, possibly without knowing it. Is your xbox or windows gamebar or something active and streaming it?\n\nLeague typically uses about 10,000 bits/sec at most when play (10kb/sec, average game 30 minutes long = 18 Mb)\n\nIf you open up your task manager and go to the \"Performance\" at the bottom you can click \"Open Resource Monitor\". Under the Network tab of the RM you can sort by data (I do it by total). Do that during your next game and see if League is actually eating the bandwidth or something else is","replies":[]},{"poster":"nubbest","date":"2017-05-23T18:08:28.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got accounts on EUW as well but all my friends are on NA :( The ping is not an issue, I am perfectly fine playing at 250 ping here but the issue was with the data consumption because I have played League before at the same location and it didn't consume this much data as I stated before. If there could be any steps or way to tackle this problem as if it was possible to play this game for 4-5years with only 30-40 mb data consumption, there must be some way to bring it back to it?  \nI tried again to play a blind pick game. I opened up client no issues, the chats working, the news loaded up, I queue for the game, I click accept then when it takes me to the screen I see this. I can chat but cannot select or see any champions. \n[Screenshot](https://ibb.co/eONdxa)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T18:34:08.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info and screenshot!  This specific issue is usually related to a connection problem, but not necessarily just ping.  Something else could be causing this degradation from a more local source, so just to be safe I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to clear up anything that could be causing it.  Make sure to test it out in a custom game to be sure.  The connection guide might be able to help with data consumption, but beyond that you may need to reach out to your ISP for options.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}
