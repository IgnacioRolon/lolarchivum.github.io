I tried to do it in \"attack move click\" but it wouldn't let me bind left mouse button. \r\n\r\n1.5) I'd like to bind the normal left click then, to a different key as well. where is that too? I didn't see it in the menu... maybe i am foolish ;) \r\n\r\n\r\n2) Is there a way to make it so that I cannot bring up the chat to type in it? I want to be unable to type in chat - it is a bad habit I have - I don't really flame but it seriously distracts me to think about typing. \r\n\r\n3) There is a new option to ping \"enemy warded here\" but I need to set it to a binding - where is that?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-19T15:58:36.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The recent patch allowed mouse buttons to be swapped!  While in-game, select Hotkeys in the options menu and scroll all the way to to bottom.  You will see the option there.  :D  It's not possibly to modify reserved bindings beyond that, though.\n\nIt's not currently possible to disable chat, but you can move it off screen.  You can also use /mute all to prevent seeing anyone's chat.  Just keep in mind that even if off screen or muted, you can still hit enter to chat.\n\nThe Enemy Warded Here ping is available in your Hotkeys menu.  You'll find it under Communications, and will need to bind the function!","replies":[{"poster":"lofi n chillhop","date":"2017-08-26T20:33:02.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks\n\ndarn about the chat.
