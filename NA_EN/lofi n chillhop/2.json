So there's very little I care to get anymore, since BE can not get skins or ward skins except a very small selection that doesn't look appealing to me as a player. \r\nAnd I'm sure there's a way for me to spam blue essence to open random skin shards and then unlock them, but that is not attractive to me at all since, as I own all champs, so I'm just going to get random skins I don't like on champs I don't care to play. \r\n\r\nso I have a few questions\r\n\r\n1) since I own all champs, is the level up reward just going to basically give me more useless BE, or am I gonna get skins now? \r\n2) is there any plan to implement more options for blue essence purchases down the line? \r\n3) is my \"reward for spending so much RP on runes and skins\" basically a useless reward and therefore an actual insult instead by its pretending to matter at all??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-08T16:34:24.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your specific circumstance is a rare one, and your feedback is certainly good for our devs to consider.

Same goes for me, honestly. If i do understand that right; is it actually the case, that the chests we're supposed to get on level up are only champs, not any skins?\nIn this case, all my cumulated BE will be sitting where they are for quite some time, only getting more and more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lofi n chillhop","date":"2017-11-09T16:01:02.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=HnRAHmej,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-08T16:34:24.494+0000)\n>\n> Your specific circumstance is a rare one, and your feedback is certainly good for our devs to consider.

Make sure to let your voice be heard!\n\ngive us a way to turn BE into RP, even if it's expensive lol. like 5k be = ???? rp. I don't know the math of what is worth what, but like if I have 40 BE for the purchases, what's 10% of how much money I put in? idek. probably a lot higher than you'd want to exchange BE for RP for, so let's say 40k BE is 10$ worth of RP and then make it in purchases of like 5k or something so it scales to anyone with a ton of BP. 5k BE = 350 RP? that'd be very cool. But, again, I don't know the math, so maybe something higher is fair too.\n\nif you guys do it right, it's enough to make us excited for the exchange rate, but just under enough that when grinding for RP we just buy RP too. so for people like me who are stingy it's just a cute little help that doesn't really affect you, but for most people it's just a way to trick 'em into wanting to buy more RP ;) \n\ny'all need to learn how to impliment monetary discounts that actually earn you money 'cause it gives people a reason to spend money. makes us feel good 'cause it's a discount, but it still ends up with money in your pocket.
