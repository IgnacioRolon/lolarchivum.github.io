So I recently just finished updating league of legends patch 7.12, and everything ran smoothly. But when I opened league again, it had a yellow exclamation mark saying log in issues. My client is in 7.12 but the events and skins are not here and I still have the caitlyn and trynd skins as the latest. Please help on how I can get to the new update, I really want to buy the nightbringer skin and try the events","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T22:05:04.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can verify that you're on the current patch (7.12) on the bottom right of the client.
