Even worse than the release of Kalista in my eyes.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have taken time off on the game because of the frustration each patch gives me. This does not help at all.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser, marveled as one of League of Legend&#039;s most creative Champions in its earliest stages of the game, has been ruined. He lost all of his identity, he lost all of his power, he lost his true strengths in lane. For what? For a buff?\r\n\r\nNo, I say it is for CertainlyT&#039;s entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis guy has created disgusting champions like Thresh and Yasuo. Kalista was personally the last straw pulled out of the cup for me. I could not believe an abomination like her could have been released. All my friends who have also played this game for years on years also think all of his champions are pure crap in terms of balance, nearly all of them quit, only the ones who spent thousands still play this game. No matter how weak their numbers are, CertainlyT&#039;s champions seem to be viable anyway.\r\n\r\nCertainlyT&#039;s champions are even more stupid than release Vlad who can literally walk into lane and ult a Teemo and the Teemo would die. At least he was nerfed, same with Xin Zhao and LeBlanc close to their releases.\r\n\r\nBut since this guy &quot;touched up&quot; an old champion that I have known and loved since I have started, I just felt like I had to say something.\r\n\r\nI loved what Riot did to champions like Garen and Ashe: they keep their identity while buffing them, tweaked their skills to maintain that identity, and they do not lose anything in the process.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser literally lost everything. CertainlyT just sneezed out his old skills into &quot;newer&quot; ones that do not help out the problems he had previously at all. The funnier part is that CertainlyT did not even TRY to take care of his mobility issues which was basically the only reason why he has been weak, instead he enhances his melee strength (his Q of all things) and pushes everything else aside.\r\n\r\nThe absolute worst part is that CertainlyT gave 0 fucks of what anyone said. He did not give any reason to what he did to Mordekaiser. He did not even try to defend himself. It is as if he knows he has done something wrong and said &quot;fuck it, we&#039;re doing it live&quot;. In my eyes, this shows no effort and that he thinks he has the &quot;divine right&quot; to make champions, no one else can have a say at all.\r\n\r\nI really do hope that Riot does something around reverting this rework to the old state of Mordekaiser, then taking care of some mobility issues he has in a more sensible way, rather than shoving and forcing him to go bot lane like a paper bag.","replies":[{"poster":"luckmallory","date":"2015-08-24T21:26:35.566+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"To be fair he has the highest win percentage of any ADC in the game right now.

I mean, what identity he had. Steal souls for a shield. That's still here. People just don't like his W.\n\nYou never played Morde pre-rework didn't you?\n\nMordekaiser identity was hyper pusher champion negating all incoming poke while poking down his lane opponents and making them hug a turret. He was a champion who was scaling extremely well with items, becoming an insta-burst champion as the game went on. Being near full build Morde meant death (unless you were a tank). He's burst was instant: whenever somebody was in range, you just bursted him. All of his abilities were meaningful, his Q dealt a lot of damage, his E dealt a lot of damage, his W (after patch 5.4) allowed you to enter teamfight after your tank engaged. Or run away by casting it on ally in front of you. Or even help your allies run away. Or just give those 30 bonus tank stats to your teammate and yourself. Or just increase your damage in 1v1 scenarios.\n\nRight now, he lost everything. He can't push lane so well anymore. His only good ability when it comes to damage is Q. He scales horribly with items, with only Q having insane damage while his other abilities are worthless. His W, as we all know, now needs an ally to be even casted. And it doesn't give tank stats anymore. His E damage was completely gutted, making it the most pathetic spell in the game. His burst isn't even instant like before. Now, even if you are near Morde, it doesn't mean you are instantly dead, because he has to have his Q charged to 3rd strike to be able to deal ANY damage. The only part of his identity he maintained is his no mobility and no CC, which is complete sh*t when you look how he is even more dependant on those 2 things than before. I'll quote my favorite youtuber and say:\n\n> This thing is total f*ckin' gar-b*tch.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-08-24T21:27:30.567+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dont see how an ability that is instant death on a champion whose main gimmick is ''Become a ball of stats by out-leveling the enemy ADC and close before the 25 minutes mark.

Now Q is only just retarded and gimps everything else in his kit for it's power including morde's play style. W requires you to have a baby sitter and E doesn't even feel good because of the crappy damage and rapid shield decay rate.

Before I would never imagine that. It is a really cool concept in itself.\n\nHe literally threw shards of metal around his allies and gains a shield based on his damage. Just imagine it, throwing shards of metal around your own minions. It's hilarious.\n\nHis shield in general drew me in too, it is an extremely creative tool that he had to survive in lane. \n\nHis Q was fun to use, smashing a mace to become smaller maces, his E was just fun to cast in lane and make your enemies cry.\n\nI also loved that he had glaring weaknesses. The sacrifice for having his shield in lane is that his skills had HP costs. He was also hard countered by being kited, but punishes if the enemy team lets him in close. Edit: to add, remember Regrowth Pendant? All Mordes bought that item first to try to counteract the HP costs. Ah the good days.\n\nMaking flash plays with Mordekaiser was fun as well, I done it all the time.\n\nAlso, the fact that in season 2-3 I did Morde jungle for fun (note: requiring his W) while maxing out his Q (only with friends of course), usually going bot lane for fun as a support, and still going in solo lanes with him was also fun as hell too.\n\nNow, only one of those is even close to viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-24T22:52:54.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We have a very similar view of early Morde.  I greatly enjoyed how Creeping Death caused fear in my lane opponent when minions would give chase and Mace of Spades was always cool to land that long range echo for damage under tower.\n\nAfter a year or so of playing however I feel my feelings changed for him if ever so slightly.  His Siphon of Destruction just started to feel, for lack of a better word, dry.  Breaking down how the ability worked it was just a 'point and deal damage' spell.  Thats...kinda boring for a hulking suit of armor and not at all fun for a new player to experience since no place in game was there any way to know it was a cone attack if you hadn't encountered the champion before.  \n\nHis Q also started to feel bad for me.  Never really feeling threatening after the laning phase unless I picked up a Lichbane for the on hit proc.  Even then it was after a hefty set of purchases in AP that it felt good but always boiled down to 'point to death' being the better option.\n\nLastly his passive.  Just never felt meaningful after laning and his survive-ability dropped hard if hit with any CC.  I have no problem with that but isnt that weakness supposed to be for assassins?  A massive suit of armor shouldn't explode because it was hit with anything less than excessive damage. \n\nThe rework as of now feels like it fills out how Morde looked like he should have played.  Alittle CC can deter him, but its not explicitly his end like old Morde and I'm loving how tanky he feels, even when I've fallen behind in lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ztevano","date":"2015-08-25T00:10:01.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can not agree more, it shows an absolute disconnect from the integrity of what defines each champion and everything that is the game.
