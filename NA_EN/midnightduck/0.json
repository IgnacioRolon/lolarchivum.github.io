However, I do not know how to go about this as one of the golden rules is no account, product, or service promotion. I assume this applies to streams doing giveaway deals to subscribers. In short, I want to advertise an RP giveaway event but do not know if this is OK. Could any mods clarify?\r\n\r\n-Duck","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-12T07:05:23.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Streams & Videos here would be the appropriate place to discuss such a stream if it was allowed, but I'd say the place to discuss whether that was the case would be the [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) section. Alternatively, you could talk to a mod in private on the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification). Since it's a general request for clarification of the rules rather than some kind of dispute, I would lean toward the former option, so everyone can benefit from seeing the answer. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Midnightduck","date":"2018-12-12T07:20:00.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback KFCeytron, Ill make another post there as well!
