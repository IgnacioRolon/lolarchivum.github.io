However I maintained gold per min higher then our ADC, and ganked and counter ganked MULTIPLE TIMES.\r\n\r\n   \"Content: and you get reported for using gp jg in diamond\"\r\n\"xContent: and thats why you dont break meta\"\r\n\"xKnightmares: GP jg is bad jg\"\r\n\r\n    Its kinda hard to gank an already 3-0 lane by 5 mins in because YOU decided GP jungle is {{champion:48}}  out of pure ignorance.  \r\n\r\n I just think it is so sad that OUR community is now based around what 20 champs the LC$ \"says\" is meta.  There are endless combo's with the MAMMOTH champion pool, how come I am consistently running into this kind of bs?\r\n\r\n ** How can we fix this?**\r\n\r\n   _Ill spell this out for the reading impaired...This is not a conversation about my stats in game.  The stats of GP as jungle or anything specifically related to game play or balance about the champion or my PERSONAL game play are all moot points and hold NO BEARING what so ever to the question above.  I expect 2-3 idiots to post in relevance to GP jungle, or my personal match history...also about 30 thumbs down because is stated \"LC$\" so instead of educating and replying with viable conversation they'll thumbs down and feel accomplished....p.s... its like 80% of our community that sucks....the other 20% know exactly what i am saying.\r\n  _","replies":[{"poster":"CliffordK0","date":"2015-04-08T02:59:31.226+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"an easy way to avoid this is just to treat your team like bots and not talk to them, happens in my league too but you just gotta let em know with pings and thats it. maybe 1 or 2 sentences regarding play, but other than that, look after your own elo if thats what your after\n\nalso you got to think about composition, engages and cc, maybe your team was looking for cc that a sej can offer, and maybe your GP ult is all that contributes to an easier gank, food for thought","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2015-04-08T18:04:45.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry this happened to you, but I seriously doubt those reports will mean anything.\n\nWhile there is value in looking to the pros--they will, in general, play some very good champions in ways that we can learn from--of course that doesn't mean that we should _only_ pick what the pros pick.

I have been a member since April 09'.  After LC$ came about the community turned into a FLAME troll hulk smash in your face, staff stopped listening or even actively posting on the forums, and then server tenacity went down as they expanded their imo\"RIGGED\" show.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-08T17:54:01.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna point out that almost everything is viable in the lcs atm, so, yeah\n\nScrubs gonna scrub","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-08T17:35:16.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Peasant, please.
