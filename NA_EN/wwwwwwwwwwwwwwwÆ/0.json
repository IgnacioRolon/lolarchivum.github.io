Conclusion was that since old LB was highly problematic too that wasn&#039;t the right call, creating additional work, balance cost and disruption without getting her closer to the right long term changes.\n\nIronically, balancing old LeBlanc would create &quot;additional work&quot; but they&#039;ve been dragging on a rework for months. \n\nI have a slight problem with his post: He did not indicate which aspects of her kit were problematic. \n\nI guarantee he was referring to her old WQR poke, but that&#039;s easily fixable. Just shift mark/detonation damage from 50/50 to 40/60 or less. Give her a minor buff to mana costs/W AP ratio/W radius/chain CC duration/anything to keep her overall strength similar and voila.\n\nSome other &#039;problems&#039; he might&#039;ve been referring to are her QW trading and late game insta-oneshots. LeBlanc&#039;s QW **is not an automatically won trade.** Instead of running away, enemies can easily trade once her skills are on CD. Watch Faker&#039;s 0/0/1 LeBlanc trade with a 0/1/0 Viktor. [Guess who wins?](https://youtu.be/C7LrvozHlRo?t=5m8s) Maybe this is a greater problem in lower elos. But if Riot doesn&#039;t want low elo lane bullies, shouldn&#039;t Darius have been changed too?\n\nAs for instant oneshots, I think that was a defining aspect of her gameplay. LeBlanc, unlike other assassins, has no on-demand invisibility or untargetability and compensated by being fast. Despite Riot&#039;s vision, being fast and fluid (i.e. not deception) was the _core element of her gameplay_. You could tell who was a good LeBlanc player by how smooth and decisive they could make her look. Faker was regarded as the best LeBlanc player because he could manipulate the champion with such ease and precision, **not because he was good at deceiving with her**. He knew the ins and outs of the champion better than anyone. [Is this not one of the most hype pentakills you&#039;ve seen?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqPI5fI-3E8)\n\nNow, I have trouble differentiating between a good and great LeBlanc player. What even makes a good LeBlanc player? Whether they choose to mimic R(E) instead of R(Q)? The placement of their R(R) clone? LeBlanc is so boring to watch and much less exciting to play. Faker&#039;s signature champion is gone. If you gave me an anonymous gameplay video, I wouldn&#039;t be able to tell you if that was Faker or any other Challenger/Master tier player playing.\n\n> without getting her closer to the right long term changes.\n\nIf by &quot;long term changes&quot; they mean counterplay, counterplay is not simply an indicator that states *I will deal damage to you in x seconds.* Old LeBlanc had well defined weaknesses such as lack of waveclear, high mana costs, dashing into melee range for early trades and waveclear, and weakness against grouped teams. This rework exchanged all that for new Sigil. Her new passive made her much stronger and arguably even more unhealthy than her old state.\n\nThe biggest controversy is that LeBlanc was reworked for the sake of change, not to make her any more satisfying to play. If you look at other reworked champs (such as Poppy, Fiora, Sion, Galio, etc.), they all had small playerbases and (debatably) low skillcaps. Most importantly, they were champions that the majority of players agreed needed to be reworked. Their reworks made their kits more satisfying and interactive. LeBlanc had a large playerbase and high skillcap, and, in particular, was agreed to _not need a rework_. By many&#039;s standards, the new LeBlanc is much less satisfying to play/play against and is less interactive.\n\nHere is a list of [high elo player opinions on old vs reworked LeBlanc](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeBlancMains/comments/6q7ww8/compilation_of_high_elo_player_opinions_on_leblanc/).\n\nThe complete lack of transparency/justification from Rioters makes me feel like nobody at Riot plays her, so nobody understands how she's really supposed to work. Over the years, the archetype of the champion grew to be fast, fluid ranged AP assassin. Instead of embracing this facet, it was actually removed with the justification of \"deception\" shoved down her throat. In one fell swoop, the LB playerbase was alienated because people played her to be an assassin, not a deceiver.\n\nFunny enough, I don't even feel as though I deceive the enemy when they accidentally blow a cooldown on my R(Q/W/E) clone. It feels like luck/enemy misplay. R(R) is just a glorified blue trinket and skillshot blocker. It doesn't fool anyone above plat.\n\nphroxz0n, ricklessabandon, Meddler, 20thCenturyFaux, please give this a read as you prepare for the upcoming LeBlanc changes. \n\nMuch appreciated, {{champion:7}} mains everywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"BleKz","date":"2017-07-29T00:27:07.426+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":5,"body":"I second this man! I'll post my thoughts on LeBlanc here\n\nFirst of all, I wanna compare new LeBlanc with old LeBlanc\n\nLeBlanc's kit is about to roam and snowball early/midgame and finish the game as fast as possible, you don’t wanna commit into lategame teamfights, so you have to do your job starting at laning phase :\nLeBlanc's old laning phase was about having kill pressure onto the enemy midlaner, not allowing him to get in range for Q,W so a lot of mindgames were involved there, you didn't have good waveclear, so your roaming capability was based around how good you could zone your opponent and take that time you created as an advantage to roam.\nNew LeBlanc's laning phase is about landing W on minions (and maybe opponent if slightly miss positions), Q the wave and enjoy a free roam because you cleared the wave before the enemy could do anything, meaning no skill nor counterplay exist here\nLet’s get into the midgame :\nOld LeBlanc needed to use W aggressively in order to get kills and start her snowball, going even when midgame started was almost never an option and you had to take risks by W'ing the enemy back lane, meaning you really had to be skilled and know what you are doing\nNew LeBlanc uses W as a repositioning tool, since her damage no longer belongs to that ability, meaning the enemy team can't punish LeBlanc miss plays, because she can't even do miss plays (for the most part) Also, her new kit allows to start snowballing just for getting your core items, no matter if you are behind, meaning even less risk and skill is needed in order to get to your beloved midgame, where you can just roflstomp the enemy team\nLategame : If you get to lategame even with the enemy midlaner (unless it is another lane bully) playing any version of LeBlanc you already lost your winning condition at the middle lane, but lets keep going\nOld LeBlanc had to severely commit for aoe damage and almost always exploded if focused correctly, so she had to play very carefully against the enemy team and search for risky flanks onto the back lane\nNew LeBlanc always has that W, RW, W, Q combo (with no counterplay btw coz you spawn clone with RW and they can't target you) that has an unavoidable 1.6 + base damage aoe ap ratio, you also can just play like a peeling champ and stay with your adc since your chain + passive deals enough damage to defend them, again, because you don't need W for anything else than reposition yourself.\n\"healthier\" means how can you interact with a champ in the game itself, not in a rotation of spells, so, imo, old LeBlanc is a better way to start working on her\nSo basically, here are my thoughts (and for the most part all of the LeBlanc mains out there)\n\nShe shouldn’t have bounces on minions, needs less waveclear\nShe doesn’t feel like an assassin anymore, and she was really the only ranged assassin in the game (maybe ahri but she is more like an hybrid), that’s because you don’t have to be melee range anymore with the new kit and the passive\nPassive damage is busted, making other abilities underwhelming to use, basically everything seems like a form of applying passive\nMax Q is boring and unhealthy, not against point and click nukes, but not as core ability\nR-Spell interactions are frustrating to play against because the clone is so random and doesn’t really fit the deceiver theme, it’s more like “lol 50/50 clone or me”\nW should be the core ability, it’s what makes LeBlanc LeBlanc, but actually… well, you know what happened to W\nNew rework created a lot of good combos, but without being so sigil of malice reliant the champ could be even better\n\nI would like to see something like this as her passive : out of combat, you spawn a LeBlanc clone that goes by your side and mimics everything you do, until you damage an enemy. This way, you’ll have to juke opponents, miss positioning yourself intentionally when entering a fight so they would think your clone is actually you, I think it’s a nice idea (at least on paper)\n\n\nNO MORE BULLSHIT WAVECLEAR MAGE, NO MORE MOBILE DISRUPTOR, GIVE US OUR ASSASSIN LEBLANC BACK!","replies":[]},{"poster":"droolfang","date":"2017-07-29T11:54:50.170+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"If they reverted it, and made Q/R(Q) do 40/60 on the proc, (40 on inital so it does little dmg like akali q, 60 when u pop it) or reduced dmg if you pop a sigil with another sigil, get rid of the WAVECLEAR SHE DIDN'T NEED (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) & remove the current passive, she will be fine.

This rework exchanged all that for new Sigil. Her new passive made her much stronger and arguably even more unhealthy than her old state.\n\nBecause her combo had little to no counterplay. For a class that's high skill cap, high risk, high reward and all about \"sick outplays\", they weren't very subject to being outplayed themselves. Unless you had a displacement, there was very little you could do other than \"don't be in range\". Her problems were mechanical issues, not her macro weaknesses.\n\nAs for waveclear, LeBlancs was fine. It just had the same drawback Fizz E does being that if you use it you put your high CD damage and escape ability on cooldown. Mana costs are irrelevant past first back now, I wouldn't want to see old LB in today's League. Dashing into Melee range isn't that big of a deal when you can blink back instantly (ex: why Zed got his instant R blink removed) short of diving 1v5 when they have all their cooldowns up. And a weakness against grouped enemies is something all Assassins shared.\n\nAssassins needed a paradigm better than farming their laner early game, and while the Assassin Update was hit or miss on that, they definitely missed the mark with LeBlanc which is why they're going back to her and a revert is not the correct action.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2017-07-29T11:32:09.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Now tell me, what's Kata's E W gunblade Q E E E E counterplay right now?

Fizz's ult is extremely hard to dodge at max range (it covers 70% of a lane in width) and on top of the huge damage it deals, you're also displaced and slowed so you can't run from his full combo. Yes, he has to wait to proc W, but he has all the tools to over extend a fight and win it anyway.\n\nAs you can see, there are still a lot of assassins that delete people in a second.

All that was needed to play kat before was macro knowledge. You just had to watch for cc and wait to go in and if you could do that you would get fed pretty easy. Katarina's old kit didn't demand any mechanical skill from her players outside of quick reflexes to utilize your resets effectively. With new Kat you have to do everything that you had to before and then some. Her old kit was super binary and had alll her damage on \"uninteractive\" skills. Q and E are targeted and W and R were just click for damage. Now a large portion of her damage is centered in her daggers. If she can't hit enemies with her daggers then she loses A LOT of her damage, especially in the later stages of the game. Her daggers have a huge AP ratio, but her Q and E don't really scale that well alone, not to mention her ult still has its same glaring weakness to hard cc, which can sometimes be hard to avoid against coordinated teams or in late game 5v5 fights. I'd say she is just as high stakes as before considering her damage is much more delayed and spread out than before so if she gets caught or goes in at the wrong time she arguably feels worse than before. \n\nI get so tilted by the baby ragers who still think that she's a \"faceroll, no skill, brainless champ\".

I addressed each of her supposedly unfair combos were fixable or counterable.\n\nThe thing with LeBlanc is that she was an all-or-nothing champion, meaning if the enemy successfully facetanked her combo (either via shielding, building MR, etc.) or juked her E, LeBlanc was useless for the next ~20s or so because she failed to accomplish her task. \n\nI heavily disagree with the sentiment that every burst champion needs a bright, delayed, damage indicator. LB's old playstyle filled a niche which no longer exists.\n\nHigh elo players had no problem playing against the champion because they sufficiently studied or played against her enough times. I think as an Ahri main, LB feels inherently annoying to play against.\n\n> Mana costs are irrelevant past first back now\n\nYou're heavily underrating the effect of mana costs. Pre-first back is extremely influential to whether LeBlanc snowballs or not. Lost Chapter is also not a end-all fix to mana costs. Watch some of Faker's old LB gameplays and see how mana cost limits his pressure.\n\n> Dashing into Melee range isn't that big of a deal when you can blink back instantly\n\nIt's fairly significant. Probably less so if you're playing against lower elo players/players with slow reaction times. Morgana/Kassadin/Syndra were heralded as LB counters because she had to dash into melee range. \n\nThe difference with Zed is that he can outplay a lot of damage by going untargetable. LeBlanc's dash is interruptable (see Syndra), and its travel time plays a large role. Remember when LB W speed got reduced to 1300? She was trash tier.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-07-29T04:32:58.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"W into range QRE was the more fair one most of the time but still felt unfair due to Q and RQ being point and click while doing most of the damage. Even if she missed the E it was enough damage to force someone out of a fight or recall.\n\nMy biggest grievance was QRW in laning phase post 6, or QW pre 6. It did outrageous amounts of damage for the time frame of the game and there was nothing short of having a displacement (not something a lot of mids have) or staying out of range, that you could do to prevent it. Even if you CC her she'll still get the damage through and, depending on who you are, win the trade using her W blink to avoid your retaliation or  just straight out damage you. I know you'll point out the Viktor clip again but Viktor shielded a decent portion of the damage and got a lot of free autos in.\n\n---\n\nThere's a difference in \"bright, delayed, damage indicator\" and just having something you can do to fight back or avoid most of the damage. Artificial gating like new LB has isn't good, but instant burst with little you can do about it isn't the right answer either.\n\n---\n\nShe was still definitely good in high ELO though (and pro play for that matter), and still likely annoying to play against. Just people won more games against her.\n\n---\n\nPre first back also has a lot of Mana that you get just for leveling up. Honestly as long as you don't spam spells, I find early game the easiest to manage Mana between Doran's + level up Mana.  I'd also rather not watch anything Faker, thanks.\n\n---\n\nMorgana has E to neuter all-ins, not just her Q. Dashing melee range into a melee champion designed to counter your class type is never a good idea. Syndra is one of the few mids to have have a displacement, let alone on a basic ability, to stop her E and LeBlanc can't outplay Syndra R. The travel time is very important. It's speed is the difference between being able to react with any spell (almost impossible to reactively CC if you have a standard cast time) and her being trash. The only reason you'd get to CC her W is if you predict it (not hard tbh), or to CC her after since she has to stay long enough to QRE.","replies":[{"poster":"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWÆ","date":"2017-07-29T04:52:34.599+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You raise some good points.\n\n> felt unfair due to Q and RQ being point and click while doing most of the damage.

Give respect or be ready for LeBlanc to punish.\n\nAs for QW, I can't suggest much else than to run 9x MR blues and abuse the fact LeBlanc's primary damage/waveclear/mobility tool is on CD. Many champions like Ahri, Syndra, Orianna have primary damage spells on lower cooldowns than LeBlanc W, which you can use to poke her when she goes to farm. Even if you can't damage LeBlanc when her W is on CD, shoving her into tower is an option. Junglers also should be looking to gank right when LB uses W. \n\nAnyway, the point I'm trying to make is that when taken at face value, QW looks and feels super oppressive to play against. While there aren't many ways to directly outplay it (barring Syndra), players don't realize that they can take advantage of LeBlanc being weak while W is on CD.\n\nMany players also don't understand how to give up CS.

If the severity is high enough you can get zoned off XP too. The thing with Syndra and Ori though is that you can avoid most of their damage without Flash. Hell, you can even use minions to reduce Ori's damage, unlike LeBlanc's main early damage (no E). There's just not a lot you can do to avoid LeBlanc's damage.\n\n---\n\nThe thing with LeBlanc is that she's basically the only Assassin who's ranged since Ahri's changes. Other Assassins are vulnerable to ranged harass in a ranged dominated lane. While other Assassins can have similar pressure to old LeBlanc, like a well played Zed 70-0'ing someone pre-6, or how Talon has an insane level 2 powerspike, even Kat does even though its been heavily nerfed (AA reset on E), it doesn't feel oppressive to die to them like that because their laner can harass them and not feel like they can't do anything to them. But old LeBlanc enjoyed the safety of ranged while have similar kill pressure all while having the least counterplay to it.\n\nYou just have to play like a bitch, and no one wants to do that even if its the correct play.

Good players understand the range of LB W and can skirt just on the edge. There are many spells that have higher range than LeBlanc's spells, which let you poke her without her being able to retaliate.\nExamples: laning phase in [game 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MelcmJAELU8), [game 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axUDaE_mXD4)\n\nYou might say that you \"go first\" in some turn-based RPG, and, if you play correctly, you always get more turns than LeBlanc.\n\n> I mean, either way is a victory for her, albeit a CS lead is smaller. \n\nLeBlanc is designed to win early game.

LeBlanc, unlike other assassins, has no on-demand invisibility or untargetability and compensated by being fast. \n\n\nLeblanc is compensated by having the highest on demand mobility among assassins, having her whole kit basically be ranged (which makes her mobility doubly potent) besides her mobility spell damage and a hard CC on a basic ability.\n\nCompared to Fizz who is entirely melee outside of ultimate and less mobility (NO PORT BACK on same spell/double E).  That is why fizz has untargetability.  Leblanc should spend extended time in retaliation range if she is to be a ranged champion with that much mobility.\n\nMuch like Zed needs to have the 1 second delay before port back on ult, Leblanc needs the same thing.

Leblanc currently does not.\n\n\nThe great thing about leblanc not being an assassin means riot can create AP assassin items (which they couldn't before) and slap melee only tags on them to prevent ranged abuse as all AP assassins are melee.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2017-07-29T11:37:49.719+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed doesn't have to wait 1s, it's like 0.5s. \nLB has to wait 0.25 to reactivate W, and this change alone made her extremely clunky.\nAlso, Zed is untargetable when ulting and he has a mobility spell too, which is W.

Someone has to be at like 1/2 health or so to even be in range of lethal (assuming an average game) and that's just the carries. You could argue that \"oh well its only fair because she has the ridiculous mobility to escape and she can just w back after her combo with no coutnerplay\". Yeah, you wanna know another champion that can do the same? Zed. Except Zed on the other hand has a lethal range around 7/8 health on carries. It may not seem like much, but its a HUGE difference, especially come late game where adcs get bloodthirster and such and just heal back half their healthbar. On top of this, just as LeBlanc can just \"w back\" Zed can just press R, or even w with the e reset. I'm not saying that Zed is broken. I think he is quite strong with the lethality changes. But I think that LeBlanc (in her current state) a complete nightmare to balance. And I mean that her kit is just intrinsically stupid. Why should she have the waveclear of Viktor but at an earlier point? Why should she have so much mobility? Why does she have a snare that can''t even be flashed out of?

The points he highlights are valid, yet they really only apply when the enemy doesn't know how to play against a champion.\n\nSure, Fizz is a 3/10 when players don't know how to play against him, but as soon as they learn his power spikes, how to abuse his cooldowns, and his approximate damage output, he becomes easily manageable. The same applies with LeBlanc.\n\nRiot is making assassins more noob-friendly by showing a 'build-up' of damage before large burst happens (i.e. LeBlanc passive, Fizz W). I don't think this is the right direction because learning how to play against old assassins was a great way to learn microplay: abusing cooldowns, respecting zones of control, learning champion mechanics, etc.\n\nNow, all players have to do is BTFO whenever they see that build-up of damage.
