Which leaves me to my main concern which would be the tweaking of Janna possibly the nerfs that may come as she will be a more contested pick due to her countering every assassin that set foot into league. So now that I&#039;m done I want to know what riot thinks of her state is she balanced strong or too strong?

She consistently has a high winrate, but I think that's because 1. she's relatively easy to pick up, but also has a high ceiling for mastery, and 2. she has a well-defined niche, but that niche just so happens to counter a lot of popular champions. I think Riot is more likely to focus on balancing assassins, rather than focusing on Janna; I don't think Riot's trying to enforce an assassin meta right now, it's just that assassins are undergoing changes and thus are going to be unbalanced for a while. I also don't think it's likely that Riot will nerf a counter champion who has a well defined niche/is otherwise pretty healthy. When ADCs had the class update, armor stacking tanks such as Malphite and Rammus took off in winrate, but I don't recall them really getting nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IRFodder","date":"2016-02-11T04:15:53.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's good at what she does.
