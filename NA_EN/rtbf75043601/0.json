I don't see a problem with asking once for a surrender though -- it's clear he didn't continue asking, and it's a valid question. The Annie stuff might have gotten her annoyed, but it's pretty minor -- the two lines you pulled out were actually in his Team Chat rather than All Chat as well, so all the Annie would have seen were \"Annie, can you stop talking in All Chat, thanks\" and \"Annie, you're just salty.\" Not GREAT behavior, but I know I'd let it slide, and I'm pretty quick to report.\n\nAs for asking for reports -- Riot's said it's okay in the right situation: i.e. it's fine if you say \"Hey -- Annie was tossing racial slurs at us. Mind tossing her a report?\", but it crosses the line when you're attempting to use reporting as harassment, threat, or to belittle a player (things like \"Report top for feeding\" when their build is fine and they may just be struggling).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toxicate13","date":"2017-04-19T03:23:32.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I had been temperary-banned before, but this was the only log I had","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-04-19T03:26:21.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Toxicate13,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=oxEgL46y,comment-id=00010000000000010000,timestamp=2017-04-19T03:23:32.005+0000)\n>\n> I had been temperary-banned before, but this was the only log I had\n\nHm. If you had just come off a 14-day ban for toxicity and got reported in the next game, there's a chance that the system might have simply banned you based on that (or possibly on a back-log), but it's a little odd.

Calling players names and raging at them is player Harassment (which is bannable and in some cases hate-speech). Also, using words like \"gay\" is just a no no, it's hate-speech. Words like \"gay\" or \"%%%\" or even \"%%%%\" are all unacceptable by Riot's standards (in most context it is still considered hate speech). Unless this was a temp ban you should have two other chat logs, I'd like to see them if that is the case. If not and you're only temporarily banned, make sure to UNBIND your ENTER key when you start playing again, maybe also /mute all. It will make sure you don't say anything. After around 3-4 months you shouldn't have to UNBIND your ENTER key anymore or /mute all even if you haven't reformed. This is because your toxic tier will have decayed proving to Riot you have \"reformed\". If you're toxic again you'll get temporarily banned again if your toxic tier decays meaning you wont get banned even if you continue to be toxic. Please take my advice and don't make my mistake of waiting until it's too late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2017-04-19T06:44:44.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't even know what each champion does, but that doesn't stop you from telling your team what they should pick or what they shouldn't pick.\n\nBlaming everything that goes wrong on the top lane pick is unacceptable behaviour...it's also completely stupid, ignorant and absolutely not fair to do that.\n\nOverall your attitude was very negative.\n\nLearn your own champion first and stop being so annoying.\n\n> Gards5FTW: wtf\n> Gards5FTW: jsut happened did she flash with me on her back?
