After that i tried to start the game again as admin and such and now it just says repairing and instantly fails.\r\n\r\nI've tried to restart my pc, i've flushed dns and i've removed rads stuff. Nothing seems to work\r\n\r\nI would love some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T01:50:45.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you keep getting stuck in a repatch loop, try updating your admin settings really quickly by following the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions).
