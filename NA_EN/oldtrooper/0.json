However, I wouldn&#039;t like to see her available by a random click for $5 like other championship skins. This skin wasn&#039;t meant to be just for the revenue. I hope you remember this. \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nOT","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eggo McLego","date":"2016-09-27T00:32:23.939+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven will be available through November 6th 23:59 PST and then will behave like all other Championship skins (coming back for future Worlds, available through Hextech and Mystery Gifting).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amhyden","date":"2016-09-24T14:38:23.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come nobody asks if it's going to be available for individual purchase or only purchasable IN a bundle?

That means every purchase of Championship Zed will directly increase the prize pool for Worlds 2016.

Money gained from championship Riven went towards development of the game.
