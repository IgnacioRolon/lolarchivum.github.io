So many ADCs do not get that lifesteal doesn't mean anything if they aren't doing that much damage. It's such a waste in most cases.\n\nI'm a support main, and I just had one of my Jhin ADCs try to say he'll go tanky. That was where I became concerned because ADCs should not be focusing too much on building defensively. Thankfully someone dodged.\n\nThe other team was stacking tanks. So I told him don't build BT early game because you aren't going to have enough damage to make that lifesteal useful, at least wait to build it after IE. Personally though the fact that so many ADCs overlook BotRK really irks me. We're in an age where tanks are deadly again, and even Vayne can struggle against them. \n\nADC itemization is laid out so nicely and clearly, why are so many ADCs getting it so wrong? I main a role where itemization is wonky at best, so I would be so happy if everything was that neat.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to add to this for ADCs is **DO NOT TRY BUILDS YOU'VE SEEN ON STREAMS IN RANKED**. It should be very obvious, but I've had more than a few say they saw a build or something in a stream. Bad idea.

If you just walk up forward and engage on him, you better be sure he dies instantly or it's incredibly stupid. It just lets his Runaan's attack 3 people at once for max DPS.
