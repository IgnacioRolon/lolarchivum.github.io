At that point the patcher will start scanning files again to make sure all is peachy, but sometimes certain antivirus software will block it from scanning again. Try turning those off if possible (*only* while you're updating) and let me know if that gets you in!","replies":[{"poster":"1337soup","date":"2017-05-06T03:02:41.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now it just gets to 2% and brings up the \"update failed\" window up but it'll still continue updating in the background.

Since it doesn't seem like any antivirus is getting in the way of the download, we may need to double check that your OS has permission to let League do it's thing. \n\nSometimes, without those permissions, your OS might think a program is bad and just shuts it down before it can do anything.
