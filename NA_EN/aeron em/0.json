Make sure Riot sees this. Thanks.***\n\nI had brought this up before on the forums, but recently I saw a video of Elementz expressing the same sentiment and with the new ‘Community Beta’ I felt like I should post this again in the hope that Riot may take this seriously. \n\nAt present, although the severity of the situation varies, there is no debate that ranked games do suffer with players afking, raging and intentionally trolling for whatever reason. The stand that Riot seems to have taken is – “We have a tribunal/discipline system in place, and frankly everyone is on an even playing field since it happens to all” \n\nRanked is meant to be the competitive scene for League of Legends, yet the level of immaturity and discourtesy allowed by Riot (yes! Allowed) reflects very poorly on the company. You wouldn’t allow C9Hai to get up and leave because he gave up first blood during an LCS game without severe consequences would you? Then why allow it in your competitive ladder? \n\nNow I understand and appreciate you don’t want to impede on players’ rights and that most afkers, ragers, etc are good people on a bad day. But I suggest something needs to be done to correct this behaviour. My proposal is to include chat restrictions and strict bans from ***ranked play only*. **\n\n\n**For ragers, inappropriate language and trolls (non-feeders) **\n\n* After first offence (reports in 2 games straight or 3 out of 10) gets an automatic ban from in-game chat for 2 days/week) \n* Second offence results in a 3 day ban form playing ranked games (would be peer or Riot reviewed)\n* Any further reports will result in a ban from ranked for a week – 2 weeks, finally resulting in a life-time ban from ranked. \n\n**For afk, trolling, feeding, etc.**\n\n* First offence (reported 2 games straight or 3 out of 10) results in an automatic one day suspension from ranked. (Even if this is caused by bad connections or simply having bad days I believe this time will help them resolve their connection issues and/or calm down)\n* Second offence results in a 3 day ban from playing ranked games (would be peer or Riot reviewed)\n* Any further reports will result in a ban from ranked for a week – 2 weeks, finally resulting in a life-time ban from ranked. \n\n\n**Notes: **\nRanked is a privilege, not a right. If you do not have the maturity and self-control to be polite and show human decency, you should not be allowed to play with others who do.\n\nTo be proactive, reports should be monitored. Any player reporting an excessive amount of times (this can be determined by Riot) or in a span of a month has a majority of reports not found ban-worthy, will get the 3 day suspension.\n\n\n\n> **Feedback:**\n> It seems a lot of people who d/c often feel that they should still be entitled to play ranked. \n> This shows a clear disrespect for others who value ranked more than a game type that gives you a pretty icon at the end of the season. \n> I feel Riot should either \n* a) prove that they take the ladder system seriously as some of their player base do and enforce stricter rules.\n\n>* b) or say \"No our ranked is not a serious ladder, it's just for fun. If more people are interested we'll create another ladder which will follow stricter rules.\"\n> ","replies":[{"poster":"Tray","date":"2014-02-18T22:31:42.316+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What sucks about ranked is one guy trolls, but doesnt speak. He just silently goes around the map trying to cause the team to lose. This happened to me yesterday where a fiddle, who counter picked himself as support against blitz lost his mind after getting pulled. Cait told him to roam if he was gonna troll. So he declares in all chat hes going to, and proceeds to roam around feeding kills until hes valuless, and doing what ever else he can to cause people to die.\n\nNow im mad because on more than one occasion during this he baits me only walk away and let me die. I call him a troll who is intentionally throwing the game. I get reported for negative attitude.\n\nThats whats wrong with punishments in ranked. Trolling is allowed and unpunished so long as you dont speak.

I don't think people should be punished for that because it's not causing the game, fair enough if your internet causes you to leave a game that's bad, but as long as you come back in you're not doing too much harm. I don't think you should be punished if you at least attempt to reconnect and try to help your team come back. I'm at school so I have no structure for this but I know it's annoying for me when I got auto-banned for one day just because my internet kept stuttering and causing me to leave, once, my game crashed whilst in loading and by the time I reconnected I got disconnected for inactivity. In both cases I believe we came back and won but you really can't blame people for their internet stuttering, most of the time it's not them but people on their pipeline (or whatever it's called) using up all the bandwidth and occasionally spiking and causing yours to drop for a few seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeron Em","date":"2014-02-19T17:16:11.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok one of two things here:\n\n* One: If you dc'd and then rejoined the game to win, others wouldn't report you as afk so it wouldn't apply to you.

I like the general idea that you present, but I definitely think that given the number of players that play this game, such a simple system wouldn't be ideal.\n\nI think that the 1 day ban for ranked needs to actually measure not only if they received the AFK reports at the end of the game, but also if the game officially marked them as a leaver. If only reports are present, it shouldn't result in an automatic ban on the first offense.\n\nAdditionally I actually think that things should start acting on the second event of the day, and the reason I say this is that it is possible to have a one time event that lasts several hours (such as a power outage) where the player would be perfectly reasonable in assuming that the problems are over with, and wanting to cue up for ranked again.\n\nThe bans should only start being handed out when there is a case for maliciousness or clear neglect.\n\nFurthermore I think that it is unreasonable to be banned for 3 days because I just experienced a power outage twice in one day, and it happened once six months ago as well. There needs to be a period of time after which your ban-cycle resets to prevent weird situations like this. The period of time can increase depending on which punishment step you're on, but it needs to exist.\n\nRealize that the intent is not to decrease the number of players in ranked, it is to decrease the amount of toxicity in ranked.

Look at it another way if you know you could be playing in games with these people then you could make the choice to not que ranked. You are no more entitled to play ranked then any other player.

It's not as serious and anyone over level 30 with 16 champions can play it, but you get to see your rating so you can tell if you're improving or not (the problem with normals is the utter lack of transparency.

People flame, troll, feed, leave, enter games when they have to leave, are tired, stoned, what not. However, those people still want to see their rank which is why they play ranked. \n\n\nNormals is not very rewarding. Because of the mmr system, no matter how much I am improving, I don't see it in my game play because I am always matched with similarly skilled opponents. I've had around a 50% win rate in normals since season 1, but my skill has improved dramatically. Ranked is what shows that.\n\nSo my idea was to have 3 game modes.\n\n1. Normal - no rank, no team limits, no caps on duoing, anything goes, play the new guy, break the meta, whatever you want. It's a game; it's for fun\n\n2. Elo Rank system (with draft mode champion select) - You get to see your rating rise and fall as you play. It should be taken more seriously than normals, but it's not the ultimate competetive scene.\n\n3. The current tiered system - The difference is though, that it's hard to get into this system to play. You have to prove that you are competent on the champions that you have access to for this mode (my suggestion was a 40% win rate over 10 games in the Elo system) and you have to have a very low number of leaves and reports. This would be the mode for people who are really trying their hardest. It doesn't matter if they are bronze or challenger. This is more of a safe-haven from trolling, afking, people who just bought the brand new champion and haven't even watched the spotlight yet, ragers, etc. \n\nThe mmr system would still be in place, so a silver person in the tiered system would still have a silver elo if they played in the other system, but you are giving the community the rating transparency of ranked for everyone, but still providing a different setting for those who are positive players and don't like the effect the toxic players have on their games. \n\nWhile the toxicity statistically doesn't affect anyone in particular - we all have an equal chance of being exposed to it, it really drags down the gaming experience. \n\nThat's the point of my suggestion, it's to solve the toxicity problem for players who don't leave, don't rage, don't troll and always try their best.
