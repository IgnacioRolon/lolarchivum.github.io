Jensen did not just get banned for language or behavior, he was banned for DDOS'ing. He was actually banned right alongside another player named \"Khaled Abusagr\", he's the post right above Jensen's on the source page (I'll link below again). Here's the copy and pasted post they gave:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRecently, Riot completed an investigation into the account histories of the players on teams which are scheduled to compete in the upcoming League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) European Qualifier.\n\nThe investigation has confirmed a number of facts in the player history of Khaled Abusagr (Abusagr), including a consistent pattern of in-game verbal abuse, racism, anti-Semitism and threatening behavior which require immediate action. \n\n**Abusagrs current account, StunnedandSlayed, has been suspended by the Tribunal five times, including a recent two-week suspension in December. This account has established a persistent record of in-game harassment, verbal abuse, and unacceptable behavior: \n54% of reports were for Offensive Language, Verbal Abuse, and Negative Attitude.\nStunnedandSlayed has been reported in 18% of total matches and is currently before the Tribunal for a possible permaban.\n**\n**Much worse, however, is the unprecedented multitude of violations in Abusagrs gameplay history:\nHe previously has been permabanned on three additional accounts, including the notorious DarkwinJax account.\nThe DarkwinJax account established the highest harassment score ever recorded on the EU West server. No player, before or since, has matched this degree of negative behavior.\nIn game chat, Abusagr has threatened to physically injure players, including a Riot employee.\nHis previous accounts are replete with a very large number of racist and anti-Semitic insults.\nDarkwinJax was reported more than 1,000 times during a 375-game period (Feb-Apr 2012).\n**\nDespite years of repeated punishments, official warnings, and permabans, Abusagr has continued his pattern of unacceptable behavior during the past several months under the StunnedandSlayed account, even as his team advanced into the upcoming LCS EU Qualifier. \n\n**As a result of this players abject history of poor sportsmanship and harmful actions, the player behavior team has issued a lifetime ban on Abusagr. His StunnedandSlayed account has been permabanned and all future accounts will be permabanned on sight.\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo the only two people banned from LoL permanently were a player who constantly demonstrated extreme negativity and also engaged in criminal cheating activity by DDOS'ing (Jensen) and a player who demonstrated arguably even more negativity to the point of making death threats and threats of violence directly to other players and even Riot staff (Abusagr). One player (Jensen) made a new account and played as a nobody until he became a coach for SK gaming, while the other (Abusagr) made multiple new accounts and continued making threats of violence, pretty blatantly announcing that he was back. Neither of them should have been allowed back in, but the one they allow is also the cheater. At least the other one is only screaming at people, Jensen DDOS'ed people. I can understand letting him coach SK gaming, if they want to hire him as a coach that is their choice, but Riot needs to adhere to their own standard if they want to make any claims about being credible.\n\nSource here: http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1015978&page=1#post10180118\n\n \n> The ruling in lifetime bans is that they&#x27;re &quot;indefinite&quot;, having no set finish time. They can be ended at an arbitrary time as Riot sees fit though.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, an indefinite ban from any sporting event means \"From now until the end of time, unless specific circumstances or factors that were not able to be predicted come to light or unless specified\". So for example, if someone gets banned from a sports team for getting into a bar fight where they ended up taking the life of another person, and then several years later it turns out that the players actions did not actually result in the persons death but some other factor unknown at the time, they could re-evaluate the indefinite ban because new circumstances have come to light. This is why most people get a suspension for either a season or a specific number of games depending on the severity of their infraction. If something is worthy of a life time ban, then it needs to STAY a life time ban. DDOS'ing is even worse than using a hack, it requires a person to actively target the person they are DDOS'ing, as opposed to a hack which is still cheating but not targeting anyone. There is a certain amount of maliciousness that makes it very worthy of a lifetime ban. Also, the rest of the dialogue in the report from Riot determines whether or not \"Indefinite\" is meant to be \"Unlimited\" or \"Without a set time frame\". I cannot condone such apologetic thinking or mindsets, especially when the people making it are making the claim to support positive sportsmanship.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-01-20T21:48:30.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Also, the rest of the dialogue in the report from Riot determines whether or not \"Indefinite\" is meant to be \"Unlimited\" or \"Without a set time frame\". I cannot condone such apologetic thinking or mindsets, especially when the people making it are making the claim to support positive sportsmanship.\n\nTheir policy of reviewing such players means it's \"without a set time frame\" in most cases. They define it [here](http://2015.na.lolesports.com/articles/competitive-policy-revision-permabanned-players): \n\n> **Indefinite**: Indefinite suspensions are subject to review, but suspended players need to meet the highest standard of conduct over a sufficient period of time to be permitted back into the League.\n>\n> * What is considered a “sufficient period of time” may vary from case-to-case and will depend on the severity of the original offense and any offenses thereafter.\n> * Indefinite suspensions are reserved for players at the more severe end of the scale who in the past would have received a permaban.\n> * Indefinite suspensions are subject to review at the end of their minimum suspension term (see below).\n>\n> **Minimum Suspension Term (Indefinite only)**: This is the minimum amount of time an indefinite suspension must stand before the affected player is eligible for competitive play, provided they pass their review.\n>\n> * This doesn’t apply to fixed suspensions\n> * The term is defined X number of splits (2 splits being considered equivalent to 1 season of competitive play)\n> * This can’t be any less than 2 splits (equivalent to 1 season)\n> * In exceptionally rare cases, an indefinite suspension with no minimum suspension term can be levied, meaning the suspended player would never be reviewed. Such a suspension will be reserved for only the most extreme offenses such as those which have severe effects outside of the game (criminal offenses like sexual assault, for example).\n\nClearly DDOSing other players isn't on the same level as sexual assault, thus Jensen was periodically reviewed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-01-19T16:24:59.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm  right. \n\nJensen's punishment was ban on sight. \n\nAlthough Riot did consider Jensen reformed later.

So, I guess that is an interesting ruling.\n\nIt's exceptionally interesting. His initial ban ruling came on 01-23-2013, yet in March of 2015 they made the decision that he would be allowed to become Cloud 9's mid laner based on his \"in game behavior up to that point demonstrating reform\". We know that he was coaching SK Gaming, because Riot refused to allow Jensen backstage or to be a active member during the 2014 World Championship in Korea, which was in September 2014. \n\nCoaching has nothing to do with \"In game behavior\", and Riot admitted that he was playing league of legends on a new account during the time frame between his initial perma ban on 01-23-2013 and his re-admittance to the game on 5-11-2015 when they said \"according to our monitoring tools, he has not been implicated in any DDOS or Drophacking-related exploits since Q2 2013\". What happened to \"All future accounts will be banned on sight\"?\n\nIt's especially noteworthy because only two players in the history of LoL have ever been \"Permabanned\", which riot has always said means they will ban any confirmed accounts you have on sight, and of the two he was DDOS'ing, which is criminal activity. It implies that not only does Riot have no standard, but that they do not care about their community. How can they make the claim \"We want to promote good sportsmanship\" and then say \"Oh that player we perma banned for the most serious offenses a lol player can be held accountable for, we actually were letting him play again and think he's reformed so he's back. Nevermind that he was already back since we've been monitoring him, you should just ignore that.\"? It's deliberately hypocritical.\n\nEDIT: And people are DEFENDING this, which is the most baffling thing to me. I've not seen self destructive logic this bad since Selin Gören apologized to European migrants for being raped by a migrant because \"She didn't want to appear racist\". This the exact same type of logic. http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/16/member-of-german-left-youth-party-apologizes-to-refugees-on-facebook-after-alleged-sexual-assault-by-migrant/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-01-19T09:11:55.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grandis,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7ea1f0H5,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2017-01-19T03:07:21.484+0000)\n>\n> Please provide a source for this zero tolerance policy, as Riot has yet to openly describe any policy in anything other than a vague and undefined generalization.

This is in fact one of the problems with the constitution, is that some of it is very general. For example, the 2nd amendment that people in my home state of Texas adore. It states \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" no more, no less. Without defining what \"arms\" you have the right to bear, or placing a limitation that is stated properly, people can make a lot of different arguments that are all contradictory and yet still all correct at the same time. Technically speaking, a person who owns a rocket launcher can live next to a person who owns a pistol, and the person who owns the pistol can believe all he wants that the rocket man shouldn't have the rocket, he can make extremely good arguments for how dangerous and stupid it is while the rocket man can argue that he has the right to own any firearm he wants, but until \"to keep and bear arms\" is better defined neither of them is wrong. And what about the edgy kid down the street who owns a katana? Is that covered in \"arms\"? Both rocket and pistol man say no, arms specifically refers to firearms, but this is something that is not defined so everyone is right and wrong at the same time with completely contradictory views. This only breeds conflict and loop holes, it doesn't make it easier and more efficient to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-01-19T16:41:47.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grandis,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7ea1f0H5,comment-id=0003000100010000,timestamp=2017-01-19T16:16:14.707+0000)\n>\n> Being vague is what creates those loop holes in the first place. \n\nThen you seem to have a different definition of \"loop hole\" than most people I know.\nTypically a loop hole refers to something very specific technically not breaking the letter of the law, even though it does in fact go against the spirit of the law.\n\nThe law \"Everything bad is punished\" doesn't have any loopholes.
