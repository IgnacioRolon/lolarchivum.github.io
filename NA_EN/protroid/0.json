He has received only one buff (A base armour increase to 16 from 12) a few patches after his initial release, a few quality of life changes to his W and R, and exactly 0 nerfs. The last time he even appeared in the patch notes was in 5.6, which was a change that allowed him to cancel his ult via thresh lantern.\n\nTL:DR; What are rioters thinking about Vel&#039;Koz right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-06T04:41:35.317+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"We think Vel'koz could use a small amount of extra power. We're reducing his Q reactivation time to 0.25s (most common ability cast time, so a very minor feel change from 0.3s) and increasing the range of the secondary missiles to 1100 (from 900) to match the original missile's range as a result. We're looking to put power into Q specifically since it's a pretty signature spell for Vel'koz, with a cast style that rewards experienced Vel'koz players noticeably more than people that are just good with skillshots in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-08-06T05:39:01.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be not topic, but what is with the Viktor changes going on?

Viktor is about upgrading. \n\nIn terms of scaling, it is kinda like a overtime growth, which is like a plant growing. Viktor isn't a plant, he's a machine who goes from one version to another. The scaling on it seems kinda un-thematic imo. \n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-08-06T22:45:37.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rOpBWU9F,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-06T04:41:35.317+0000)\n>\n> We think Vel'koz could use a small amount of extra power.

(1050 VS 1100).\n\nAlso if you are still around, can you say if there are any other plans for Vel'Koz in the near future? Or where you feel Vel'Koz is right now in terms of balance?\n\nAlso, for the folks playing along at home, these changes mean that Vel'Koz's Q's max possible range is now 1,520~ from 1,382~.
