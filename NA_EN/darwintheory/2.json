Changes which are in my own opinion cause most of the problems and frustrations people have with the game. \n\nLet me explain:\n\nStep 1: Season ends &amp; Preseason starts - **The game receives massive changes to items, champions, masteries and gameplay like for example S7&#039;s tower and Jungle changes**. It&#039;s huge and everyone Bronze to Challenger struggles to adapt. I awtch many streamers on Youtube and Twitch and even high elo ones have been particularly frustrated the past season or two.\n\nStep 2: Season starts &amp; the next 8 months are spent balancing the game because many champions were all buffed or nerfed to suit last seasons changes. People get angry and frustrated non stop for the next 8 odd months or more because the changes to the game have vastly changed their champions place and/or ability to play with them this season. 8 months of clown fiesta play testing makes people int if I&#039;m honest with you.\n\nStep 3: The game settles and &#039;finds it&#039;s balance&#039; towards the end of the season. It&#039;s not perfect but after** 8 months of public beta testing** RIOT&#039;s balance team starts to get on top of things\n\nStep 4: Season ends. See step 1 &amp; the process is repeated over and over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy though? Yes, nobody wants the game to go stale but why all these rage-inducing titanic changes which wouldn&#039;t be so bad were it not for the fact we all know every change has a passive knock on effect. Each champion is built and suited to a role and place in the game any change to items or gameplay affects them. For example: Nasus had his place in S5/S6 - bad early strong late - but when you nerfed towers for S7 with the short games he became utterly useless. NOW you buff him with what? 1/2 months left in season and only to compensate for the fact there is no late 40+ minute games anymore.  Didn&#039;t you consider this before making the S7 changes? You basically threw him in the trash after making huge changes to the game without considering the knock on effects and instead left us, the players, to waste months playing champions like him and pointing out your mistakes.\n\nSo back to my original question: Why? You&#039;re a multi billion dollar company who regularly talk about using analytics to balance the game but then why make so many large, random &amp; uncalled for changes and leave us to suffer through them for most of the year wasting hat amounts to weeks of our lives wasted? What you do year on year is like FIFA suddenly saying &quot;ok you can now pick up the ball with your hands this year but we&#039;re going to also make the goal nets smaller&quot; \n\nWhy not actually poll the community on seasonal changes? Or even only change one thing per season ie: Rework masteries one year, jungle the next\n? Or even hold off all changes and have them every 2 years instead, this gives two full years to perfectly balance the game.\n\n\n\nI&#039;d also like to take this opportunity to suggest something: Have all 10 players before they pick their champions in ranked vote on whether to play a game with tower health as is is or trebled. At the end of the day it&#039;s just simple code saying health is something like 1000 or 3000 so not hard to implement. I understand you enjoy LCS spectacles but if you give players the option of choice, like champion bans, it will help ease our suffering. I&#039;m certainly not alone when I say 25 minute curb stomps are infuriating.\n\n\n\nFingers crossed for a response. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-08-10T17:59:38.701+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Polling the community is a bad idea, because the community has no idea what makes a good game. \n\nThey do, generally, only change one major thing per pre-season.\n\nThey're not gonna be able to perfectly balance the game in two years if they can't do it in one. And it'd get stale.\n\nAlso, having players vote on game-by-game changes is even more dumb than just polling the entire community.","replies":[{"poster":"HongChongDong","date":"2017-08-11T00:21:05.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with that. Most definitely not the general community, but highly skilled champion mains and very high tier players like professional players will always know more simply because of their experience. Riot can look at in depth stats, but they can only theorize and receive sub par testing results from their play testers in terms of actually knowing how their decisions affect the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-08-11T01:48:41.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, better skilled players will know more.

This game is built on competitive gaming which by default is about placing 2 opposing sides on an equal opportunity playing field. They SHOULD be striving for the best possible game balance, and that means utilizing professional/skilled players to give them the advice they need.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-08-11T17:51:06.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Advice, yes.

Wow. I am a person on the boards that frequently defends Riot and their changes on a specific level, however I feel the same way about this. \n\nIt's so frustrating going through this cycle over and over again. Yes, a lot of updating need to be implemented with respect to the more outdated champions, items, etc, but why does that mean we need to have something random thrown in over and over again to throw it all into chaos? Things like the jungle camp changes this preseason have taken forever to iron out. We are STILL looking to increase viability in the jungle for more than a handful of dominant champs. And you know what? At this stage of the game, it's fine to keep it this way, we Are figuring it out, but I'm not confident that it will be left as is for that to ever be solved because some other change will be made again. \n\nIt's beyond frustrating to watch the game inflict wounds upon itself through random implementations, which typically don't directly solve the present issues, while planting seeds for new ones. Gameplay changes should always be the top, proactive concern to this game or any game. Unfortunately gameplay is constantly treated on a reactionary level in LOL. \n\nI always feel like this game is THIIIIS close to becoming all it has the potential to be. Then we're left disappointed.  \n\nIt's like it's so damn obvious the company has too many people working for it, and they all need something to do for 8 hours a day, that work is being created solely for the purpose of it. There is no focus for more than a couple weeks. Why can't we perfect the game over the course of a year, instead of patching up holes we created? And that doesn't mean we can't create new content. There's always room for it if done correctly ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blu Avenger","date":"2017-08-10T17:36:38.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I been thinking about this a lot recently, Atm the biggest issue in LOL is items.\nInstead of riot adressing this they are planning to break gameplay even more by adjusting something that does not need addressing.\nWe have badly overtuned support items, stoneplate abusing cho gath, duskblade gave alot of champs free damage for no reason, ap items are terribly underpowered (with the exception of morello).\nCdr on all classes can get to 30 to 40 very easily at no cost.\n\nInstead of dealing with these huge game breaking issues, you guys at riot are working on breaking another part of the game.\nWhere is this all going to end? Please please please, stop the madness and think for atleast 1 second, if little kids can see a problem why can't experienced developers at a huge gaming company see it!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2017-08-10T16:19:10.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah it's pretty ridiculous. \n\nApart from the cost, what is wrong with the current runes we have? They're flexible and every single champion has multiple viable setups depending on the situation.\n\nYet Riot are making them more like masteriies which are rather inflexible with many champions struggling to use more than 2 keystones effectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kovorix","date":"2017-08-10T13:50:25.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A problem with games is allways that the players will do other things with changes then what the developers planned.\n\nFor example in another game I played the devs mad a weapon which should be a game changer in huge fights but if you use it wrong you would kill your allies. The players don't use it that way they use it in small engagements to roflstomp the enemy because you can't fuck up your mates.\n\nPlayers will allways find a way to abuse changes in the most efficient way they need it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-08-10T20:39:11.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Step 1: Season ends & Preseason starts - The game receives massive changes to items, champions, masteries and gameplay like for example S7's tower and Jungle changes.\n\nWtf...
