A Garen may replace Glyphs with Cooldown runes for Q poke. A Rammus replace Marks for Armour runes. A chogath health runes. It&#039;s this unique playstyle that gives our champions that &#039;personal&#039; touch and though subtle these changes can make a lane counter manageable......winnable even.\r\n\r\nI fear these new runes are just limiting diversity and shoe-horning champions to single playstyles. Everyone&#039;s going to pick set runes for set champions it&#039;s going to be so generic from what I know so far and this will also completely unbalance the 100+ champions exist. It&#039;s going to be a chaotic melting pot of broken champs, hot fixes, buffs and nerfs.\r\n\r\nAs well as all this though has the impact of losing these starting AD / MR / Armour runes even been factored into RIOTs equations? We have early and late game champs and losing these runes is going to completely throw that out of sync. Even the ability to farm and take minion and tower aggro is going to be massively affected.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-09-12T14:25:03.875+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Current runes do not express a playstyle.

Claiming that \"having more AD instead of MR on Riven is a play style expression\" is a bit of a wild conjecture. The stats offered by the current runes are mostly negligible once mid game rolls around, and even in the early game, their \"play style expression\" is non existent because having more AD vs more MR on Riven won't actually change how you play her. Under the new Runes, if you, say, have a rune that gives you an extra dash or grants you a big heal for landing CC, you _actually will_ change how you play her, as big changes like that would allow you to be more aggressive and be heavily rewarded for it. If anything, play style diversity will skyrocket, because champions will have more tools at their disposal to do a lot of things the current runes/mastery system won't allow them to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Radiant Seraph","date":"2017-09-12T11:21:30.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You haven't payed attention or what?

It is definitely a negative strike against this game in terms of individuality. Riot however has been at war with individual skill for a long time. They want to make it impossible for a good player to solo carry the lower ranked divisions.
