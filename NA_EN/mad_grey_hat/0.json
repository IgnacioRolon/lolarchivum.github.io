Maybe a bit psychotic but I even pulled an all nighter waiting for the patch to come out...and yet there is still no release or even info on when they will come out. Any and all help is appreciated as to when they will be coming out :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T21:16:51.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hang tight, and get some rest!
