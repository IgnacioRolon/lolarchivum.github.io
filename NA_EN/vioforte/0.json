The intended behavior is that, if Bard dies before the missile gets fired, the ult immediately stops. If he dies after the missile's fired the ult continues. What's happening at the moment though is that Bard dying during the cast time results in no missile being fired, but the warning indicator (which is created at start of cast) remaining on the ground the whole duration. That makes it unclear for everyone what's going on, so we'll clean that up.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-27T22:30:56.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet!

Those are still early-mid game changes which do not sustain the ability's usage post laning, though they are decent improvements to at least assist the laning phase. Is the goal to just hope that the laning improvement is enough to assist the leveling of your adc and jungler to carry through the rest of the game?\n\nWhen I play Bard, the only way to have him be useful is to build as a tank, so that W is not receiving an AP boost to the amount healed (which is usually insignificant either way because of the prevalence of the W as an emergency last-hope all-my-other-things-are-on-cooldown ability in the late game). It's never at a point where it compares to other heals.\n\nPersonally, I wish it had a stat-boost passive or lowered charge time as compensation for the drop-off.
