My suggest is to give players the ability to adjust mouse size and it's light tone.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-01T18:19:36.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mouse cursor modifications are not currently a feature, and unsupported.  I highly advise against trying to make a custom one, as it can be considered creating an unfair advantage in-game.  If you're on 4K, you might get issues like the one you're describing as it's not fully supported yet.  Your best would be to not exceed 1920x1080 resolution on both in-game and native settings.","replies":[]}]}
