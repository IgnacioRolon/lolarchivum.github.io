A zed will most likely get a serrated dirk for their first component, and that can easily be countered with a Tabi rush. If he is pushing you under your tower you can also do a Tiamat and a cloth armor for your first back.\n\n\nHis main escape tool for the early game until his r is his w (which is on a 20 sec CD) so if he uses it to poke or blink to it to harass you, use that to initiate a gank form mid/jungle and all in him. \n\nI would say try get an armor item for your second or third complete item.\n\nIf you see a zed or yas and the team comp looks like they are going top then maybe try pick a champ that can play safe in the early game and not get them fed. If not then just get Doran’s shield to minimize their poke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2018-09-14T21:49:19.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not ban him?","replies":[{"poster":"Napoleon3","date":"2018-09-14T21:50:53.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was playing normal and as always the most players are playing yasuo zed so if i play normals he will just be there like an enemy and get feed every game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sKingEan","date":"2018-09-14T22:56:19.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Napoleon3,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vJlLxAEZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-14T21:31:25.364+0000)\n>\n> funny thing even if i buy armor with a fighter champion like fiora still zed does damage how boosted this game is? i mean where is the counterplay? skills? not even q needed to kill someone this game is so unfair and you people still dosnt say something about it? maybe if you lane against champions like zed then you will understeand the weak balance at all? deleting you with 1 yommus not even q needed and makes you take armor still bursting you and you got 0 damage to him how is this balanced and fair? what this game has become? even a baby can smash keyboards and kill enemys right now that is the most big problem that the most champions and the gameplay runes at all are unfair and makes this game horible adventure playing it well i started playing league since season 4 and season 4 and 5 i never had this felling it was a good adventure with counterplay game and skills needed but after season 6 the balance was being so damn\n\nSomeone who is good at Fiora and that buys armor can beat Zed 1v1 in any situation.
