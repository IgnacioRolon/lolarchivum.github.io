Does anyone have a confirmation on which skins have sunglasses? From the lists I've seen, they seem to have been last updated before season 3. Several sunglasses skins have released since then but not all skins (neon strike vi) work. Do we know for instance that Secret Agent Xin Zhao or Pool Party Graves work with this passive? Just curious, any info helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2015-06-11T21:23:24.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be funny if a Leona all ins you, and the only reason you survived with 1hp is the fact you have on shades.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-06-11T22:22:15.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"pay2win\n\nthen to die on a random Teemo shroom.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-11T21:11:03.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey ShenpaiPlsNotice,\n\nAny champion/skin wearing sunglasses should work. We are aware that Neon Strike Vi is not working properly with this passive, and that's indeed a bug. \n\nThis is something we can certainly look into to ensure everyone wearing sunglasses is a bit more protected from the sun. :]","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-12T17:51:28.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick update here! \n\nOur system likes to round numbers up, so in some cases, it may not look like the -1 damage is being applied, but I checked out the ladies and gents with shades, and the easter egg is working properly. \n\nIn addition, we're working on the Neon Strike Vi bug related to this easter egg. :]","replies":[]}]}
