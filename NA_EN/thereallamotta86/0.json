I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the game. It's such a hassle. After reinstalling I am able to play, but once I close the game I am unable to reopen it. I tried the Hextech Repair Tool but that does nothing. Reinstalling takes about an hour or so. With each reinstall I feel less and less interested in playing. This makes me sad because I love playing this game. D: I really want to keep playing but not like this. I guess this is just a sign that I need to take a break from League altogether.\r\n\r\nIf there's anyone out there that can save this relationship I will be forever grateful...if not...I'll miss you League.

Words have spread among the city, of summoners who are in need as they pass through the gates.   I write to you now with a great sense of urgency.  Pray tell, what do you mean when you say it no longer works?  \n\nIf it is not appearing after trying to open it, then something might be blocking progress.  Seek the instructions in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to continue your journey, and fix this.\n\nEager for your reply,\n\nThe broken hearted\n\nP.S.  Don't break up over text, it's lame.","replies":[{"poster":"TheReallaMOTTA86","date":"2017-05-04T04:33:28.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Porocles,\n\nYour response has been well received and I honor your sincerity.\n\nFurthermore, when I say the application no longer works I mean that when I attempt to open the application it doesn't even bring up the sign in screen. I just receive the typical Apple Error/Problem Report which logs the problem. Again this is on an iMac so the permissions guide isn't applicable as it seems it only is suitable for Windows whereas I have the Mac OS. Unless I'm missing something and apologize if that's the case.\n\nI can forward you the Problem report if that would help resolve this issue.\n\nAgain I appreciate your concern and effort to mend this relationship.\n\nRegards,\n\nMotta86\n\nPS I still have feelings for League. Angry Birds just isn't the same...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"md litey","date":"2017-05-02T07:48:06.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont blame you I am not playing anymore either.
