At first i thought it was cause I hadn't updated the client, but even after doing so the problem persisted. The only other instance i can find of this is a discussion posted two years ago with zero replies, so yeah... it's not common I guess but it's literally making the game unplayable for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T22:20:32.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game or client wouldn't impact your connection to your mouse or other hardware.  There could be another software (for your mouse) or even faulty hardware causing this.  Does this happen while doing or playing anything else?  What happens if you try another mouse?  You may need to reach out  to the support specific to your mouse's brand.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
