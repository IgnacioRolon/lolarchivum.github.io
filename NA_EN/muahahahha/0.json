push, and completely deleted her, all the other reworks have the player doing the same things, kat throws knives, ww suppresses and tanks, etc etc etc, karma no longer is about positioning, timing, and trade offs, shes just an ap mid with cc, and basically a gimped lux\r\n\r\n\r\nI was so turned off from lol i stopped playing at that rework, at the same time the (quite frankly redundant) Lissandra was released in 2013\r\n\r\nI returned when Kled was released, and i noticed one thing:\r\nEvery game with a Yasuo, was buttfucking retarded.\r\n\r\nI will admit i tried playing Bruiser Singed bot, because i didn&#039;t know how changed the meta was, but after a while i came to the understanding, \r\n&quot;Their Yasuo will rape you all, Your teams Yasuo will fucking be raped&quot;\r\nNo game with yasuo is unblemished\r\n\r\nSo i did the normal thing and looked for counter-play, and counter picks; There aint fucking none, the only way yasuo is bad is if the player is bad.\r\nA pro even said that he only loses if he goes full ham (fml i can&#039;t find the quote)\r\n\r\nI looked at threads from up to 3-2 YEARS AGO that where eloquent and articulated about the problems, and nothing they said has changed\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1562346&amp;page=1\r\n-He is impossible to play against with any skillshot champ, ranged adc, or even another fucking melee adc\r\n-his shield is bigger than any support could provide, always up if yas is moving (so always up), and at no cost\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1578545\r\n-his &quot;negatives&quot;

cd dependant\r\nYas: RESOURCELESS, and virtualy no cd\r\n2\r\nYi: second strike every 3rd, and some minor true damage\r\nYas: DOUBLE CRITS (wtf)\r\n3\r\nYi: channeled heal, on an ability\r\nYas: free shield, (bigger than any support can provide), for simply moving, activates automatically on opponent damage, SECOND PASSIVE\r\n4\r\nYi: alpha strike, long cd, only hits a few enemies\r\nYas: A DASH FOR EVERY ENEMY IN LANE\r\n5\r\nYi: ...\r\nYas: a free, fast moving, huge CC that knocks up, he gets for hitting minions\r\n6\r\nYi: ...\r\nYas: A FUCKING SHEILD BRAUM SHOULD HAVE, THAT BLOCKS SOME ABILITIES THAT AREN&#039;T EVEN FUCKING PROJECTILES\r\n7\r\nYi: &quot;can&#039;t be slowed&quot; ult, MS,AS and some CDR\r\nYas: TELEPORT AND INVULNERABLE, WITH ANY KNOCK UPS ONTO AN ENEMY, HITS MULTIPLE ENEMIES\r\n\r\nThis was basically if a fan wanted to make a more broken Yi, but if a fan suggested this it would have been shot down instantly.\r\nHell i&#039;ve seen yas in every lane be a threat everywhere, how is that not the prime indicator something is wrong?\r\n\r\nThis is why he is so warping in lower elo, and everyone shuts him down in high elo asap\r\nIn high elo there is actual communication and organization, and the fucking jungler will camp Yas&#039;s sorry ass\r\n\r\nand none of this even address how toxic the players attracted to yas are, and that accounts for the apparent &quot;Their Yasuo will rape you all, Your teams Yasuo will fucking be raped&quot; effect.\r\nwhen your teammates fails with him they flame and feed. when the opponent yas kills you you can&#039;t do anything\r\n\r\nand my issue basically comes to this:\r\nIf they can fucking delete a less than year old champion like karma, only because it wasn&#039;t played enough, then how the hell has this game warping champion not even been reworked in 3 years?","replies":[{"poster":"Klergon","date":"2017-06-07T20:15:42.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...\n\nI have to say, it's possible to counter Yasuo. You just have to know what you're doing. If he were completely broken, don't you think he'd be the go-to pick/ban for LCS? That being said, he could take some nerfs to deal with him. I recently read in a patch notes (7.10 or 7.11, I forget which) that Riot slightly nerfed/changed Azir so that he'd have counterplay even when played right. Something along those lines would be helpful in Yasuo's case, as I find that no matter how poorly he has done in lane against me, no matter which champs I play against him, there comes a time in every game where his power becomes virtually unstoppable. Could be facerolling him as Swain 2 minutes ago, once he gets his items and cds, he's got a very high power spike. Maybe if Riot toned down the power spike, and lifted his early game a bit, then there would be a solution?\n\nBut that might just be me.

However, that being said your point is still valid; Azir was so strong that he had no counterplay, while Yasuo is only so strong because low elo players (like myself) don't understand, or rarerly understand, what his counterplay is. But, as I said in my original comment, Yasuo isn't as broken as some people think, and more broken than other people think. Honestly, I think that the best way to counter a Yasuo is with good team coordination and chain CC; however, at lower elos or in norms, this is very hard to pull off, and I get tired of picking Sion top 50% of the time because we need a good source of CC. But maybe that's just me, who knows.

Which if both the jungler and mid laner are AP champions, you DEFINITELY want that bit of {{item:1033}} to shut down any M pen they have early on and let you survive ganks better. It somewhat helps they curved hp stacking builds a bit and made a few items have higher resistance values which can end up with alot for damage reduced then soaking up 75 dmg with 'hp itself'.\n\nHe could still use some nerfs to restrict his 'high ceiling' a bit and dissuade 'nooblets' from picking him up over a much safer pick like {{champion:238}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:112}} and so on. Obviously a good deal of them are  AP but they tend to have kits that aren't as edgelord'ie, but can do big damage numbers with a bit of more 'leeway' on the items they build then what is basically {{champion:157}} 's one build pathway for the first 2 to 3 items almost every single match.\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\nIts just the typical mix of he gets too much hype when he should really have as much of a pick rate as any other mid-high tier mid laner with the weaknesses needing to be alot more clear cut then they currently are with the blurred lines.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-06-07T19:05:29.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jorencice,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rEMrts3V,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-07T18:29:07.103+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s funny is Yi can destroy yasou 1v1.\n> \n> ...yes that&#x27;s all I took from this thread.\n\nOnly when there is no minion wave around, as in they're literally 1v1 in a cage-fight setting.

Alpha Strike's CD is nearly 20 seconds in early levels (18-14 second over 5 spell levels) if he can't hit things to reduce the CD, and even if you can that's still quite long, hence generally you at best dodge 1 nado and that is it for that trade, meanwhile Yasuo can just spam E to get away from Yi while spamming Q to poke Yi down if there is a minion wave. This is especially true since Yas's dash is fixed-range, so he only has to worry about his dash angle, the range is always there.\n\nObviously, Yi doesn't start the game as lvl 6 and neither does Yasuo (which I think you're confusing about that given that you claim \"yi should be fast enough\", no he isn't pre-6), and laning phase mostly ends by lvl 6 anyway and thus the discussion pretty much ends as soon as or right after they reach 6.\n\nThat's precisely why pragmatically speaking, Yi can not win against Yasuo in minion waves, assuming both fighters know what they're doing. Yi has to find a way to duel Yasuo with no targets for him to dash to and juke around with, so that Yi can nail him down and kill him. That's how the fight works out between the 2. Yi kills Yasuo in a face-off, but Yasuo doesn't do face-offs in lane (at least not until he gets fed).

Straight up number LOSSES. Many of which apply to his \"Dashes\" and his \"Shield\". The most recent nerf hits his lane pressure by not letting Yasuo hold on to his Q stacks for more than 6 seconds. A 4 second loss is a huge nerf.\n\n> 6 free dashes per wave, still makes him impossible for a mid to lane against\n\nSimply not true. I can think of at least 3 champs off the top of my head (mages) who can easily handle Yasuo: Annie, Morgana, and Malzahar. The thing about Yasuo's dashes though is that they are VERY predictable. Its always a fixed distance, and always through a target, meaning if you track his positioning, (you do WATCH your lane opponent don't you??) the direction and distance he can dash is pretty easy to read.\n\n\n> a free massive shield for moving\n\nThat is easily broken by an auto attack and won't last longer than one second after use. He has low base stats, he needs windows to play as much as his opponents do. Also, Malzahar gets a better shield and doesn't even have to move to get it. He just has to not take damage. AND his blocks cc. Combine that with point and click MASSIVE DOT and VOID SPAM, and a ranged aoe SILENCE?! OMG (see what I did there?)\n\n> impenetrable wall wastes any counter play ability\n\nThis is not true, and has been disproven over and over again... The only thing (IMHO) about windwall that needs a change is it needs a set size/duration. It doesn't need to be bigger than rank 2 or 3, and its duration should not exceed 3 seconds... That would match a morgana snare. Wind wall doesn't move to block your damage, if he casts it, back up and make him have to come through it to damage you. If he is running, walk through it. Team fight? side step. Still not enough? Use non-projectile aoe Spells, like Malz Q, Annie W, Syndra Q, etc, etc, etc. There is plenty of ways to play around this ability. Frustrating? Yes! So is vlaad pool, and fizz troll pole... and don't get me started on caitlyns traps :P\n\n>  his ult still works of any ability knockup\n\n Any ALLIED ability knock-up. OMG he can have synergy. Like a billion other abilities that can combo cc. Like Jhin W, any allied damage works. His ult also puts his squishy but right in the middle of teamfights. \n\n> i only learned about him AFTER all the nerfs\n\nThis doesn't change anything or add to your argument.\n\n> and you just listed all the minor things, and didnt associate them with any of the issues bought up\n\nI apologize for respecting you as an intellectual...? I didnt think I would have to spell it out for you.\n\n>please tell me how shifting any numbers around deals with any of these core problems\n\nThe \"core problems\" that you bring up are that he \"has a kit\". You address everything in his kit as a problem, without addressing its inherent weaknesses. You don't evaluate and argue, you cry. I would gladly get into games with you to show you how to beat a Yasuo. Does Yasuo have outplay potential? Sure. Is he invincible? Far from it. Overpowered? no. If he was, he would be LCS pick/ban, like when Tri-force still gave crit.\n\n>because he will either rape everyone, or get everyone raped\n\nThis is not only an obvious case of memory bias, but also evidence against 2 major arguments brought against Yasuo: \nA) \"He's a brain dead/ brainless champion. Takes no skill.\"\n~and~\nB) \"He is OP. Lacks counterplay.\"\n\nIf one or both of these statements were true, the case where he is either getting crapped on hard or owning everyone would not exist. It would just be the latter. \n\nIf you want to have a serious discussion about champion strengths/weaknesses, try to be less biased in your argumentation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2017-06-07T19:02:37.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I half agree with you.  Any good Yasuo will mop the floor most of the time.  He is OP and needs a lot of nerfs.

Yes, Yasuo is a fucking disgrace for the game, he is  annoying in every possible way, and in low elo everyone can use him and cause a massacre.
