Consistent dc's from the main client page and in champ select. It doesnt effect me ingame but greatly effects me getting into a game, i just got into my promos for gold and was trying to get into a game but my client kept dc'ing and now it says i abandoned champ select and have a 30m ban, does that mean i got the 5m ban too? I really need a fix I've been playing this game since season 1 and i cant take this anymore x.x \nP.S. My connection is stable i play on wired and have tried wireless too, both work 100% of the time on everything else i play.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T20:42:42.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 30 minute ban reflects an escalation due to consistent queue dodges.  Even though your connection might feel strong, it doesn't rule out network issues reaching the game server.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  The steps here should get you squared away and back to game.  I also recommend doing any testing in custom games to prevent more penalties.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
