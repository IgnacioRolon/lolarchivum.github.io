Not because the other team counter picked us hard, I had to leave for something, or because I am a douche who likes to waste peoples times, but because my team literally refuses to play the role they are designated in champion select. The first game I had to dodge our last pick on the team was deemed support. So as anyone in bronze/low silver does they said \"I dont support\" and locked Akali with flash and ignite, clearly indicating they would be a burden to lane with and overall put everyone in the game on tilt and be a fiery chaos that ends up costing me like 24 LP. So I dodge to save LP and time and get into a game with players who will perform their roles. Or so I thought because once again another last pick player says \"i pref not support\". So I said please support if it ends up having to be your role. He agrees but when it comes to our last 2 players pick they are mid and support and they lock rek sai and ryze and both bring flash and ignite. Seeing that this game will go as horrible as I predicted the last one to, I dodged again to save myself from the flaming 20 minute or more bloodbath that was about to ensue.\r\nI guess what I'm getting at is how is this at all fair to the players of the community like me who want to play the game properly but are being hindered by people who are acting like idiots? We will be support if we end up as last pick and we have to but when it's someone elses turn to bite the bullet they troll and bring everyone else on the team down. This is aggravating but the worst part is I am being seen as the bad guy for dodging but it is really to try and save myself and the team from the impending doom of a 20 minute 9 v 1 yelling match that will probably end with \"REPORT X FOR FEEDING\" \"REPORT X FOR VERBAL ABUSE\" \"\"**** TRASH **** ****\". I really just want to play but I do not want to waste time playing a losing game that the people are going to just troll in and try to tilt their own teammates. It's tough to enjoy a game that I'm being hindered from playing properly and I just really want to have a good group of people who will play their roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Drive By Max","date":"2015-10-30T16:59:59.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, considering they said they don't want to support way before they had to get stuck with it, you could have picked a support and went support. So there's that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-10-30T17:34:00.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is unfortunate, although I generally do the same if it's something that overt within champ select. Although I've never received any sort of warning/punishment for it so I can only imagine you're dodging quite a number of games over time, just 2 in a row isn't enough. So maybe on those edge cases where champ select looks daunting go through with it anyways. Teams can pull together despite strange circumstances if you don't blame and flame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-10-30T17:06:19.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately Riot's ranked system is extremely outdated. Which in turn causes scenarios like this where the good guy ends up being the one punished. I feel ya man, we've all been there and had these things happen to us. But Riot tends to always look at it like this...\"it'll all even out. youll have a game where theres an afk on the enemy team eventually, and you basically get free LP from that, so it evens out.\" Sadly Riot uses this as an excuse waaaaay too much in these types of scenarios where good, upstanding players get punished b\\c they got put in a bad situation and refused to go along with it. Same thing when you have a game with 2 afk's on your team and you end up losing 20+ LP for losing the game. Why should YOU be punished for something you didnt do. You stuck around and tried to play the game anyway but you lose LP b\\c of other peoples wrong doing. Hopefully we get a lot of changes to the ranked system in season 6 which will address a lot of these issues","replies":[{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-10-30T17:26:36.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LastBreathX,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=BOTAxNTn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-30T17:06:19.663+0000)\n>\n> Unfortunately Riot's ranked system is extremely outdated.

There is a 55% chance to get an AFK on the other team, as opposed to a 45% chance to get one on your team [as long as you aren't the one doing it].  The Law of Large Numbers tells us that over a long enough series of games, you can expect those numbers to hold true.\n\nStop acting like a victim.  Everyone experiences AFK's, Feeders, Trolls, Bad Players, Ragers, and the people who can climb learn how to play around them.\n\n\"Why should YOU be punished for something you didnt do.\"\n\nBecause life isn't fair?  Sometimes you just have to accept that bad things will happen and figure out how to make the best of it.","replies":[]}]}]}
