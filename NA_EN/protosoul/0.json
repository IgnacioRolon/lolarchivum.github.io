If you're interested, we do have a knowledge base article here on the system:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22083111-Honor-System-FAQ\n\nWith all that said, I do agree somewhat with the comments here about the system.  It's not quite what it can be, although it is a really cool step.  The good news is that the Player Behavior and Justice team here at Riot is aware too.  Since the Tribunal is currently in extended maintenance while they work on new features they're looking on touching the honor system too.  One idea they've had is that, what if in addition to voting on players to punish for negative behavior, there could be a system of voting on players to promote for good behavior?\n\nThey're some cool things they're thinking up and working on, nothing too specific to really reveal yet though.  But I'd keep an eye out for updates.","replies":[{"poster":"raynac","date":"2015-08-11T00:59:41.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I would just like to say that I had maintained my ribbon from the time it came out to earlier this year. \n\nI was very proud of it and it made me feel good to have something to prove what most people who play with me know. That Im a really nice guy! (and not the kind that get angry at girls for friend zones, those are faker nice guys hahahah XD)\n\nI have had one of every ribbon but I experienced a large disapointment the other day when my final ribbon faded away, It felt terrible, I felt empty inside and didnt even want to play the match I was in que to play\n\nYou  may not know me, but I know me. and I will say with full confidence that If I cannot maintain an honor ribbon, then the system is not working properly! no one should be able to maintain one,  Not without resorting to some sort of abuse of the system. \n\nas  rioter could you please look into this? maybe make it so that the system looks for you to be meeting short-term honor goals but lower the short term requirements for those who maintain high amounts of honor over the long term.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChangeLord Freyr","date":"2014-07-13T22:38:44.379+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not impossible to maintain your ribbon with a little D.S.T. but compared to early season three seeing someone with a ribbon is a rarity to say the least.\n\nI got my Honorable Opponent ribbon back in preseason 3 (When someone could miss-click and you would get it by accident.), but even after the season 3 changes to the honor system I have kept mine (still have it now). I have 514 Honorable Opponents out of a little over 1000 wins (normals). \n\nI do agree that something is wrong with the system. I have seen a good deal of my friends lose there ribbons even though they kept getting honored, and when playing I see one red ribbon in 20 or so games if I'm lucky.\n\nI'm honestly afraid I'm going to lose my ribbon. I'm actually kinda proud of it. I actively try to lighten the mood and work with players both on and off my team so that I can keep my ribbon. \n\nWith this current system it doesn't matter how honorable you are, because the system doesn't reward you for being honorable. It allows players to give each other ribbons for liking each other. In my experience I give a lot more honorable opponents than I do teamwork/helpful/friendly, because I expect that of my teammates. Rarely does someone go so far above and beyond that I feel that they deserve it. Opponents on the other hand have this bad habit of \"to ez... skrubs\" which is what should take away peoples \"honor\"\n\nBut I understand the delicate balance of the system and how it's the communities nature to find ways to abuse or misuse it. I'm just voicing my fears and opinions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-07-12T01:05:07.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor Crests are based on a ratio of games played to honor received per game and I think a few other factors.
