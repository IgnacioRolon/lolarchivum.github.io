(It either negates the Q damage or the E damage). It applies the stun but a HUGE chunk of your burst damage is gone. \n\nTo replicate:\nStep 1: Q an enemy\nStep 2: E an enemy quickly after casting Q\n\nThe only way to make sure the bug doesn&#039;t happen is if you Q, wait until the sphere has completely finished its animation, and then E. It&#039;s a huge issue as the only way to get a reliable stun is to cancel half the damage of your burst combo. \n\n\nIt&#039;s been a long standing bug but lately it&#039;s been happening in every game. This has happens to me on the Atlantean Syndra skin. Going to try it out on her other skins now.\n\nEdit: This is NOT an Atlantean Syndra bug; it occurs on any Syndra skin.\n\nEdit 2: here are two video links\n\nThanks to Kimochii x3  for www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfWQg2hfrxw&feature=youtu.be\n\nIronically the bug was also in the allstars tournament and saved Zion's life:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=XwJ7KU8OrtI \nat 3:33 you can see Syndra Q and E Zion but he only takes the E damage which ends up saving his life.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-12-08T22:21:58.179+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friends,\n\nSyndra Q deals damage at the place Q was cast whenever the Q spawns, as opposed to dealing damage where it spawns after it's been affected by E. What seems to be happening to me in these videos is as follows.\n\n1st try \n\n1) Q cast\n2) Gromp is in Q-circle. Gromp is hit by Q damage\n3) E cast \n4) E connects with ball first (we're generous with Ball pick-up radius)\n5) Ball starts flying (note, the ball is far enough from the gromp when it's hit that gromp wasn't actually stunned in this case)\n6) E connects with Gromp and deals damage to it\n7) Gromp is sent flying back\n\nI'd argue that this isn't actually a reproduction of the combo anyways since the Q+E missed gromp (check above his head, he's never stunned). What happened in the 1st try is that Q hit gromp and then E hit gromp, basically. \n\n2nd try \n\n1) Q-cast\n2) E-cast\n3) E-connects with gromp, pushing gromp back (Q hasn't formed. You can confirm this by noting that when gromp is initially pushed back he isn't stunned. Q+E would've stunned him)\n4) Q is formed (Gromp is out of range by this point because E has pushed gromp out of where the Q hits. Check out the cracks in the ground, that's roughly where Q hits and you can see that gromp is not close to the center of those cracks.)\n5) E grace-period connects with the Q, even though technically the E has long since passed. (This grace period has existed for a very long time to reduce the instances where Q+E'ing would miss the ball because the ball hasn't formed yet.)\n6) Ball flies forth, stunning gromp (check out the stun indicator above gromp)\n\nWhat it looks like to me is that Q not affecting targets is a result of those targets not actually being in the Q circle whenever Q spawns.\n\nImo this is all working as intended, let me know how you feel about this assessment. Open to discussion about how this should work, but I wouldn't use the word bug when describing this interaction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kimochii x3","date":"2015-12-05T22:55:28.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No video material.\nI will try to provide a video material..\n\n====== EDIT ======\n\nThis is the video link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xfWQg2hfrxw\n\nPlease add it to your post @roseagius","replies":[{"poster":"roseagius","date":"2015-12-06T04:41:23.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

I know those mechanics like the back of my hand.\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was a patch that allowed Scatter the Weak to use not fully formed Dark Spheres as a viable mean of stunning.\nThat was about 2 years ago.\n\nAgain, the outcome is that Dark Sphere can be knocked out of its original position before forming, which in turn changes the spot it will deal damage.\n\nThere are two possible fixes for this... \"bug\", as you call it.\n\n1. Sphere dealing damage regardless of its position at the end of the cast, which leads to clarity issues and confusion for the other party, ironically leading to very similar threads to this one. Judging from Riot's lately endeavours that's the exact opposite of what they want.\n2. The interaction gets completely remove and you will be completely unable to make a quick stun, which also won't happen because Riot never reverts changes like this. Plus it would hurt **you** more than anybody.","replies":[{"poster":"roseagius","date":"2015-12-07T01:06:06.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I just find it messed up that ad champs get rewarded for animation cancelling while ap champs get punished.\n\nRiven and Fiora are nothing WITHOUT their animation cancels while Syndra loses half her damage WITH an animation cancel.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-12-07T15:12:00.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a whole different thing.\n\nBut I completely agree with your stance on it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2015-12-09T07:16:15.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me or is Q->E also very sluggish compared to before?
