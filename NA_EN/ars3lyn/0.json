The client needs to talk with our servers to figure out exactly what it needs to display on the store page, and if it can't reliably reach our servers then it won't know what to show you resulting in a black screen. Hit up our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and run through those steps.
