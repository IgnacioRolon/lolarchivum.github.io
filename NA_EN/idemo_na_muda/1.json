For the love of god its so not fucking pleasant to play a chill game of URF where u came to cool down from your cancerous soloQ / flexQ ranked games and you have to get a full tank mundo in the enemy team that tryhards on URF like his life depends on it. \r\nSpirit Visage\r\nRanduins\r\nThornmail\r\nAdaptive helm\r\nFrozen Heart\r\nLocket \r\nZeke's\r\nStoneplate\r\nGuardians\r\nSunfire \r\nDead Man's\r\nIceborn Gaunlet\r\n\r\nNote: Yes, Maw gives MR and yes, Zhonyas give armor and yes, Wit's end gives MR but they are an offensive item as well, but i find them fine since they're not giving u unkillability. \r\nAll i'm saying is\r\nDisable all tank items on URF. It's not fun. At all. I get rengar and i can't play him ap cause their vladimir goes spirit first item. \r\nAlso quit the AR bullshit, give us bans and champs we wanna play. Or make a pool made out of 15 champions where we put the champs we have / free champs so we can have like a little champion pool made for urf that we would like to play.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-06T22:08:02.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No.\n\n{{item:3194}} is incredibly good in urf.

In fact, most people dont.\n\nI dont see why intentionally choosing to be bad lets you spam your abilities more, but you dont appear to counterbuild in normals either, so i doubt you would know.\n\nAlso, if you dont care about stuff being OP, why are you rageposting about people building stuff you dont like?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
