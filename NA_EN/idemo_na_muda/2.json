His ult healing is somewhat fine ( if you are able to burst him down once again ) but then, in order to burst him down, you need to be ALIVE\r\nyou can&#039;t be alive against ekko when his passive and E together deal more than like, Zed&#039;s entire WEQWAA combo or Yasuo&#039;s QQEQ and bunch of AA&#039;s. His passive should be nerfed to the goddamn ground cause it really is broken. Ekko main or not, you gotta admit that his damage from passive is absolutely ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"skoulker","date":"2018-04-19T20:07:18.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The damage isn't broken. I'm sorry you mispositioned or got stomped or something, but that doesn't make you right. Ekko has good burst but is squishy and reliant on his target not being able to move. CC, locket, and phantom dancer are all things that make his burst tickle. Learn how to play against him don't try to get him gutted.","replies":[{"poster":"IDEMO NA MUDA","date":"2018-04-19T20:29:56.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Iron solari got nerfed to the ground so its almost useless. CC can maybe kill him but that means your entire team has to go on him and him only while the enemy team is free to destroy your team. He can R back to get full hp back, and he is far from squishy especially with his regular build.","replies":[{"poster":"skoulker","date":"2018-04-20T01:21:30.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um... no. Iron Solari is still really good on a tank, which is what it's for. His ult heal works on damage taken with a small base heal with a decent scaling. Unless it gets really late game his base heal isn't all that good, he needs to take damage for it to heal a lot. What is his \"regular build\"?","replies":[{"poster":"IDEMO NA MUDA","date":"2018-04-21T11:58:04.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the regular build includes spell-vamp + flat hp items such as protobelt, in some cases even  Rylai's Scepter, Zhonya's which gives armor and untargetability, sometimes Liandry's and sometimse RoA with huge burst damage. I just think his passive should get nerfed, nothing other than that","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SalamencÄ™","date":"2018-04-19T20:30:15.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-19T20:34:11.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not OP, you just need to learn how to not feed him.\n\nConsidering that game, i will just hazard a guess you braindead-spammed abilities at him without any regard for his E and R being up, like most Syndra players.","replies":[{"poster":"skoulker","date":"2018-04-20T01:22:09.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I should of checked the match history.

And just for the record, i was decent that match but my botlane ( as always ) was feeding. I was fine on mid, not even bullied or anything. I've enountered his OP-ness mostly on his passive. I've played... katarina? i think? and i've had like, around 150mr ( i even bought maw ) and he literally just double Q'd me and proced the passive with a basic attack which was enough to kill me. He was decently fed but with 150 mr and nearly 2k hp im not really supposed to be one shoted like that, right","replies":[]}]}]}]}
