Then another pass at Jhin, Kai'Sa, Graves, and sleeper meta forever Miss Fortune can be looked at again. \n\nJax needs some taps, I agree. He's very consistent and doing well which might not seem like a problem at face value, however he also retains a large impact on games from laning phase to teamfighting, to split pushing, frontlining, bursting, and objective taking. Rather powerful statement of a champion to boast. \n\nKassadin is good, but not overbearing imo and depending on where the meta goes will need nerfs accordingly. But as is, I don't think he's sorely in need of being touched just for performing very well and not being particularly oppressive. The numbers he possesses at the moment means generally for any champion, that the meta is favoring them at the moment and can change with other balance notes that need not touch whatever decently good thing they have going on. Kassadin is on the line without needing anything yet for the purpose he provides to a team, but should be kept watch on as the next patch or two comes out and Worlds winds down. Can easily drop a little or spike, and he's very volatile as far as champions go. \n\nAkali and Aatrox are doing awful in regular play, they have Ryze syndrome basically. Akalis shroud being unhealthy and toxic doesn't mean she needs nerfs, it means the mechanic needs to change, so that she can actually have a more fleshed out power budget to balance. As she is, so much is in W that even though her regular win rate tanks, the budget is so heavily invested in W that they will make other parts of her kit imbalanced for the sake of her being unique rather than balanced. If they do decide to change the Shroud so it can actually be seen by turrets at the very least, there might be something to work with. I don't even know what to suggest about Aatrox -- his kit is just pro play sensitive like Ryze and probably won't be easily viable anymore in ranked. It's not as bad as Ryze at least, but it's comparable. \n\n\nChampion balance is honestly exhausting, nerfing damage across the board with a major numbers nerf to everything would be great just to grant a buffer. Sort of like cutting away the foam just to see the liquid. Foam is just all damage right now and it's covering up a lot of balance appropriations to whether something kills fast or can survive, which makes it two extremes rather than balance (that means patch notes are too busy with the damage and not on kits, objectives, and most other items that are not burst), and the ones in between are just taken out of the equation. It also explains why there's such a large disparity in effectiveness between meta and non-meta champions this season and how solo carry potential is directly influenced by that as well, making for a miserable experience if you are fed on a meta champ vs off-meta to drag a team across the enemy nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shleelpboy","date":"2018-10-02T15:40:43.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus Nerf just a suggestion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Matty","date":"2018-10-02T14:07:32.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about we just gut Tahm Kench more because he can save people from a 1-shot meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-10-02T13:38:25.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they wanted to improve Aatrox's late game.\nMaybe tone down his lvl 6 - 9 damage then?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakxcombat","date":"2018-10-02T12:00:19.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't nerf Jhin just nerf stormrazor.
