RIP transparency as a company\n\nUnless something changes dramatically about the way groups of humans manage the planet, \"transparency as a company\" is something **everyone should demand** but *never believe has been delivered*.\n\nI mean that generally, not just as it applies to Riot. After all, there are whole professions, and associated areas of study, dedicated to convincing people *not* to demand transparency. Fanboyism in any other market is called _brand loyalty_. Loyalty from one person to another is a complicated phenomenon. Most of its use in the management of markets has amounted to what would be called _abuse_ if it were done by people. Individuals who lie to the people who support them are not generally rewarded for that behavior. Individuals have limited incentive to engage in dishonest behavior repeatedly, since escaping a reputation is costly (financially, personally). The risk for most big companies in that behavior is negligible; besides being unmoved by emotion, their identities are flexible, they have less dependence on each person involved (Riot's friends list is millions of names long), and the balance of power is in their favor (a corporation has to do something **seriously evil** to motivate ordinary people to feel offended enough to take action all at once; even if 60% of the playerbase were unsatisfied, Riot would have no reason to worry).\n\n\n/off-topic blah-blah","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spartan Potatoes","date":"2017-07-16T15:53:48.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF/ARUF, Dark Star, One for All are very nice.

Most successful game outfits eventually reach a stage wherein every team mostly strives to confirm that they are doing everything right (instead of confronting shortcomings--much less admitting them to the players by adjusting their decision-making process). PK and Ascension get more Riot attention and more hype--and are simply available far more often.\n\nThe only game mode that has inspired players to set up petitions on Change.org that than went on to receive tens of thousands of signatures was URF. (If you go looking, you'll see that URF attracted similar attention in every region).\n\nHonestly, I think URF threatens Riot's e-sports scene. Since being acquired by Tencent, their tight-lipped obstinacy in certain unpopular decisions has mostly benefited LoL e-sports.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2017-07-16T03:22:43.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'll be a long while","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thewannabegamer","date":"2017-07-16T16:03:08.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"April First as it should stay.","replies":[{"poster":"iDemacia","date":"2017-07-16T22:42:11.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't had it in April the last 2 years what makes you think that's the day for it?
