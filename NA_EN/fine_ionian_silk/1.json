A few seconds after we got their Baron, we all experienced the issue where our screens suddenly froze and we were unable to alt f4 or anything like that. One or two of my friends said they were able to get back into the game (where the enemy team did not experience the issue and pushed mid endlessly). The rest of us, however, had to restart our PC in order to be able to do anything again.\r\n\r\nWas there a server issue or something along those lines? All of us experiencing the same issue at the same time is a bit too much to be coincidental, especially considering the timing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-18T19:15:31.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a very strange issue, but I haven't seen any server issues.  Are you guys all in the same network?  When was the match and what champ were you using?  I can take a look and see if something might be up.","replies":[{"poster":"Fine Ionian Silk","date":"2017-11-18T19:18:43.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe we're all on the same network (do you mean network provider?). The match was not too long ago (today), it lasted 28 mins and 53 seconds and I was playing Amumu.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-18T19:34:07.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, yeah ISP or if you're all like in the same room.  Thanks for the info!  I found the match but I wasn't able to see anything out of the ordinary.  If you guys are playing in the same area, the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide might help tune up your network.  Otherwise, double check your ISP in case something might be going down.","replies":[{"poster":"Fine Ionian Silk","date":"2017-11-18T20:09:06.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't live near each other.

Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: 104.160.131.1.  Run it for about 5 minutes, remove the IP on the first two rows, and let me know what you find.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
