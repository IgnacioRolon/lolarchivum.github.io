When I scroll over the icon it says that it's the highest mastery champion, but that wasn't true earlier? Is there any possible way to get Rakan back without having to get him my highest mastery champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-06T03:46:10.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That dynamic background on your profile mostly looks at your highest mastery to determine which champion it shows. After that, it looks for most played champion as well as the total amount of mastery XP on your champions. Right now it looks like your two highest masteries are Soraka and Nami, with Rakan in a close third at level 6. Once you get him to level 7 and play him a little more than Soraka, he'll push her off and taking her place as your background ^_^.","replies":[{"poster":"Fine Ionian Silk","date":"2017-06-06T03:47:43.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, is that how it works?
