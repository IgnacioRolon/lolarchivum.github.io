I had 7 key fragments and so I forged 2 keys using 6 of them at around 2:30am est on october 14th 2016. I realized as I the second key was forging that no new keys had appeared in the hextech inventory. Is there any way for me to get the 6 fragments back? Is this a known bug? I also used a championship jewel token afterward but it successfully gave me 2 new championship jewels so I don't think that the problem is just due to a some kind of lag in the client.\r\n\r\nAny help or information would be greatly appreciated!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T17:34:00.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds strange that your keys would just disappear, so I looked into this to find out what happened.  I do see that you crafted 2 keys from 6 fragments.  Your inventory does currently show you having 2 Hextech keys.  Are you still experiencing this issue?  If so, have you tried relogging yet in case of some sync or connection issue?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky 77 Sevens","date":"2016-10-15T02:12:20.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for getting back to me so soon!
