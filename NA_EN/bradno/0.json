Some of my teammates make poor decisions, and I try not to flame them so I can climb. But I just have to hard flame some people because they lack too many brain cells to make good decisions (not that I'm perfect, but I try to make fewer mistakes). And when I flame them, I will probably get reported for it. And, I \"probably\" deserve the report. But, at the end of the day, if you keep on making poor decisions in my game, I'm not going easy on you. I'm trying to climb, not carry your dumbass.\n\nI will accept my permaban, however, I will quit if I get permabanned.\n\n>Removed by Moderation>","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-02-22T18:31:40.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Welp, it doesnt really seem like OP wants to have a conversation here about behaviour.

About 1/4 of the player base in Silver and Gold are what's wrong with the community, from the terms of toxicity. Case and point is this entire thread.\n\nIt's as you said: these people, including you, should know what they're doing...whether it's right for the game, whether they made a mistake, whether they need to take a break to not go full demon mode in all chat and waste 27 minutes of everybody's lives...\n\nBut those people can't take ANY responsibility for a loss, or criticism for even a single, small mistake, because IT CAN NOT BE THEIR FAULT if they lose or if it looks like they're going to lose. They're just too competitive and egotistical\n\nOr, in the case of players like you, because you don't CARE if it's your fault, as long as people you *personally* blame don't win their game. You play god, plain and simple. The total god-complex, \"you don't deserve this win\" types are BY FAR the worst.\n\nBronze and Iron are learning. They're low for a reason, and even though they share a lot of the same behaviors, I could argue they *learned* them from the **true** villains. Silver and Gold know things, but some get all elitist whenever literally anything goes wrong, and throw half their games being tilted instead of trying to make a comeback. Or more, if they decide the only way to get people to notice their effort is to babyrage to the boards about how they're about to get perma'd from \"other people's lack of ability.\"\n\nAt the risk of getting myself into trouble, let me recite the Deep Magic of gamers, just this once, to tell you clearly: \"Good.
