It helps me be more diplomatic and get the heat of the moment away from making me embarrass my allies more than they already have been. They already have an enemy team making them feel bad. They don't need anyone on their team making them feel bad too, even if they deserve it, they're still more valuable to you if you find a way to make them feel good about you teaching them something. The most difficult people for me to reach are those that play in groups because I can't appeal to them as individuals because they don't even see themselves as such.

I don't know if this is true or not because I have no personal experience in it and it's all kind of anecdotal evidence on the forums but what I have seen is a pattern of players complaining that they get honors in post game and they are still in dishonored for months, which makes me believe that what the reds said about being slightly negative in games does halt your honor progress regardless of whether or not someone gives you an honor post game. \n\nAnyway, best of luck and hopefully you'll get out of dishonorable soon!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Still Virgiñ","date":"2018-12-17T03:05:52.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never type anything, and i usually get honored.","replies":[{"poster":"BradNo","date":"2018-12-17T03:39:35.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was doing that when I played jhin.
