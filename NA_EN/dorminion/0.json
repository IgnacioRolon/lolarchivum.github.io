Whether it be before the first wave of minions or after we have taken all inhibitors, it does not matter. I started having problems last Sunday night and have tried games every day since then and with no luck, I have completed games but only 10% of them. What happens is, my character will stop moving all together but sometimes minions will move, it will then show the \"Attempting to reconnect\" bar. I have tried exiting out of the game and joining back in but then I get stuck on the screen right before the game starts. I don't think its my internet's problem as I keep a steady ping of 30 or lower. I have tried closing everything besides League and still no dice. I have disabled and enabled peer to peer, I have deleted the game and re-downloaded it numerous times, and I have ran out of options. Please help if you have anything to try. Any and all options are greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T04:28:32.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like you're experiencing packet loss and/or entire connection drop-offs to the gameservers.

Would those logs help? Also, I switched my DNS, used an Ethernet connection, those did not work. Then I ran the packet buffering test form this link http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/ and it really didn't say much. Thank you for the response and I'm sorry if this is frustrating as I am not that good with technology.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T21:47:17.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the connection guide didn't resolve your issue, I recommend reaching out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach those hextech logs to it.
