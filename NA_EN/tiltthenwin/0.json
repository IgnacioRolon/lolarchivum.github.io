I promise, if you try playing mostly in groups of friends you&#x27;ll have a much better time than you currently are.\n\nYes and at this point its the ONLY way I can still play league. Because as uber danger once said league is no longer a game I use to have fun. Its a game to be a backdrop when among friends.  Something we can all connect to while apart and talk, joke, laugh while it goes on in the backround as everyone autopilots on their mains or gets carried by the guy auto-piloting while you occasionally try something different.\n\nRiot has stated multiple times that the game is more enjoyable with friends and I agree BUT at what cost? They want to promote gameplay with friends  ever since season 5 and since then the power of solo carries has gone (If a single person gets caught out now you give up sooo much map pressure until you are 5 again), team objectives have gone up, we got dynamic que (which don't get me wrong I enjoyed with friends but as a solo experience it might as well been hell).   As a result the game has become more toxic among solo players and just meh among friends. \n\nRemember when every game felt different? When there was a trio of team comps for teamfights that kinda worked like rock, paper, scissors? Poke, engage, and wombo combo. You could have a little of all, or two, or invest heavily in a single comp and you knew your win condition.  On top of that there were other strategies like splitpushing and seiging instead of fighting.  \n\nNow EVERY game feels the exact same.  People do so much damage that a single poke champion is enough to be the old poke comp, a single engage is enough to be a wombo combo since people blow up instantly anyways.  Splitpushing is pretty much part of most games but it falls off pretty fast since the mid game disappeared.  \n\nI loved this game. I played way to many games a day and tbh I still would be playing if I could bring myself to look forward to each game.  Now I look at the champ select and it doesn't even matter what champions are on either team.  They game will play out the same way regardless of who gets the lead. \n\nThis game used to be about the overall strategy of your team mixed with the tactics of teamfights and rotations.  Now is all just fast paced tactics.  \n\nSo yeah I still play it with friends but it will never compel me to properly learn (read main) new champions and buy their upcoming skins anymore. It will never compel me to play just one more game after a tilting loss and it will never again compel me to get on immediately when I have free time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aliied champion1","date":"2017-12-26T18:34:43.154+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doctor Dyment,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Eea9L7ni,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-12-26T09:17:36.110+0000)\n>\n> Gonna get a lot of flak for saying this, but have you tried playing more often with friends instead of alone?
