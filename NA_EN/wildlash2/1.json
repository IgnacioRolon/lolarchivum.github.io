If he gets behind he's still pretty annoying due to his slows/snares and still can instantly kill most ADCs without a defensive item, which typically is also the ADC's 5th or 6th item. He's a feast or famine champion that never really famines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-07-29T19:35:53.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't wanna get nuked, you shouldn't have fed the entire game prior to this encounter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwÃ«ek","date":"2015-07-29T19:34:39.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/y0F7AKW.png\n\nThe Rengar ended 27/1/3 with 345 CS at 40 minutes.
