I don't know about first back, I can't really give you a time we do this on a regular basis. But most diamond level players average about 3 pinks purchased per match. I'm a little bit closer to 4 myself, but I always did more warding than your average player. Before we removed vision wards from the shop this preseason I would average just less than a ward placed per minute from non support roles. As a support it was probably closer to an average of 60 per game. I liked to ward. A lot.

Junglers and supports aren't the only people who should be warding. \n\nI've seen laners place 8 wards in a 60 minute game. Yellow trinket the entire game, and 8 wards. I've even seen a jungler place 4 wards with yellow trinket after 45 or so minutes. There's absolutely no reason for that...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mynameisskii","date":"2016-06-07T08:08:41.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss green wards so much ;-; I used to buy the crap out of them","replies":[{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2016-06-07T08:43:03.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main reason they got rid of green wards was because \n\n1. On low elos no one would buy them, they just expect the support to do all the warding. So i think hey wanted to promote team warding. Restrict the amount of wards a support can hae to force the rest of the team to buy them. And low and behold the ward changes changed nothing because MOST people on low elos still just use trinkets and cry \"we have no vision\" when the supports wards run out. \n\n2. I think because of all the trolls that would do nothing to help the team and would just fill up all their item slots with green wards and then drop 30 of them in your base while the enemy was destroying it,\n\nThough these may or may not be the reasons that 2nd one was annoying as hell. Just as annoying as these full AP annie, lux and nidalee supports that never buy a sightstone. The Nids that do that are the worst out of them 3...at least the lux can snare....the nids just change form and run and leap to safety while your ass is getting thrashed.
