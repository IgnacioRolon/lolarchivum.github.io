I'm very tired of this even when I barely make it back in time after the crash its so late in the game. I just got a leaver on my account because of this so now I feel like I'm suffering even more for something on riots part. Also, so many other people are having the same or similar issues lately. What's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T21:50:40.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there is a pretty serious network issue if your ping is staying as high as 500, and ultimately kicking you off because it can't hold onto the game server.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve this, and test it out in a custom to be sure.  Not everyone is having this issue.  League is an always online game, so connection issues are the most common problem.  Let me know how that works for you.","replies":[]}]}
