I just played one now and got an S. And still no token. Please I'm not understanding why this is happening. You can look up the match history and clearly see I earned the s but got no token. Please help.

This actually disqualifies you from earning Hextech loot after matches, which includes mastery tokens.  You can read more in-depth about this in our [Hextech Restrictions Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463).\n\nI hope this alleviates some confusion, let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ult√Æma","date":"2016-05-20T16:18:49.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I understand why banned/punished players don't get to have extra goodies, why is this applicable to champion mastery? His ability to play the champion (and getting great scores) has no bearing on his in-game attitude. Why is champion mastery gated both by hextech crafting AND player behavior? This system doesn't seem to be representative of players' skills with a champion and there isn't an explanation as to why it was arbitrarily designed that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silent Arrow","date":"2016-05-29T12:59:16.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this was 10 days ago but you're wrong... I was getting s-'s. I got an S that same night and got a token so no I was not punished... And speaking of behavior in game, I honestly don't understand your shitty system. Someone trolls in a game and then starts being toxic to the troll WHO IS INTENTIONALLY FEEDING and you the players GETS a punishment. You guys are only helpful when it comes to the top players like helping the pro's take care of Tyler 1. You guys don't even look into the chat. Someone gets banned just by the amount of votes. But what if those games there was an actual troll?? And get the opposing team to report with that troll? If you guys actually cared about your system I wouldnt be leaving 4 out of 7 games Ive been trolled on recently. They steal your role in champ select, they tilt your team, and they INTENTIONALLY feed. AND ONE TIME I HAD SOMEONE FOLLOWING ME WHILE I WAS JUNGLING!!! But yea the toxic mouths are worse???? Yea okay!!!! Get real Riot. anyways Thank for being WRONG about what you posted Cause i got my lvl 7 that night. :))))) and thanks for reading this post about your stupid fucking shitty banning system. Sorry real words from a COMPETITIVE gamer. Not a pussy gamer. :) League is a sport remember? Treat it like one.","replies":[]}]}]}
