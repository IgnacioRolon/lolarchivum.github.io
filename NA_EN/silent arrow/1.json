Since clubs had issues loading, it would explain why this error message pops up, but doesn't really affect anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Arrow","date":"2016-05-07T16:16:10.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you very much :D But I have been lagging at moments in every game :( I never lag lol.
