[Gameplay]","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have been noticing a recurring issue with his W - Hunters Call (attack speed buff) not casting at all. I wish I could be more scientific about when or where it won't work, but I can't find any pattern. I've had this issue happen to me during both team fights and 1v1, it doesn't seem to have any bearing on my unbuffed attack speed, teammates attack speed, the buff putting anyone's attack speed over cap, distance of or number of teammates nearby, buffs, gear... it doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason. Sometimes it goes off just fine, sometimes I think I'm going to break my W. Is this a known problem and is there any plans to fix this? Is it possible that this issue is unique to me and perhaps I'm imagining this issue along with my army of gnomes that won't stop bringing me socks? If WW is \"working as intended\" I may have to stop my medication...\n\n*edit for clarity.. sort of","replies":[{"poster":"AWKaiser","date":"2014-09-23T16:32:25.168+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm suffering of the same bug, I did initially think that was an invisible cooldown but I started to suffer of the same bug on summoner spell Flash only when usung Warwick, anyone with this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Faksnima","date":"2014-09-25T21:18:01.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bumping this.

This has a significant effect on gameplay. I like Gangplank too (and actually play him more than WW), but I'd rather this lockout issue get fixed than making Gangplanks R more \"consistent\".\n\nHonest question: Do the people who ultimately decide what fixes have a higher priority than others actually have gametime on the champions they're making the decisions about?
