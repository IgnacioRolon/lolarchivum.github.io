But in the store the descriptions says 2 missions only (screenshot: http://puu.sh/xHnd4/4992585d6b.png).\n\nTy in advance\n\nEdit:\nalso do i need to buy the normal champion ship ashe skin to unlock chroma for 320 tokens or can i use it without having the basic one?","replies":[{"poster":"Rogue NÄ±nja","date":"2017-10-27T23:56:38.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just stared the missions and i bought the worlds master pass i have 35 tokens. but i bought the worlds master pass today does that mean i will still have enough time to do the missions and be able to get the chroma and the ashe boarder or im i out of time.
