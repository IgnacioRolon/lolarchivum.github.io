It marked the official kickoff of competitive League of Legends and there are some events and partnerships planned for it.

We thought a lot about that, and in the short term, we&#039;re going to keep releasing champions. In the longer term, as we roll out competitive seasons, our first season will include all champions, but our additional seasons will feature a reduced set of &quot;in-season&quot; champions. This means that -- while you can always play all champions in [casual play] -- the featured competitive mode will have a reduced set of champions that rotates periodically as we cycle through seasons. This allows us to revitalize the metagame; if a particular strategy is getting really strong, one way to make things interesting is to just change the champion rotation. And it also reduces the learning burden for someone coming in, so they don&#039;t have to learn 60 champions -- they only have to learn 35 or 40, or whatever number we determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL:DR Champions are not being rotated like they said they were going to do","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-05-06T14:33:30.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's pretty obvious that this idea has been abandoned.

Hence the comment.\n\nIt's more of a general observation of mine that Riot has done a fairly mediocre job of communicating on their own Boards when the status of any project changes. Some Rioters are aware enough of this to point it out, as well. \n\nBut, as Rioters have stated in the past, the best way to try to get feedback is to be cordial, and your post has done that. I wish people wouldn't downvote the post, because all it would take is a couple of minutes from a Rioter to see this and make a quick comment about it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-05-06T14:03:57.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is that at first they weren't as confident that they could keep balancing the game with an ever growing champion pool. But.. So far they've done a pretty damn good job. Sure you have OP champions and OP tactics, but the amount of advantage they give isn't THAT great. Cinderhulk is OP, but it's not like you can't win without it. The same goes with anything else and I suppose Riot is happy with the amount of variation there currently is (while they expected everything to be way more stale) that it's not necessary to rule out certain champions. Also, we have 6 bans that kind of work like a player-based rule out of certain champions and some champions might actually be nearly completely ruled out for (part of) a season{{champion:38}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sl0th Kidd","date":"2015-05-06T14:14:43.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what if those OP champions are just OP for a few months.. rotation hits now come up with some new starts.. this is where champion mastery would kick in.. master a ton of champions.. and those champions are now part of your \"rotation\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-05-05T19:09:07.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm yeah they are...\n\nEver heard the term  \"flavor of the month\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-05-05T21:48:44.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would kind of suck, If I had to go an entire ranked season without playing Sona I probably wouldn't play ranked, or at least I wouldn't support.
