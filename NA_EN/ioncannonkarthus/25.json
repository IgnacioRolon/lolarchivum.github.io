Chromas have once again proven that Riot doesn't pay attention to feedback, literally EVERYONE who voiced an opinion on them was negative and Riot didn't change a single fucking thing.  Riot's art team is still completely fucking worthless and have a backlog that rivals the IRS.  Shurima lore is still less filled out than old sivir's arms in spectacular sivir.  Fuck TSM.\r\n\r\nEUW/EUNE should either be banished to their own GD that already exists or have their own GD eliminated.  East Coast servers need to happen, or at least centralized servers need to be balanced.\r\n\r\nAlso, Nasus is balanced atm, learn to play the fucking game ADCs, just learn to play the damn game.\r\n\r\nhttp://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/270/1/b/shitposting_loudly_by_justapersonwithapc-d80p9p1.gif","replies":[]}
