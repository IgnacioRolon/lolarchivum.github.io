Then came Anivia who actually made a wall, it didn't do anything else, just block movement from champions/minions/etc.  Pretty solid, easy to counter, just walk around or jump over it.\r\n\r\nThen we got Yasuo's windwall, blocks all projectiles.  Kind of bullshit but it doesn't move, has a decently long cooldown, isn't that wide.  Overall, a bit much for a wall but hey, powercreep is powercreep and this was alright.\r\n\r\nAnd then, we got Braum's shield.  A mobile windwall.  Can't defend this shit in the slightest.  Thought this would be the last wall we got, but that was not so.\r\n\r\nShurima happened.  We now have a wall with a knockback that allows Azir's team to go through it but not enemies, enemies can't even jump the damn thing like Anivia's anymore.\r\n\r\nMy prediction for the next wall is going to be a mobile, lane wide wall that gives allies MS when moving through and stuns enemies that touch it or try to jump it.  It will also reflect all projectiles back to the senders.  This is how wall creep is going to end.","replies":[]}
