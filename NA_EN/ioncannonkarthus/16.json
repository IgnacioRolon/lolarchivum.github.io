Now, this does NOT mean that Rioters are bad, on the contrary the majority of Rioters are very talented and very passionate.  The problem is that Riot's management is shit.  Riot has consistently been inconsistent over the years and has never released a finished product and supported it, here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n* Dominion, it was released and completely forgotten about by Riot for roughly 1-2 years before they finally started map specific balance changes.  Dominion's lack of popularity can be traced back to Riot's unwillingness to support it and grant it a ranked queue to give players a reason to play it.  Dominion already doesn't have a queue on LAN and I wouldn't be surprised if it started to get removed from other servers.\r\n\r\n* Honor System, it was released and then abandoned entirely.  Lyte toted it as a new system to promote less toxic play and reward people for being honorable.  Instead we were given an arbitrary number that gave us a nice ribbon.  This is a prime example of a waste of resources from Riot, granted pretty much everything Lyte's done is a fucking waste of resources so that's not a big surprise.\r\n\r\n* A New Client, last year Riot hired AstralFoxy, the creator of the Mint league client, to come and work on a new client for them.  We have heard literally nothing about a new client and rumors that they haven't even touched on it yet.\r\n\r\n* Ranked System, we all know by now that ranked is pretty pointless apart from Diamond 1/Master/Challenger.  Riot has made this painfully apparent with the removal of decay below Platinum but that isn't the point.  Your rank below Diamond 1 doesn't even match up with Riot's judgement of your skill, AKA MMR.  Riot's ranked system is a shiny wrapper to make people feel good that in no way ranks people's skill.  If Riot was actually serious about ranked they'd have people play vs people 1 division above or below them, not entire leagues above or below since the players are trying to climb above their current rank it only makes sense to match them vs people of the same rank.\r\n\r\n* Tribunal, it went down for maintenance over a year ago.  Where the fuck is it?\r\n\r\n* Art Team, in particular splash arts for VU'd champions and skins.  Remember the promised Nidalee splash arts?  Nidalee was VU'd in the Vi patch on December 14, 2012.  It has been over 2 years and we STILL do not have the splash arts for Nidalee or other VU'd champions.\r\n\r\n* Centralized Servers or East Coast Servers.  People have been begging for this for years and the only thing we've gotten from Riot has been \"we're looking into it\" and \"we're 'migrating' servers to a different part of the same building.\r\n\r\n* Balance Team, do I even need to explain this one?\r\n\r\n* Magma Chamber, Ao Shin.  I'm just tacking stuff on here for the hell of it.\r\n\r\nNow, how can Riot improve itself to become a halfway decent company instead of an EA that delivers on it's promises less often and charges you more for less?  There are a few ways:\r\n\r\n* Replace or actually hire management to keep the departments working in a timely manner.  I'm going to pick on the art team here because they are the most visible in this regard.  Get your fucking shit together and focus on champion splash arts instead of Esports bullshit.\r\n\r\n* Cutback on esports.  Seriously, everyone knows its a black hole for your goddamn finances, stop throwing everything into it.\r\n\r\n* Communicate with the community.  You guys used to do it, you were good at it.  Now you mainly hide out in reddit and occasionally send out your QA people in the jaded homegrown reddit you've created.  You wonder why people here aren't as calm as reddit?  We're tired of your bullshit, it's that simple.  We've put up with it for years and it has only gotten WORSE.\r\n\r\nRiot has very talented and very passionate individuals, but their management is worse than the United States government.  People can dog on EA all day long, at least EA gives products in a timely manner and comparatively speaking, reasonably prices their products.  Sad fucking day when EA is ran better than Riot.\r\n\r\nTL;DR  Riot's management is shit.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.interpretllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/riot_games.jpg","replies":[]}
