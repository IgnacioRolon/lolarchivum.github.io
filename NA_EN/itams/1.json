Why). I'm inclined to agree with most people here though; her E or passive will probably take some sort of hit, maybe a range reduction on her passive, or some sort of limit on E (either a hard limit or some sort of damage fall off, sort of like how Azir's soldiers do less damage if more than one are attacking the same target). I get the feeling that nothing is going to be outright removed, but instead a large portion of her damage is going to be nerfed and she's going to be really dependent on her support, if she actually proves to be toxic OP\n\nEDIT: [Surrender@20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/11/114-pbe-update.html) just put out some more info on her as she is on PBE currently. I might have to retract some of my statements. Good lord this champion is stacked. Her passive dash actually *scales* with her boot rank. Not to mention she can't cancel her auto attacks (both a blessing and a curse, I guess, but probably more of a blessing, given that she can reposition herself so much better than any other ADC). Her Pierce has this mechanic where you can stack up Rend on one target and Q it for the kill, which then carries *all* the stacks onto the next enemy in Pierce's path. Her W passive has a cooldown and both attacks need to be within a certain time, *but does %max health damage*, quite a bit, it seems too (12% at lvl 1, not sure if it scales with ranks). Given her mobility and Q poke, I can't imagine it's hard to follow up on support harass. Her E does still stack indefinitely, and doesn't appear to disappear if you switch targets (as far as I can tell). At least the stacks disappear after a few seconds and extra stacks only deal 20% damage, so there is *sort of* a limit built into it, based on your attack speed, and each additional spear does reduced damage, her ult also doesn't appear to deal damage, and base damages (possibly ratios too, not sure, Q seems ~1.0AD, E seems ~0.7AD?) on her spells seem on the lower end, so I guess those are some things.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-11-05T13:57:01.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep, that passive scales with boots, and with some AS u can dash more often than yasuo...\nQ got 10/70/130/190/250+1.0 total-ad on 8 sec cd(and that pirecing mechanic)\nW does 12/14/16/18/20% maxhealth with a 8sec cd per target\nE has 20/35/50/65/80+ 0.6 total ad and 16/14/12/10/8sec cd, each aditional sprea increses damage by 20/25/30/35/40%, infinte stacking on multiple targets possible, works with hurricane, and every spear actually sticks in the target, having 20 spears in a dragon is awsome.\nCan't say much about the ult, only played a botgame so far","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-11-05T14:46:45.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update (my estimated ratios weren't too far off :P).
