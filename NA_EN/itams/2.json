The blood Moon legend if you go into more detail is about a fearsome creature tormenting a woman, chaasing it to the ends of the earth. In the end, the woman puts a mask on and faces the demon, but it runs as she stands her ground.\n\n\nA pretty decent way to instill fear in your target would be to dress up as an almost never ending attacking demon now wouldn't you?","replies":[{"poster":"iTams","date":"2014-11-08T05:33:11.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, it makes sense that she can play as a fearful demon to scare off demons, but naming it Blood Moon and giving her a Blood Moon mask (which the Rioter specifically stated it is) is plainly incorrect.\n\nMaybe if it is colored different and named something else, I would have no problem with this.
