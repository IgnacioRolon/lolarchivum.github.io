First 40, middle 42, and last 40.\nI tallied each champion in terms of:\nDash (can't cross walls, these are rare)\nLeap (free movement abilities)\nCharge (movement ability that requires a target)\nHastes (movement speed buffs)\nAs well as each type of CC (displacement, root, silence, slow, stun, charm/fear/taunt, polymorph, and suppression).\nHere are the totals.   Format is # / # / # (First/Middle/Last).  I've bolded the numbers that are significantly (50% or more) higher than the other 2, and used strikethrough on any numbers that are significantly lower than the other 2.\n\n\nDashes:  1 / 1 / 0\nLeaps: ~~5~~ / 9 / 11\nCharges: ~~4~~ / 8 / 10\nHastes: 18 / 18 / 20\n\nDisplacements: 12 / 12 / **32**\nRoots: ~~4~~ / 8 / 6\nSilences: **4** / 2 / ~~0~~\nSlows: 26 / 23 / 27\nStuns:  9 / 12 / 8\nBlinds: 1 / 0 / 1\nCharms/Fears/Taunts: 3 / 3 / 2\nPolymorphs: 0 / 0 / 1\nSuppressions: 1 / **2** / ~~0~~\n\nSo, looking at the periods relative to each other, the champions post-release of the game are FAR more mobile than the initial 40.  While movement speed buffs and slows remain fairly constant, the number of leaps and charges seen a huge increase (doubling in frequency).\n\nAlso of note is that the first 40 champions only \"excel\" at silencing champions, with 2/3 of the game's silences between them (it was 5/8 before Kassadin and LeBlanc lost their silences).\nIn every other category, the first 40 champions are equal-at-best in terms of mobility AND crowd control.\n\nFinally, the only CC category that has a truly major change in frequency is displacements.\nIn the first 82 champions, there was roughly 1 displacement ability for every 3.4 champions.\nIn the last 40 champions, there is 1 for every 1.25 champions.  That's a 170% increase in frequency of abilities that forcefully relocate another champion, or simply knock them up into the air.\nOr, expressed another way, if you played when the game came out, the average game (with randomly chosen champions) would have 3 abilities capable of displacing your champion or an enemy champion.  If you play the game with only the most recent 40 champions, the average game (same random champions) will have 8 of them.\n\nIf you combine suppressions, roots, silences, stuns, charms, fears, taunts, and polymorphs (\"hard cc\" without displacement):\nNon-displacing Hard CC: 21 / 27 / 17\nDisplacements: 12 / 12 / **32**\nSlows: 26 / 23 / 27\n\nEven merging Displacements into the Hard CC category, you end up with a noticeable spike in the frequency of heavy cc effects.\nHard CC: 33 / 39 / 49","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twilight Drizzle","date":"2014-11-26T05:05:44.692+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Add:\n\n {{champion:105}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:48}}","replies":[{"poster":"PenIceland","date":"2014-11-26T23:03:55.292+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}}  can ult off {{champion:34}} wall \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNCiAlrtKHA","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-11-26T09:20:57.269+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":59,"body":"Hey all,\n\nWanted to throw in some of our thoughts on displacements here for a bit of context, given they're definitely a CC type we're using more that has both some costs and some benefits to the game relative to other types of CC.\n\n\nFirst off, some details on why we've been using displacements more/what we feel the benefits of displacements are:\n\n* Displacements are clear. Having the unit(s) affected move makes it clear who a spell's hit and, provided the displacement arc or knockback distance is understandable, helps all players involved track the duration of the CC as well. \n* Displacements are visceral. A knockup can often feel better for the caster than a significantly longer duration stun, leading to better satisfaction from the same power budget.\n* Displacements, if there's a noticeable amount of knockback included, add some extra play to how a spell's used, giving players more ways to optimize and more options to play around. Not all hits are equal basically (e.g. a great knockback, versus an ok knockback versus a terrible knockback that helps the enemy), giving another point of mastery for players of the champion in question.\n \nOn the cost side:\n\n* Displacements over large distances can make it harder to track where champions, your own especially when moved suddenly against your will, are in a busy fight. Using relatively short range displacement helps avoid this being a significant cost however.\n* Displacements diminish the value of Tenacity and Cleanse. That means players have fewer responses against them. \n* With regards to Tenacity, item based counterplay tends to be relatively poor if the item's not one that changes your gameplay noticeably (e.g. Zhonya's via its active, Bloodthirster since sustain modifies how you look to trade/fight, Boots of Mobility significantly impact how you initiate, ward etc) since it's otherwise just a single decision, based off team comp and lane match up. Tenacity items don't have a particularly significant impact on playstyle however, so the loss of interesting gameplay there's pretty limited.Tenacity's also harder to access for many classes (deliberately), so often irrelevant, and the vast majority of the counterplay associated with CC is almost always to avoid the skill in question (whether by dodging, staying out of range, not being a tempting target etc). \n* Cleanses not removing displacements by contrast is a higher cost and one it's important to be aware of, particularly with regard to champions with burst who'll potentially kill a target within the duration of a single CC.\n\nSome other notes:\n\n* CC durations on new champs/major reworks nowadays are generally significantly shorter than those used on the original 40 champs. In terms of raw numbers new champions will tend to have more displacements than the original lineup, but those will tend to be of shorter durations (we're trending away from abilities like Morgana's Dark Binding, Rammus' Puncturing Taunt or Fiddlestick's Fear with extremely long CC durations via a single skill). \n* Displacements do interrupt dashes/leaps in progress which gives them extra power relative to most other CCs. Having counter mobility options like that in the game as a common tool's got significant value however and as above that power's offset against shorter CC durations.\n* Like many other effects displacements do lose some of their value as a tool when used too often and we have certainly gone through a solid run of champions with displacement on their kits. The next champ up after Rek'Sai will almost certainly not have a knockback or knockup and it's highly likely that the champ after that won't either. We'll definitely continue to use displacements where, as above, it's appropriate, they're not something that should be found on every new character however.","replies":[{"poster":"Omnipherious","date":"2014-11-26T11:05:45.131+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":5,"body":"You guys aren't the same Riot from 3 years ago.

It's not an either/or situation though, displacements can offer some additional clarity when combined with those other tools.

I certainly don't mean to come across as arguing 'displacements are the simple, easy solution to problems' - they're not. They've got upsides and downsides though and I feel it's valuable to discuss both of those, particularly given the costs tend to be more easily identified. \n\nOn the animation side stunned and knocked up animations are something we've talked about. We are a larger team and able to get more done, as with VO though animation's also substantially expanded the scope of its work with new champions (more attack variants, multiple run cycles, more detailed emotes, higher overall quality etc) so that extra capacity is getting used for stuff we believe does a lot for the overall feel of the character.

I am worried that league will escalate to a fighting-game-speed game filled with primarily dashes and displacements where the fastest reflexes/connection wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alexander","date":"2014-11-26T11:45:47.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey all,\n> \n> Wanted to throw in some of our thoughts on displacements here for a bit of context, given they're definitely a CC type we're using more that has both some costs and some benefits to the game relative to other types of CC.\n> \n> \n> First off, some details on why we've been using displacements more/what we feel the benefits of displacements are:\n> \n> * Displacements are clear. Having the unit(s) affected move makes it clear who a spell's hit and, provided the displacement arc or knockback distance is understandable, helps all players involved track the duration of the CC as well. \n> * Displacements are visceral. A knockup can often feel better for the caster than a significantly longer duration stun, leading to better satisfaction from the same power budget.\n> * Displacements, if there's a noticeable amount of knockback included, add some extra play to how a spell's used, giving players more ways to optimize and more options to play around. Not all hits are equal basically (e.g. a great knockback, versus an ok knockback versus a terrible knockback that helps the enemy), giving another point of mastery for players of the champion in question.\n>  \n> On the cost side:\n> \n> * Displacements over large distances can make it harder to track where champions, your own especially when moved suddenly against your will, are in a busy fight. Using relatively short range displacement helps avoid this being a significant cost however.\n> * Displacements diminish the value of Tenacity and Cleanse. That means players have fewer responses against them. \n> * With regards to Tenacity, item based counterplay tends to be relatively poor if the item's not one that changes your gameplay noticeably (e.g. Zhonya's via its active, Bloodthirster since sustain modifies how you look to trade/fight, Boots of Mobility significantly impact how you initiate, ward etc) since it's otherwise just a single decision, based off team comp and lane match up. Tenacity items don't have a particularly significant impact on playstyle however, so the loss of interesting gameplay there's pretty limited.Tenacity's also harder to access for many classes (deliberately), so often irrelevant, and the vast majority of the counterplay associated with CC is almost always to avoid the skill in question (whether by dodging, staying out of range, not being a tempting target etc). \n> * Cleanses not removing displacements by contrast is a higher cost and one it's important to be aware of, particularly with regard to champions with burst who'll potentially kill a target within the duration of a single CC.\n> \n> Some other notes:\n> \n> * CC durations on new champs/major reworks nowadays are generally significantly shorter than those used on the original 40 champs. In terms of raw numbers new champions will tend to have more displacements than the original lineup, but those will tend to be of shorter durations (we're trending away from abilities like Morgana's Dark Binding, Rammus' Puncturing Taunt or Fiddlestick's Fear with extremely long CC durations via a single skill). \n> * Displacements do interrupt dashes/leaps in progress which gives them extra power relative to most other CCs. Having counter mobility options like that in the game as a common tool's got significant value however and as above that power's offset against shorter CC durations.\n> * Like many other effects displacements do lose some of their value as a tool when used too often and we have certainly gone through a solid run of champions with displacement on their kits. The next champ up after Rek'Sai will almost certainly not have a knockback or knockup and it's highly likely that the champ after that won't either. We'll definitely continue to use displacements where, as above, it's appropriate, they're not something that should be found on every new character however.\n\nhow about then just make all knock ups cleansable and reduced by tenacity if you like them so much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-11-25T21:40:09.869+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally I agree the knock ups are getting excessive, but given the nature of this new champion, knock ups make perfect sense on the champion considering it is attacking from underground.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathia","date":"2014-11-25T23:53:26.324+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll just leave this right here...","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-11-26T16:19:31.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do people even play Yas anymore?

It's simply more visually interesting, as a player or a spectator. You can easily go 'why can't Garen move? Because he's in the air!' instead of 'Why can't Garen move? Well, he was hit by a stunning flash of light.'\n\n2) It allows Riot to more easily control how long someone is CC'd. If someone is knocked up for 1.25 seconds, they are guaranteed to be knocked up for 1.25 seconds. Stuns face tenacity, so that 1.25 stun can last as short as .2 seconds with the right set up. Honestly, I feel this is a problem with tenacity rather than a problem with stuns.\n\nI find the sheer amount of knockups boring, from both a variety perspective and a 'I hate Yasuo' perspective, but I can see why they use it. But honestly, I'd rather they figure out ways for alternative CC to work instead of just throwing a knock up on everybody.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-11-26T10:02:55.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot that knockups interrupt movement too, so you can make flashy plays with it too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZekromEX","date":"2014-11-25T21:22:57.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":26,"body":"but... those are only two champs gnar didn't have a knock up.","replies":[{"poster":"iTams","date":"2014-11-25T21:28:28.768+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar's ult is a knock up, knock backs are equivalent to knock up code-wise and gameplay-wise in this game.\n\nEvery champion up to Jinx has had a knock up in their kit, and jinx was released October 10th of LAST YEAR.\n\nYasuo, Vel Koz, Braum, Gnar, Azir, and Kalista all have knock ups.\n\nAnd if we want to count Sion's rework, he has 2 of them.","replies":[{"poster":"ZekromEX","date":"2014-11-25T21:33:02.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":46,"body":"Gnar's Ult isn't a knock up considering he throws you....
