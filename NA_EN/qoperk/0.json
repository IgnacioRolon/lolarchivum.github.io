Everything is fine until I'm in loading screen and then my whole wi-fi stops working. I know this sound stupid but i tried it several times and it happens every time. I tried reinstalling the game and turning off firewall but it doesnt help. When i tried playing on different computer everything is fine and game works perfectly so it's not wi-fi dependent. I was just wondering what may cause it and if there is a way to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T22:20:39.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since playing on a different pc on the same wifi lets you in, it sounds like the issue might be somewhere in your network settings.
