You can't prove it at all. Don't state it like it's a fact.\n\nSecond, that was a small reason for why you got banned. Even **if** you were right and they were cheating, you would still be deserving of this ban.\n\nLast, you don't get to decide what your punishment is. Riot tried the whole perm-chat ban thing. It didn't work as they hoped. And if you wanted to enjoy your account that you spent so much on...Well, probably should've thought about that after your 2-weeks.

Even if you don't feel like responding, that's fine. Just let it sit in your head and remember it when a pivotal point in time comes around.\n\n---\n\nIronically the word bigot means \"a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions\".\n\n---\n\nThe community has been told many times that cuss words don't influence your ban as long as they're not being used in a negative connotation, so using it as an adjective is okay.\n\nSo if we replace the word \"fucking\" because it's used as an adjective to express anger and not being used in a negative connotation\n\nLines in bold are unjustifiable comments.\n**\nth3sidekick: jesus you two are useless**\nth3sidekick: [gosh darn] smurfs man\nth3sidekick: you [intolerant person]\nth3sidekick: if he isnt [really a] smuf then he is scripting\n**th3sidekick: oriu shut the [heck] up;**\n\nCalling people useless, okay. Probably. That's one strike. In one game.\n\nTelling someone to shut up isn't really.. Worth throwing them in jail for. I mean come on, there's nicer ways to say it but it wouldn't make someone hate their life if you told them to shut up for being a jerk.\n**\nth3sidekick: ali STOP GOING IN ON 2V1 you shit fuck**\n\nOkay. Another single strike in a game.\n\n---\n\nThat all said I have no doubt that he's probably shown some phases where he goes overboard consistently. However, don't you think reform cards should show those instead of minor offenses? No one is going to kill themselves for being told to shut up. No one is going to get depressed over an obviously angry guy calling them a shitfuck. We **know **it's written out of anger.\n\n---\n\nWhy do we have to act like No Child Left Behind took control of the community? A majority of the people can agree that, yes, it's a good idea because it serves to better the community, but the people being punished are identifying the problems that the system has when they're experiencing it.\n\nPeople are thrown in jail for \"substance abuse\". Almost all the people who have done so cried out, \"Hey this isn't fair!\" but until very very very very very, recently, no one listened to them. They said, \"You're a criminal, why should I listen to you.\" Then all the sudden, someone who **skirted the system** in a high place of power, said something and now everyone thinks it's a good idea.\n\nThe people who are getting punished are obviously disgruntled because of something. In this case, he's disgruntled because he feels unjustified that he has to play with people who have no business being there. If you're playing Little Leagues and an obviously older person who's on a High School team subs in for a person on either team, hey I'd say something. Wouldn't you?\n\nBut instead of looking at the issue,** you're looking at the effect of the issue, and if the effect of this issue isn't in agreement with your terms you punish them**. You're conveniently eliminating them from the community for any reason to save face.\n\n---\n\nDo you really want to punish these people? Do you really want to jail people because they're already in distress? Sports serve as an outlet for frustration, as well as many other things. Letting someone get something out of their system isn't a bad thing. It helps people let go. Studies have shown that parents that have told their children to \"Suck it up\" and \"You'll get over it\" end up being more prone to depression or low self esteem in life. Do you really want these people to bottle up their emotions? To \"suck it up\"? I'd hope your answer would be no.\n\n---\n\nOkay so we've got all the problems down. Now what about solutions?\n\nThe silliest one I can think of is **mandatory enforcement of the chat filter.** Okay okay, I know, unpopular opinion. Hear me out. Is someone really going to type something in chat when they know it's going to get filtered? \"____bag of ____.\" I'm already laughing my butt off. It turned something that sensitive individuals would take offense to, and lets their mind wander. If they're not already thinking about negative things, \"____ bag of ____\" could turn into something rather hilarious; \"Dirty bag of Doritos\" for instance.\n\nThe people who are looking for a fight, or already in a bad mood have a chance to be like, hey you know what, I'm not going to get mad at this. Obviously this won't catch all cases, but it'll serve as an inconvenience to say bad things. \n\nBut if people feel inconvenienced about talking, how is this any different than bottling up? It shifts their anger. Instead of being angry at their teammate, they're now directed at \"the ____ chat filter\". Redirection is a very good method for relieving stress.\n\n---\n\nThe game itself has evolved into a very competitive environment. Now we have numbers labeling everything we do. We've got borders and divisions, and all this stuff that we compete over. Don't let these be tools to be used against us. Take away the weapons. Provide barriers. Eventually they'll just decide, you know what, it's not worth it.\n\nWell I've lost track of what I've been writing. Got distracted by something and I'm immediately no longer interested in what many people would call this to be a \"toxic, negative\" behavior because of the things I have written. The method is already working for me. I'll call it a day for now.

This is another point.\n\nHave u actually considered that person u said it to is actually homosexual, and that he suffered bullying, abuse and even physical attacks and was called that word many times in his life? Or some other person in that game? U know how much it could hurt someone to see someone using that word in game where he came to have fun and relax?","replies":[{"poster":"th3sidekick","date":"2016-03-28T23:34:45.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"he didnt come to have fun and relax, he was int feeding at 0/7 at 5 min..","replies":[{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2016-03-28T23:42:42.907+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=th3sidekick,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EafH9Ipx,comment-id=0000000000000000000000020000,timestamp=2016-03-28T23:34:45.898+0000)\n>\n> he didnt come to have fun and relax, he was int feeding at 0/7 at 5 min..\n\nBeing 0/7 in 5 mins doesnt mean he was intentionally feeding. I asume u talk about Morgana, if u look all her deaths were on your side of map, behind or directly on your turrets. That person isnt even ranked, he is new lvl 30, probably inexperienced player. He leveled playing Howling Abyss.  He only ever played 4 ranked games, Its just a new , bad player, who will probably be placed with other unskilled players in Silver/Bronze. I dont see anywhere in your chat that u tried to give him advice or help him somehow. Also u threatened to report Draven for \"smurfing\" lol. I am sorry, but i was in silver when i got lvl 30 and i know that players like u almost made me quit. Players who just insult, flame are constantly negative. Who call better players smurfs or cheaters. Your punishment is completely deserved and i am glad Riot is working on getting rid of toxic creatures that are giving hell to new players in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"dapositiveviking","date":"2016-03-29T01:24:07.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice shut down!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-03-28T23:42:53.208+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"His behavior does not excuse your behavior.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"th3sidekick","date":"2016-03-28T23:22:36.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"thats the whole point. i got a 14 day restriction and played like 30 games then i played these two and got permabanned.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-03-28T23:25:31.482+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's how the system works.
