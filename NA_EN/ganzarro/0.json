Basically, I end up staring at my mac and my turn never comes.\r\n\r\nAlready fixed through the help fix button, uninstalled and reinstalled, don't know what to do anymore.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-27T16:30:13.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is losing connection to our servers during champion select, and freezing because it's not receiving information.
