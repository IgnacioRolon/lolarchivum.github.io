As a first step, make sure that your drivers as well as your Windows are up to date.  A reinstall won't necessarily fix this if your PC can't load the game.  Go through each step in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide for instructions on that, as well as additional instructions towards resolving this.
