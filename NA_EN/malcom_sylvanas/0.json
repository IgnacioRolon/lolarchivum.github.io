I was pretty excited, but also pretty skeptical. The last time I applied for PBE was quite some time ago and this seemed somewhat out of the blue. I had tried accessing the PBE to create an account many times since that day, but the website linked had tons of errors, and so I remained really cautious.\n\nIncluded in the images is a link to \"pbesignup (dot) na (dot) leagueoflegends (dot) com/en/pbe-signup\" which appears to be either an Obsolete, or Broken web-page. Firefox even flags the connection to the webpage as not secure. Multiple instances of the image and text for 'Thank you for your application' repeat a few times, along with some boxes for entering information to create an account and one actual application area.\n\nThis is the same page you get sent to if you click your name in the top right and drop down to PBE, then click the \"I want to help\" button.\n\nI have tried accessing this page with both Firefox and Google Chrome and they both display the same errors. My guess is that since both pages still display (c) 2014 instead of the (c) 2017 that the forum are, and the fact that firefox views those pages as not secure... is that someone is trying to use the pages to Phish account information.\n\nIts either that, or your web-page's script is broken something fierce. Ad-blockers and stuff are off and its broke. I'd really like to hop in the PBE this cycle but I feel as if I've either been unsuccessfully duped or the ship has sailed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T02:36:43.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been having some issues with the PBE signup page recently, but as of this moment the signup page is down for maintenance.
