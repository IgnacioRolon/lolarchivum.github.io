Let alone one of our provisionals. We don't have very much time to play and we have been fighting hard for these wins and points and would really like to keep the ones we earn.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-09-09T18:18:40.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bard,\n\nI looked into this and it seems that you guys had a queue dodge right after your Promotional series started. Similar to solo queue, 3v3 and 5v5 matches instantly counted as a loss during Promos when a player on your side dodges from champ select. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bard","date":"2014-09-09T23:28:03.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I see, yeah I remember that. Friend didn't realize it was his turn to pick a champ and when the timer ran out it booted us.\n\nThank you for the reply. ^^   We are just happy to know the reason so thank you and we will be more careful about that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2014-09-09T15:45:23.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there \n\nSounds like it's probably just a visual bug. If you want to be sure of your stats before you continue playing, [open a support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and ask a Rioter to look into it for you. :)","replies":[]}]}
