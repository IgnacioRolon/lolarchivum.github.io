If a player doesn't like a random skin that he/she unlocked in hextech crafting, they can refund it for half its value in blue essence or possibly trade it for a skin that is of equal value to it. Maybe even trade skins with our friends, just as long as the skins in question are of equal value.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-09-05T22:53:03.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, as much use as I would personally get out of this, I still think it's not a good idea to have skin trading.\n\nTrading skins means gambling for skins is far more efficient for the players (you spend less for random skins and trade for what you were aiming for). Good for us, but it cuts directly into Riot's revenue, which would result in them taking away gambling systems or making them more expensive/less efficient to even out the costs so they aren't hemorrhaging money through it.\n\nIt would also turn the Boards into a trading market, flooded with people looking for specific skins or advertising what they've got. Moderation for us would be impossible to keep up with, and it would directly result in you guys having to sift through hundreds of off-topic threads just to see what actually belongs on that board.\n\nFinally, it would open up a new level of scamming, meaning if your account was compromised you'd have more to potentially lose, and ignorant players could be tricked into trading off their rare/expensive skins for common/cheap ones. Even if you didn't fall for it, I don't want to be spammed in the client with friend requests from people whether it's a scambot or just a stranger looking to get something from me.","replies":[{"poster":"hwff","date":"2017-09-06T06:11:37.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can add some restrictions like people can only trade 3 times per year and can only trade with the accounts that have been friends for over a year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fdshadfdcfx","date":"2017-09-06T03:00:08.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly agree, allowing for \"skin exchange program\" just opens the floodgate to a whole array of other problems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-09-06T03:08:59.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would have to be a very high cost, like 6 to 9 skin shards to give a friend one.
