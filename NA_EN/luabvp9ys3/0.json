I log on to see none of them there. I have only been gone two years. I bought at least half of the champions and a good chunk of skins to go with it (as of 2013) . At least 300-600$ of items from Riot games. Now I log into my old account and it's all gone?! No email of me being ban or any kind of email to let me know I was refunded them. What is going on. I am considering to call my Lawyer as this is clearly stealing from me. I bought those champions and skins fairly and with my own cash. I did not receive a refund in of any kind. Can another User let me know what is going on? How do I get them back? This is really causing me to even reconsider playing again.","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2016-02-12T21:39:55.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of your content is missing, you're just logging into the wrong account.
