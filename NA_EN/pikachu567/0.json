She's got decent AP ratios and cooldowns and overall high damage output and burst. She can do a decent job supporting. She's one of the few support champs that can counter tons of mid laners and not suffer at all. In the current meta she's completely solid. I'd choose her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gallowgrim","date":"2015-01-22T16:42:08.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ori can do both.
