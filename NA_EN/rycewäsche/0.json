If troubleshooting your firewalls didn't help your connection there are a few other steps they can guide you through like adjusted your DNS servers to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4. Give that a shot as well using the step in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if you aren't sure how, but please also open that ticket back up to followup with the techs for more in-depth help!","replies":[]}]}
