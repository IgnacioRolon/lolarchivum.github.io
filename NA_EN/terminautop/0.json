Also the number is random. Very annoying because I am so happy I got the new champ, then it says I cant buy it even though it displays the correct amount of IP. This works inversely as well because the bug seems to show I have less IP than I actually have so I can sometimes purchase things when it seems that I can't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T22:49:14.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Lew* is correct, this is a fairly uncommon bug that happens specifically on the Beta Client.
