For some reason I get 60 ping compared to my 48 on the NA servers. I found an ip address for the LAN servers here(104.160.136.3): https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4efy17/how_to_check_your_ping_without_getting_into_the/\r\n\r\nWhen I ping that IP address I get about 30ms. I looked up the location of this IP and it seems to be the same as the location for the NA servers(which can't be right because the ping is different).\r\n\r\nI'd just like to know where the LAN servers are. If they are still in Miami, is the IP address I have correct and if so, why is my in-game ping so much higher than when I ping the address?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T04:46:46.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LAN Servers are still in Miami ASAIK!

It says my request timed out, which I'm pretty sure means that my packets were sent, but the server never responded.\n\nI'm assuming that this server won't reply due to DDoS/DoS protection. Is there an ip address I can actually ping? The IP address 104.160.131.1 actually responds and gives accurate representation of my ingame ping for the NA servers, so there should be a similar IP address for the LAN servers, right?\n\nI did check the status page for both the servers when I pinged/actually played on them.\n\nI really should be getting lower ping on the LAN servers because I am so much closer geographically(assuming that the NA servers are in Chicago).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T21:56:23.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you aren't getting any reply from that server it's a pretty good sign that you've got some packet loss along the way.
