An automated response wanted me to gather logs with the hextech repair tool. The next game I played after running that crashed(after taking forever to do anything after champ select). It told me that it had to repair files, which ended up being almost 5 GB(possibly MB, I can't remember if it was measured in KB or MB when I saw the number) of files. Then it had to scan stuff. Before it finished doing whatever it was, I got leaver.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if I could be compensated for the 17 LP I lost. :v","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T17:39:41.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The logs it obtains shouldn't impact your game files, though I'm sorry that happened to you.  You might have some pretty corrupt files, but it seems like something is blocking you from repairing.  To start, try out the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure your OS settings is allowing your game files to be read and used.  In the meantime, stick to custom games and use it as a testing ground to prevent anymore LP loss.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaFluffyPotato","date":"2017-07-19T02:29:52.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It now seems to be endlessly attempting to repair after it forced me to restart league.","replies":[{"poster":"DaFluffyPotato","date":"2017-07-19T02:37:48.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like it finally stopped after like an hour.","replies":[]}]}]}
