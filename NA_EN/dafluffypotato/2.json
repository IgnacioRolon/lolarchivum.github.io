This has happened three times now. Is there anything I can do about it?\r\n\r\nSometimes the reason I connect slow is because of the glitch where league says I don't have internet when I do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T01:25:22.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely don't want it taking you that long to get into matches, especially if you're getting leaver penalties for it. It sounds like your network might just be having a hard time getting a reliable connection with our servers since you mentioned League is saying you were disconnected. Your best bet would be to go over the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just to make sure we cover all the typical fixes.","replies":[{"poster":"DaFluffyPotato","date":"2017-05-05T14:23:42.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of the problem is that when I close game(when it's crashed) I have to wait for a minute or so before the client loads and I can hit reconnect.\nI'm not sure why, I've talked to some other people about it and I'm the only one who has to wait a minute or more before the client loads after the game. I'm running League on a laptop hooked up to a 1080p monitor, so I made sure the client closes while I run the game for better performance. The people I asked have the client closed during games too.\n\nI have a batch file that pings the NA servers so that I can make sure my ping will be okay before I play ranked games(because if I play at the wrong time, I could get stuck with a steady 300-400ms). I've never had any problems trying to ping the servers(other than high ping times). So I thought it had something to do with the client not being able to connect for some reason.\n\nI do not have a firewall trying to block LoL. I also always check http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na if I'm having problems with connecting(there has only been a problem once). I'm currently unable to get a wired connection. I usually get 40-50 ping if I'm not playing in the evening or a weekend anyway, so I don't think that's the problem.\n\nIs there any way you could tell me what exactly is being done during the black screen before the loading background, once the loading background pops up, but before it shows icons, and while I'm at 0%(if the game has started and I'm connecting alone)? It can take a long time for the latter two to complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T20:37:02.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your client takes such a long time loading after the game ends or crashes, your best bet would be to turn off that close client during game option. Even though your other friends still have it enabled and it loads quicker for them, your pc might just be having a harder time getting the client loaded back up. \n\nIf you can ping the servers and have a good connection there, you should have a smooth time while actually playing. If you see that black screen before the full loading screen shows up, it means the game is still trying to grab the information it needs to show. If it sits on that black screen for awhile, it can be a pretty good sign that your network is having a hard time talking with our servers, so you were on the right track with your guesses! Give the steps in that [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) a try, and let me know if it's still loading hella slow and we can dig a little deeper with you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
