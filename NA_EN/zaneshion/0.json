I've been a Numpad player on PC for 20 years now, and I prefer it.\r\n\r\nYou can even bind a key to KP_Enter but it will do the function (like Ping or your Ult, etc.) and open up the Chat/Console on the same press.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how to do this? Using the console settings from old threads doesn't seem to work, and the overwrite from Server side to the .json files ruins it at anyrate, and Read Only doesn't fix it.\r\n\r\nAnyone understand what I am describing and a way to work around it?\r\n\r\nBig thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"KaTm Hipe","date":"2017-08-16T20:41:28.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same problem and would love for atleast the numpad enter to be able to change in game but since the same problem happens (rebinding it works but always opens the chat) can't work with that. My solution is perhaps not optimal but it did the job. i wanted the numpad enter to center the camera on champion (this is in the camera menu) and for that i did the following.\nInstalled sharped keys https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys , mapped the numpad enter to other key, (used space because why not ) , ingame, changed the camera do the NumEnter option and voila, works as intended, chat does not open and it does indeed center camera.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/95ac1b6bfa156e0c7f949164eb7e7119\nhttps://gyazo.com/5c74ec0edfc939e8e1e358ec1c36d313\n\nBefore using sharpkeys, just read the do's and don't before... you really don't want to remap them badly, use as little as possible...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-21T22:48:31.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We reached out to our Tech team personally and they said this isn't something that is possible, or if that it was possible it would be more hassle and could cause more issues than it's worth.
