Even on the pbe its flawed because the pbe isnt nearly as good as the live servers in terms of team play. Most ppl just play pbe to try something out-skins, buffs, nerfs etc. They dont play for the team they play for their own experiment.\n\nThat being said, I have found the most unique part of the pbe right now to be the mastery system. Nothing is standard anymore.. at least not yet. \n\nThey've added and changed a lot of items that affect more than just ADCs. I think the biggest change is the amount of CDR in AD items now. Its actually insane if you look at them all. And the cheap armor pen cdr item Brutilizer is gone, and now armor pen is on  maw with a passive similar to guinsoo's rageblade. Their is soooo much shit that has changed, ADCs are probably effected the least if you ask me... i mean Tiamat doesnt even cleave anymore.. \n\nTL;DR everyone is being fucked with not just ADCs.

Sure, the combo is now incredible for Corki since they made Corki's passive crit again, but they didn't add any crit interaction to Ez, so now he's building a stat that he used to never touch, like...

Essence by itself was good, then a BT and you'd sustain poke since your Q's were already doing most of your damage. Toss in some CDR boots and with an Essence, 5% flat CDR and 5% scaling plus the 5% from Masteries, you had maxed CDR with just your Essence Reave and CDR boots and your Q's returned their mana. Now you can get the CDR with just the Essence and Trinity without CDR anywhere else, but you don't return mana on your Q and your Q does about 30 less base damage and that only gets worse as you go into your build and it's being exchanged for Crit.\n\nIt all just feels horribly awkward. Before, you poked targets down and kept your distance with your Q and E plus high CDR, AA'ing CC'd targets and staying as safe as possible. Now you can't really play that sort of safe. Your poke is about the same if you throw it every 2ish seconds with the Deathfire keystone, but in an actual AA fight? You have no crit interaction in your entire kit. Draven scales off of high AD and crit chance. Every other ADC has some kind of large interaction between their kits and crit or being a raw damage AA'er in general. Ez has never been that type of ADC. He used to out duel ADC's when his W slowed AS, then he did it by kiting them and staying out of range with his Q, which he did to really every target to be honest, and now he's having his power shifted out of his Q and into his AA's, meaning he's losing safety and having to do what other ADC's do. Normally, I'd be fine with that. Safety loss for damage, but there is no damage boost. Crit isn't going to make his Q hit any harder and he's got nothing in his kit other than a 50% AS steroid (Which every ADC pretty much has, plus other ADC's get to go with a PHantom Dancer to let them take less damage). \n\nEz is getting the short end of the stick and he feels so wrong because of it. Having to get crit on a champion who has never rushed crit, ever, is so wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-10-31T14:27:57.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strong on everyone ATM, 30% CDR off a single item is crazy and it gives crit to synergize with standard ADC builds.
