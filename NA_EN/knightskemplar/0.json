Our party consisted of:\r\n\r\n- Me: regular player and quasi-addict to League\r\n- Friend who got me into League: doesn&#039;t play League much anymore, but follows LCS and knows the game decently well\r\n- My wife: doesn&#039;t play, but has cursory knowledge of the game because I play it a lot around her\r\n- My coworker: good friend of mine who enjoys games casually, has never played League and is almost entirely unfamiliar with it\r\n\r\nIt was really telling to me that all four of us liked it so much. Even the girl who has never played League at all was fascinated with the characters and enjoyed the mechanics of the game a lot. She is the one who has pushed the most to play again, actually, though all of us want to. We made it through 4 missions the first night and we are eager to keep going. I did not realize, until after I had opened the box and started reading, that it was a &quot;story-driven&quot; kind of experience. That&#039;s new for me, and I like it.\r\n\r\nSo, first of all, kudos to the designers. There isn&#039;t a lot of activity on this board, but if any Rioters read this, thanks for the game! It is great!\r\n\r\nOne question if are here, though, Riot game design team: did you intend for this to play similar to the &quot;Legacy&quot; board games that are out there right now? They seem to be having a surge of popularity, although I have never invested in one. This experience seems like it is, at the very least, stealing some ideas from the &quot;Legacy&quot; board game idea. How much did your team talk about that while you were designing the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2017-01-18T21:06:54.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think we intended for it to play like a Legacy game, but rather we wanted to include some semi-legacy elements that would help to drive the story and overall campaign. There are unlockables in MvM, but after you've unlocked them you're basically free to use them in subsequent playthroughs if you so choose to. Glad your family and friends are enjoying it!","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-01-18T23:00:47.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really a blast! One of the best things about Riot is seeing all the different things that you're able to do besides the core game. It's becoming a really expansive universe, and I appreciate it a lot. \n\nI'm looking forward to whatever comes next! It doesn't sound like the \"board games division\" is going to be a consistent thing.... But correct me if I'm wrong, cause that would be awesome.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LuckerNoob","date":"2017-01-19T10:56:58.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having played Pandemic and Risk Legacy: MvM is nothing like a Legacy game.

If MvM was a Legacy game, you'd have things like \"If all slots on a mech are filled with damage, physically destroy the mech and any cards and items specifically referring to it.\" Basically, every mistake you have in a Legacy game has permanent consequences. On the other hand, so does every good thing you do. It can be very intense.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
