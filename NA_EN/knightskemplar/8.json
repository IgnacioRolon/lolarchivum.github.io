This item is basically the only option for most mage mids to rush right now, and the reason is incredibly simple; it gives them everything. Mana, mana regen, damage, and CDR. It&#039;s over half of the offensive stats that mages want.\n\nSo Riot, being pretty smart with design, goes &quot;you know what? That actually doesn&#039;t break the game too badly, so we&#039;re just gonna make a bunch of items with Damage, CDR, and Mana and see what happens. You can&#039;t have your mana regen anymore, that&#039;s nuts, but we&#039;ll just give you insanely large mana pools to compensate you for that, no worries.&quot;\n\nThat&#039;s really nice. I&#039;m not sure why mage mains aren&#039;t rejoicing and openly weeping on the Boards now; we&#039;re *finally* seeing some parity in offensive items between Mages and ADCS.

I mean, I guess I could go {{item:3089}} instead, but the extra mana on {{item:3003}} or {{item:3285}} is highly appealing, especially if I'm gonna have all this extra CDR to permaspam my spells. \n\nBut still. I feel like all this CDR will just make people rage at the \"broken\" enchanter supports even more ({{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}} ) when they inevitably build these items and can spam their heals and shields.

You have options with all of those; the one you want might not be optimal, but it might end up fitting your playstyle and being plenty strong. In an ideal world, that's how that *should* work, right? So they're taking steps in that direction, and I love that.\n\nGood analysis though. I will worry with you a bit about enchanter supports. I think it'll be mitigated by the wider availability of GW for two of those, but Janna is one to keep an eye on.

Sure, there's many good things I see coming, and I *like* that, but dangers also loom on the horizon. Liandries is a meme that will be easily fixed√, what I'm *concerned* about is Seraphs.\n\nSeraphs is the new Morellos, and replaces it as the \"cookie cutter first item\". Offers 89√ AP + 20% CDR on buy, and trades the grievous passive for the ability to immensely scale later on (+50~ AP and a shield), as well as significantly higher mana pools. Basically trades 18 AP + 100 gp for 400 Mana + 20% CDR, which is a significant buff over it's current iteration, ignoring the better buildpath.\n\nNow, this is a problem because we have an entire class of champions (Mana Guzzlers), who are balanced around Seraphs being incredibly hard to get rolling. It's a direct buff to the champions that build it currently (Cassopeia, Ryze), as well as those who really ***really*** want it, but couldn't afford the early game power hit (Hi, Kassadin√√).\n\nAlso, it kind of invalidates Ludens as the \"Poke Mana Item\", it scales fast enough that the window where Ludens is better is incredibly short√√√, and generally poke champions want \"assloads of mana\" way more than \"a dinky on-hit proc\" (25% mana refunds *alone* is huge).\n\nOverall, I feel like Riot's got a big beast to wrangle in terms of making Seraphs not have a hardcore power dip in the early game, but also not suffocate out the other options. I trust them to eventually get this right, but I *do* expect some turbulence.\n\n√Already addressed on PBE, apparently.\n√√89 AP based on 650 Mana from item, 650 Mana from champ, = 1300, which is 39 AP from the passive.\n√√√Though the PBE buff to Ludens helps to alleviate this, it doesn't solve the root issue that *seraphs is a better poke item*.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-02-08T01:28:27.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you bring up a good point with seraph's, but it will still take time to amp up.

You're right that the balancing act between Luden's and Seraphs may prove to be difficult, and that'll be something to watch. \n\nPersonally, I don't think the intended use of Luden's *is* to be a poke item, though it has certainly ended up that way.

Said scaling might need to get ramped back, maybe something like lower the AP gained from Mana from 3% to 2.5%?\n\nLudens, at least it's previous iterations, was intended to be an item for poke mages.

More spells = more damage, so several of these items have significant buffs just because of that. I mean, I think the GLP and Archangels look *much* better now, but we'll see how it is in practice, I guess.\n\nDCap is the biggest concern. I really do hope they look at the build path for it, because that could be a great help in late game builds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2018-02-07T21:39:06.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's the right decision, but why's there 500 mana on one item when you can have like 250 or 300 on multiple items that would be in core builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2018-02-07T22:33:29.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resourceless AP users also need items, you know.

However I hate the removal of AP from the game once again. Having cdr options is surely nice but all I wanted was another 100 AP item instead there's one less then before. Also finally they split liandry from flat pen.. But I don't get why do I have to pay for hp to get flat pen, and why gw is on the same item. I want damage not hp!! Rilay is now one of the highest AP item in the game (ok only by 5 but still) which I find absurd.  Only way to keep up with AP is running trascendence and overcapping cdr on purpose. I hope they change their mind and give more access to rabadon via better build path. I just want to burst again not get less punished for missing my spell at the cost of lower  burst.\n\nAnyway I 'd say the concept track is the right one *though they left out tanky mages who buy roa but don't want tear).\nAnd can't wait to try the new item with stacks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-02-08T07:10:09.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"AP changes are a net nerf.
