I want to concisely explain why.\n\n1) If the winning team can&#039;t close the game with the tools they **already have from being ahead,** why do they deserve to win?\n\n2) More importantly, one of the biggest defining parts of MOBAs, including LoL, is wave mechanics. Now, waves won&#039;t behave in a predictable manner, because there will be power differences between the minions.\n\nIt&#039;s the second point that has me much more concerned. I think this is super questionable. \n- Shoving a lane when behind? Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;ll come right back.\n- Leave a lane even and go do another objective? Oops, looks like the enemy team has one more tower. It&#039;s pushing to us now!\n- You and one enemy are split pushing different side waves, while the 4v4 in mid dances back and forth? Well, if you&#039;re losing, you automatically lose that trade. Too bad!\n\nI just don&#039;t think it&#039;s a healthy way for a team to push an advantage. Dragon changes implemented were so early game champs have a way to &#039;scale&#039; to late game. The winning team should have more items. The winning team should have more vision. Having better minions is the **_wrong way to give a winning team power._**\n\nSo, anyway, I voiced my opinion. We&#039;ll see how it shakes out. There&#039;s a poll. You should take it.\n\nEDIT: I realized an even bigger problem I have with the change. Clarity. Since you can't predict what the wave will do, it significantly hurts clarity. Big issue for me. \n\nPut a different way/good test of concept: Imagine explaining this to a new player. It's gonna confuse them. The whole premise of the game is that the minions are evenly matched without champion influence.

The idea is that you are unduely punishing good play by giving an advantage to the person in last that they dont need to work towards, much like the blue turtle shell in Mario Kart that rewards you for being in last place by taking out the person in first. Even for a wacky party racer its frustrating and unfun, forget about LoL.\n\nLeague already has a lot of comeback mechanics in fact, primarily in terms of shutdown gold, which rewards a team playing from behind by helping them close out the gap **if** they can earn it. This is not nearly as bad as \"the blue shell effect\" because it can only be obtained through excellent play and doesn't actually give an advantage to the loser, but many people still feel it causes low end games to become and endless seasaw that doesn't really reward the better team. It is similar to playing Monopoly with the free parking houserule, you infuse a lot of resources into a system that will statistically reward the worst players the most to try to keep them in the game and it just results in drawn out games that at best have a known outcome that will take an extra 10 minutes and at worst adding a random delay to the game that may reward an unskilled team enough for them to recover through sheer luck and attrition.\n\nGood game design both rewards the better team while also allowing interesting play states where the game's outcome is still in question. I don't think that the minion buff is a remotely good way to do it because it is a lot of invisible power that can work to the detrement of the winning team and makes minions a really unpredictable force, but LoL really needs more \"win more\" mechanics, a power boost only avalable to teams preforming well to help them close out games. \n\nThat said I think the new changes to tower durability will do much more to help dominant teams close out games than the minion changes. Losing two towers in a row early game will be absolutely devistating and will make a clear loser in lane an outright match throw in most cases, and teams should be encouraged to play around that rather than having minions invisibly start self pushing.\n\nThat said as a lot of people noted this will definitely have a lot of interesting effects in regards to stall outs by actively punishing winning teams who safe farm, which is frankly a problem. It may just work out.","replies":[{"poster":"Amuq the Native","date":"2015-11-11T15:01:25.071+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> but LoL really needs more \"win more\" mechanics, a power boost only avalable to teams preforming well to help them close out games. \n\n That's exactly what Baron is.

This game is becoming more and more like team deathmatch and I'm about done with it if this is the direction they continue to move in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leonerdo","date":"2015-11-11T03:33:44.463+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also pretty concerned about it, but as I was looking for answers I found a Red comment on reddit that made a lot of sense. It's in response to a questions about the increased gold flow and the \"item efficiency\" changes, but it's also relevant to the minion changes: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3sb7k9/patch_522_notes/cwvpl5n\n\nEssentially, if your team is winning enough for the minions to make a difference, then chances are you are gonna win just by sitting back, farming, and waiting for the next dragon/baron. With these changes, you are encouraged to push to round out the game, or else you give the opponent a chance to farm and come back.\n\nAlthough another comment brought up a legitimate warning that stall comps with Ziggs and such may become a lot stronger with these changes. We really just have to wait and see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-11-11T07:46:43.452+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Fixing what isn't broken.

They want to drive it down mid and force objectives. The stronger minions will add additional pressure to these sieges in the form of a splitpush and force the behind team to respond in a decisive manner to protect their base (or otherwise lose).\n\nIf however, the ahead team decides to stall out the game, focusing on farming rather than trying to force a game-ending teamfight at baron or at an inhibitor tower, then it gives the behind team safe freefarm which will even out the game (and possibly result in a turnaround from what should have been a decisive victory from the start).","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-11-11T05:12:56.306+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you are right.

The tactic was to set up your lanes to push, and go distract the enemy with a mid push or objective while 2 towers went down on the other side.\n\nI agree with your fears - when you're behind, being able to set up your wave to push while you try to win a team fight is a come back strategy.  If you win that fight you already have a wave pushing you can teleport to (or run to) and take a tower for it.  Get back in the game.\n\nWith this change I feel that being behind is going to be as bad as having inhibitors down just from losing a tower...  You're going to have to win 2-3 fights to come back because you have to start your push over every time.  More than that the pressure is off the attacking team to make any plays.  If they just stall out the lanes will push and they'll win.
