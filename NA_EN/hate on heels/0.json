The problem is though, this is my main account that had this name ever since the change in early season two. Problem is though, I don't have any proof since I lost all my screenshots from a dead hardrive. What I'm trying to say is, is there a way that I can prove I've had this name for a looong time and not being some type of sheep?","replies":[{"poster":"ZED G0D","date":"2017-01-24T01:20:14.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Snowflake","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curious Kat","date":"2017-01-24T01:06:39.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, does it really matter though? Even if you COULD prove your name is older, would you really link that to the person after a match just to prove it? IF someone calls you a WW 1 trick pony, or something like that because of ur name, and they don't believe your story, then that's their problem xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-24T00:32:20.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give it a month, nobody will care. Even if you could prove that you have had your account that long I have never heard of a way to tell when your last name change was so that would not prove it either. In a week to a month nobody will care.","replies":[]}]}
