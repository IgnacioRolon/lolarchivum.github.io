He's a lot like pre-rework Yorick (and Kalista/Azir right now) in that he needs to be gutted number-wise in order not to be completely overbearing because of his kit. Just like the only real counter to old Yorick was Heimer, the only real counter to Urgot is Yasuo. As it is right now the only thing Urgot has to do to completely deny cs to the lane opponent is to land E (which isn't hard because it has a big radius) and then spam Q. There's no real counterplay to that. The fact that he's actually still viable at all despite the ridiculous numbers is the biggest proof he's at kit-level broken.\n\nI do love Urgot and I think the idea behind him (a tanky marksman) is super awesome, but I gotta admit the game is better off with him (in his current form) gutted. So I can't wait for the rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tacofacefart","date":"2016-10-31T05:42:19.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just want him to have a real identity","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-31T17:21:54.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully he'll get started on after Warwick.

Have you? \n\nThey have 2 teams working independently on each champion at any given time. The team that finished working on Shen at January 28th finished Ryze on July 13th. The team working on Taric released him on April 19th and finished Yorick on September 8th. That's a solid 6 months average on each rework. At this rate, Warwick will finish on January/February, meaning we should expect Urgot (assuming he's next in queue, which we don't really know) around July/August.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tacofacefart","date":"2016-10-31T05:43:09.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"man, i hope the rework is awesome whenever it does happen.","replies":[]}]}]}
