I find it very petty of you to ban me for 25 games for defending myself.\r\n\r\nMy father died in April 2019 and my mother passed away last Saturday June 15th.  Someone makes comments about my parents, as toxic players due. \r\n\r\nI tell them I am reporting them, and I don't appreciate their behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\nI get banned for  it... nice.\r\n\r\nHave you ever lost your parents in a span of a 2 month period? You seriously think its ok for people to joke about it... and then ban the person who is grieving over the loss of their parents?\r\n\r\nAwesome job...  you should probably educate your support staff... \r\n\r\nUntil you lose both your parents in a 2 month time-frame.... you have no idea what I am going through.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2019-06-25T20:44:46.345+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through my own dark times yet not once did I ever feel the need to flame anyone else or get myself banned or punished. Just because someone says something to you, doesn't mean you have to respond. you have no obligation to \"defend\" yourself to people that you're 99% of the time never going to interact with again. I understand that it's tough dealing with that, but again, the onus is on YOU to control yourself. Nobody else is responsible for your behavior and using the death of your parents as an excuse is kind of outright offensive and I don't think that would be something they would be appreciative of (not speaking for them of course).","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-25T20:39:33.576+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really, GimmiMoar, flaming your teammates so bad that you get punished for the second time?\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, but strangers on the internet don't know you.

(sigh) League's community is so bad this has to be the most toxic in the history of games. Mostly made of keyboard warriors. What works best for me is turning off cross team chat when they spew verbal diarrhea. Also, don't expect riot to do anything \"good\" for the players. They haven't done anything remotely great since season 5 and that was simply leaving the game balanced enough.\n\nThe OP is getting downvoted because they're using their parents death as an excuse for their poor behavior and have also not provided their Reform Card to back up their claim of being punished simply for saying they were reporting someone &amp; didn't appreciate their behavior. While it's sad that their relative died they shouldn't be using that to try to excuse their poor behavior (and let's be honest, this isn't the first time someone's tried to do this), especially considering they've already been punished at least once already for poor behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"C104k","date":"2019-06-26T00:22:07.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"See, completely cut off from their emotions.

That said, we can't just simply look the other way and give a pass on their behavior, especially when not only has the OP haven't given the whole story regarding their behavior in the form of a Reform Card, but there have been people here in the past trying to do the same thing the OP is doing: trying to use a relative's death to try to excuse their poor in-game behavior. You may disagree and that's fine, but I fail to see how any of this equates to being a robot (assuming you're not talking about unluenative).","replies":[{"poster":"C104k","date":"2019-06-26T01:13:00.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I don't disagree at all matter of fact I've said something along the same lines in this very same post. But I do however find your methods a tad odd. If you've had other people in the past that have exhibited the same type of behavior and claim. And presume this person is being dishonest. Why not just lock the thread in the first place and instruct this person through a DM? It would probably best for us all when these types of post present themselves. Cause by just leaving it as it is it will keep getting down voted and it could probably well effect op's psych. \n\nAs for the robot part I don't feel like explaining that right now and it would probably get me banned anyways. I'm trying to go for a new record here and test my limitations before I get banned again. I give myself ehhh another day or two.   \n\nAnd what the hell is a unluenative? Did you mean unalienated?\n\nEh don't bother replying boss. Ive grown bored of the boards. Time for some league.

Personal problems don't excuse poor behavior. Riot doesn't hold other people responsible for what you do. Responding to flaming teammates by flaming them back doesn't prevent you from seeing their continued flame, so it's not a defense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-06-25T21:38:21.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all - I am sorry for your loss and wish you best for luck in the future. Losing one beloved person is hard enough but losing both of your parent in such a short amount of time must be especially difficult to handle. Hopefully you have caring people around you and get a lot of (professional) support.\n\nBut even if it may sounds rude to bring it up now: **We all have our crosses to bear.** That does not mean in any way that your feelings are less worth or invalid but rather a friendly reminder that not only you suffer. League of Legends has an incredibly huge playerbase with different kind of people - and probably also with a lot of sad stories behind it. You would like to be treated with enough respect and enjoying your game peacefully, wouldn't you?  Then consider that your behaviour could possibly also ruined the game for your (not insulting) teammate(s). Maybe they wanted to play a chill game after dealing with a lot of shit in life, maybe they were just dudes trying to have fun - you can't know.\n\nRiot doesn't know you - they may have a lot of private information about your person but besides that - nothing. When the automatic system reviews your chatlog - well, for it you are just player \"GimmiMoar\" who broke this or that rule. Riot doesn't approve the behaviour you had to face but they don't allow counter_flame_ (unsure if you really flamed due to pending chatlogs), \n\nWe can not allow to give player free-passes just because they deal with a tough situation. Some people could lie, abusing this system - making up wild stories to get sympathy  and others could cross the line massively due to their uncontrolled frustrations. God, there are many possibilities how this new \"rule\" could lead to chaos.\n\nLeague of Legends is well-known for its toxic community, therefore I would highly suggest that you start muting teammates as soon as they start showing negative signs or even at the beginning of the game till you are coming to term with the deaths.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C104k","date":"2019-06-26T00:12:13.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"**Riots parents were just surrogates therefore they know nothing of a loss of a parent. Or human feelings for that matter. They're a bunch of npcs.**\n\nI think it's pretty pathetic and disgraceful to use your parents passing as a excuse. For your behavior and lifting your ban. You should of first morn then play league. You know what kinda scumbags  are on League and you should know what kind are on this board. I hope they don't lift the ban cause this game is just going to screw your psych up more then it already is. So get off and go heal first. \n\nMy condolence may you heal and peace be with you.","replies":[]}]}
