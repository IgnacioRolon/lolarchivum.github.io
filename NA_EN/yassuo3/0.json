To me this is not a ban able offense since players are given the option to mute each player both on their team and on the enemy team, or further more they can get rid of the entire chat feature itself in the settings box. I believe that every player who was permanently banned from the game for purposes only due to \"toxic\"  in game chat behavior such as cursing and or trash talking teammates or opponents should have a second chance in this game since technically they have not actually broken any rules in terms of making the game enjoyable. Since riot has the mute teammate feature players can simply mute their teammates who prefer to take out their aggression over the terms of typing in chat even though the chat box is suppose to be used for team work and planning, however we players know that this rarely occurs in lower elo and especially in higher elo. Personally Riot should spend less time focusing on banning players for things such as toxic chat behavior for this doesn't cause any real harm unless these players are telling other players to kill themselves repetitively for this is a different style of aggression. Riot in fact should spend majority of their time banning the players who truly cause major issues in this game being those who win trade, and purposely throw games to help streamers out as well as boosters. These players actually effect how the game is played and can cause players who don't deserve certain rewards to get them while players who grind away get farther and farther from their dreams especially if they have to encounter these types of players on a daily basis like I do.

How much effort do you think a completely automated system takes? How much effort do you think is actively applied to chat?\nAnd the **effect** of the punishments for chat is simply larger because it's much much easier to hold people accountable for their chat than to hold people accountable for their intentions.\n\nAnd that's the point of what I was trying to say: Making the game unenjoyable via, for example, feeding is only deemed worthy of punishment if it happens **intentionally**.","replies":[{"poster":"SymbolicFear","date":"2019-12-01T09:49:50.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-12-01T09:56:19.626+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SymbolicFear,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=iz44l8xf,comment-id=000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-01T09:49:50.860+0000)\n>\n> Incorrect yet again young one\n\nWhat is incorrect?\n\n>Asking if birds are black is not a yes or no question as it encompasses many different species and subclasses, \"Birds\" isnt a specific. \n\nAnd asking if making the game unenjoyable is bannable is not a yes or no question as it encompasses many different types of behaviour. \"Making the game unenjoyable\" isn't specific.\n\n>Asking if its bannable to make the game unfun, is a specific, im specifically asking if i make the game unfun for others, knowing thats what im doing, is that bannable?\n\nJust because you say it's specific doesn't mean it is. Admittedly you are getting more specific as you are now including \"knowing that's what I'm doing\" in the question. But there's still a whole lot of ways you could be doing that.\n\nThere are plenty of lane combinations that specifically aim to make the opponent's game hell. That's not bannable.\nSome people dislike certain champions in certain roles, to the extend that if I pick such a champion (even if I know I'm improving my - and therefore the team's - chance to win) I make their game less enjoyable. That, too, is not bannable.\n\nSo the answer to your question, just as with the question of \"Are birds black?\" is: Sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\nYou can keep pretending as if all actions that make the game unenjoyable are 100% identical and should be treated 100% identical. But it's simply not the case.\nAnd that's why your question is, frankly, bullshit. You are putting your own views and assumptions in there, forcing anybody who would try to answer the question to implicitly agree with those assumptions.\n\nWell, here's the thing: I don't. I don't agree with your assumption. That doesn't mean I'm overthinking things, doesn't mean I'm underthinking things, doesn't mean I'm a fanboy.\nIt just means that I disagree with you.

Also, why is it that in game chat is the biggest priority as Riot is so lazy to make it automated and refuse to ever put in any real effort to stop wintrading, smurfing, boosting, intentionally feeding, trolling, etc etc, also, why is the game frequently updated to be more and more frustrating to the individual?  With complete disregard to the feedback that a majority of players, even high elo streamers and players of many many years and even pro players, they repeatedly make them game more and more unfun and unenjoyable to play. In fact, ive spoken to a large variety of players in all elo and they all state the same issues and it started about 3 to 4 years ago.

Toxic chat behavior can vary yes ? Someone can simply flame things like “stop feeding” or “please help the team instead of nonstop free farming jungle all game” and all it takes is a pre made group of two to report you and you get the same punishment as someone who were to take this sort of behavior to another level being in typing things that are more or less on a more personal and aggressive manner. One is not even remotely harming another player at all where as the other is, yet they revoke the same kind of punishment. Win trading however affects the teams who have the win trader and those who do not, for no matter what happens the team that has the win trader is going to lose the game and potentially end their series or promotions or what ever it may be. The team that is receiving the free win has a ruined game experience due to it just not being fun to win that way. Boosters ruin the game by making others hard work and time commitment seem pointless when someone who has played the game for one year can go from Bronze 4 one month to let’s say gold 1 or platinum 4 the next. While in the course of this month they randomly start taking flash on d as opposed to f like that have their entire league career. For those of you who believe that I am only asking that toxic players should get un banned only because I got banned? Honestly this is somewhat true for I personally got banned permanently on my main account due to trying to expose a win trader in the chat and they told their duo along with their friends who reported me straight to riot. Do I find this fair? Not really for everyone else on my team was flaming them as well and yes they also got permanently  banned, while the win traders did not.  Now that we have got this settled. To turn the conversation so that others who Always seem to point the finger at strictly toxic behavior. I know for a fact that everyone in this game has flamed their teams one time or another, some do it every game. Why don’t they get banned then if it is breaking the rules ? Also let’s say that you flame someone due to having a bad day, and you get banned I garentee  that your opinions about toxic chat behavior will change.
