Sometimes it crashes on load screen.  That happened to me today and I had to restart my pc.  I was able to make it in game, but 2 people in the team voted to remake and  I took the loss.  This is so incredibly uncool for the following reasons:\r\n* Under 3 minutes is too soon to remake\r\n* Its a League crash .. don&#039;t make me suffer more\r\n* I actually made it back into game!\r\n* Only 2 people voted and it was still a remake?\r\n\r\nIs there anyway you can make this system fair?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMarcus","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-18T04:54:58.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you didn't lose anything in the process?\ni can't cook bread in 3 minutes, i'd say just move on, it shows up as a remake as well, not a loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venompaw","date":"2018-04-18T02:48:10.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 mins is too big of a deficit to come back from if the other players are competent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-04-18T00:27:38.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it fair to drag the game on for NINE people not knowing if you will be back or not?  It is not just 3 minutes that was wasted.  Add in however long people have to sit in queue + like 5 minutes of champ select.  You want to drag it out even longer?\n\nThe only way only 2 people voted with a successful remake is if there are 3 afk on the team.","replies":[]}]}
