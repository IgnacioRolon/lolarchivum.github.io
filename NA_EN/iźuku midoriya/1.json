Sure hes changing because the meta is changing but he essentially has a perma slow on his E with a silence.  This makes it extremely difficult to get away from him.  Due to his passive he has insane sustain in lane along with a dorans ring makes it very difficult to punish him.  I think the biggest problem lies in the problems he has:\r\n\r\n{{item:3800}} {{item:3193}} \r\n\r\nBecause damage reduction doesnt reduce true damage, he still hits you for so much.  Righteous glory gets him into fights and due to its slow allows him to permaslow you with his E.  A big problem is also do to the fact that when he snowballs out of control, there is no way to stop him.  He deals true damage scaling with his max health and there is no way for him to lose his stacks","replies":[{"poster":"QuantumToast","date":"2017-07-23T10:22:39.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cant rito just change the health provided by stoneplates ative into a shield? So you would gain a shield equal to 40% / 100% of your max health. Would have exactly the same effect but removing the stupid interaction with chigath. Cho doesnt need it. Even without it he is a very solid pick with his new E and the good cc.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2017-07-23T12:04:49.583+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stoneshield give hp because it can be countered, kinda.

I did like this other guys idea (posted on the boards somewhere) to make it give **_base_** hp.  This would give it all the tankiness still, but prevent it from adding a bunch of damage to a certain ability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-07-23T03:22:38.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree.

Now we play more seriuosly versus Cho... Before you only need move a bit a he didnt anything...so easy...now he is more challenger ..its very good for the game. Some people need to deal with a new champ in the meta and stop spamming cries.\n\nFor example I cant wait to see a Morde and Skarner being strong and meta... Yes we will see lots of topics like this... Its means something good.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-07-23T15:39:00.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No love I don't playing vs him...

He was better when his feast stacks didn't stack infinitely. but now he is a pain in the ass. He benefit's too much from HP scaling and he needs to become a mage-juggernaut not a fucking OP killing machine with disgusting scaling on his new E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XElite109","date":"2017-07-23T03:17:18.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly riot fucked up and he just is in a very unhealthy stat with that stick.","replies":[]}]}
