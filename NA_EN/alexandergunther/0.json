I don't get on League often anymore so it's hard to pinpoint exactly when this began happening, but I think it was around the time that I updated for Ivern. I've searched for a problem similar to mine but so far I've come up empty. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling, but that didn't work. I manually changed the resolution in the game's file to my monitor's current resolution (1768*992) but that didn't work either. The game runs fine other than that, but I really need full screen in order to perform my best. I included pictures of what the game looks like in windowed and full screen mode. When in full screen, the game still overlaps anything else I try to open, so it behaves like it's in full screen even though it's not covering the entire screen.\r\n\r\nI'm running Windows 10. If you need additional information to help me please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T04:55:41.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There was a windows update that was pushed out and is causing issues for players using some of the outlying display resolutions such as yours.

It should be here: **(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)**\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**, then hop into a custom match to see if it's resolved the issue. \n____\nLet me know the results!","replies":[{"poster":"McSnikles","date":"2017-06-22T18:39:36.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixes also the current issues with Patch 7.12.
