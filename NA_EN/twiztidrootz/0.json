(NOT SARCASTIC)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Very recently my account was stolen, the pass changed without my consent or knowledge. Honestly I thought I was screwed. The account I had for YEARS, put sooo much money and time into it. It was lost. I didn't have the original email I had created it with, and I could only imagine me never getting access back because of a stupid hacker. Riot, you helped me quick and incredibly efficiently and I thank you so much. I know it can get hard, never able to make people happy, but I'll remember this. I'm almost in tears cause the thought of having to make a new account almost broke me. I couldn't have made another account and put the time in. I would have had to quit playing a very very good game. Although this has also shown me there seems to be a massive issue in your system/processes. I won't elaborate because obviously I don't want a bunch of people to figure it out, and even myself don't understand completely how they might have did it. But I have a pretty good idea. I hope you guys are able to figure a better way to stop it from happening so easily in the future. Again, thank you SOOOO much riot. I would hug you all personally if I could, but I can't so Ill just hug my monitor and say I did. Support team = BEST keep up the amazing work!{{champion:74}}  (Now where is my adjustable reverse-ratcheting magnetic box wrench!)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T15:31:10.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really glad that your situation had a happy ending!  Our account team really does their best to help with recoveries and reparations.  I know sometimes we might seem a bit stern, but it's only because we want to make sure an account is being restored to its owner without a shadow of a doubt.  \n\nWe know how important an account is to you, I couldn't imagine losing all the years of hard work and games I've played.  Lots of warm and fuzzies in this thread, I'll be sure to pass it on to Sempai Support and the rest of the account team.  :D","replies":[]}]}
