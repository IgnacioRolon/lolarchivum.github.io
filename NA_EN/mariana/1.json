Normally I average 63ms and it's very consistent, but now my ping spikes between 70-100ms almost every second. 1 Second 63ms, next second 100ms, next 80ms. \r\n\r\nOn the PBE though, I was constantly  getting 51ms. Never spiked.\r\n\r\nI've tried majority of the troubleshooting solutions on the support page.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has an idea of what could be the problem, please let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-29T15:20:38.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you getting any lag spikes despite the increased ping?
