Closed the client in hopes to reconnect that way but it just takes me to the normal screen with no options of reconnecting? I can re-queue with no time penalty also. No signs of the game existing on my profile either? Not sure what happened since my internet is at my full speed and no signs of lag anywhere else. Hoping it was something to do with the game getting cancelled and not just some bug screwing my team over. :/ Hopefully no reports. :c","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-24T03:52:54.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh sounds like you encountered a game that crashed on the server. It doesn't happen too often, and when it does you'll be able to requeue just like you could this time. You won't get any penalties for this, since the game itself crashed and essentially never existed!","replies":[]}]}
