Releasing patches in slower or faster cycles doesn't make a single difference.\nWhat it does matter is what is the game's pace.\n\nMMO pace is pretty slow and League's is pretty fast.\nIf Riot took Blizzard's approach, our patch cycles would look like preseasons do. Massive clusterfucks of a lot of changes and sudden meta role reversals. That is definitely not healthy for a competative game like LoL, where it needs constant care and a lot of smaller patches that address problems pretty quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"foinhas","date":"2016-03-13T21:30:23.002+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"MMO MMO MMO MMO MMO MMO MMO.\n\nGee, can you imagine if Blizzard had anything else than WoW?

Certain champion kits are old enough that under these new LoL conditions, it's impossible to balance because the kit is binary and messing with this one thing the kit is good at will completely ruin a champion.\nThat's why Riot is doing Champion Updates, Class Updates and fixing Itemization.\nYou can't expect everything to be done right from the first try nor that you'll like every single change.\nEven if fundamentally, some champions are bad because League evolved into what it is today, there are both sides of the same coin: some people will be mad that their champions has been updated and others glad that now they can play it.\n\nThey have made mistakes and even some champion updates did not hit the right mark with them or address their issues. You need a lot of information to understand what exactly isn't working and how to fix it.\nAlways hating on Riot when something doesn't turn out as expected will only lead them to eventually not taking any risks in order to freshen up the game and we'll end up with a generic game and run of the mill champions that are nothing special - just ball of stats that are either good or bad.\nIn the end, i don't think Riot will run their game to the ground one day, it will be us Negative Nancies that do.\n\nYou can be frustrated that a certain things are out of whack but if i were a Rioter, i wouldn't want to come here to sift through the hate, i'd rather read a core post about a specific problem you think it doesn't work so that i could reply with facts and perhaps an inside scoop or whatnot.\nIn the end, don't be a vague dick in your posts.

How many times has this item been reintroduced and the same champs are still abusing it? Albeit this time around we narrowed those champs down to \"on hit passives\".\n\nThe item was so poorly designed, it was only a niche pick for champs with passives built into their kits, like Aatrox, Xin, Yi, Shyv. Then you guys proceeded to buff it into the heavens to make it viable on a larger champ pool. All it did was make champs that already used it insane, and no point in picking champs that didn't.\n\nThe other problem is that daggers build into so many things. If by 5 minutes you can tell that your team can't hold their own and your jungle is in danger; you simply DON'T build Devourer. And guess what? You're not punished at all. You turn those two daggers into BoTRK or Stattik.\n\nSo these two things means that; if you can build Devourer and stack it, you win. If you can't, you go for Warriors, and try your luck at a 50/50.\n\nAlso; instantly stacking Black Cleaver is nice and fun.

When it came out, it was an item with a trade-off. 1) You give up early game presence for late game power and 2) You need to commit gold to make use of its passive, unlike Feral Flare. However, with so many radical changes over summer and fall, these conditions kinda don't hold anymore since there's item like Sterak's Gage and Titanic Hydra and then again, there's Guinsoo's Rageblade that has so much synergy as an item with it's stats (AS works with AD, AS works with Guinsoo's stacks, AP works with it's on-hit passive) and Devourer makes it even stronger. It's just that Guinsoo's provides so much AS that you probably don't need any more damage items if your kit already synergises with AS. On the dagger thing, I think you could say the same about Cinderhulk and Warrior, as you can shift to Cinderhulk and turn your long swords into anything, or your Caulfield into TBC. And while that's okay, at the same time it's not, because most junglers need their enchantment to remain relevant in the game and clear the jungle fast enough to have some gold. I still insist that they should turn Black Cleaver back to the way it was before 5.22. As the item is, it favours classes that it wasn't meant for more than it does for classes that it's meant for. Maybe Devourer should also revert back to 50% AS 50 Magic Damage since that way, a better part of the item is locked out of it when you're CC'ed. Maybe there's some complex math into this that proves that 40% AS+60 Magic Damage > 50% AS + 50 Magic damage?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-03-14T01:15:21.430+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":9,"body":"They are only strong because of the items.

The whole point about this stupid build is that he avoids dying while running towards you, eating all the damage and diving towers, while still killing you as fast as possible.\nThe same problem is with tank Akali, Ekko, Fizz. Riot deleted tank Ekko and Fizz because it was not OK.\n\nFiora also does this. Irelia too.\nGraves builds {{item:3142}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3812}}  and not ADC items.\nWe can't forget our buddy Jax.\nXin Zhao too...\nTrundle, oh boy...
