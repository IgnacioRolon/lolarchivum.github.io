I create this request for a chance to be seen by the developers.\r\n\r\nI want to request a more difficult Co-op vs AI.\r\n\r\nIt used to be more difficult back in season 2, as the bot AI had bonus gold gain which made them harder to beat.\r\n\r\nCurrent bots do not have it, and are extremely easy to beat.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Bots in Custom games are more limited than Co-op vs AI mode, in the champion pool. (Many bots are not in Custom game, while they are in Co-op vs AI.)\r\n\r\nOther MOBAs like DOTA 2 etc. do have this feature (Harder bot difficulties) while League does not. Please, don't fall behind other MOBAs and improve this!","replies":[]}
