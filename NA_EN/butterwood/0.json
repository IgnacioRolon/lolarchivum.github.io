Or League of Legends (in its current state).\r\n\r\nBut it _should not be okay_ for you to shit on other people for enjoying those things. If someone wants to get an enormous Jar Jar Binks tattoo on their chest because it makes them happy, let them. If someone spends the entire day procrastinating at work and googling Game of Thrones theories (not speaking from personal experience, I swear), let them. There are too many things that make people legitimately unhappy to actively try to stop anyone from enjoying something they're passionate about.","replies":[]}
