Then while in game to go along with ping spikes the game itself will freeze randomly. It especially freezes if someone surrenders or the nexus is killed it'll freeze from 1 to 4 seconds before going to the nexus explosion. Any help with this would be very appreciated.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T18:46:45.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a pretty unstable connection that's getting cut off while trying to load and having hiccups if you get in at all.  My suggestion would be to go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and stabilize things a bit.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
