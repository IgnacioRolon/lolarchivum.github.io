It makes text and numbers pretty hard to read, and I can't actually change the size back because then the graphics do not fit onto the actual client. Its especially annoying because I just made the mistake of trying to change the size back in champ select, which caused the client to glitch and give me a dodge during promos.\r\n\r\nHow do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"BABY Polarbear","date":"2017-07-30T10:18:18.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem, i try so many times change the size in client/general 1024x576 to 1280x720 but after each game, it changes the size to 1024x576 by ifself :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-30T04:41:06.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First I want to make sure you're changing your display size in the right area. Make sure that you're changing it through the client settings and not by editing the config files, since editing the file itself may not force the settings to save on the cloud. If the client won't let you up the screen size any higher than 1024x576, then your pc might not think it can support that high of a resolution.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-04-30T04:55:17.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I edit the size is through the little gear symbol in the upper right corner of the client. It leads to Client/General. I can choose the sizes 1024x576, 1280x720, and 1600x900. No matter which option I'm on though, the client will go back down to 1024x576 as soon as a game ends. It wouldn't be an issue if I could resize it, but doing so glitches the client.","replies":[]}]}]}
