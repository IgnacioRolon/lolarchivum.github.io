I absolutely love him.\nAlmost every game i go into I try to play him. Most of the time my whole team will cry if I play with randoms. At least 2 will say ivern sux every single game and more often then not its the whole team saying that, other than myself. I tell them: No he don&#039;t suck, just most people suk at playing him.\nSo is anyone else Ivern mastery lvl 7? or am I the world first?","replies":[]}
