I&#039;m sitting at Bronze 1, and hovering between 0 and 50 LP. Everything up to this point has felt easy, but recently, I haven&#039;t been able to win games. I&#039;ll win my lane consistently enough but a majority of the time, I&#039;ll be faced with an even more fed mid laner, jungler, ect, and with on mis-step (and let&#039;s face it, I&#039;m bronze, I&#039;m gunna make a mistake at some point, with out doubt.) I get annihilated and I lose the ability to influence the game. Last time it was a fed annie, who would just walk through my team, stun me and I&#039;d die.  I honestly am trying to figure out what the hell I&#039;m supposed to do, because it seem like every game, even if I&#039;m doing well, there is someone on the enemy team who is doing better.","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-04-23T00:50:01.808+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You go into the game hoping that your team is competent....usually a worthless wish.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2015-04-23T01:06:03.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"either QSS (gives mr and removes stun) or banshee (gives mr, shield vs first spell and health).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Purple Death","date":"2015-04-23T00:48:22.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You ask your team to protect you in teamfights.\nIf your playing a good duelist adc you can splitpush till someone tries to stop you and just kill them take turret.\nIf mid annie is fed and you cant kill her try and get maw  or banshees or even a qss can help.\nIf your winning bot you have dragon control ask you jungler to come gank so you can kill the bot lane and get dragon or even turret or BOTH!","replies":[]},{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-04-23T14:17:19.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep playing and learn from your mistakes. Bronze 1 is definitely harder, because everyone is desperately trying to get Silver.\n\nThere are some champions who you'll die to as an ADC, even if you position well. Irelia for example, if you're Lucian in a teamfight, you're probably dead. But itemize against her as best as you can, get whatever self-peel you can, and hope the team helps. Save your E to escape if needed. If you're banning, ban selfishly, to keep yourself relevant. Bronze is a cheese war, so make sure you cheese harder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-04-23T13:52:34.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you win lane, fastpush the lane and backdoor the inhib, then do this with the other lanes - let the minions do the dirty work, But you must ward the enemy jungle, so you won't get 3-4 man gank and start feeding. If you are  getting camped, but still win bot, go push mid, teamfight only if you have advantage. Also playing \"noobstomp\" champs is the key to get out of bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melee Form","date":"2015-04-23T08:43:13.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter how fed you are, your job isn't to start the fights.

General advice I can give you:\nDon't go melee as adc, stay back and keep in mind your most important job is not to die, you might be able to kill the enemy Ashe if you flash in but is it worth it if you die aswell? Maybe if she is 7-0 and you are 1-5 but otherwise no. Just stay in the back and focus the most important target close to you. If you are dead you cannot dish out damage which is your only job as adc so make sure you surive every teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-23T01:12:52.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait for the Annie or whoever else is fed on the enemy team to blow their abilities on someone else, then go in.  Don't bother trying to 'focus the carry', hit the enemy who you can attack safely. If you straight up can't teamfight, ward a lane and splitpush, you can probably take a tower or two while the enemy is arguing over whether to try to kill you or not.","replies":[]}]}
