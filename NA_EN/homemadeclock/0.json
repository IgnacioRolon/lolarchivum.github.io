As soon as we get into character select and everyone chooses a role, there's the bot usually with a name that goes in this format **tRoVm**Joyce, or in this format Audrey**eHsHe**. they never type anything during the match, and selects a random champion during champ select. another name format that the bots have are names that go like this example(each of the names i listed are the names of the bots): Robert**pKo**, and Cheryl**yKb**. notice how the names are similar in format. Another would be Kirka**UvrvW**, and Maxwell**cKeDr**.\r\n\r\nThey never say anything during the match, and during the match they run into each lane, occupied or not, and if they see an enemy, they run towards them and try to attack the enemy champion, and run into turret fire even if they are about to die. \r\n\r\nOnce they do die, the bot switches to a different lane and repeats the process, and towards the end of the match you'll notice the bots on each team are 5 or 4 levels below the rest of the team. \r\n\r\nit has been happening a lot more in games that i queue in, and it's really boring, the bots are too predictable. Then there are times when more than one bot will be on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-14T08:01:06.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, almost everyone has noticed that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shovel Bot","date":"2019-12-14T05:12:53.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes the bots went elsewhere from Treeline since rito's apathy did not want to save it from being ruined by bots\n\nsorry for your experience","replies":[]}]}
