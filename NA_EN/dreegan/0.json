Toxic Ribbons. Something that lets people KNOW that when they get in a match with someone toxic, they already know what to expect so they're not blind-sided in-game.\r\n\r\nGet Chat Banned? Here's a ribbon with a face on it with an X over the mouth, so you know that person is either not allwoed to talk, or restricted from talking, whether it's voice (if ever implemented) or chat.\r\n\r\nGet suspended for seriously bad behaviour? Here's a sickly green ribbon that looks like it's either been dipped in a corosive or left out in the trash for 3 weeks with rotten food.\r\n\r\nAnd there can be other ribbons that could show off what you've been reported for. Obviously these ribbons would go away after X amount of time without a legitimate report.\r\n\r\nThe kicker? Dodging the que when one of those people are in your group doesn't count against you, or anyone else who dodged. Now you KNOW who the toxic players are, and you KNOW what to expect right from the word go. No more having to sit through 20+ minutes of teeth grating as you watch that Support Ahri feed her ass off, knowing you can't go on tilt because you'll get reported, and can't really DO anything about it except try to play your best (even though you know you're just wasting your time) and hoping for the best. This way you're not longer punished for nipping a potential problem in the bud, and players who have at the very least a minimum amount of decency to their fellow summoners don't have to feel afraid, or that they're being punished for being forced to play with someone who has a history of shitty behavior.\r\n\r\nI can't say it's the best system, but I really feel like it's a step in the right direction towards helping get past the anonymity of the game. Part of me feels that it might be a bit heavy handed, but just like it's nice to know if someone's an honorable opponent, or a good team-player, I'd like to know who and where the rotten apples are, so I can avoid them, and hope the rest of the player base does as well.\r\n\r\n{{champion:98}}  We all still have to Stand United, even if it's against those who want to poison our community. Sometimes you can't fight rage with a smile and a silent tear.","replies":[]}
