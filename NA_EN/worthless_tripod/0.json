Easter eggs would make for a simple and fun way to introduce players to the clients useful features, and easter egg hunting could become a thing for a while. New players will be delighted to come across them, or hear of them and immediately log on to investigate.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m thinking of Hearthstone as the inspiration for this, with stuff wiggling when you click on it (useful and fun to mash when waiting in queue), but it could also take the form of the konami code, or an epic scavenger hunt leading to an unlockable summoner icon.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is a great idea, leave a comment with an example of a possible easter egg! And don&#039;t forget to vote in the fun poll!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-12-09T04:51:30.808+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I approve #huevo","replies":[]}]}
