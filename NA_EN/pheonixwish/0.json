Your projectile when ranged will usually go to a nearby minion, which gives you enough info to back off.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaos Open","date":"2015-01-08T20:07:44.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This only works in bot lane or top if you have one of the few top ranged champs. Otherwise there are no minions are to attack. So, the bushes in the jungle or the two bushes in the river beside mid lane don't apply. \nIt works for the supports, during laning phase if the enemy minion wave is in the right place, and you have enough time to stand still and see if your champ attacks the minion wave; but it's too situational to be of use 99.9% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Pheonixwish","date":"2015-01-08T23:43:40.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to me more than you might think, maybe I'm playing wrong or something o.O\n\nJust thought it was a neat little trick though :3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-01-08T18:00:57.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wat\n\ndo you mean the minions will attack you?
