However, I went into game having looked up in the past how to handle her.  Some say range stomps on her, so I took Gnar.  Not the best pick, whatever.  I kept her lane clear, killing tentacles as they spawn.  I went even in farm.  I took ignite to her tp, maybe not the best, whatev.  People say dodge her abilities all u have to do is sidestep.  Ok sure, I dodged at least half.  But she just needs to land e once, and ur in big trouble.  She got fb.  I call in lee jg to help, he ganks and she e then ults and practically 1 shots both of us, this after i Gnar ult and w her.  She stomps all game.  Can somebody tell me how to handle her beyond dodge her skills, because they are going to connect sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2017-01-15T23:35:18.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Denying any part of her combo - dodging E, canceling W, walking out of R so he cant hit both you and your soul - will cut her damage immensely. It's much more important than killing tentakus on the walls. Basically don't let her hit E, ult both you and your soul, and than W you. That's the one-shot combo, but there are many places to deny it. I won't explain it in detail here, but any part you deny cuts damage by 50% or more.\n\nThe lower you are on HP, the less damage she can do to you by bashing your soul, so you can hold your turret for surprisingly long, even if you can't really fight her.\n\nIf you dodge her E, most champions can all in her and duel comfortably. Although you should probably still back off and come to fight later if she ults (ult doesn't do too much damage if she has no E, so you can just walk out of it).\n\nShe is gankable like hell if she has no ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2017-01-15T23:33:33.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she or gnar gives you trouble laning against I'd suggest trying. {{champion:25}}  Her shield protects u from the soul grab, well  you have great wave clear and cc.

However, if she landed a tentacle during that time it was slaughter.\nIt isn't so much that you can't make it work every once in a while, it is more like what is the trade off for her?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-15T23:30:12.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start by not giving her first blood. Play safe, always save mobility to dodge or escape, just farm and try to keep her busy. Anticipate her ult and run away, flash if you have to. It has very limited range, and her massive sustain is also limited by kiting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2017-01-15T23:27:29.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you kill the tentacles, then when she pulls your spirit, just fight her, and you get the spirit back quicker and will outtrade her\nwhen your jungle comes for a gank, and illoai pulls a spirit and ults, both of yu just run, her ult has a long enough cd early, that when she backs and returns, it will still be cd, and seeing as how she tends to shove the wave really hard, just call your jungle again and you can get her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-01-15T23:27:21.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit her when she grabs you to decrease the vessel time, rather than running away.\n\nDo run away when she ults.","replies":[]}]}
