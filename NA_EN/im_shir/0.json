I posted another thread in the forum with a possible reason. ive only noticed the bug in games with Illaoi. I think it might have to do with the animations of the tentacles.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xTheCaptainx","date":"2015-12-02T15:20:40.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It happened to me all game last night. sometimes it would straighten and sometimes it would just freeze the character and lasers would come out of nowhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2015-12-03T17:31:36.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess he **REALLY **likes Illaoi's tentacles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KDragonL","date":"2015-12-03T05:25:11.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup this is happening to me as well, 2 out of three sounds about right.

I've also noticed lately that my ult just doesn't work sometimes. Either it will just totally ignore my cursor to aim and just stay firing in one spot or it will just not do anything at all but lock him in the channel position with no lasers firing whatsoever. I've also been using his Battlecast skin, if that matters. I don't know how to get the bugs to happen, though I have noticed (or think I noticed) that his ult seems to bug out after throwing out Q, W, and E all at once. It's really killing my games :[","replies":[{"poster":"Im Shir","date":"2015-12-03T04:01:26.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also happens in his Arclight skin.","replies":[]}]}]}
