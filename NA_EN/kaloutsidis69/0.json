We don't have 100% info on Clash here in NA quite yet (since it isn't being tested here at all) but I was able to find some of this info over on the [**Clash Discord**](https://discord.gg/league-clash-beta)!\n\n> **SUBSTITUTES**\n> \n> The substitute system is there for when one of your team can't play in the tournament.\n> \n> - Remember, when you lock in with your group for your first day of play, you're with that team for the rest of the weekend. If you want to sub a player for the first day, just lock in with them, and then sub them out for future days.\n> \n> - Each day, you can substitute out a single player. That player must fit all the other team requirements, not be in another Clash team, and also be at (or below) your Skill Tier. That player will be with the team for the rest of the day (and no longer).\n> \n> Here's how it works:\n> 1. The captain will select one player to be substituted out and invite another.\n> 2. The substitute accepts the team invite, and inputs a Ticket.\n> 3. The sub will lock in with the rest of the team, and play as normal.\n> 4. Prizing works as follows:\n> a) The player that was subbed in will receive rewards as normal at the end of their tournament run that day, and then leave the team (regardless of performance)\n> b) If the team loses during that day, the subbed-out player will receive rewards as if they had lost both games that day\n> c) If the team wins during that day, the subbed-out player will return to the team the following day","replies":[{"poster":"Kaloutsidis69","date":"2018-01-04T11:34:54.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did I get notified?
