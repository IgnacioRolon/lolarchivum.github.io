I was trying to find a way where he (and others who don&#039;t hear) could enjoy the champions&#039; wonderful and often hilarious voice lines. \r\n\r\nI was thinking of something along the lines of an optional separate chatbox that showed what nearby champions were saying, or an option to have small text appear near the champion as they said a voice line. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m hoping this brings a probably overlooked (and small) issue to riot&#039; attention so they might think about putting some energy towards making the game as enjoyable as possible for a certain demographic of their players. \r\n\r\nAlso, if this is in the wrong place or could go someplace better, tell me where to put it.  \r\n\r\nI read through some of the other posts regarding deaf players&#039; interactions with the game and it seems like a lot of people are (were?) concerned with global ults with an audible warning but no visual one. I think this might fix that issue as well but I&#039;m less worried about the &quot;unfairness&quot; of the game and more worried about missing content since if it were that unfair for deaf players there would be less of them playing. \r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback, ideas, and/or help.","replies":[{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-07-11T06:01:04.365+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":100,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Samura Yukisuna","date":"2017-07-11T06:11:57.952+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fuffychan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iGdEixrh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-11T06:01:04.365+0000)\n>\n> Liberals never stop finding things to complain about.\n> \n> Blind people cant play the game.

You do realize that the actors probably worked from a script, right?\n\nThere is no reason to ever not have subtitles if the material is scripted. Adding text lines that you actually do copy+pasta from a script is about as basic as it gets for coding.\n\nPlease keep in mind Riot put a significant amount of resources in to animate Cassiopeia's tail more realistically. The 'opportunity cost'? There are some things that I think have innate value--offering deaf people an opportunity to interact with the game the same way hearing people do is something that has innate value, and the opportunity cost of copypasting lines from a script into subtitles that you can turn on and off with a checkmark in a box costs basically no resources, and it costs a lot fewer resources than lots, and lots, and lots of little things Riot does to make the game enjoyable.\n\nYou have no idea how many deaf people play this game, just like you have no idea how many people wanted wintery summoner's rift. Sometimes, you make stuff for other people to enjoy, even if it wouldn't be of any value to _you_.\n\nBusinesses are run by people, people who also are deaf, or have deaf friends and family members. The assumption that deaf people are the 'other' and shouldn't be accommodated for is, frankly, very near-sighted on your part. Disabled people ARE part of the gaming community, and their needs should be as much of a priority as able-bodied people's. I personally would rather have one deaf kid able to 'hear' the champions' voice lines than get a skin for my favorite champion, or a new rotating game mode added to the client. I'm not deaf. I don't know any deaf people. It's just something I think has intrinsic value.\n\nTLDR; your values are not representative of other people's, or even Riot's, for that matter, and it never hurts to ask for accommodation.

I think they should have a fair shot as the game. For example, an ability that has no visual cues but only a sound effect is rather unfair. But this suggestion is to add something with absolutely no gameplay impact into the game and it's really not just copy, paste (even though that's part of the process, yes). You need to find a right location on the screen to fit it in, that location would have to stay preserved for this function instead of being available for other future content. Another toggle button on the options menu making it slightly harder to find the things you're looking for. (One extra button isn't doing much, but if you start adding toggles for every tiny thing, then people will get lost in the option menu.)\nAgain, the main issue is finding and reserving that spot on your screen and maintaining it throughout the years.\n\nAlso, the public of interest for this particular update is not the entire deaf population.

The biggest hurdle is finding a way to display it, because at the moment the chat box, damage boxes, and ability boxes/attachment (text that reads \"Not ready yet\", \"out of mana\", etc) are the only available places for text. Though there's probably a hidden box as well for things like evolutions that can be adapted and you should only experience clipping in certain circumstances, ones that are so specific as to be practically irrelevant.\n\nOf course, that's all assuming *several* things, but as far as getting every line that's in the game, it's extremely simple.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChemicalBuster","date":"2017-07-13T06:01:13.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes a definite trump supporter.

Sion and Kled are the two big ones I can think of. My sister mentioned the sound they make, but the first warning I personally get of an incoming Sion or Kled on their ult is when they come flying out of the fog. Some little touch to provide a visual warning would be nice.\n\nEdit: It doesn't have to be a big or persistent visual effect. Just... something. A question mark appearing over your character's head or something. Like \"what was that?\" Some little hint.\n\nOn the positive side, my sister tells me that spamming laugh taunts or other audible emotes to try tilting your lane opponent is something some players do.

I'll never play high-level ranked play (since my inability to use discord or other chat programs for communication would put my team at a disadvantage), and I'm fine with that. But I play well enough not to drag my team down in normals with no changes to the game as it is. I just was pleasantly surprised to find someone else advocating small quality of life fixes for people who aren't hearing, and was happy to discuss possible fixes and improvements. I do agree that resources devoted to these issues would be for the betterment of play for a tiny fraction of the player base, and given a choice between implementation of deaf-friendly fixes and features that benefit everyone, of course the resources should go to the features that help everyone.\n\nBut, just a thought here, small things that would help deaf people could also benefit hearing people. For example: players who like to listen to music while they play. Or players who have to mute the game because they play at times when the volume might bother the people they live with. Or people who just don't want to listen to whatever noises the game makes (my sister frequently mutes games she plays in favor of music or just because the sounds irritate her, so I know other hearing people probably do as well). Those are just three off the top of my head.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-07-12T04:16:45.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like it could be a very small fix, like they had with color blind mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"big boi edri","date":"2017-07-11T16:41:31.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to the pings concern, I think a great solution would be to allow LoL to work w/ tactile mice (a mouse that can vibrate). \n\nHave a \"Deaf Mode\" option maybe that works in conjunction with the mouse to send vibrations based on the ping used.

But even a very small fix, like an option to have the ping marker persist a little longer on the minimap... Not a huge duration, but maybe double the time, would be helpful. At least then I wouldn't glance at the minimap so often and see that someone pinged SOMETHING, but no idea exactly where or why.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Samura Yukisuna","date":"2017-07-11T06:13:30.517+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should show your brother to the wiki page of his favourite champions so he can read their quotes.
