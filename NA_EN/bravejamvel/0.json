Of course this doesn&#039;t mean anything to players who play SR only, but to me it&#039;s an achievement. There&#039;s an entire community of TT players like myself who love this map to death and prefer it over the Summoners Rift, for the games are more team based and fights seem to be pretty even if one team isn&#039;t just completely smashing.\n\nAll of that aside, it&#039;s fucking terrible. Here&#039;s why:\n\n* You have gold funneling, which completely ruins the jungle role entirely and is pretty much unbeatable in high elo due to the hyper carry being 3 levels ahead with a support and 2.5-3k gold ahead.\n\n* You have alters that are basically just &quot;You can capture me but it really doesn&#039;t do anything&quot;. Legit, the only reason to even capture these damn things is to get your Hunter stacks from the domination tree. (For those who are wondering, the alters give 10% bonus movement speed for one and 1%HP and Mana per minion kill for two).\n\n* The map specific items blow donkey dick {{item:3090}} {{item:3170}} {{item:3104}}, the only one even worth mentioning being Wooglet&#039;s, giving you 25% bonus AP and a Zhoynyas, but you&#039;re really only going to be getting a bonus of 75-90 AP before the game ends. The other two items are {{item:3056}} tier.\n\n* There&#039;s only a select few of viable champions, being {{champion:63}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:6}}. Anything that isn&#039;t this is considered &quot;experimental&quot; or pretty much feeding unless you&#039;re in gold and below.\n\n* The match making is so bad due to the lack of players+the fact that it&#039;s flex queue. The golden rule on the map is legitimately &quot;If the queue timer goes past 1:30, go ahead and dodge because you&#039;re going to get some wonky shit&quot;. On my Diamond accounts, I sometimes  have to wait a good 5 minutes because there isn&#039;t that many Diamond players in TT (Probably like 80-100), so I&#039;ll get a random silver with a 44% winrate on my team and will instantly lose the game because of it.\n\n* Vilemaw buff is completely niche, it doesn&#039;t give you any stats, but the fact that it fears enemy minions is nice because you can control the wave and  keep the enemy from segueing your nexus tower.\n\n* The fact that the tier 2 towers on the top side of the map can shoot you over the wall is completely unfathomable. That area needs to be widened up or something because that in itself just shouldn&#039;t exist.\n\n* Vilemaw dies far too quickly, especially when it comes to gold funneling bullshit. I see a Yi at 12 minutes with {{item:1419}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3124}} kill it solo in 6 seconds.\n\n\n\nOther than that, the map is fine, but all of which I pointed out completely ruins it. I hope Riot hears my cry of desperation, for at this point, the map is just going to get the dominion treatment, and I&#039;d hate to see that happen.\n\nI know for a blatant fact that you guys have the funds to make this happen, because you're putting forth more effort into a rotating game mode (nexus blitz) than you have on TT in 3 years. From what I've heard ( I could be wrong on this), you only have one person on your entire team working on the map. I guarantee you that if you put forth more effort onto TT, you'd get a bigger playerbase.","replies":[]}
