Then again I solo'd those. Didn't notice it as often while partied. But solo, I had some arams where half the players on each team were clearly bots... or more. I think I had one game with 6 bots, and the other 3 actual human players (all on the other team) pretty much had the same impression.","replies":[{"poster":"xFrostKnightx","date":"2015-09-29T11:11:46.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only been playing Aram/Ai bots due to internet provider issues.\n\nI have never met a bot. 2-4 afk' but no bots. \n\n\nAccept your ban for letting a friend log in from another access point (his home) seconds/minutes after you log out from a different access point. \nBans are almost 99% accurate because they notice you log in from another location and your play style, map movement, champion is different. \n\nIf I can hop onto a site and see common jungle paths which highlight over 1,000 players traveling the map submitted by replay. \n\nWhat makes you think riot dosnt have something x10 better to detect a different player playing?\n\nThere are even sites which detail performance per game and with each champion. You think riot won't notice a spike in player ability which is only being seen on Ranked and not on normals or Aram?

I won't link to a couple of my other recent threads, but in summary, you don't see bots because they're being used, from what I can tell, to auto-level accounts for sell after level capping. If I told you now it was about 30% of the people I ran across on my low-level account, that would probably be an understatement. I'm not kidding.\n\nI probably should have specified earlier, I was referring to lower-level matchmaking. No I don't see any bots at lvl 30. Then again, I wouldn't expect to see anyone use bots at lvl 30 and expect to get away with it.\n\nYes Riot has a ton of data. And yes I would believe they could easily detect any number of different behaviors from it, but apparently, they don't bother when it comes to bots that are 10 times stupider than Rito AI (they're pretty dumb, you have no idea.) And that's what I find absurd.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sweetíè","date":"2015-09-29T18:50:49.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The question is I did not ask any one to play for me.
