The ability to poke from range is not why anybody would pick Lee Sin jungle. This would not be the first time Riot has decided to balance a champion for one specific role. Thresh and Leona are great examples of champions that were created as a solo laner concept, but in practice were found better suited to support, and were then balanced strictly around being supports. Riot has also changed several other champions to put them onto just one role / a different role for balance purposes. {{champion:12}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:223}} also come to mind.\n\nTL:DR - Damage on Q1 is nearly irrelevant in teamfights, the power lies mostly in the threat of engage at this time.\nHe doesn't need poke as a Jungler, at now point in LoL history have junglers been picked for their poke prowess, even Nidalee with formidable poke was contested for her high clear speed and powerful early skirmishes.
