I do not use Snapchat. I do not use Line. I do not use Weibo. I do not use Twitter. I do not use Tumblr. Nor do I use Instagram. I do use G+ and comment on youtube, but I haven't done that for the last couple months. I have a phone, and I usually prefer to text and call people with it instead of resorting to social networks.\n\nThe closest thing I do to \"online social activity\" is using the league forum, and using the chatgroup in the game where it's consisted mostly of retired players and inactive accounts.

If you think you have the right to dump shittalk onto a person and expect them to just take it, then they also have to right to ask you to shut up as well. If you can not compromise that much and continue, I fail to see why you can't be reported for it.\n\nYou can claim that reporting is \"pussy\", but then think about the fact even primary school kids are forbidden from solving arguments or abuse with violence and are encouraged to seek peaceful and civil resolutions or referring to the correct authority figures. So do we have to do worse than primary school to not be considered \"pussy\"? Well you know what, I don't think people care about the buzzwords and tags given out by people who behave worse than young kiddies in primary school.","replies":[{"poster":"Fox Illusion  ","date":"2017-07-23T20:31:19.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-07-23T20:51:38.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fox Illusion  ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ly7EATN0,comment-id=0000000000020000,timestamp=2017-07-23T20:31:19.798+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Also, if someone finds your talk offensive,&quot;\n> \n> stopped right there.
