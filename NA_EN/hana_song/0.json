I have a a vertical monitor to my right where i resize the client to fit on the top half. It's just such a common windows thing that people/I already intuitively expect. Though I do admit that this brings more problems for the UX/User Experience designers; currently they just force the client to be at a constant aspect ratio and design around that one scenario. \n\nTo add to what others are suggesting; I see a problems with have a fullscreen option; it implies full immersion into that program (ie. somewhat constant entertainment). I doubt any one playing league only looks at the client from open to close. In fact the client is minimalistic; it give you the information you want and that's it. There's no 3D Urgot dancing  during queue, no collection of videos/streams, nor in-game browser for anything really (ie. custom server browser, world chat, huge community chat). \n\nHow does the UX guy deal with all the extra space when the game is fullscreened? Does the client just get bigger to fill sapce or is more space just added to elements in the design? Or does the client just get reorganized entirely when switching between fullscreen-client and minimized-client? \n\nThere is definitely a problem with the current system, people feel constrained by the resizing options for the window; but solving that problem isn't cut and dry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EbonP","date":"2017-12-28T22:42:41.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all the posts seem to be old but recently the client seems to be/or has shrunk some.
