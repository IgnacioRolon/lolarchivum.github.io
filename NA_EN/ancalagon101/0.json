Twitch {{champion:29}} . \r\n(Disclaimer: I don't particularly dislike Twitch, I realise he's a good champion in the hands of someone who can use him)\r\n\r\nIs there a way to remove a champion from my champion pool? I'm not asking for any kind of refund, just a way to remove it from my champions.\r\nYes, I am aware that I can re-roll, but I prefer to do that if the team comp is too monotonous (e.g. 5 assassins)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T22:40:14.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yeah, the frustration of getting champs you don't want in ARAM especially after rerolling.  >< Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can look into removing it for you.  Just a heads up, though, we likely wouldn't be able to offer a refund with the removal if we are able to assist.","replies":[]}]}
