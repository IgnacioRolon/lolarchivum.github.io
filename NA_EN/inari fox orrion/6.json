So far, as a support OTP, I'm not thinking I want to play ranked at all this season if the preseason is at all representative of how crappy the game state is.\r\n\r\nMy last 5 ranked losses -- the only ones I have this season -- happen to mysteriously come with an ADC who started to flame people within the first ten minutes, and two of them had been flaming since they left champ select... even if they aren't flaming me. Interesting to note, the wins I have in ranked occur when stuff like that _doesn't happen_ which in and of itself should probably indicate to people that there's something hugely wrong with how ranked is set up and balanced at this very moment. Last season, I had like 8 or 9 games where no-one on either team was bitching (**of the thousand I had, and I fuckin' counted throughout the season to compare with S8 and S7**) and this season it feels like those matches are **gone.**\r\n\r\nNow answer me this: if \"ranked\" play is seriously so fucked up that 0.8% of my games actually had, like, decent quality people within it... **AND I'M SILVER, HALFWAY TO THE CUTOFF POINT OF GOLD...** then how do you expect anyone to take it seriously? And how do you expect people **not** to randomly start trolling because the matches are incapable _of_ being taken seriously?\r\n\r\nTL; DR: When half of all games start with \"muh teamcomp I guess I'll just play Heim ADC then morons\", how do you expect people to take the game seriously? How do you expect to combat toxicity when people _won't_ take the game seriously?","replies":[{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-12-01T00:34:00.125+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say it is a matter of ADC or JG being good, but rather just being tilt-proof.  JG is a trash tier (but important) role, and ADC isn't much better.   The real question is if your JG and ADC are going to baby-rage once they get smacked around by the enemy Top or Mid. \n\nNot to mention the season just ended, so the queues are full of Elo boosted trash that don't deserve their current rank.","replies":[{"poster":"LordItchyPickle","date":"2019-12-01T01:48:00.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could be it.

If the junglers are weak and sensitive to any disruption (they are) and also so important they determine games (they do), then you need to change your play style to disruption/dragon/jg support. Think Bard and roaming supports.\n\nTo test this (again as a jungler) I went ahead and tried roaming supports, it seems...highly effective. Roaming supports that disrupt jungle are in again (IMO). You have to support/disrupt both bot and jg as support now. It's just an adaption on the support end. On the JG end, it's a nightmare. It's hard to have the game rest on you while also being the most sensitive to any disruptions. \n\nIt's also forcing people to play a very specific set of junglers, talking to other JGs we all seem to agree that it's also the most boring one dimensional set of junglers. That's why many are fleeing the JG and trying new postions (and others are getting autofilled in)\n\nI'd say that the learning curve for a traditional support player would be really high as you need a high level of JG play to disrupt it well, a JG playing AS support trying to disrupt it has an easier learning curve IMO. (which is what I did)\n\nAlso, only 44.5% are below gold, though gold IV is very heavy at 15% on its own due to people stopping there or getting carried to it and stopping. 78.5% are below Plat.\n\nP.S.
