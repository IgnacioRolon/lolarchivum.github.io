Instead of matching you with others in your division, they create teams based on a hidden nonsensical number called MMR. So while both teams will have about the same MMR, the individual MMR will vary greatly.

It can happen due to the start-of-season reset if you don't play for a period of time after the reset, for instance. It can **appear** unfair, but it is still less unfair to match people according to MMR than to match them according to Rank that do not really reflect their skills.\n* If they can't queue together, why can they be in the same match together is a very good point, but the logical answer is not that that match-making should follow Divisions, it's the other way around: queuing restrictions should be based on MMR instead. The goal of queuing restrictions is that you don't want a very good player queuing with much lower players and stomping the game, ruining it for the enemy team. That should be measured with MMR, not current Ranking.\n* Matchmake with what people can't see isn't really a necessity, but it has one nice effect: it **appears** more fair, even if it doesn't change anything in practice, so people feel better.\n\nOverall, the match-making system is already the best it can be, but I agree that MMR should be visible, to decrease complaints from players and to base queuing restrictions on it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bard Blyat Bard","date":"2017-04-26T15:49:30.273+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The MMR is, as said, bogus.

The very act of doing so makes comebacks less likely, because you're going to have to face up against the person who beat you, only now the lead they have over you is even wider. This is particularly true in the current state of the game, where a lead of one or two kills can snowball an entire lane, which can then decide the outcome of the whole match. Even when League isn't as snowbally, however, trying to come back from a losing lane is still an unpleasant and stressful experience.\n\nA major issue with snowballing right now is that Riot's been trying to compress into 20-30 minutes matches that were originally designed to take 30-45 minutes on average, and doing so by just accelerating the rate at which leads are made without altering their weight. Currently, being ahead one or two items over your opponent can mean having practically double their power, especially in the game's early stages: in more stretched-out games, where items would take longer to accrue, that would be fine, but at the game's current speed, gaining ~70 AD over your opponent, or the equivalent for any other class, during the laning phase, means you're bound to crush them without having to make all that much effort. Marksmen are especially large culprits, because their late-game curve has been shortened in such a way that they snowball like crazy off of even the slightest lead, and the combination of their AD, crit and life steal means that they become nigh-unkillable murder machines in mid game teamfights if they complete their build too quickly.\n\nOne possible alternative could simply be to reduce stats across the board, or shift them onto levels: in such a scenario, gaining a full item over you opponent wouldn't create such a rift in statistical power, even if it would still hurt. Another could instead be to massively increase shutdown gold bounties, which would alllow for more comeback potential while keeping games at a quicker pace (there'd risk being a lot of flip-flopping, though). Personally, I think it might be better to shift leads onto permanent objective captures: while towers feel pretty weak now, creating an environment in which they'd fall faster overall, while still allowing the losing team to farm and move a little farther out from their base without it being considered overextending, would allow games to remain fast-paced, while also making for fairer fights. Since tower captures are essential to winning the game, but have no impact on most combat situations, it would allow teams to make major progress without crushing as hard in teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Mayonnaise","date":"2017-04-26T04:48:20.427+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gotta disagree with the portion about Marksman.

F. Sword. Effectively, one side can already teamfight quite well, whereas the other may struggle to even survive, which is why bot lane tends to snowball even harder than most other lanes, and also ends up having the largest impact upon how the rest of the match plays out. For sure, there's still the unpleasant situation where bot lane gets 4-man ganked and one side gets completely crushed with little to no possibility for retaliation, but if bot lane wins early and starts rotating mid, the pressure they put is so intense that it can lead to their team quickly winning the mid game as well, as they make a huge difference in teamfights even at the 15-minute mark, whereas previously they had to wait about 25-30 minutes to come online.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salson","date":"2017-04-26T10:36:24.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I don't think it's ever truly healthy in a PvP game to have players gain raw power by winning fights. \"\nWhile I agree it's not healthy, it's the most satisfying thing in the game, hell maybe even gaming in general.

Increasing rewards of any kind just lead to more abrupt jumps in power and potential for further unbalanced results.\n\nThis is true, the rubber-banding might end up leading to really unstable mid and late games, so increasing shutdown gold might not be the best, but I don't think it would be good to purely reduce leads in the game's current state, as that would stretch out games past their intended window. Ultimately, the ideal goal here is to have a game that feels fair, but also ends within 30 minutes on average, and currently the tradeoff has been that Riot's method of compressing match durations has made them too one-sided as a result. I'd much rather have a game that didn't rely on snowballing off of leads as hard to end, but that might need deeper changes to happen.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=HalcyonDweller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QPFp01vN,comment-id=00070002,timestamp=2017-04-26T22:59:39.709+0000)\n> \n> So would towers get easier to kill?

Outer turrets should still provide a measure of safety in the laning phase, but I think any tower beyond that shouldn't offer protection to players, which is why them being modeled as damaging turrets is a mistake (they already don't offer much in the way of real protection in practice).","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-27T16:53:08.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK I see what you mean.

Even a FED TANK cant tower dive you in dota until late game. \n\nWith the increased size of the map, everyone can clear their wave and roam to nearby jungle camps.

I got 2/4/18, in a 38/36/37 match and an S- on Morg.\n\nWhy did I type all that?\n\nRito wont fix these one sided stomps because they do it on purpose. For every match thats close I think \"OK thats what match making should look like.\" Then for every match that is an ROFL stomp where we win way too easy I know Im going to have to support a Gangplank ADC, or a Soraka jungler, or my favorite BS troll nonsense so far...\n\nFull tank {{champion:45}} \n\nYeah. Had an assclown on my team building full tank Vig. mid. We lost. I mean at one point they picked up in damage, but well after they fed an enemy Yasuo and that Yasuo went ham on the rest of it making any contribution too damn late.\n\nSo where did tank vig come from? Ritos match making forcing a 50% win rate.\n\nIts my belief that Ritos match making actively tries to stop winning streaks by injecting trolls, toxic ragers, and morons into your games. Those onesided stomps are part of this match making scheme. They match up people winning with people losing against people winning... till they decide to turn the tables and match up the previous winners with people on a losing streak.\n\nSo that Morg match I mentioned, that was supposed to be a loss... One of those people in the lobby was threatening to run down mid if anyone picked certain champions... The other one giving me shit went 3/11/9. Rito gave me the shittest odds they could with toxic ragers on my team that threaten to feed based on allied champ picks, and a feeder, while still having the MMRs be close enough to make it not a total joke.\n\nWhy do this? Some people want to climb as high as they can; for some that stops at gold for the rewards. Riot, like any F2P game company, wants you playing. If youre not playing youre not invested. If youre not invested, youre less likely to spend $$$.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nYoure in a van on a road trip. The van was provided for free, along with gas and meals. But while driving youre subjected to advertisements. The more advertisements you see the more likely you are to buy one of those things you see. Those ads are provided by the same people who provide the van... Dont act surprised when the road trip takes 3 times longer than you expected because of all sorts of mysterious roadblocks and strange mechanical failures. Thats all to increase the ad time. They want you to stay in that van as long as possible.\n\nTLDR; Rito creates lopsided ROFL stomps as part of their forced 50% winrate match making system. Dont expect them to fix a system they put in place thats part of their method of $$$ making.","replies":[{"poster":"Cavesloth","date":"2017-04-26T04:59:05.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Rito gimping you after a win 100 percent.
