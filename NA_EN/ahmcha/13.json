Why don&#039;t they burn? What are they made of? Why does he tie belts around the thighs? \r\n\r\nFor 4 years....4 GODDAMN YEARS I have tried to ignore this, ever since I saw his splash for the first time, but the thought has always been there, gnawing, eating away at my sanity. \r\n\r\n&quot;You&#039;re overreacting, they obviously can&#039;t show his fiery micropenis in the game&quot; \r\n\r\nHe&#039;s not even a fucking person, he&#039;s a flame spirit or some shit, you could just make him genderless, but no....you just had to give him pants. You know what pants mean? It means there&#039;s something there to begin with, and I have had to live with that knowledge for 4 GODDAMNED YEARS. The knowledge that something is under there...watching....waiting. And I can&#039;t take it anymore, I can&#039;t be the only one who bears this curse. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry you have to bear this burden with me, but it&#039;s time Riot tell us the truth. Why does Brand need pants? What is he hiding? Do we even want to know? I demand answers after all this time, I&#039;ve suffered in silence enough.","replies":[{"poster":"swanington","date":"2018-02-02T18:10:01.099+0000","up_votes":126,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does anyone wear pants?\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"SomeStars","date":"2018-02-02T18:19:50.386+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":0,"body":"now this is a real question \n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Fury","date":"2018-02-02T23:20:07.729+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/Itsmrpantsboxart.jpg/220px-Itsmrpantsboxart.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-02-03T20:45:28.834+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asking the real questions right here.","replies":[{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2018-02-03T22:59:27.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that wasn't intentional, but still funny from my perspective:\n[https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/xvl8ONIk-i-think-its-time-to-ask-the-real-questions](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/xvl8ONIk-i-think-its-time-to-ask-the-real-questions)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2018-02-02T18:53:58.885+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"not kogmaw :3","replies":[{"poster":"Kirbanator","date":"2018-02-02T21:25:59.072+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"amen to koggy nudity","replies":[]},{"poster":"StainlessTweedle","date":"2018-02-03T10:34:07.462+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/giw2DyRmAak?t=227","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yordanik","date":"2018-02-03T09:20:10.043+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=swanington,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=9lEk9IpB,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-02-02T18:10:01.099+0000)\n>\n> Why does anyone wear pants?\n> \n> {{sticker:sg-janna}}\n\nWhy do women wear bras \n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saewin","date":"2018-02-03T16:07:50.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Less prominent female developers often have trouble correctly coding their own jiggle physics.
