It's not a ''free'' game for Riot, they're making millions out of it. And the players are the reason they make money, you have EVERY SINGLE RIGHT to tell them to stop whatever they're doing. A musician doesn't go out on a stage and tell their fans to fuck themselves just because he's throwing a free concert, if the concert is shit everyone is gonna leave, it's simple as that. Does it go through your head? Also, I spent more money on this game than I spent on pay to play games, so I helped this game more than other games, because I used to be dumb. Oh wait, no one forced me to do it right? I'm not supposed to be entitled not like I'm helping Riot make their game better. Like, you'd see kickstarter developers thanking with their everything to their consumers instead of seeing things like ''no one forced you to back me, fuck off''. But MORONS would like to think League of Legends is a ''free'' game that doesn't need our money, our time, our patience for these megalomaniac developers. I've been soo dissatisfied with Riot in the past months, I stopped purchasing RP for a year. And now I'm not gonna touch blind pick 'till they bring Normal Draft back. They can shove their business up their asses. There are way better alternatives to this shit that actually have developers that doesn't want to screw everyone over. Every developer is trying to innovate and Riot is doing the OPPOSITE! We're going back to times when people HAD to play Blind Pick, this is beyond stupidity.
