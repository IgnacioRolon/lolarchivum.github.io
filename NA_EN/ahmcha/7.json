{"poster":"AhmCha","date":"2017-05-08T18:31:13.573+0000","title":"After living through five of these, I think I can safely say that class updates don't work","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":186,"down_votes":38,"body":"Important Disclaimer: I know nothing and all of this is just one idiot&#039;s opinion, proceed with caution. \n\nEvery single one of these has sent the game into a spiraling clusterfuck for the next several patches, and in many cases has left the champions that they attempted to fix worse off than before ({{champion:90}}{{champion:42}}{{champion:7}}{{champion:107}} and now possibly {{champion:154}} and {{champion:57}}...also some would argue{{champion:35}}. Additionally, I&#039;m gonna take a shot in the dark and say that {{champion:113}} is gonna join this club in the near future....again, making the tank update an 0 for 3. Oh and once in a blue moon I see threads about {{champion:82}} but I&#039;m sure he&#039;s fine). Then when things finally stabilize, you put out another one and the same cycle repeats itself. I don&#039;t mind big changes to the game, but shoving in these changes that no one actually asked for isn&#039;t a good way to do it. \n\nCredit where credits due, not all of these are bad, and a handful of champion reworks actually turn out pretty great, {{champion:122}}{{champion:55}} and {{champion:8}} being a few examples (I know people have mixed feelings on Vlad, but I really liked his rework and as of now, it&#039;s pretty balanced imo). At the same time, the majority of them feel unnecessary or shoved in the wrong direction. For example, why did {{champion:154}} and {{champion:161}} get reworked? No one asked for this, before the MYMU everyone looked at {{champion:161}} and thought &quot;balanced.&quot; Do you know how rare that is? For a group of League of Legends players to look at a champion and AGREE that the champion is fine and doesn&#039;t need and major changes? So why the friggity frack did you go and add major changes to him then? And {{champion:154}}? ~~You literally say in the midseason update page, granted in different words, &quot;Zac doesn&#039;t really need changes.&quot; In fact let me go and find the quote real quick...ah here it is: &quot;In terms of unique skillset and a rewarding path to mastery, Zac was in the best spot to start with.&quot; You admit that he&#039;s in a good spot and then decide, let&#039;s change that for no real reason. ~~ (As a commenter pointed out, I misinterpreted this quote from Riot. I was attempting to show that Zac was in a fine spot and did not really need a rework, but misquoting people isn't the way to go about that.) Yeah, that turned out great. I&#039;m not even gonna get into items and objectives because my dumb bronze ass is already overstepping his boundaries by acting like he knows a lot about what goes into these. Although, I will say that personally I like more items because I think allowing variance in build paths allows skill by showing who can adapt to the needs of the current game the best, but that&#039;s just me. \n\nThe reason I&#039;m even bothering to make this post is because there&#039;s a strong possibility that the next class update is going to be Divers. Divers are my favorite class in League, and I&#039;m really worried that the potential changes are gonna fuck them over. I&#039;m really concerned about the fates of {{champion:62}}, {{champion:254}}, {{champion:58}}, etc. Before you do another one of these, please fundamentally rethink the way you approach them, because as one of the many who has sat through all five of the previous ones, I can tell you that they do more harm to the game than good. Whatever lead to the {{champion:122}} and {{champion:55}} changes, follow that line of thinking and not the...{{champion:90}} one. Please. He wasn&#039;t a minionmancer, no one wanted him as a minionmancer, just because some dude built him AD and jungled doesn&#039;t mean anyone wanted him to be a minionmancer, fuck why do you do this to me? FUCK YOU. I&#039;m sorry, I lost my temper. \n\nAlso {{champion:104}} is a jungler...{{champion:104}} is a FUCKING JUNGLER, goddamn you already make playing ADC like getting tested for syphilis and then you turn the one AD I like into a jungler, who outjungles the Marksman that&#039;s meant to jungle (btw I&#039;m talking about {{champion:203}} in case you forgot they exist, fuck I wouldn&#039;t blame ya). Fuck it, resident Krug feeder out. \n\nEDIT: I feel as though I should clarify something. I am speaking primarily of the class updates to champions. In regards to itemization I have very few issues except with the changes to {{item:3068}} and possibly {{item:3046}}. I am of the opinion that more items for more situations is a very good thing for this game to have.

I believe his new kit is fun, but so weak it's impossible to enjoy. If it was balanced, I think it would be fun unlike Mordekaiser, Malzahar, and Kog'Maw (even though Kog'Maw's was pretty fun, it just limited design). I'd say once Zac and maybe Maokai get buffed a little and Sej nerfed a little, the reworks will have been an overall decent success unless some unforeseen problem arises from their strengths.\n\nThe real issue here with the Tank Update is Riot's unwillingness to preemptively throw out balance changes to champions who would clearly suffer from the changes (aka champions that relied a ton on health scaling). If Riot had done a little bit of that, this would have went more smoothly over all. Overall, however, Class Updates have had a tough time being appreciated. If the Tank Update doesn't turn out well by the middle or end of 7.11, I think Riot needs to step back and look at how they do Class Updates. Luckily, I would say that there are only one or two arguably classes in LoL that could be argued to need a class update, being Divers and Supports/Enchanters. Otherwise, I think the rest of the champions are due for VGUs. Even if Class Updates are overall frustrating, we have 2 at max left to get through.\n\nAlso, while I don't test EVERY patch, there are some PBE testers that I have played with on the PBE who are clearly only doing it to try out skins and such for their favorite champion. We need better testers as well as better response from Riot for balance on the PBE. During this patch's PBE testing, I played three games straight where neither Maokai, Sejuani, or Zac were picked by anyone but me. In fact, majority of the players weren't even picking Tanks.

In the past when Riot Games did a Class Update, the entire game was one sided and everything was broken. I think the Assasin and Tank update were successful . . . and people are overreacting. Sure Lethality was being abused but it didn't take them 6 to 7 months to fix it like they did with the ADC update . . . that took 6 to 7 months to balance. The ADC update was a nightmare and really ruined the game. Riot Games obviously learned from it and tried to do better with the Mage update . . . . but they didn't really accomplish the level of gameplay the Tank and Assasin update did. Do you want to know the reason why? They didn't' work on 6 champions in one Class Update . . . ., actually listened to player feedback, and really honed in on who the champions are. Kat, Talon, Sej, Zac, and Maokai all play better to me . . . . .\n\nThese Class Updates are meant to be for champions that need gameplay and thematic changes . . . and not VGU. Unfortunately, Riot Games ruined a lot of champions in the process of trying to learn how to approach Class Updates. It now seems like they have a firm understanding of how to approach Class Updates now. It sucks that specific champions are being ignored and were changed so much that now they need a VGU to correct mistakes . . . . Riot Games made . . . . . and push back.\n\n----------------\n\nRyze will probably get another VGU before anyone else. As players have been telling these Developers for years . . . they don't do enough VGU a year. League of Legends has too many champions to keep up with now with balancing, kit changes, and if that new champion is in the meta now. Look at Kalista, Azir, Reksai, and other newer champions. They all need balancing, changes to their kit, updates . . . and more . . . . Every time they add a new champion and need to do this level of work on them, it takes months and sometimes years to get it accomplished and that is work being taken away from a champion that has been waiting for years to get that work done on them. These Developers just don't understand this and they don't care.\n\nRiot Games needs to stop making champions for the next few years . . . or just do one a year . . . and really Dedicate themselves to bringing this world and champions to life and updated. I mean for Christ sake . . . . . Ryze had four updates the past couple years and it is all a waste of time that could have been spent on someone else and making them better. Instead they wasted time on a champion that is a time guzzler.","replies":[]}]}
