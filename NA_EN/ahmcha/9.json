He has 3/4 the kit of a mage, and then a passive, ult, attack range, and base stats of a tank. He's intended to combat AP champs and be the \"MR tank,\" but Galio doesn't have anything remotely tanky about his kit that can swing team fights in his favor, other than the ult. His kit is an incohesive mess that's trying to push him in too many directions while missing the goal entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-01-03T18:39:47.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Plus, his ult doesn't exactly scream \"anti-mage\".
