In one game one of the guys called everyone on our team a \"ni**er\" in the post game chat for no reason. he won the game. his team went on about how we left the base undefended and we were noobs when 3 ad champions tp'd to a minion when we only had 1 tower left and the nexus.\n\nThis is completely ridiculous. and this shit happened in the blood moon event as well and yet i haven't seen a single instant feedback response in my client yet.
