That seems like I'm being a grammar nazi but saying 1k AP damage makes it sound like she has a thousand ability power to do damage with her ult. Which would do less than 1k damage actually, since her ult has a 75% AP scaling. So what you're meaning to say is that her combo can do 1k magic damage, not just her ult. Which is totally accurate! Just clarifying. \n\nAnyway, her Q is one of the easiest spells to dodge in the game. You can usually land them in the confusion of teamfights as long as you aren't the initiator, which lets you set up the ult + TLDs + passive damage, and a lich bane auto for the proc of sheen and your passive again to deal insane burst damage. But in a 1v1 there's just no way you're landing that Q. \n\nWhat I usually do is throw the E out when we're close; since it's a slow, it makes it easier to land the Q. And since they want to get out of the zone to avoid damage, they run in one direction, setting up an easy Q hit. So you E, Q, AA, E detonate, ult, AA. That's the ideal combo but it's not always possible against a mobile enemy, in which case you settle for just the E, Q, ult, E detonate. \n\nSince outside of that combo she is completely and utterly useless, aka gated by CDs, she relies on using that combo to win fights. Against a tank that combo won't be enough. It'll take them down to maybe half HP if you're fed. Tanks beat burst mages, that's just the rock-paper-scissors aspect of how Riot designed the game.
