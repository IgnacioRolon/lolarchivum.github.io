Yes, Rek'sai has been fairly prominent in the competitive scene....but that is all she is since she is a fairly lackluster champion in anything below Diamond due to her constantly getting nerfed due to the competitve scene being able to utilize her entire kit via communication. 90% of the player base is below plat and only (I think) 50% are above gold which means well over 75% of the players getting this skin aren't going to be able to utilize the champion very well and thus don't really care if they get it outside of \"Well at least I get a free 6300 IP champion if I don't own her?\"\n\nThe previous Victorious Skins (Sivir, Morgana, Elise, Jarvan, Janna) have all been prominent champions in their respective seasons, but have also been fairly easy champions (barring maybe Elise). Also, another thing to consider is pickrate in regular games as well where Rek'sai hasn't really passed 10% pickrate in a loooong time in dynamic queue. Most of these champions that got the Victorious skin had a fairly large pickrate in their respective seasons (Sivir being THE ADC for most of the season, Morgana being tier 0 support when they first implemented the spellthief's line, Elise being pick/ban with Lee Sin, etc.).\n\nThe more likely candidate would be something like Gangplank, Jhin/Ashe, Karma, or even Braum who have all been fairly strong for the last half of the season and have been VERY high in the pick/ban rate. Viktor would also make the most sense for mid lane since he was THE mid laner for like 5 patches after the MYMU.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-09-08T19:46:36.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}}  vs {{champion:59}} \n{{champion:102}} vs{{champion:60}} \n{{champion:238}} vs ???     most likely one of these {{champion:112}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:90}} \n{{champion:429}} vs{{champion:15}} \n{{champion:412}} vs{{champion:40}}","replies":[{"poster":"FakeGravity","date":"2016-09-08T22:13:56.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so {{champion:25}} never existed?","replies":[{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-09-09T01:56:06.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're right im boosted i forgot about morg XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I7A6X2v2","date":"2016-09-08T19:40:19.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is getting the victorious skin ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JMoormann","date":"2016-09-08T15:34:13.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We will get Vikturgotious of course\n\n{{champion:6}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2016-09-07T18:13:45.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a mid Silver Viktor main with all(3) of his skins.
