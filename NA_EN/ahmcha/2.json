To translate that: you sound like an asshole. I personally didn&#039;t mind autofill (past tense because I uninstalled and won&#039;t reinstall until the game is less snowbally), but after season 6 people got used to being able to queue up for two roles and get one of those two roles. It&#039;s difficult to go back to a worse standard of queuing (or anything) when you had a superior version for a while, that&#039;s human nature. \r\n\r\nLook I get it, people should be able to play all five roles I guess, but League is a time commitment, and some people just don&#039;t have the time to learn all of those roles and their different patterns and nuances. They shouldn&#039;t be penalized for having other shit to do. \r\n\r\nI know this isn&#039;t gonna really change anyone&#039;s mind, but next time you wanna make fun of people for their dissatisfaction with autofill, maybe put down the &#039;Member berries, and realize that this isn&#039;t season 4 anymore, it&#039;s season 7 and it&#039;s ok for people to hold the queues to the standard that season 6 set as far as actual champ select was concerned.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-01-24T08:41:06.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I Feed Krugs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PoeyO4so,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-01-24T06:10:39.672+0000)\n>\n> Look I get it, people should be able to play all five roles I guess, but League is a time commitment, and some people just don&amp;#039;t have the time to learn all of those roles and their different patterns and nuances.

A system where everyone has to deal with all roles equally should still place people at around the same MMR compared to a system where everyone only has to learn two roles because everyone has to deal with it.\n\nSay you put in enough hours to be gold MMR on average for two roles. The system changes so you have to spread your time across all 5 roles? That number of hours across all 5 roles still should average out to gold MMR because ALL players have to deal with all five roles. The other players on the server do not magically get an extra 20 hours per week to play League just because autofill turned on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-01-24T08:06:31.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 inches of snow is not a big deal.
