Let&#039;s take the removal of the wolf smite that warned of invaders to the blue side jungle, against invading champions that was the optimal defense because it could essentially scare them off. If they were persistent and didn&#039;t leave the entire team could collapse on them. Against a champion whose location is difficult to ascertain without optimal vision, that buff was invaluable. I guess my main concern is that this new system will make getting reliable vision of stealthy champions much more frustrating. If I recall the updates from the assassin rework correctly, Evelynn will still be made visible by pink wards because her form of stealth is referred to as invisibility, but I just wonder if there&#039;s going to be anymore vision optimization to prevent jungling from becoming overwhelmingly frustrating?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-13T19:37:44.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pink wards will only fail against combat stealth - rengar R, shaco troll, ect.\n\nStuff like eve, teemo will still be picked up on stealth wards as normal, it was made pretty clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-10-13T19:17:10.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't a problem in higher ELO when everyone maintains a pink on the map at all times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-13T19:09:50.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably because of the heavy stealth rework.
