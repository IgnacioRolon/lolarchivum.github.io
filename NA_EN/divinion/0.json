I never requested to transfer my account to a different server and want it to be stopped immediately.  What the hell do I do to get time sensitive help?  I may not play much anymore, but I spent quite a bit on RP in the past on my account and I do not want to just up and lose it because someone, somehow, got access to my account, even though it should be damn near impossible (have a diff password for every game I play and never use the same one twice.)","replies":[{"poster":"Divinion","date":"2017-01-09T03:26:34.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question for you.  HOW can someone possibly access my account, change the account name, transfer my account to another server, all without being stopped by verification emails?  I never received any emails about password resets (except for when I requested one yesterday, and did change my password).  Riot's security is extremely outdated if there are not email confirmations for things like transfers and account name changes, as these are big red flags for theft of accounts.\n\nI know the name that my account is currently showing as, as I got an email saying that my account is now banned.  How can someone change these things without verification?  Or even the new password, as I changed the password very quickly, and the password change went through.\n\n> noreply@riotgames.com\n> 9:48 PM (37 minutes ago)\n> \n> to me \n> Greetings deft6666,\n> \n> Actions that have been performed on your account are in violation of the League of Legends Terms of Use.
