Like I mentioned in the title, my game will not get past the load screen.  I can log in no problem, pick a champ, and it goes to the load screen showing all the champs, but I have no ping.  Everyone will sit at 0% forever.  I contacted Riot.  They suggested I run the Hextech repair- it kept telling me league was not installed in the primary C: drive?  So I uninstalled and reinstalled- same problem.  I'm installing where the program recommends so I dunno what the issue is there. \r\n So the Hextech repair tool will not work properly, League won't work properly- I have no idea what is wrong with my computer.  I am absolute dunce at computer stuff. \r\nIt ticks me off because I have had a similar problem in the past, and my ex knew exactly what to do.  I wanna play league so badly I'm half tempted to text him and see what he did.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T01:10:24.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked into your ticket for more context, and it looks like that agent was trying to get some logs from the HRT to see what exactly was going on. No worries if it's still not working for you, we can use [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) to grab those logs manually. \n\nScroll down to the steps on League Logs and have those ready. After you have those logs, go back to your ticket (or open a new one) and attach those logs so the techs have more info to work with ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
