Riot said that the changes were in order to give her incentive to stay in the fight, but her W already provided that incentive, since it was a large part of her damage and it was a 4 second DoT.  What's more, with 40% CDR, you could actually cast your W pretty much as soon as the DoT finished.  Combined with an Iceborn and a Sunfire, you were dealing some serious sustained damage.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Riot was trying to switch a lot of Sej's sustained damage to permafrost, which would be great if there wasn't the delay on reapplying frost.  As it stands, though, Having a 3.6 second CD on won't do you much good.\r\n\r\nPermafrost has a 1.5 second duration and then targets have immunity to frost for 3 seconds.  That means 4.5 seconds minimum.  Probably more like 5 or 6 when you figure in having to actually reapply frost and then cast permafrost.  So unless Riot is trying to tell a tank not to build CDR, that doesn't make much sense.  And they nerfed the slow duration, so really a net nerf on her CC in fights.  With old Sej's 2.5 second slow, the CD with max CDR was 6.6 seconds, which worked out nicely with the frost reapplication CD and provided a strong CC presence.\r\n\r\nRiot, any explanation on these changes?  I'm failing to see the buffs here... am I missing something?","replies":[{"poster":"Gaminon","date":"2014-12-14T21:16:51.856+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turns out they changed permafrost so that there's no cooldown on the reapplication of frost.

damage with W while missing two ticks of of the aoe damage. Some things to keep in mind.\n\n* we are going to assume level 9 so you have the ability maxed\n* we are going to assume you have at least juggernaut and giant belt because you should have about that much at level 9.\n* you have 0 ap because you are tanking\n* we are ignoring magic resist\n\nI saw that you said maxing Q is better for farming so i'll show you why it's not. \n\n* I'd say the average health of the big minion at each camp is around 1800 health. \n* The base damage of arctic assault is 160 at level 5 with doing 12% of targets maximum health. \n* 12% of 1800 is 216 + 160 base damage is **376**. \n\n* When you max flail first you are doing a base damage of 120 when you hit the target as well as an additional 60 + 2.5% bonus health (22) per tick with a total of 4 ticks. \n* Jungle creeps aren't going to run away from you so you will hit all 4 ticks \n* The total damage you are going to do is 120+4(82)=**448** \n* So according to \"math\" maxing flail is better then maxing arctic assault. \n* The cooldown and mana cost of flail are MUCH lower than that of arctic assault\n\nYour next point was that maxing permafrost does more damage than maxing flail. \n\n* Permafrost does 260 damage. \n* The full damage that W does is shown above, 448 damage. Much more than that of permafrost. \n* lets say you miss 2 ticks of flail, you are still doing 284 damage.\n\n---\n\nKeep in mind before you say something like you can't stay in range for her flail to be useful, \n\n* her ultimate is a 1.25 second stun and there is an additional .75 second slow. \n* Arctic assault knocks you in the air for about 1 second.\n* permafrost slows you for about 1.5 seconds.\n* That totals 4.5 seconds of crowd control to land an auto attack and ticks of the flail. \n* Again, you can miss 2 ticks of flail to do more damage than permafrost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MattAkhavan","date":"2014-12-15T23:50:29.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it only takes 7 seconds for flail to be off cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ecchi Gorira","date":"2014-12-15T22:56:34.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree pre-nerf it was more beneficial to max E first and W last but that doesn't really matter now.

That means 4.5 seconds minimum.  Probably more like 5 or 6 when you figure in having to actually reapply frost and then cast permafrost.  So unless Riot is trying to tell a tank not to build CDR, that doesn't make much sense.  And they nerfed the slow duration, so really a net nerf on her CC in fights.  With old Sej's 2.5 second slow, the CD with max CDR was 6.6 seconds, which worked out nicely with the frost reapplication CD and provided a strong CC presence.\n> \n> Riot, any explanation on these changes?
