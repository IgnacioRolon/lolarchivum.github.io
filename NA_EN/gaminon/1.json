In the end, all we're doing is hurting ourselves and the game that we love.\r\n\r\nBut are we asking for it with the art in League?  Well, let's look at why Riot might put splashes like [this ](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120912044527/leagueoflegends/images/thumb/a/a5/Morgana_OriginalSkin.jpg/613x460x2-Morgana_OriginalSkin.png)in their game, lack of armor and all.\r\n\r\n**Character Design is a Thing**\r\n\r\nPart of having a league of 100+ champs is that they have to each be distinct and unique.  If you were to cover every champ in fully functional, protective armor, you'd end up with the 100+ Mordekaisers slugging it out.  \r\n\r\nEve dresses like a dominatrix because she's basically a half step down from a succubus.  Shaco doesn't wear armor because he's a psychotic demon *jester*, not a psychotic demon *knight*.  Veigar is, well... he's a final fantasy black mage with a height complex and a wardrobe change, and black mages wear robes and have pointy hats.  If you covered all those characters in a layer of steel because what they're wearing wouldn't protect them, those characters' themes would be destroyed, and League would be a worse game for it.\r\n\r\n**You're 500 Feet in the Air**\r\n\r\nThe issue of character design is compounded when you think about perspective.  As a player, you're basically floating 500 feet above the battlefield.  Most details are not visible at that height.\r\n\r\nFor weapons to be distinct, they have to be *gigantic* (see: Riven).  In order for female champs to appear female, they have to be petite, busty, or have long hair (or if that female character is in full armor (Kayle), she has to have decidedly anti-functional boob armor).  In order for male champs to appear male, they need ridiculous muscle definition or five foot wide shoulders.\r\n\r\nSo since the splash art and the game model are supposed to match, the splash art needs to be exaggerated because of the requirements of the game models.\r\n\r\n**Larger Than Life**\r\n\r\nBut really, we all know that the true reason for the busty, bootylicious splash art is that sex sells, right?  Well yeah, there's no arguing that sex DOES sell, but let's look closer.  League of Legends is a game about... well, *legends*.  Characters that are larger than life.\r\n\r\nIn \"real\" life, physical traits that lend themselves to combat are not typically attractive in the feminine sense.  If you want an example of a fantasy female warrior who is more constrained by these \"real world\" limitations, go look at [Brienne of Tarth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth#mediaviewer/File:Brienneoftarth.jpg).  However, when you want to make a female warrior who's larger than life, what better way to do so than to make them a deadly fighter AND attractive?  This combination immediately pushes them into the extraordinary category, even when you're already working in a fantasy world.\r\n\r\nAnd before you cry \"stereotypes\" and \"misogyny\", realize that Riot does the exact same thing with their masculine characters.  Ryze has a physique that makes most professional athletes look like wimps.  Brand has muscles where I'm pretty sure the human body doesn't even have muscles.  Mad Scientist Singed has pectorals four times the size of his own head.\r\n\r\nThese champs are mages and scientists.  Typically those types of characters are brainy but weak.  But remember [Ryze running from Nocturne](http://youtu.be/tEnsqpThaFg?t=1m9s) in A Twist of Fate?  Instead of making Ryze a dusty old man who hasn't gotten out in years, Riot made him into a parkour-ing, tough as nails badass.  Oh yeah, and he can melt your face off with magic.  It's almost like he belongs in some sort of LEAGUE for people who are LEGENDS or something...\r\n\r\nSo with both male and female champs, Riot adds physical traits (like beauty or raw physicality) to the characters to make them really stand out as someone incredible.\r\n\r\n**Wrapping it Up**\r\n\r\nIt's easy to glance at splash art and roll your eyes because \"omg Rito just loves the bewbs\", but before you start complaining or pointing fingers at the game, think over the goals and constraints tied to the creation of splash art and really try to figure out what will make League the best game it can be.","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-10-22T11:18:51.599+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"A hundred Mordekaiser's running around would be hillarious, what you saying?\n\nHuehuehue brazil","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-10-22T15:35:57.562+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"speaking of, omgf did u guise c da bewbie armer on Mordekaiser? #bootylicious #sexsells #huehuehue\n\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1&image_host=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freecodesource.com%2Fwallpaper%2Fmordekaiserlol-755349.jpeg&u=http://www.wallpaper4me.com/images/wallpapers/mordekaiserlol-755349.jpeg","replies":[{"poster":"Rortarion","date":"2014-10-22T19:20:17.158+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is important.

She's literally covered head to toe in armor. The first issue I have with the whole Kayle splash discussion is the ridiculous hyperbole. All that's happened is that there is an extra plate of armor added *on top of* the breast of her existing armor (which, by the way, there *is* definition around her breasts in the original splash *and* the in game model) http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140407150655/leagueoflegends/images/thumb/3/3e/Kayle_Render.png/215px-Kayle_Render.png\n\n>I wouldn't expect her as a character to pay much attention to her appearance or be overly concerned with how people perceive her gender, and thus dislike that she's now displayed as wearing armor that is exclusively useful for doing those two things.\n\nSecond issue is people applying their own head-canon to who Kayle is. Here is the first section on her lore:\n\n>In a world far away where an ancient war still rages, Kayle was a great heroine - the strongest of an immortal race committed to destroying evil wherever it could be found. For ten thousand years, Kayle fought tirelessly for her people, wielding her flaming sword forged before time itself. She shielded her delicate features beneath her enchanted armor, the sole remaining masterpiece of an extinct race of craftsmen. Though a beautiful, striking creature, Kayle, now as then, avoids showing her face; war has taken a terrible toll upon her spirit.\n\nNotice a few things:\n\n1. The mentions to Kayle's \"delicate features\" and \"beauty\".\n2. Her *enchanted* armor, forged by master craftsmen\n3. Her sword, \"forged before time itself\"\n\nAs you said, there's nothing to suggest that Kayle pays particular attention to her appearance; likewise there is nothing to suggest that she wants to hide the fact that she is female; she only hides her face because \"war has taken a terrible toll on her *spirit*\". It has nothing to do with her sex.\n\nIt can be reasonably assumed that Kayle's armor was not forged by her; being immortal, it is possible that the armor was forged specifically for her, or, as her sword was forged \"before time itself\", it can be seen as an heirloom given to her, or forged specifically for her. Either way, the master craftsmen were forging a suit of armor for a female, an *angel*, no less, that is designed to fit someone with \"delicate features\", you'd expect something like that to be incredibly detailed and ornate, as oppose to strictly utilitarian. Moreover, the armor is enchanted, meaning much of the protection it offers doesn't come from the structural qualities of the armor itself (although I can dispute that the armor is as impractical as everyone seems to believe), rather the enchantments the armor holds; it can afford to be more decorative. Kayle herself has a spell that makes her *invulnerable*, I doubt someone with that kind of power is going to rely on plain gold plate armor for protection.\n\nLets draw a comparison: Brienne of Tarth. Personality wise, the characters are fairly similar; they don't make too much of their sex, and they certainly are powerful warriors. Brienne, however, lives in a world where 1. she relies on the physical properties of her armor to protect her, and 2. female fighters are not respected. I sincerely doubt that Kayle faces that kind of prejudice in her world, especially given that she's an angel; it's not uncommon for a female to be an angel. In Brienne's world, she has to prove that she can fight *as a man*, where Kayle doesn't; there is nothing in Kayle's lore that suggests her sex was ever an issue for her.\n\nend of part 1","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-10-22T23:25:18.793+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">Since when is Kayle's splash art showing \"egregious cleavage\"?

They occupy space. Kayle's current model, however, doesn't actually show any cleavage - the breast plate forms a flat surface between the peaks of her breasts. The new splash art retcons this and basically replaces her metal sweatshirt with a metal cat suit.\n\n>(although I can dispute that the armor is as impractical as everyone seems to believe)\n\nI'd love to hear it.\n\nRegardless, it seems peculiar to me that, if someone was completely unbound by practicality, they would elect to wear otherwise functional armor that showcased their boobs. If the form of their armor has any sort of impact, I can't imagine that Kayle would see male attention as worth the increased injury - if the form is irrelevant, I'd imagine that she'd prefer something more comfortable and less noisy than full plate.

This is depicted both in the old splash art, and the new splash art; there is no flat/continuous surface, there never was. An example of a continuous breastplate is Championship Shyvana, where Kayle's breastplate has never looked like this, and presumably was never intended to. The reason there aren't as many polygons in the in game model to depict this texture change is likely due to technological constraints when the model was first developed (I'm assuming the model was simplified for better performance).\n\n>I'd love to hear it.\n\nIf you look carefully at the new splash armor, you'll notice that no armor was actually removed or replaced; her old breastplate is still continuous under her additional breastplates; more armor was *added*. Assuming that Kayle relies on the physical structure of her armor to provide protection (which I have discussed in my first comment), extra plates would actually distribute force from an impact. A single continuous piece of armor is actually very prone to weakness, once the initial structure has been compromised (ie. a crack), the rest of the piece is now far weaker. In armor with multiple plates, if a plate is damaged, the other plates are still structurally sound, and because Kayle has a full chestpiece under her additional plates, she is even more protected than she was before. You can see this principle in modern body armors as well, how single ceramic plate armor is far weaker than, say DragonSkin body armor.\n\n~~Your next paragraph presumes that her new armor is less functional, which I have just addressed, so I won't talk about your comments unless you have an actual counterargument.~~\n\n>I have absolutely no idea who you're talking about.\n\nThis wasn't so much directed specifically at you so much as other people complaining about Kayle; Brienne is a character they would often compare Kayle to, I made the comparison as a counterexample for anyone else who read my comment.\n\nEDIT: I noticed something about your other paragraph that I'll mention here.\n\n>I can't imagine that Kayle would see male attention as worth the increased injury\n\nYou seem to be making a very dangerous assumption that the form of Kayle's armor is designed to attract male attention. Which is to say, if a dress or attire is suggestive of the female figure, then it is meant to attract male attention. Which is to say, if a female dresses in a way that suggests that she is female, then she is trying to attract male attention. It's a bit of a slippery slope argument, but I've seen this many, many times before, and it usually ends in the result that a woman's purpose is male gratification. I'm positive that this is not the argument you're trying to make; I just want to make you aware that I see a very thin line we're walking here. \n\nEDIT2: I remember why I mentioned Brienne of Tarth: she's mentioned in the original post.","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-10-23T00:57:26.418+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">If you look carefully at the new splash armor, you'll notice that no armor was actually removed or replaced; her old breastplate is still continuous under her additional breastplates; more armor was added.

You have two options - you may either turn your shoulder to him, hoping to somewhat deflect the force, or you may attempt to hug him.\n\nBoob plate is the 'hug him' option in this example - even if the breastplate beneath it remains identical structurally, the boob plate will shunt any oncoming objects directly into your body center, which tends to be bad for your health when the oncoming objects are metal and pointy. Where yeah, whether you hug the guy or not, it's still your body that's being collided with, but it's a question of which part of your body is taking the brunt of the force - your side, or your solar plexus.\n\nI would expect to see historical examples of boob plate if simply tacking some metal jugs onto armor actually offered any additional protection.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-10-23T01:34:51.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with your analysis of boob-plates, I never had an issue with that; I don't think this applies to Kayle's armor. Look carefully at her new splash; she still has the diamond plate in the center of her chest to deflect blows away. The chestpiece as a whole is still convex, it isn't like other boob-plate armor which directs blows to the center of her chest.\n\nThe only point of contention I see is that there is a gap between the extra breastplate and the main breastplate. Given the structure of the centerpiece and the plates themselves, it seems more likely that blows to this area would be directed upwards or downwards from the point of impact, not to mention the initial impact would absorb much of the force behind the blow; even if there was an incredibly precise thrust attack that lodged itself between the plates, the thickness of the main breastplate is substantial, and would likely not pierce the plate. Moreover, this would trap the opponent's weapon, making it a simple matter of turning your body to disarm your opponent. And, of course, this is all assuming that this armor is meant to take blunt force directly; this isn't even taking into account that it is enchanted, which makes it even less likely that the armor could be pierced by blunt force alone. I don't find it difficult to imagine that the enchantments create a more rounded barrier that is unseen, sort of like how Kayle's ult is a perfect sphere. Couple this with the fact that Kayle seldom fights at close range, and is quite adept at kiting enemies (between her slow and self movement speed buff).\n\nI agree that Kayle's armor isn't as utilitarian as it could be, but considering the fact that this is master-craftsman-enchanted-armor-for-an-angel-that-can-make-herself-invulnerable, I don't think it's hard to imagine that it might look a bit more ceremonial than strictly tailored for hard, direct combat. She's still an angel, she fights with a magic sword that smites people from a distance, she has magic that protects her, both built into her armor and that she uses on herself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2014-10-22T06:18:37.913+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"Morgana dresses like that because of magic.

Anything a woman wears can be sexualized, or looked upon with lust. Look at nuns (I'm not talking about Halloween costumes). On the other hand, we have men walking around in speedos, man-thongs, and shirtless and we look at it as either normal or with absurdity.  The only time we look at it with lust is if they're attractive while we're always ogling women unless they're unattractive.\n\nI'm not saying never sexualize men, or to keep sexualizing women, I'm just explaining how it's not so black and white. \n\nNo pun intended, but look at Lucian and Jinx. \n\nLucian isn't boyish like Ezreal, macho like Tryndamere, or beautiful like Taric. Do people consider him to be attractive. Some people would say yes or no based on personal preference, particularly his outfit and personality. Others would say yes or no because of his race. Why I mentioned race? With people discussing the lack of diversity and male eye candy, I'm curious as to how a predominantly white female audience would react to non-white male eye candy.\n\nAt first glance, Jinx is eye candy. She wears a bra/bikini top/thing and shorts. However, despite, regardless, or because of it, she seems popular with the female audience. Part of it is because she's petite. So she's an example of how female eye candy can be done in a positive way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Adrenalotr","date":"2014-10-22T19:17:32.744+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I thought this was on how boob armor would guide blows towards the center of the body rather than deflect them. I'm no expert, but it's been brought up in a lot of places. \n\nExample of bad boob armor: Battleborn Kayle, Leona default, Sejuani, Vi, Lux default.\n\nExamples of better boob armor: Iron Solari Leona (lower stomach vulnerability to horizontal blows notwithstanding), Defender Leona. I found only these two good examples in the female champions' splashes.\n\nThere are many champions who were partial (and thus only partially effective) armor, and many who seem to use it more for aesthetics than for actual defense. I can think of no sensible reason to have a boob window in your armor. Of course, there's no sensible reason to not wear helmets, either. We can give some leeway for making character identifiable and relatable by exposing their heads, even if it's unrealistic. Maybe we should give partial armor that same leeway? Sure.\n\nBut boob armor is dangerous. [_The armor_ could kill the wearer](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/05/boob-plate-armor-would-kill-you). [We can still have attractive women in armor](http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/1jlx34/on_the_topic_of_boob_armor_and_other_related/).\n\n--\n\nBut no, this thread is about visual appeal.\n\nI like Leona. She has visual appeal, and she hasn't been sexualized like many of the other female characters... yet she's unmistakably female. I like Kayle too. And Vi. And Sej. And Diana. All of which aren't particularly sexualized, yet unmistakably female.\n\nWe've got champs like Karma, Liss, and Quinn, who aren't sexualized, but still fit into this game. Yet we have excessively sexualized characters, and tons of sexualized skins for them too. There are times when the loading screen looks less like a game and more like... something else.\n\nSexualized design has a place in the game when it can communicate character. [Sometimes it does.](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/9814-Its-Okay-To-Like-Or-Not-Like-Bayonetta) I can see this being suitable for MF and Morgana, to an extent Fiora and Ahri. But what's the deal with the *Frost* Archer's stripperific outfit? Did Kat not realize she's outgrown her little jacket? What does Cait's skirt length communicate about her?\n\nHalf the female human-ish characters could get non-sexualized outfits and designs and still have their character communicated just fine.

If there is one thing moms and teenaged girls pretending to the grocery for their mom likes more than anything else, it's soft-core manservice.\n>  \n> \n> http://victoriapaigebooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/gentle_rogue.jpg\n> http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1342376494l/1731408.jpg\n> https://lifetakeslemons.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/bodice-ripper.jpg\n> http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1401762970l/22395506.jpg\n> http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1411658659l/4643161.jpg\n> \n> \n> Now if ANYONE dares to bring up the *\"but that's male power-fantasy\"* crap, may I remind you, the only people buying these are **moms and teen girls**, **not** your \"immature sex-obsessed 12-year old\"\n\nYou must seem to read a lot of romance novels, or look at them often at least.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-10-22T21:02:59.386+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't you read where he said he works at a small bookstore that women frequently get these books from?

It's not indicative of the entire group of women as a whole.\nSome females (and men) like romance novels with beefcake on the cover. That doesn't mean that men as a whole are objectified the same way or to the same extent as females. The male and female roles on the cover are quite different as well.\nIt's a very limited example.\n\nIt's also very similar to post from 4chan that's been making it's way around saying pretty much the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-10-22T23:04:22.506+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"> > Didn't you read where he said he works at a small bookstore that women frequently get these books from?

I'm using my own store because I'm not about to go to the chapters in the mall to ask them how well their Defiant Surrender is selling.\n\nAnother thing you should take note of is that Bodice Rippers have been made in the thousands long before the internet's been a thing. And even back then, it's main audience have been moms and housewives.\n\nAnd you're right it doesn't cover 100% of women, because NOTHING will 100% cover up an entire demographic. You can say teen girls and moms like Justin Bieber. You KNOW not 100% of them like Biebs. But you also know that enough of them exist to make the kid ludicrously rich and famous.\n\n> Some females (and men) like romance novels with beefcake on the cover. That doesn't mean that men as a whole are objectified the same way or to the same extent as females. The male and female roles on the cover are quite different as well.\n\nYou're correct that men aren't objectified the same way as women. But in case you haven't noticed, men and women are DIFFERENT. \n\nBut a sexy fabio in the cover of a bodice ripper is a woman's equivalent of, say...Emma Watson posing in a lingerie in Playboy magazines. Not exactly porn, but a step below, but still intended to titillate their respective audiences all the same.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
