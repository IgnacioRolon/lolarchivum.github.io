I have roughly 230AP on my passive, and more AP through my build. I can Q a minion wave and get them down to 3/4 health with a single cast. I suddenly buy Rabadons, and with my AP items and Veigars passive, the passive of just Rabadons alone gives me an additional 209AP ( WOW ). I go to a minion wave now and Q and they are down to just a sliver of health still.\r\n\r\nYou mean to tell me with an extra 209 AP! I cannot do 1/4 of a minions health in damage? It feels very underwhelming so I figured the AP calculation is off. Anyone know why this is?","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2017-08-17T11:54:28.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope. You get what you read. Take your AP, increase it by 30%. That's your new AP. As veigar, each Q will now give about 1.3 AP. Take the AP gained, multiply it by your scaling value, and you'll get your new damage. Minions scale with your level so it's possible they got tankier. However if you Q'd minions, they got to a sliver of health, you backed right after and got the rabadons, came back, Q'd and it was the same sliver, I'd probably call you a liar because that's a mathematical impossibility. \n\nIn all seriousness though, no hidden algorithm. Minions just get tankier as the game goes on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-17T07:40:17.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar's Q has a .6 ap scaling, so 209 ap would be about 125 more damage. Then it is lowered by a % based on the minion's magic resistance.\n\nEven if that was enough damage to be one shotting the minions you were fighting it is also possible that the minions got stronger. They get more powerful as the game goes on.","replies":[]}]}
