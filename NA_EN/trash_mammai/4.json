League has to choose whether to appeal to people who always need something new to keep their attention and people who enjoy league as a competitive esport. Right now I would argue neither side is fully happy.\n\n> Also going off the Boards... Any new champion tends to be pretty hated instantly. OMG OP. OMG WEAK AF GET THIS GARBO CHAMP OUTTA MY GAMES.\n\nA lot of that comes from the immediate presence the champion has in every game, including ranked. I also would argue that at least 50% are overtuned from release or shortly after. \n\n> Generally it seems anything that requires players to learn how to interact with it is unpopular. Don't chase the singed had to become a fucking Meme before playerbase got it.\n\nMinimizing impact and counterplay are different things. Could you ward against Zoe on release? Yes. Did it stop her from having a 1400+ range instakill option on nearly no cooldown and less than 1 second to react? Nope.\n\n> I don't mind your view, I just don't share it.

It isn't about being unique or not, it is about following the core game rules. If he can cast the ability during cc he should have a cleanse. Even if they added it now, it isn't like Tryndamere is dominating the meta and that would make a difference.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2019-06-20T20:16:08.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nm1010,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k78HhjEs,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-20T19:42:29.921+0000)\n>\n> I think an ability that functions as a qss makes sense when it works through cc, an ability that doesn't remove the cc makes much less sense.\n\nIt doesn't say it in his skills tooltip that it \"removes cc\" because it doesn't it just works through it while still leaving all his other abilities locked out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slim Gragas","date":"2019-06-20T20:24:12.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You try playing Tryndamere without his ultimate, and thats why he can use it whenever he wants.

I've never heard people complain about Tryndamere ingame, I only know of low elos that call him OP because \"omg he literally cant die, no counterplay!\". The only time i've even had a problem against him is when he can splitpush for free, but thats up to how your team plays against him strategically. And for his ult, it can't be stopped by any means because its SPECIFICALLY for when he is low HP unlike all other invulnerabilities that offer strategy at all times like kindred/kayle/taric. Counter him with your champion/build, try to burst him because theres plenty of times that Tryndameres die so fast they couldn't even react to press R. And when he DOES press R, you can still CC him and wait it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Haze97","date":"2019-06-21T02:06:08.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You haven't played against a good Tryndamere main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-06-21T15:24:19.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The simpler a kit is, the more your champion matters more than your skill.\nIf tmere had no E spin couldnt cast R during cc, but gained up to 200% ad and the flat ad on his Q passive, he would be \"simple\" and \"easy to understand/beat\" with certain champs, but it wouldnt stop him from literally right clicking your turret ina 1v1 lvl 6 and winning 3 times ina row.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-06-21T15:21:31.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you rather fight a tmere that cant cast R while cced\n-----------\n but gained 15 more potential ad from Q passive and 50 more base healing and his R lasted 1.5 and 3 seconds longer based on lvl instead?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-20T22:11:27.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only starts mitigating damage once he takes what would otherwise be a lethal hit, so if he couldn't use it while CCed, he would have to use it early and waste part of it.
