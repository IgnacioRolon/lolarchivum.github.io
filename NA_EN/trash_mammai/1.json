Too hard to balance\n\nReally? How do you properly balance permanent invisibility or a true damage dealing, high damage CC immune dude with a slow? Buffing either of them creates pretty toxic environments as parts of their kit are extremely difficult to balance around. If Eve gets more damage, she's a threat due to being invisible and exerting pressure on the entire map at once. If Olaf gets more damage, he's a threat because the only peel you can provide is killing the dude or running as soon as you see him.\n\nRiven's kit is comparatively easy to balance. Is she doing to much damage during her CC's? Lower her damage a bit or lower the duration of her CC, or even nerf her stickiness a little so she needs to be closer to go in.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Torasuto,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MHzLXAN5,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-14T04:01:03.598+0000)\n> \n> {{champion:157}} Well, you see Yasuo..your shield is making you too tanky.

He was already amazing lategame, but was doing great early to and thus was nerfed. Riven by comparison is meh early and mid unless you fed her and meh late unless you either fed her a lot or don't focus her at all.\n\nNot really, for example: {{champion:23}} & {{champion:39}} in the meta where {{champion:24}} was dominating were at the same level of {{champion:24}} in terms of power and they've been historically known to stand toe-to-toe when facing him. No one used these champions effectively to counter {{champion:24}} to stop him and for good reason. LCS meta top picks at that time was {{champion:98}} and ranged toplaners like {{champion:85}} & {{champion:126}} who aren't that good of duelists. You're more inclined to do things you're shown to do rather than using shaded options. I speak of others like {{champion:31}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:54}}. You can excuse LCS players for needing a mobile toplaner and only using {{champion:58}} but other players declined to do anything on their own to counter the champion, therefore uncalled for nerfs and then he got a buff on his Q and R to compensate showing the nerf wasn't really necessary.\n\n> Their silence was removed because it was a point and click long ranged CC on a champion that normally did all their damage in ~.5 of a second then ran. That meant your counterplay was limited to autoattacking, running, or hoping you survive their entire burst combo. Riven does not have point and click instant gapclosers or the burst of an assassin.\n\nI wouldn't say you're entirely wrong here in terms of range as {{champion:92}} needs to use E to have similar reach; however {{champion:92}} 's damage is definitely that of an assassin. Except she gets two hard CCs on top of the damage and unconstrained mobility and is resourceless. {{champion:92}} is well known for destroying glass cannon champions such as {{champion:55}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:84}} because she bursts them down in a short duration where they can't output their carry-ish damage. What do you call such a champion? That's right, an assassin.\n\n> First, Lee still gets a shield when ward hopping, but the ward does not. That was because shielding a ward made it effectively invulnerable for the shield time as it still only took 1 damage from autoattacks but had a several hundred health shield. Second, the AS slow nerf was rather huge, as it meant Lee had less dueling power and was thus riskier.\n\n> Second, Riven's nerfs were rather noticeable; the hp per 5 means any damage you do to her will stick, while the shield cooldown nerf means earlygame baiting the shield (or just waiting a second for it to go away) gives you free reign to punch Riven. Otherwise, AD scaling is not a bad concept or even extremely strong, as unless Riven has magic resist or armor to go with that shield is just empty, squishy health.\n\nWow, you're telling me you didn't play as/against {{champion:64}} ever since the W change? What I'm implying is, you have no idea what you're talking about. {{champion:64}} 's W stopped giving him a shield on non-champion units a long time ago. He no longer gets a shield for ward hopping nor dashing on a minion. \n\nSecond, the nerf is somewhat meaningful early game; I'll give you that. It loses meaning once {{champion:92}} backs because {{item:3074}} is a core item on Riven.  There is several things wrong with your statement about baiting the shield:\n1- While it's possible, most champion abilities have obvious telegraphs that they're casting such as {{champion:98}} Q cast time and flight time, {{champion:24}} E detonation delay, {{champion:41}} Q cast time and flight time {{champion:79}} barrel travel time and so forth.\n\n2- Riven's free harass combo denies any auto attack trade attempt to get her to use the shield. Example: {{champion:48}} goes in to Q Riven as she comes to last hit a minion. Riven sees that {{champion:48}} is walking her way therefore she moves towards him and W's, killing the minion she wanted to last hit and punishing {{champion:48}} for trying to interact with her and responding with a combo.\n\n3- You know darn well most {{champion:92}} run CDR glyphs because of how strong of a stat it is on her. This does not make her vulnerable to AP, this gives her more power to use against AD champions [ more spells, more damage, more stuns and more shields; more passive procs ] while 90% of magic damage fighters are weak early therefore she shits on them with this CDR anyway.\n\n> Veigar had an instant long ranged long duration stun (2.25 seconds, which is the highest AoE hard CC I can find). As much as I love Veigar, that stun was extreme bullshit to face and had the counters of \"buy merc treads and banshees veil\" and \"never get within 1050 range of Veigar\". Riven's stun is an AoE .75 second stun in melee range, which is hardly comparable to Veigar's ultimate tier E.\n\nAs I said when it came to {{champion:38}} & {{champion:91}} silences. {{champion:92}}  does E Q for ~500 range knockup into stun for a decent hard CC duration, laying auto attack inbetween. When it comes to melees toplane, most champions want to farm with auto attacks. Doing that gets you in the very same {{champion:45}} situation where you either have enough armor/sustain to survive the combo or you lose lane. It works as simple as that.\n\n> Sej was nerfed because going full tank still made you do sizable damage. Riven is not because A) she isn't tanking your team for several seconds while outputting great DPS unless you really fucked up, and B) Her total CC's go to almost 1.5 seconds. CC fucking heavy? Garen's friggin silence is a longer CC than her entire kit.\n\nRiven has a shield, shields are basically resource -> hp conversion systems that run out based on resource, in theory you can shield until your resource runs out unless the enemy pins you down and bursts you before your shield comes up. In {{champion:92}} 's case: Resourceless, mobile and shield is on low CD. So if you don't hard CC AND burst {{champion:92}} down, she can shield for days then lifesteal all the way back with {{item:3074}} whether she was ahead or not. You see the problem here? With only {{item:3074}}, she has damage, sustain and beefiness. 1 item. That's..... I'm going to stop here, I believe I made this clear. Also, {{champion:86}} silences one target, {{champion:92}} 's CC is AoE.\n\n> Garen's base abilities are also pretty powerful; slow cleanse + point and click silence, permanent 20% bonus resistances and active tenacity + damage reduction, AoE physical damage that can crit and an execute ultimate. Buffing his cooldowns would lead to some rather unfortunate times (lower Q? More silences and screaming demacians. lower R? You get to the Darius problem). Riven's cooldown are rather low LATER IN THE GAME, but early game her cooldowns are still rather large and give her rather open windows to be attacked.\n\nSlow cleanse on a tank? Silence the frontline? W is a great spell, I agree. Building crit on {{champion:86}} is questionable aside from {{item:3142}}. His E might as well be considered a DoT spell, those are a pain to farm with and give plenty of opportunity for the opponent to react against; unlike instant spells {{champion:92}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:92}}. And by the way, {{champion:86}} can't intentionally increase his ult damage; nor can he excute multiple targets from range.\n\nIn case you weren't looking, his ultimate was finally buffed to have a decent CD. No {{champion:122}} situation arised nor did {{champion:86}} become meta. {{champion:92}} 's CDs are all below 10 seconds from the point she enters the game due to rune and mastery setup, save for her Q since it has 3 casts and by the time you finish casting them you have less than 10s Cd on Q already. Her basic ability CDs are not high, the first level of her ultimate has a long ultimate and that's it. Lvl 2 ult is under 75s CD while it lasts **15** seconds, might as well consider it ~60s CD.\n\n> She also snowballed with a long range point and click gapcloser on a champion that survived and won mostly via outstatting you. You either died to her burst, or didn't and then killed her since she so nicely served herself to you. Riven does snowball rather easily and keep the leads well, but she also still needs to waste her damage or defence to get close to hurt you.\n\nSo {{champion:92}} does not outstat you/out-kit you when she all-ins ? We're just talking about a silly {{champion:92}} here, you might as well compare her with an {{champion:84}} ulting minions to reach you, expecting to beat you 1v1. It applies to {{champion:98}} &{{champion:58}} using E to reach you instead of damaging you with the spell, it's not something only {{champion:92}} can mess up in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"draqxqard","date":"2015-05-14T06:25:21.645+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":7,"body":"> Wow, it's almost like Yasuo was literally pick ban for several months after release and had literally everything about him nerfed!

Only thing better is Riven's comes with a dash and has a lower cooldown.\n\n{{champion:157}} was nerfed multiple times in a row then left alone for a good while (4+ patches?) arguably, that's when he was most balanced then suddenly Riot took off a big chunk of his lvl1 HP and 10 of his MS in that patch. Only recently he was given a damage buff on his Q CD, 5 movespeed back and very recently increased his shield values. This suggests they indeed overnerfed him because players found him to be annoying to play against, meanwhile {{champion:92}} doesn't seem to get damage nerfs despite the amount of frustration her playstyle brings.\n\n> I don't really play Riven. But your entire post is mindless QQing, so I downvoted for that.\n\nRiven's infuriating presence takes it's toll at the opposing toplaner, sometimes jungler. The rest of the team tends to have the attitude of: \"I have no problem with {{champion:92}}, but god I hate when my team feeds her like crazy then she becomes ridiculous\" You shouldn't be downvoting people because they're angry, this is feedback and it is important to determine the enjoyment of the game and health state of a champion. I personally like {{champion:55}} and have no problem with her, but people tend to have a problem with her roaming and having the game become all about her because of 1 teamfight. Respect the opinion of others, be level headed and determine where the emotions are coming from; as knee-jerk reaction from you isn't better than an OP's burst of emotion. \n\n> Because one 2300 gold item that only gives you 35% armor pen completely invalidates armor, right? Not like she needs cooldown reduction or lifesteal early, or that your armor still protects you.\n\nYes, it pretty much did for ADCs and showed very clearly from patch 4.10 until the appearance of cinderhulk. Tanks and fighters were dying very quickly to a {{item:3072}} {{item:3035}} {{champion:236}} for example, an AD caster champion. {{champion:92}} is not different, in fact it can be worse because building {{item:3071}} on {{champion:92}} is more reasonable than building it on an ADC on top of the {{item:3035}}. Aside from that, armor does not push lanes nor does it destroy towers, nor does it regenerate HP like AD & lifesteal do.\n\n> Because adding an extra fucking 20 armor penetration gets rid off 2 entire items worth of armor, right?\n\nOP might not have been clear on this point, but {{champion:92}} roaming with {{item:3142}} nets easy kills while split pushing with it is nearly immune to capture; rendering the toplaner's armor stacking strategy useless.\n\n> That would be because you afk'd to QQ on the forums, or maybe because you decided to not peel for your team against the squishy melee.\n\nNot necessarily, {{champion:92}} 's instantaneous burst of ability sequence tends to cause quick kills, which result in objectives forced therefore ending the game quicker than say, {{champion:58}} or {{champion:122}}s ability to force close games.\n\n> Obviously you don't actually hate Riven that much, seeing as you won't make room for a supposed champion you \"despise with every fiber in my body\".\n\nChill, with over 100 champions in the game you'd forget what playing against a certain champion is like.
