Accept the punishment like an adult or leave. Don't expect special treatment.\n\nRiot does this thing where they feature League of Legends youtubers on the splash page. This helps those youtubers out because it exposes them to the community a little more. I haven't seen Dunkey on that page once, so correct me if I'm wrong, but they don't really help him out. Look at someone like Discoheat. Riot featured his channel stating that he breaks the meta and that his vids are cool because of that, but they seem to ignore the major point of those series, which is that he has to deal with toxic people a lot just for breaking said meta. The guy even has a series called \"League of Children\" which showcases the toxicity. Riot doesn't pay attention to that as far as I can tell. But as Dunkey said, he has provided FREE advertisement for their game. Despite the fact that the game is free to play, people still pay for cosmetics and such, and since he has been doing it for however many years, that's why he feels he should get something. As far as I know, youtube is pretty much a job of his as well. I don't know if he monetizes his videos (I see ads on them so maybe he does), but Riot shows their appreciation to youtubers is my main point. He hasn't received said appreciation (as far as I know).\n\nAlso, as a side note, I am not defending Dunkey for what he did. I am simply stating his perspective a little more clearly. Also, I do think the Malphite should receive a punishment, whether it was a one time thing or not. You should never intentionally troll a game, because even though it's a one time thing, you are still ruining the game for 9 other people that one time that you did it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-09-13T19:40:00.314+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahh.

The only fun he has involving league is recording and making videos for his viewers. Even when he's playing with Sky he doesn't sound like he's having fun. I think he was on the borderline of quitting, and Riot's ban on him gave him that last push.\nIt wasn't just the troll or Riot banning him that pissed him off and made him quit, it was quite a lot of things.\n\nAlthough I partially agree.

He probably assumed he was recording a video and wanted to be in said video.\n\nAgain, not defending the Malphite, cause it was scummy (Though According to lyte, The case where Dunkey said what he told us he said i nthe video, wasn't even the same game as the Malphite, so Dunkey is slightly lying)\n\nThis is what Lyte said in response to a question on his ask.fm\n\n\"This also really wasn't a case about intentional feeders and whether it's OK to be toxic towards other toxic players--there wasn't even a Malphite in the game that got him banned \" So yes, there WAS a Malphite in a game, but the game that got him banned wasn't even the same instance he thinks, which means he was even worse Off camera, and likely an instance we aren't being told about.

Riot says that they want champion diversity on one hand, and then they make changes that tunnel most champions towards one role anyway.

People who think its funny and feel some sense of power in the fact that they can screw with you ruin 20-60 minutes of your life. Is there any real punishment for that? NO. you can report all you want but I have never in my countless hours of playing heard of someone getting banned for feeding or lack of skill which I think are much bigger issues than name calling. Did he take it a bit far? Maybe, but to waste an hour of someone's life should warrant a much harsher punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RichBean","date":"2015-09-14T22:18:02.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has been playing lol since beta, I have followed dunkey since he began making videos. You ask how people can defend this guy, and the answer is because, for many of us, he seems like a friend who you have known for all of your league career. While I'm alright with him getting banned, I really dislike people who seem to feel that dunkey is this terrible person based off of just watching a few of his videos. Many of his videos have jokes that you really wont get unless you have been following him for a while. While he can be a dick, he is really no different from most players I play with. I just hate seeing people stereotype dunkey without actually having seen the majority of his videos. He is an amazingly funny guy. His comedy can seem very dumb but its clever once you see his running gags.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkNaraHarr","date":"2015-09-14T21:57:44.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was the largest League of Legends channel on youtube, though i personally only watched his videos when linked by friends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vaporware","date":"2015-09-14T21:14:01.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got the same kind of ban Dunkey did for participating in a dialogue with other players on both my team and the enemy team because I said too many buzzwords. \n\nThis reporting system is a joke. I think once I get unbanned, I might start working on removing the chat feature from my installation of the game entirely, not because the community can't take a joke, but because Riot's BBB (Big Brother Bot) can't take it when I use dreaded Wrongspeak. \n\nOr I might just uninstall and go to SMITE. The game isn't much fun, but at least the community is made up of actual human beings and not human tissue paper that explode when they hear a curse or slur.","replies":[]},{"poster":"j j","date":"2015-09-14T19:17:34.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whether or not dunkey deserved to be ban or not is hardly the point. The point of the video is how companies are becoming more politically correct in order to secure more revenue. And people who abuse other players and are actually toxic go unpunished while those who defend themselves or vent their frustrations when encountered by such a player are punished instead. It's not much different than the real world where states don't allow \"stand your ground\". It's the \"we know better than you complex\" and we will dictate how you act and you will do as we say or face the consequences. Not much different than a police state kind of mentality. So, yes I understand his frustration. It's happening in the real world as well. People are slowly figuring that out.\n\nBut on his other point I totally understand that league has lost it's way and in comparison to other mobas seems to be losing out on a much bigger market by acting like they have a monopoly. League is not competitive in the moba market. They at this point do the bare minimum where other mobas who actually want to get big are doing much more than league. The other mobas are catering to their communities while league ignores theirs and treats theirs poorly. There are things WE the community wanted in league since 2009 that are slowly just being introduced in 2015 or not even at all. While other mobas introduced these concepts in their alphas or betas. League has just lost it's touch. Most of the current players in league consist of people who started in 2013-2015 area. I would say a good majority of veteran players have slowly been getting fed up with the treatment received over the years and or quit. Although I don't speak on behalf of everyone. Just from my own observations. I'm one of the veterans finding myself playing other mobas than league currently until changes happen.
