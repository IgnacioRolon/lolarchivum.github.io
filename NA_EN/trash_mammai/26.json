These 2 make mana irrelevant.\n\n\nSona and Ziggs in particular have been sitting in the high 60's - low 70's for ARAM winrates for years.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat's ruining ARAM is these \"ARAM accounts\" who only buy top tier champs like Sona, Lux, Xerath, Ziggs, Fiddlesticks, Jayce etc.\n\nMost of the time they still get those champions anyway so recent change to add 3 weeks of free rotation didn't do much.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also hope Nexus Blitz becomes permanent.\n\nNexus Blitz is 100x better than ARAM and you have control over your picks and bans.","replies":[{"poster":"SiG DxD","date":"2019-02-23T22:08:16.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agree with nexus blitz being amazing\ni miss that mode\nwas like the twisted tree line from 6 years ago or so","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"cabbysb","date":"2019-02-22T10:21:08.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"whats the point of urf mode when it doesn't even take one round of abilities to kill someone. this game sucks","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-02-22T20:33:56.809+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's still a fun mode but most of all, it highlights problems even more\n\nit was supposed to be a fun mode where champions fight without any real limitations, instead we now have masteries on roughly 6 second cooldowns and of course, items get the same crazy reductions\n\nthe original URF was great, but ARURF puts your chances of winning on RNG, much less chances of fun for the larger amount of champions you have\n\nmelee champions rarely do anything in urf and there are quite a few of them...","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-02-22T23:12:23.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> melee champions rarely do anything in urf and there are quite a few of them...\n\nActually they are the sleeper OP in urf.

I know I just pointed out easiest 3, but there are few more of them.\n\nPersonally my \"i should be careful not to feed\" list goes like this assassins/divers/fighters/bruisers -> ADC -> mages.
