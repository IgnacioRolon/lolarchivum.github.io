The camps are on a 1:40 respawn.  If you just take the big monsters out of a side, they get a fraction of what they should have.  Your level growth will be reduced since being up in levels results in lower xp growth when taking jungle camps, but your gold should be far above them.  Trust me, getting counter-jungled is crippling.\n\nDouble XP for killing with smite in the enemy jungle is a bad idea.  That would create a ton of abuse cases, and in cases of people swaping entire jungle sides, would allow for junglers to outlevel solo lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-04-24T04:29:16.121+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a fellow jungler, getting counter-jungled is crippling for both sides, the one stealing the camps and the one with the camps getting stolen. Unless you are also able to kill the enemy jungler, then counterjungling becomes really rewarding. So the reason he is by the same level is simply because he is fallign behind as well...\n\nHowever is still high risk, as if you die on the enemy jungle, it will cripple you considerably and boost your opponent jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2015-04-24T05:08:50.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically this. Especially if you are counterjungling in the pre-5 minute period where your time in the jungle is really precious to either powerfarm till 6 or get a strong early gank off. Walking all the way across the river and trying not to get collapsed on, gambling that the enemy's camps will be up and hoping to god you'll get lucky and catch them low. Worst case scenario you die or waste flash, average case scenario, you get maybe 1 camp, but not even full XP or gold since you leave a little one. \n\nCounterjungling *can* be oppressive, but only as a \"win-more\" strategy. If your lanes are winning, its really easy to go and invade the enemy jungler because you can count on the enemy laners being pushed into tower, your laners responding first to help, and winning a 2v2 or 3v3 if it comes down to it.\n\nCounterjungling right now is NOT an effective strategy by which to consistently establish firm leads, its just a way to snowball leads that your team has already accumulated.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-24T09:54:22.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would agree on the most part about counter jungling. If you leave behind small monsters, you gain less experience too, but if you take everything, sometimes the monsters respawn before the enemy jungler get around to them (like VI who tends to gank early then head to other camps).\n\nI have been counter jungled, but unless they take Red or Blu, it rarely makes a difference to my game. I still get hurt more if an ally jungles (usually an ally takes my jungle AND I get counter jungle'd and the ally then complains I don't gank :/)\n\nThere's so many camps now, it's easy to make up for lost exp, and cycle around to let lost camps respawn. Counter jungling is only effective if:\na) you get a kill or very good ganks (coming from enemy jungle you often find blind spots)\n\nb) you take multiple camps - which is dangerous as you extend your time there and are more likely to get caught low, you really only want to do this WHILE you have eyes on all enemies, then you can clean up everything\n\nc) taking the enemy big buffs\n\nd) very early game, successful counter jungling will give you a strong lead, but most of the time laners' will cover jungle and drop some free wards, so it's still very risky\nI find that if I successuly counter jungle and then gank, enemy jungler will gank too (and we'll still be near same level) but their timing will be better because they didn't lose as much hp farming so they are just waiting for you)\nI prefer to farm their jungle, then predictively farm my own. Sometimes after stealing a red, an enemy just steals yours (especially if you get seen by someone hiding in brush or a ward) getting your jungle too will force them to gank prematurely, or waste time trolling your jungle looking for camps or you at low level, this REALLY puts them behind. Making sure your team know that you've stolen the enemy jungle and to watch out for early ganks is important too :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rebound2","date":"2015-04-23T23:05:04.381+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poacher's Knife is such a sad item.\nRiot actually had to acknowledge that it wasn't just there to fill the gap and give us 4 jungle items instead of 3.\nIt really needs some serious buffs if it ever wants to see some actual play.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-24T10:02:48.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One use for poachers knife that I have done, (I don't counter jungle often, but the few times I have I've utilised this) is to fight in the enemy jungle (or if you get caught) just just quickly smite something and run. Timing that speed buff can be nice, but it's tricky and rare to get the timing right.\n\nAnd easier one is fighting an enemy near red buff (this has gotten me kills a few times) they are ahead and think they will win, just when you know they are fully commited, smite red for the HP burst and keep fighting, the sudden jump in your hp will often scare them into running, but if you're timing is good then it's already too late :D\n\nOn a side note, often as a support/tank, when caught in the jungle, I'll often run to baron and engage it. If I know I can't escape, you can often severely damage your opponent by forcing them to kill you while the Baron is killing them (and as a tank, your survivability is much higher) Even if you don't get the baron kill, you can force you opponent to return, or to even lose the next fight they jump in to. \n\nFinally, just because I remembered it, I once killed a fleeing shaco who jumped over the drake wall while counter jungling. I was Maokai and I just a sapling on the drake, the Drake then killed shaco :D I have repeated this tactic many times. I have rarely gotten kills with it, but it's a nice deterrent for dealing extra damage, or you can follow the dragon to see which way your enemy fled :D (preventing passives from triggering like mobi boots or Garens healing)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-04-24T22:50:11.790+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple reasons for this:\n\n-With the longer respawns, you can't be certain to even find camps when you go to the enemy jungle\n-The red/blue buffs aren't very impactful anymore\n-Jungle exp is skewed so that you're pretty much going to be 1-2 levels below the solo laners regardless if you've cleared 5 camps or 10.

They will be low health and blue will be around 1k hp if you do this as fast as possible, but if you mess up and miss that 0:56.5 box then it will be at 200ish hp.
