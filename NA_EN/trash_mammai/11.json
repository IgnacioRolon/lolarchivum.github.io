Karma's running around with full hp bars worth of shields that almost never go down. You did great with that\r\n\r\nOh and the randomized picks? Awesome work, RNG is always welcome in a skill based game. I see why you love TFT SOOO much. Instead of picking who I want to have FUN in the game I get to be forced into rerolling and picking the most competitive pick i'm able to get because I have no idea what i'm up against and no free will to pick so i'm stuck with the games ideals of fun instead of my own. I mean why be happy you lost playing something busted like fizz or zed when I can be unhappy I won in 10 minutes with fizz or zed against champs with no mobility or cc to stop me from rampaging forcing them to FF at the 10 minute mark\r\n\r\nStealth in this mode is just flawless. No, I don't mean its working fine, silly. I mean it's flawless because there's no flaws in having stealth. There's no way to counter stealth which in your eyes seem to be fine for normal games because of CD restrictions. Let's take that to URF where people are unable to be seen for 90% of the match. I mean that's just SOO fun having twitch shaco or evelynn or rengar come from nowhere and assblast me instantly with nothing I can do\r\n\r\nSpeaking of assblasting. The crit bonuses? Amazin, getting a predator Quinn running from base to base faster than I can blink and poppying everyone who looks in her direction was the best thing I can think of for healthy game design.\r\n\r\nI could go on all day about this amazin mode you created Rito, 10 minute long games that are never fully fledged 5v5's because someone usually RQ's after realizing that they can't compete vs anybody on the enemy team\r\n\r\nWho wants Nexus Blitz, right? I mean a gamemode that was nearly as polished and balanced as the main game? Pfft no thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Cotten Eyed Joe","date":"2019-10-03T01:13:48.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imagine complaining.\nAbout URF.\nA Gamemode Where You One Shot.\nAbout Getting One Shot.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-10-03T01:08:59.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"hmmm I can't put my finger on it, but this doesn't seem entirely genuine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-03T01:11:43.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">  There's no way to counter stealth \n\nNear-100% sweeper uptime\n\n> Oh and the randomized picks?

Might as well call it untargetable in URF. \n\nPlay ARURF on the PBE and tell me how many times you play vs Zed, Fizz, Shaco etc. 5 people rerolling until they get those exact champs that stagnated the meta. You'd be surprised how common it is. The only difference is now the enemy team has to pray that they can do the same thing, if not then wellp gg.
