Otherwise the moment you leave lane your ADC is going to get absolutely mauled (Cait dropping traps on your shrines is *fun*). Nami is also another bad one for Bard, and is my go-to pick for when Sona isn't available or isn't the best choice. Basically, sustain lanes with better poke are going to give you a hard time.\n\nAs for what works with Bard? You preferably want somebody with at least a dash to make dives a harder proposition and a semi-reasonable way to get ranged farm. Cait, Corki, Lucian, and Graves work well. Vayne is a very bad match, both you and her require scaling to become relevant and because of that you are likely to not make it out of lane phase intact. Kalista is something of a special case, you really can't afford to roam until she's gotten her first major item and T2 boots and thus gotten her power spike from her mobility passive.

I remember a Vayne that tumbled into Braum level 1, tried to melee him to death, and then raged at me and intent fed all game. Botlane dynamics are weird in that a slightly better adc won't have a huge impact until later, but one that doesn't know some of the basics can just ruin the whole game (especially the ones that refuse to kill that last minion for level 2 when level 2 Thresh is walking towads us).","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-03-15T00:22:09.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woot woot, Thresh utility train, coming in!\nYeah, I feel like I kind of was more reserved in my first two matches...
