His Q with scorch does some nasty damage early and usually forcing the opponent to back because if they stay in lane till 6 you usually get an easy kill if they leave so you can't ult them and tp back you just repeat with Q spam. \r\n\r\nI suck ass at csing in general so my cs is always behind but once he gets about 2-3 points in his E and a bit of ap his waveclear gets so good. \r\n\r\nThis is some disgusting sleeper op. Struggles vs tanks because they just get MR and you do no damage but you can easily roam and 1 shot the carries then let your carries dps down the tank.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-06-22T05:10:35.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, AP Malphite is always a pain in the ass, especially with Comet + Scorch, cuz you always hit it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2019-06-22T05:51:58.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If people account for him going AP in lane, they can prevent feeding him.  Doran's Shield and a character that isn't strictly melee with all of their abilities should be able to outlast him.  The only downside is his ultimate doesn't have that much counterplay, so even if you do well, your teammmates may feed him relentlessly if he roams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-22T05:49:18.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very popular.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2019-06-22T05:43:39.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I jungle with AP malph and it's fucking hilarious.
