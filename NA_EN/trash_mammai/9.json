You need to stack hp on the braum. And you kinda need ionics or something to do damage. Also, you want to have a warmogs on the braum.

It was pretty scary, some fights seemed really hopeless. The goal is to ramp your wardens up to lv3 as quickly as possible. Braum is the best candidate. You don't need every warden, the warden 4 buff is potent enough. You can go for Mystic for extra tankiness or buy Olaf and activate the Glacial buff.\n\nBest items for the carry wardens:\n- Braum: Thornmail, Ionic Spark, Warmog\n- Nasus: Morello, Ionic Spark, Thornmail\n- Thresh: Deathblade, Giant Killer, Rapid Firecannon","replies":[]},{"poster":"rabirinsu","date":"2019-11-29T20:30:59.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wardens only good when you have dragon claw thornmail and ionia spark, with item stacked voli and zed.
