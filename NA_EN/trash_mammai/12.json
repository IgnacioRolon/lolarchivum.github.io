I feel you can run anything so long as your able to do it successfully with a majority of RNG teammates. When you cripple your teammates more often then not your greifing them Plain and simple.  Because off meta is not about playing what you want just cuz. its about playing something personalized to you to win. See Aqua dragons Tank karthus for a example of a successful off meta, or the Taric Sona bot lane terror for a more recent example.\n\nOff meta is not, \"this might work?\"  Its more like \"BWAHAHAHAH THIS WORKS SO FKING WELL HELL YEA!\"  Testing it should be done prior to trying it in ranked.\n\nIf you want to call yourself an off meta player you better be able to prove you succeed with it.

Two of those 3 were seen pretty commonly around my elo, and the 3rd was still more common than I wanted to risk playing my strat into.\n\nIt's not just about finding something that works. It's about finding *why* something works, and *when* something works. In essence, determining *how* it works. Potentially *anything* **can** work...but without knowing how it works, you're never going to understand why you just played against that last guy and got bent.\n\nMoreover, it's also about finding way around your shortcomings. In my example, I told my jungler every time before I locked \"If it seems like I'm failing, just camp mid and take my farm, and we can run this funnel style.\" Funnel style isn't as strong as it used to be, but having fallbacks and ways to adapt if you're in a rough spot are part of running off-meta just as much as locking off-meta to start with. In Nubrac's example, if he would have just given Irelia that initial 2 or 3 level advantage, then returned bot, he would've been far more impactful than trying to force his strat all the way to the end. Instead, he forced it, just as he'd done in several other games, and ultimately got banned.\n\nI know my role. I'm a scientist, and the chances of me running off-meta in ranked are generally very slim, unless I know *100%* that my strategy is effective against what I pick it into.\n\nEDIT: Tyler1 is a cuck for proving me wrong - he tried going back bot and got rekt...some other way will exist, but I will admit that is not it. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-06-20T23:54:06.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kai Guy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5dZEmyWr,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-06-20T23:25:40.512+0000)\n\n> If you want to call yourself an off meta player you better be able to prove you succeed with it.

By the time NB decided to afk, his team was winning the game.\n\nMid was 30 CS up and less than 1 level behind (changes to exp over the years make it so you really dont lose much exp as a duo compared to a solo), and sivir was only ~10 CS under taric, who doesnt use the gold nearly as well as sivir does.
