ADC itemization is gross. After the changes when I fight a bruiser(like Riven) and build armor. I actually feel like a tank. I'm hard to kill (instead of getting brut and getting eliminated easy) \n\nWhen I build armor vs a Riven/Darius/Garen/Wu etc. I FEEL like i'm becoming harder and harder to kill. \n\nWhen I build armor vs a Vayne/Jinx/Lucian/Sivir etc. I FEEL like i'm just another squishy because of how easily they shred you. \n\nIf I'm a 6 armor item Garen vs a 6 item jinx I should be able to /laugh as her damage does nothing, while being nearly 1 shot by the mage due to non-existant MR. \n\nRight now a 6 armor garen vs a item jinx can easily just lifesteal everything up and shred him because bork + Bt + lw  + IE will melt him.
