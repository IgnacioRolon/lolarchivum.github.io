I've been 0/5 as Lucian, vote no to surrender vote, go legendary and end game at 8/5.  Surrendering is a bronze trap because you lose 100% of the games you don't try. You forfeit the ~25% (there was a stat I forgot, I think it's 1/4)  where you're behind and they throw hard. \n\nAnyone else see 11k gold deficit turn into a 5k gold *lead* in 15 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-03-11T01:01:10.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you have those 2 childish people on duo que that are running into the enemy fountain.

Yeah, those games it's better to cut your losses and ditch@20 instead of wasting another 15 minutes in an inevitable defeat.
