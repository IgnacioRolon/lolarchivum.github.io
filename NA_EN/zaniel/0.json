My last 4 games in a row I&#039;ve been playing against former diamonds and high plat players and getting the crap stomped out of me when my team has silver players.\r\n\r\nI get that this means that we&#039;re all in &quot;placement&quot; matches, but this kind of match making is ridiculous. I&#039;ve been playing this game since S1 and never have I see such a shoddy match making system in place. It makes the game toxic, and not fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-13T04:40:33.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">  do the soft reset first\n\nThat's what they are doing?\n\nSeason 7 ranked hasnt started so they are doing a reset to give the system something to go on when it actually starts.\n\n> I get that this means that we're all in \"placement\" matches\n\nThen stop complaining and play them.  If you get it then you also understand complaining does nothing.

This one I went 4/6 because of my bronze top laner against plat tops, and so on. You can get lucky and have the reverse, but that shouldn't be the hope for winning is you have the most diamond players in your bronze game.\n\nThey should have made the queue based off of the previous DQ, and there was no reason why it wasn't to be quite honest.

It wasn't a soft reset, because they didn't copy over the mmr from DQ from season 6 for no good reason. It is why you had stuff like previous silvers ending in silver 1 after 4/6 and previous challenger ending in bronze 5 after 10/0. Riot admitted it was terrible and are looking for a fix because they know it is terrible right now (they made a thread about it and saying they know the matchmaking it bad right now even for preseason).","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-11-13T07:41:26.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">They set EVERYONE at 1200 mmr for the new Flex Queue and went \"good luck\".\n\nFucking kill me. That's the dumbest thing they could have done. \n\nAfter reading that I think they need to just wipe the last weeks results off of the board and place everyone back at their place from last season. Flex Queue is Dynamic Queue just by another name. You could have not even done a reset and got a better result, since they are literally the same Queue.\n\nI could understand if they wanted to hard reset Solo Queue, because frankly I don't really want someone who's a bronze solo player but played 5s with his Plat friends getting into my Solo Queue rank and having a massive amount of inertia holding him there for weeks but why does this matter in Flex Queue where rankings will be laughed at and it's literally a place for people to get boosted to rewards they don't deserve.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mokkun","date":"2016-11-13T07:06:26.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Preseason ranked is always crap.

But the fact that it's crap doesn't reduce the crappiness of previous preseasons.\n\nAlso, solo/duo isn't getting the heavy reset.  Just Flex.  And even flex wasn't a truly full reset.\nAnd because everyone's swearing that they're only playing flex till solo/duo comes out, Riot probably doesn't care if matchmaking is terrible there, unless it turns out everyone was lying and keeps playing Flex later into the season.\n\nStop panicking.  This isn't the death of LoL.  It really just boils down to \"yet another unbalanced wonky preseason.\"","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-11-13T08:07:31.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try playing on OCE, we don't have the population to support this kind of bullshit. Even before Flex getting games with a 1 division difference (G3-P3) wasn't that uncommon, now if I queue up I get the rainbow, at least 1 bronze, 2 silvers, 2 golds and 1 plat, often I will get this with a Diamond. It's not going to even out any time soon either, when OCE rank started it was a shitshow for months on end, OCE does not have the population to average out quickly.\n\n>And even flex wasn't a truly full reset.\n\nBased on personal experience and what I've heard from others, it was at least damn close.\n\n>Also, solo/duo isn't getting the heavy reset. Just Flex.\n\nThis makes no sense, why hard reset the queue that's staying basically the exact same? You know I'd climb back to G1 in solo queue in a couple of weeks to a month depending on placements after a hard reset. It's easier to climb in solo queue because there's no 3/4/5 mans. What I don't want to see is a ton of boosted monkeys playing their placements then sitting a bit lower than the rank they got carried to but don't deserve last season.\n\nIf either of the queues need a hard reset it's solo queue.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-11-13T07:20:55.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The high level players don't want bronze teammates, and vice versa.\n\nHell I'm out of placements and I'm still getting terrible matchmaking.
