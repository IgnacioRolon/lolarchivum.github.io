You've been selected!\" When obviously, I haven't! It also says to create an account but that won't work either.

It looks like we did receive the application, but you haven't been accepted quite yet. That congratulation page sounds like it might be some kind of weird error with the PBE page. \n\nKeep a look out for an acceptance e-mail to know when you've been invited onto the PBE servers.","replies":[{"poster":"SaberAkise","date":"2017-04-01T23:19:06.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
