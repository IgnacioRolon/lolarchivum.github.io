They were online for 8 hours yesterday and STILL Did not get the gifts I sent them. Why does it always take forever for the skins I gift someone to get to them when they're online at the same time as me? They're not afk. They're in the same lobby as me waiting to start a game and the skins just don't go through until they feel like. Someone please explain what this is, hopefully a rioter.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T23:17:35.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like all three of those skins did safely make it onto your friend's account. He may not have seen the notification for some reason, but those 3 skins are already available for your friend to use.
