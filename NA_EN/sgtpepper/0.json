They already have continents and cities and all sorts of story telling components established they could implement. You could make 6 classes with tons of specializations and talents and gear to customize. Tanks, Bruisers, Marksman, Support, Mages, Assassin. They could mix in league champions as quest givers occasionally and have the LoL maps as inspired battleground type PvP things not like the top down view but a full scale Summoners Rift or Twisted Treeline. Races like yordles and humans and others I&#039;m sure I&#039;m forgetting. I think it would be cool to explore Runeterra and go to Bilgewater or Ionia or something. Imagine if Bork or IE were a crazy rare epic item and you found it. Maybe I&#039;m just bored with the game after playing since beta and feeling like after 1000&#039;s of games I haven&#039;t really gotten anywhere. I think it would be a cool thing for them to branch into. What do you guys think? Maybe Call it &quot;Land of Legends&quot;","replies":[]}
