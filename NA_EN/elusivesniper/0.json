I was silver 3, and with flex que I placed bronze 4............ but, I am getting opponents who are in platinum, and even in one game a diamond...... When I win my games I seem to gain 20-30LP but when I lose, I am only losing like 5-10LP sometimes 15LP is this something to do with the matchups? or is this how new LP is gonna work? I kinda like the LP distribution tbh XD its hard to get out of silver/bronze sometimes because every 3rd or 4rth game you get that one player who doesn&#039;t want to co-operate with everyone.......... and makes it really hard on everyone else, So what I think is cool about this LP distribution is it takes 2 losses to count as your 1 win? its definitely made climbing out of bronze again in flex que a lot LOT easier even though ive already had a few AFKS.","replies":[{"poster":"Rïìvèn","date":"2016-11-15T17:22:37.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why is the system so broken?
