Because i noticed that when using the max/recommended resolution in the game, chatbox and such aren't scaled correctly. Currently, I'm using 2048x1142 which seem to be working since it doesn't appear to be zoomed in and doesn't trim off part of the game, if that makes sense.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that the Pro 4 has 2736 x 1824 resolution.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T22:46:36.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you _can_ play at resolutions up to 2736x1824 it's not quite recommended. The game isn't quite fully optimized for those high-end resolutions or 4k monitors quite yet, and when you do play at those levels the client will start to look a little.....odd. \n\nMy main suggestion would be to try playing at that resolution while in windowed mode, or see if you can play on a lower in-game resolution of 1920x1080, for example","replies":[]}]}
