Since i viewed the finals in a theater only 5 km away from me i wanted to come this year aswell. However the eSports website only shows a theater about 150km away. So i went to the website of the theater 5km away and they show an event for the eSports coke viewing partys but are not listed on the official site. \r\n\r\nplace: Hasselt\r\ntheater: Kinepolis.\r\n\r\nCan someone confirm this is still offical? Since last year they where listed and we got Championship kalista cup as a goodie :) \r\n\r\nThanx guys.\r\nNick","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T18:21:34.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I don't have any information on venues that are holding viewing parties for worlds.  My recommendation would be to directly contact your local theater to confirm that it's a viewing hosted by Coke.  The list may have just missed it!  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
