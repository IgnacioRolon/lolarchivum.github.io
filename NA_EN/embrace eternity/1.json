It counted as a remake (leaver) for me IN MY PLACEMENTS. It's bullshit. I didn't even close the game. It just never started. Please someone help if at all possible.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI tried to launch another game and it did the same thing. It counted as a loss this time. RIOT PLEASE HELP :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T18:18:32.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a frustrating situation, and I'd like to help!  When you say your game didn't start, when exactly are you seeing an issue?  Is the game loading at all?  Are there any error messages?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Embrace Eternity","date":"2016-12-08T21:29:49.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your help.\n\nThe game was perfectly fine until after champ select. After the \"Prepare for Battle!\" text showed in the chat box, it just stopped working. It didn't go to the loading screen with our champions/summoner names/etc. I tried to re open League and it said I needed to reconnect. So i tried, and it just didn't work.\n\nI re-installed the game after browsing the boards and google for an hour or so last night. The game works fine now.\n\nThank you for your help Porocles :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T21:45:29.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to help!  When champion select ends, your connection needs to transfer over to the game server, but it sounds like you're going to a dormant state and failing to establish comms.  I know things are okay now, but I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure your network is tuned up!  It would suck for the issue to reappear and cause problems.  Hope it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Embrace Eternity","date":"2016-12-08T22:10:46.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much. The only downside to all of this is that I am now 6/3 in my placements. I was 5/1. I won one just now but lost 2 because of my issue. I will climb back up though! Thanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
