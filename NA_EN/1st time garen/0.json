Season 3 was balanced and had no FPS and ping issue.  It just worked.\r\n\r\nFast forward a year and comes Season 4, I started getting into ranked games to go from Bronze to Silver and get my border.  It was a challenge since Season 4 somehow went to s*** with all the new updates and patches.  While trying to move up the ladder, I had to deal with disconnects, lag, ping so high players were pretty much afk and the occasional trolls.  Nonetheless, I was quickly climbing up to the series to get to Silver.\r\n\r\nNow that I am Silver IV, I find this to be the definition of HELL! I am actually starting to think that I may actually be in hell.  This is a typical day of ranked gaming as a Silver IV.\r\n\r\nStart: 0 LP\r\nGame #1: Win\r\nGame #2: Lose\r\nGame #3: Win\r\nGame #4: Lose\r\nGame #5: Win\r\nGame #6: Win (Oh shit! I am going places)\r\nGame #7: Lose\r\nGame #8: Lose\r\nGame #9: Win\r\nGame #10: Lose\r\n\r\nThis win/lose pattern occurs every single time. Now, when I get in a match, I can with 100% accuracy tell the outcome of the match.\r\n\r\nSome of the reasons game are lost:\r\n\r\n1: ADC doesn't do damage\r\n2: ADC doesn't poke\r\n3: ADC doesn't follow through\r\n4: Top laner over extends without wards\r\n5: Top laner over extends and doesn't have map awareness\r\n6: Top laner over extends and doesn't respond to pings\r\n7: Mid laner feeds\r\n8: Mid laner doesn't call MIA\r\n9: Mid laner roams and loses tower\r\n10: Jungler doesn't gank\r\n11: Jungler doesn't gank\r\n12: Jungler doesn't gank\r\n13: Support doesn't build support items\r\n14: Support doesn't buy wards\r\n15: Support think they ADC and dies\r\n16: Trolls\r\n17: Groups cannot form a group\r\n18: AFK due to high ping disconnects\r\n19: AFK from start of the match\r\n20: The a-hole who always goes 1v2, 1v3, 1v4, 1v5 and feeds\r\n21: The ADC that doesn't play sage and dies and then blames the Support\r\n22: Etc.\r\n23: Etc.\r\n24: Etc.\r\n25: RAGE!!! RAGE!!! RAGE!!!\r\n\r\nEverything that can go wrong, will go wrong in Silver IV.  I need therapy. Send help, Please!","replies":[]}
