She keeps the dunes of Shurima purified and unsullied by man of any nation, race, or creed.\nStands to reason that the Shurimans would make a deity or at least make some kind of mythology around her. Which would be where the inspiration for this skin would come from.\nNot only that, but the visuals would be awesome! A brilliant, glassy jade/emerald green dorsal fin, Sleek golden armor, emerald glass particles on her prey seeker. the same sandy particles kha'zix has on his isolation marker on her tremor sense. Emerald tunnel glow with Shuriman architecture on the entrances. the sandy-particles and glass SFX on her Q and E.\nI understand launch skins are usually large departures and \"re imaginings\" of champions. But I feel like this was a sorely missed opportunity for a fantastic skin.\n\nWell, at least we have an Idea for a 975 later on.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2014-12-23T04:02:29.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good idea, though it poses a problem, Kha'Zix missle and Rek'Sai missle, the visuals, hard to tell apart?","replies":[{"poster":"Best KhaZix Void","date":"2014-12-23T04:13:31.617+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xTheft,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=aFi3dBMJ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-12-23T04:02:29.713+0000)\n>\n> Good idea, though it poses a problem, Kha'Zix missle and Rek'Sai missle, the visuals, hard to tell apart?\n\nwell naturally the Kha'Zix missile would be slower, shorter in range, and wider.\nAlso, it's under ground, so you would put dirt/sand particles as the tail end instead of the \"wind\" particles that are on Kha'Zix's W.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2014-12-23T04:44:40.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best KhaZix Void,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=aFi3dBMJ,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2014-12-23T04:13:31.617+0000)\n>\n> well naturally the Kha'Zix missile would be slower, shorter in range, and wider.\n> Also, it's under ground, so you would put dirt/sand particles as the tail end instead of the \"wind\" particles that are on Kha'Zix's W.\n\nspoken like a true kha'zix main","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-26T21:29:20.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely something to look at for future skins! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Best KhaZix Void","date":"2014-12-27T11:20:23.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=aFi3dBMJ,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2014-12-26T21:29:20.359+0000)\n>\n> It's definitely something to look at for future skins! :D\n\nI get a portion of the proceeds from each purchase right?.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoakOriginal","date":"2014-12-27T08:45:26.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add battlecast to the list! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2014-12-23T05:32:34.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was expecting some kind of \"u gots rekd\" pun...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Platinum Yak","date":"2014-12-23T01:21:50.077+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea for a skin - like you say, it's a possibility later on.
