(Varus' Sister)","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is quite stupid xD\r\nZyra has a pretty similar history with the darkins. Her kind was thrieving and powerful, same as the darkins. Zyra&#039;s kind was also at the peek of extinction and had to adapt to a new life to survive (half human). Zyra also has pretty similar body features as varus, but instead of corruption, she has leaves/vines since she has full control of her body","replies":[]}
