I saw that a recent player and known streamer loltyler1 recently gotten unbanned. I was wondering what steps I have to take to get my account unbanned as well. I'm not sure if they take different steps with people in the public eye, but I want to be unbanned aswell.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T03:43:12.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like this account went through the normal escalation process with chances to reform, which were in the form of chat restrictions. Accounts that go through this won't be unbanned. \n\nThere's some slight confusion regarding T1 getting \"unbanned\" when that's not quite what happened at all.
