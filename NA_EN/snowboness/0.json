I&#039;m new to the boards but exploring these forums are kind of fun. \nI&#039;m a casual player, and I&#039;m mediocre at the game. However, I don&#039;t understand how our community is one of the most toxic in mobas. It&#039;s really upsetting how it&#039;s gotten to the point where people would take something as simple as ,&quot;hey can you do this&quot; or &quot;please get sight stone&quot; as criticism and use that as an excuse to flame you/be passive aggressive towards you for the rest of the game??? I&#039;m just trying to chill, but honestly sometimes this game is really hard to enjoy. \nCategories: \nTrolls\nFlamers\nPseudo intellectuals/narcissists\nDiamond smurfs XDXD (therefore I'm entitled to screw around or to so and so role)\nAfk/RQ after fb\nPeople who give up and screw around when something doesn&#039;t go their way\nAnnoying Duos\nTeemo top(lol jk)\nSoccer Moms(&quot;reported&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m reporting you for toxcity&quot; after just recommending something?? Lmao)\n\nAnd reporting them barely even does anything. I like our honor system, I guess, but nowadays I&#039;ve been skipping out on honoring people. I don&#039;t really say much ig, and I don&#039;t respond when someone starts flaming me. But sometimes after 4 games of trash behavior it just feels depressing and I feel worse off than I did going into the games.\n\nEdit: I realize that they probably do this crap for their own enjoyment but it really kills the mood for others","replies":[{"poster":"Hensetsu","date":"2017-08-16T14:07:39.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truthfully it's easier.\n\nIt's easier to blame your team when you miss smite when they all come down hard on you like a ton of bricks. \n\nIt's also easier when you were the one carrying and then your team flames you for one mistake despite them going 1/6 in lane.\n\nIt's easier when you feel guilty about playing bad but don't want to admit it because you don't want your team to make you feel even worse about yourself in that game.\n\nI think that it's somewhat destructive because it causes players to develop thick toxic hides in order to protect their ego's (mine included I'm no special snowflake).\n\nIf being nice and kind was easier then more people would do it. But we get extremely frustrated with our losses and we sometimes lash out at our teams. It also doesn't help when teams go 2-20 and then refuse to FF, dragging games out for 20 minutes.\n\nThese things add up and make us more toxic as a community.","replies":[{"poster":"Squey","date":"2017-08-16T18:51:49.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> It's also easier when you were the one carrying and then your team flames you for one mistake despite them going 1/6 in lane.\n\nOne mistake, especially by the one carrying can do more harm then the person who went 1-6 in lane. Idk how many times i had a bad lane phase but came back due to 1 or 2 good team mates carrying me and then that person just throws the game away in 1 action.  My bad lane phase got me behind and an enemy ahead but his 1 massive mistake lost us the game.\n\nJust because your carrying doesnt mean it covers over the massive throw you just made.  You can get your team mates back in the game but u cant revive your nexus.","replies":[{"poster":"blackid101","date":"2017-08-16T20:06:51.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh  have you met feeding teammates that refuse to listen, like bro be quiet","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"snowboness","date":"2017-08-16T17:50:09.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zero356","date":"2017-08-16T14:57:22.446+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"One, you're level 23\nLeveling sucks, but it does balance out some once you reach thirty\n\nTwo, mute function is your friend (pings still come through so can still communicate)\n\nThree, I've probably just played so long it doesn't affect me\n\nFour, it may be ranking. People always say Plat is worst, and I'd argue bronze is second. I can't speak from experience on either, though. Plat is supposed to be the \"I'm clearly good, it's just my troll teammates keeping me from diamond\" and bronze is the \"I suck, but my mentality sucks too so instead of accepting that and looking for mistakes, I'll blame everyone else.\" A lot of smurfs are probably plat and a lot of people at your level (no offense, but underleveled I have to assume something) are probably bronze.\n\nFive, it levels out. Or at least I think it does.\nOne thing to note is that there's a good chance the person knows how bad they're doing.\n\nSix, isolated bad cases. You notice the cases where this happens a lot more; it may not be as common as you think. Or maybe it is and people suck\n\n\nAnd last half tip is to keep your words short and learn to play around the problem (not the best solution, but hey)\n\"Hey\" is to much, just tell them to ward and ping where. If they react negatively, cut near all communication\nNo sightstone?

CoD/Halo was mostly full of whiny kids whom balls didn't drop yet, thinking they're cool yet raging like the kids they were.

Outside of friendships or guilds(although there was PLENTY of drama in guilds too) WoW was also pretty bad, filled with many elitists or trolls that just want to make others feel bad. Not everyone within the communities are like this but you really cannot expect any competitive online game to be all sunshine and rainbows. Hell look at our society as a whole in its current state. MOST people do not really learn proper manners or any real kind of compassion or consideration. \"first world problems\" We are mostly very spoiled and it has led to a lesser state of being overall.

Basically what you said.  When one thing goes wrong, for the most part, it goes downhill from there (especially if there are more than one instances of something not going somebody's way).  I mean, the blame has to be put on something--somebody.  I think a lot of people cannot get over their own entitlement--their own egos...  So it's sort of like a domino effect.  I've noticed there is no forgiving.  One mistake and every subsequent error is highlighted and you're dramatically accountable for everything.  Sometimes accusers have to look at their own mistakes as well.  Nobody's perfect.\n\nFor example, I JUST had this game go down and it was probably the WORST game I've ever had...  Lucian didn't leash and jungler was cheesed early.  As nice as I was to leave lane to help Panth with Red and to do my best to support my questionable ADC, Panth blamed me for not being able to heal him when he went into a fed Fizz, Kayn, and a Darius...  W was still at least 2 seconds at rank 4 (Can't outheal high burst damage, even with Ult as Soraka), & also when he wanted to dive Kayn while their bot lane was still pushed towards us.  So, yeah, basically Lucian not helping Pantheon just made him an asshole the whole game.  \nhttps://gyazo.com/998220f4f74a731b5512e2c0c5ec376b (Scoreboard)\nhttps://gyazo.com/6c462b832f6151d7d27e3e879b8a51a1 (Damage)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-08-17T15:25:40.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi. As a toxic player in the current process of reformation for about 4 months now, I think I can give you some perspective.\n\nSo usually what happened is that after I died or we gave away baron or dragon or something I would instantly reach for the keyboard to type something negative. It wouldn't be directed at any player in particular, just something like \"wtf\" or \"that champion is broken\". This was especially bad back before I got a wired internet and I got anywhere from 300-74000 ms on a daily basis, which was really hard to deal with since it was clearly holding me back. Seriously. Wired internet saves lives kids. What would eventually happen is someone would say something like \"get gud\" and that's would set me off. I knew I wasn't good but I would argue pointlessly with them at length that they weren't either. It was like a trap, and I was caught in it for the rest of the game because I couldn't let them have the last say even though it was quite clearly effecting my decision making and gameplay. I remember vividly trying to all in a fed Olaf as rumble because I was so pissed off.\n\n    The best thing to do is not even get into an argument in the first place. Or even start making myself vulnerable with those remarks after I die. I always try and remind myself to not type anything after something bad happens. If someone does say something like \"get gud\" I just say \"ok\" and then move on.\n    Another thing I've found to be helpful is to be overly positive to the point where it's funny. Example: \"keep it sportsmanlike on the rift summoners!\". Doing this forces me to stay in character as someone who is positive. And I also find it quite funny to play as Braum and say shit like \"Always bring Braum!\".\n    There's some perspective from a reforming player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2017-08-17T13:44:37.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it really that hard to mute people if it bothers you that much?

Reporting only seems to yield results when the player has an obviously low score (e.g. 1/20) or they make extremely offensive personal remarks. \n\nWhy are people so terrible? It could be a number of reasons, but I think it mostly comes down to people trying to raise themselves up by putting others down. And it's far easier for them to lose their tempers and behave rudely online, behind the safety of a computer screen, when there are minimal to no immediate consequences.\n\nFrom my experience, I didn't have much fun playing this game until I made a lot of friends. Playing with a premade means you (usually) don't have to deal so much with the general toxic community. I was quite liberal with my friend requests, adding anyone who seemed mildly friendly. While my lack of pickiness meant I ended up adding some people who turned out to be jerks in bad games, it did mean I made lots of great friends in the long run.\n\nWhen I do solo queue, I tend to type very little, other than \"Good job,\" \"Thanks for that,\" or \"My bad.\" If I have to make a suggestion, I try to make it generic, like \"We should try to stick together\" rather than \"Ashe, quit split pushing so far all by yourself.\" If you have to single someone out, it may help to make them feel valuable, like \"We need you,\" (although, unfortunately, sometimes they come back with arguments like \"I'm better off distracting them top lane than being in team fights\"). When there's too much flaming going on, I tend to start muting people, even if no comments are directed at me, because the chat becomes a distraction nonetheless. \n\nIf you want to play with a (heh, mostly) non-judgmental team, feel free to add me for some games with my buddies and me.","replies":[{"poster":"snowboness","date":"2017-08-16T17:45:58.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha you're guys are right!
