It looks like you were able to apply for PBE a few years ago but this account hasn't quite yet been accepted. That e-mail may have been for a different account, so be sure to check any other accounts you may have!","replies":[{"poster":"ST3V3N","date":"2017-04-01T00:48:37.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But this is the only account i had, I also never changed emails, so how am I going to get into PBE?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-01T01:17:35.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did double-check just now to see if you had been accepted yet. As of right now, it doesn't look like this account has been invited to the PBE servers just yet. For now, you'll need to wait and see if you get a PBE acceptance email meant for this account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
