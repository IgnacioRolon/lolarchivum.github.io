MAY MAKE GOLD THIS SEASON!!","subforum":"Tips & Tricks","embed":{"description":"Check your Summoner statistics, MMR, realtime spectate and using powerful global LoL Charts!","url":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=romakoth","image":"http://attach.s.op.gg/logo/20150930233424.25ad99e13b943987187335ae5129699b.png"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so I want to start off by saying I am a terrible League of Legends player. I started playing last season after worlds. I hit lvl 30 and went straight into ranked. I got placed in Silver 4. Sadly I did not belong in Silver. I lost almost every game and finished the season in Bronze 3. I had a 25% winrate in ranked for the Season 4. So I right as Season 5 started I repeated my same mistakes and went right into placement matches. Guess what? The outcome was about the same. I got placed into Bronze 5. After my first 100 games I had (no surprise) a 25% winrate yet again. My MMR was so low according to sites like op.gg I think it was at about 300. So i decided being decent at League is something I wanted to accomplish. I had a two hour session with the summoner TR Senpai. Some of you may know him, but for those who don&#039;t Senpai was the midlaner for Challenger Team In3rtia. Also he is considered the best Jayce player NA. So I looked at what kind of champs he used in S4. I saw Xerath and thought he was really cool. I played a Xerath game and recorded it. After I finished I hopped on Skype and Senpai went through my game with me. After two hours we hand&#039;t even made it half way through the 40 minute game. He gave me some of the hardest critique I&#039;ve ever gotten for anything. But it was totally worth it. Small things people don&#039;t think of he told me. Every time you enemy laner goes to cs punish him for it. Its bronze he told me and they won&#039;t know how to react. Also practice Cs&#039;ing while poking to be as efficient in lane as possible. Then whenever you push them under turret, either back or roam. There is so much more he said but it would take a year to type it all out. So with new confidence I started playing ranked again. I literally dominated every single game. There was no such thing as a counter as I was crushing counter picks into my Xerath even harder than standard picks. But because my MMR was so low it took hundreds of games to get it normal. When it became normal I was about Bronze 3. At this point I realized Xerath was at a bad stage in the 5.16 Tank META. So I decided to branch out. I played champs I had tried in S4 and I actually did very well with them. Everything transfers over the cs the poke warding roam etc. . I hard carried every game I played dominating the opposition until I&#039;ve reached where I am now back in Silver 4. I&#039;m getting 25 LP a win and -10 for a loss. I think that I can make it to gold if I grind hard enough in this last month. My main role is midlane and I play Annie, Xerath, Velkoz, Cho&#039;Gath, Morgana. Viktor.\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\n1. Find out your own flaws and fix them don&#039;t blame your team (sometimes it takes a player much better tha nyou to hel you see things)\r\n2. Focus only a couple champions and master them\r\n3. Buy wards AND USE THEM!!!!!!!\r\n4. Roam roam roam always roam. If you are 3/0 in lane but your team is losing you are not carrying\r\n5. Play champs than do so much dmg you can virtually 1v5 the other team\r\n6. CS CS CS CS CS CS CS CS CS CS CS CS my average last season was 60 this season its about 180\r\n7. Learn to freeze lane under tower if you are behind and\r\n8. Play around objectives. kills don&#039;t win games the only help, the nexus being destroyed wins games\r\n9. Watch those who are better than you and ANALYZE what they are doing that makes them better\r\n10. Play around your strong players. If you top goes 5/0 in lane but after gets caught out, follow that bi**h into the jungle and fight with them, dont let them throw because they are kill thirsty, even if you want to go do something else on the map\r\n11. If you MMR is VERY bad like mine was, don;t rage it will take MANY games to fixx it before you can even think about climbing\r\n\r\nThanks for the read and sorry if its a bit wordy. I am just proud of where I have come and know there are other people who just want to get out of bronze as well.\r\n     \r\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:101}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2015-10-07T12:54:35.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take my energy brother, let it help you on your climb.

I just started Ranked this season and I had a similar experience and wound up dropping to 0 LP in Bronze IV.  I completely quit ranked and focused on improving my mechanics.

I Just started getting back into ranked and I've been dominating (83% win rate with a 4.34 KDA.)
