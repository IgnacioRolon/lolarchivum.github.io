Point and click stun is the only redeeming ability (including Shatter passive if the enemy is heavy AD), \n\nTop Lane Taric offers even less than support. I guess if the team was stacking AD (Zed, Sion, Cait/Lucian, Thresh and some AD Jungle) he may be an ok...pick...maybe.  But top lane Taric would be bullied out of lane by either 2v1 or early tops that could make his life a living hell.","replies":[]}]}
