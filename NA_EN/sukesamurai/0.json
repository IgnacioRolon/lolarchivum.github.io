I also have 4 Cloud bonus (+30% dodge to all allies). Lastly, Singed started on a wind elemental tile (+20% dodge).\r\n\r\nWhat is Singed chance to dodge?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-15T19:40:33.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You add the percentages, so 20+30+20 = %70 dodge chance.

But is that to say that every champ has the same base stat for dodge chance? If so, what is it?\n\nAnd since the buffs for dodge are based on %, do all champs then get equal benefit from them? As opposed to other %-buff items like the Recurve Bow or Spell Rod, which are proportionally better by the base stats of whoever they're used on (e.g., 15% increase of 1.0 speed is a greater buff than 15% increase of 0.8 speed). The % increase also makes me think the base stat for dodge can't be 0, which then makes the simple calculation above to arrive at 70% a bit more difficult. \n\nIf not 0 though, is it 1 (or any other number)? And what would that mean practically? Plus, is it just me or does it feel like they shouldn't all have the same base dodge stat?\n\nI've wondered about this for quite a while too, glad I'm not the only one. Perhaps I'm still missing something? But with a more prominent role now than before via the Cloud/hexes, definitely agreed on the need for a tooltip for this in a future update.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-21T02:38:04.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not a base dodge that's increased by 20%, it's just adding a flat 20% dodge chance.\n\nEveryone starts with 0% dodge chance.  If they gain +20% dodge chance, that means when someone autos them, they have a 20% chance to dodge it.  If they're standing on a wind hex and have {{item:3025}} {{item:3025}}  equipped, they have a total of 60% dodge chance, simply meaning that autos have a 60% chance of being dodged.","replies":[{"poster":"IncognitoPhantom","date":"2019-11-21T03:11:37.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely understand now, thank you!
