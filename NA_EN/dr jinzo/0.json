There is a reason they reworked LB to begin with. She is literally useless now. You cant even wave clear with her W/Q combo. Even Zoe out damages her, and out wave clears because her Q cost is so low and outputs more AOE. Like revert the passive and thats it. Did they even both testing this? Its absolutely terrible. Roam champs are garbage in this season, especially when vision is so readily available. She cant even engage in lane fights because the amount of mana needed to keep waves away from tower is INSANE. PLEASE RITO FOR ONCE DO SOMETHING THATS LOGICAL. The auto passive is great, but the fact you took away her aoe is just retarded. I actually mean retarded. She cant even proc Q on multiple champs now. This current season and meta is all aoe champs, mostly tanks and bruisers. Wtf makes you think a single focus champ that requires slow calculated combos diving into enemies is a good thing? Her E takes forever already to root, which is the most vulnerable thing about her. For a skill shot, it should be no more than half a sec. Keep the reworked LB but with her old automatic 40% drop mimic. This isn&#039;t hard. Why do you think no one plays her? Champs who need to farm champs never win games. They cant push waves, towers or obj. She is literally useless now.","replies":[{"poster":"RatedOneTrick","date":"2018-08-06T14:30:09.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't very good at Leblanc if that's how you feel about her revert. I was a Leblanc main from her release, until her rework. They killed her playstyle. They expected you to delete someone with her rework by asking the enemy to wait a moment while her passive winded up for the proc. The best thing riots done in years is revert the mage assassin back to how she is supposed to be.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-08-06T15:27:14.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate this champ soooo much. Literally the bane of my existence. All of my mid mains are countered by her she is one of the worst champions ever because even if you get her low she can jump away and then if you chase her she can change positions and your left PISSED AND TILTED AF.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ηıghτƒαιι","date":"2018-04-20T22:20:50.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Roaming champs are things like Twisted Fate and Taliyah who are amazing. Leblanc, although a roaming assassin, will lose to them because she can't clear the wave and roam at all.

Her winrate is just slightly lower than it was before the rework - and she was just released so a ton of new people playing her should tank her winrate a lot more, but it isn't.\n\nHer kit is too strong if people are doing as well as they are with no experience.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-04-19T06:30:09.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right??
