Shouldn&#039;t skills with a longer cast times have more benefits?\r\nThe main reason I ask is Aatrox&#039;s Dark Flight (Q), Aatrox as such a long wind up where he is stationary an vulnerable to cc and damage; and in the same game you have Tristana and Kha&#039;zix. Both these champions have leaps with little to no cast time and even have resests. People may argue that he has a knock up, but his knock up range is small and Zac has a leap with a knock up. And his wind up/ charge time has benefits for charging it.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-12T00:38:28.803+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, cast times are pretty important to creating meaningful gameplay for opponents especially, and they're honestly probably something we've been to quick to remove or \"improve\" on champions recently without meaningful consideration to what they're trading off for the luxury of an instant spell.\n\nUsing Aatrox as an example, his Dark Flight actually seems like it has a really powerful effect attached to it, so making it fire any faster seems pretty risky, especially since knockbacks and knockups are a pretty widely known and accepted response to someone using a movement ability toward you. I do agree with Kha'Zix having his instant leap (especially considering its reset nature) being somewhat questionable, but Tristana's Rocket Jump actually has a longer-than-average cast time.","replies":[{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-08-12T08:10:53.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your fear, but the fact is his Q can be interrupted mid-air, can also be dodged, or just missed, has a long cast time, and being his only gapcloser on a champion that relies on AutoAttacks to deal 95% of damage. Don't you think there's too much of counterplay?\nAlso why E has such a long cast time, and projectile movement speed? It's almost impossible to hit at max range on an unsuspecting enemy, don't mind in a fight.\nI understand, that when fed, Aatrox can be almost unstoppable. But if he gets at least a little behind, or even - he's just too weak, and can't fulfill his role of killing carries.\n\nOn another note, I would like to hear your opinion on his base stats. I don't think his passive justifies his base stats being so low. He is a melee AA champ after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-08-12T02:55:24.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rBsY1TvQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-12T00:38:28.803+0000)\n>\n> In my opinion, cast times are pretty important to creating meaningful gameplay for opponents especially, and they're honestly probably something we've been to quick to remove or \"improve\" on champions recently without meaningful consideration to what they're trading off for the luxury of an instant spell.\n> \n> Using Aatrox as an example, his Dark Flight actually seems like it has a really powerful effect attached to it, so making it fire any faster seems pretty risky, especially since knockbacks and knockups are a pretty widely known and accepted response to someone using a movement ability toward you.

Why does Volibear R? PBAoE abilities with a cast time seem really weird if all they provide is damage and a steroid.","replies":[{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-08-12T07:58:35.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He should at least be unstoppable when he uses Q. It would be more than fair. Knockup field is +- 1 Malphite big, it's very hard to hit with the cast time, and it can get easily interrupted, not only dodged.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
