And congrats to you and others who worked on the project skins.\r\n\r\nBut my question is will we be seeing anymore visual updates before the end of the year? I&#039;m talkind like Maokai and Kass level. I think there are a couple of champs who could use a few touch ups to bring them up to date. e.g. {{champion:20}}  {{champion:54}} {{champion:68}} and {{champion:77}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-25T16:18:50.715+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nI'm a part of skins team, which works on creating new skins content, as opposed to updated older content.

The team agrees that he could use a Visual Update, but currently, they are not working on him.\n\n-**Rumble** got some really nice VFX updates and his Texture Rebalance really improved his look, but there's no VU of some sorts in development for him.\n\n-**Malphite** should look as awesome as his new splash, the Texture Rebalance helped him, but he's currently not being worked on.\n\n-**Udyr** needs to be figured out (thematically) first. He needs to have a more cohesive look that will tie him to where he's from. His animations are clunky and his model is old, but the Texture Rebalance did help him a little. Nothing in the works for him in terms of Champion Updates, right now.\n\n-_-\n\nP.S- This obviously doesn't mean that we're never going to see 'standalone VUs' anymore. It's just that right now, with all the gameplay updates that are needed to be done, they (the gameplay updates) serve as great opportunities for Visual touches (whether they are big or small).","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2015-08-27T00:33:18.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks so much man","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2015-08-27T00:44:32.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, no problem. :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-08-22T20:05:44.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#[[5.17 Sci-Fi Update Mecha Skins?
