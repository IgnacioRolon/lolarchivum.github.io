Seeing as Vastayan have innate magical capabilities, have extreme longevity, super human strength, enhanced senses, sentient levels of intellegence (also taking into account members of their species like Ahri and Rengar who have/would be hostile to humans), What's stopping them from being the dominant sentient species on Runeterra, if not just Ionia? I doubt it would be their nature of being pacifists once again citing Ahri and Rengar. They are seemingly just as intellegent as humans, and I'm not asking why they don't concure the world, just think that they would be the dominant or largest species.\n\n2.) And **personally**, what do you think of humans being the seemingly weakest intelligent race? As lore develops and as we get more races, I don't get the impression of, \"hey here's a new race with differences and pros and cons or strengths and weaknesses\" as much as I get \"oh here's another race that's superior to humans in every sense of the word\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-04-03T19:12:11.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh shit, Have I been living under a rock?\n\nSince when?\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nCongrats dude!","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-04-03T19:14:18.471+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Few weeks now, just haven't had much chance to make it public knowledge.\n\nI haven't come off of the high that I got when I was asked to work for them.
