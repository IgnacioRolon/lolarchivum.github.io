Also, given that Urgot might become a higher priority for the team/company than Yorick (along with champions like Mordekaiser, Eve and Zilean), we could possibly see that relaunch released sometime in late 2017, which would mean a new skin for Christmas 2018.\n\nSo, we could actually see \"Winter Wonder Yorick,\" with a snowshovel and Poro Ghouls.  Would be nice, but I really don't want to wait another three years for ChampUp to get their \"special undead snowflake\" finished.\n\n(Hell, Zac might get another new skin before Yorick gets his first one.)","replies":[]}]}
