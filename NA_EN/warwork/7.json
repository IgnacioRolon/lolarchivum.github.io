I've mained Warwick for a few years now, so I should hope I can. \n\nPersonally, it's that fantasy of making people afraid of being alone. Of them knowing that you're coming for them and them alone and there's nothing they, or anyone else can do about it. Help is so far away, and it won't reach them in time. \n\nThe big problem with this right now is that the main way to do that is with damage, and a lot of Warwick's damage got nerfed fairly hard. Not to mention, damage means you need to be ahead. Without being at least somewhat ahead, Warwick doesn't have terrifying levels of damage. Of course, that's also very bad for game health, for a bruiser like Warwick to have terrifying levels of damage. \n\nIf I had to make a suggestion, I'd say explore the direction of increasing Warwick's single target effectiveness. I know Poppy's ultimate is a travesty, but this kind of idea, that a champion is coming for you and can't be stopped, is the kind of fantasy that Warwick thrives on. It might be possible to make it so that Warwick has to commit to going after a single champion, which would increase his effectiveness against that one champion. \n\nI don't recall which rioter posted the kit way back when Warwick was getting looked at, but it was a travesty.

Mainly need new animations :P\nFor me warwick identity is that of a blood craving werewolf, relentlessly hunting his prey. A bruiser kind of champion who can chase down fleeing oponnents and maul down almost anyone in 1v1 with his high sustain. He should stick to his target and be able to take advantage of bad positioning to suppress a key enemy (ult). \n\nPassive: I think the passive just need to be a bit more bloody visual wise not some green healing effect you would expect to see on soraka. Otherwise, it's fine as additional on hit damage since warwick always was a \"on-hit effect\" champ.\n\nQ: An interesting change would be a lunge/small leap and to match the werewolf team he should bite the target over clawing him. The range should remains near the same, the damage mechanic of whichever is greater is a pretty good way to gauge the power I think it should stay whatever happen. Now this could also apply On-hit which would go well with the on-hit identity of warwick. Also the healing\n\nBy the way, even without any functionality change the current Q would fit on a new kit.\n\nW: Now that's the ability I think needs to go, something I would love to see is some kind of fear, maybe some kind of \"empowered basic attack\" or a clawing attack akin to current Q. Of course the fear should not be very long, more like 0.3 seconds but should also apply a small slow and some additional damage. The cooldown should be significant enough.\n\nE: The most awesome ability of all, just like repertoire I agree that to play with the fear factor would be awesome, maybe an increase in range to all abilities toward market target (greater ult range would be scary as hell) and/or increased attack speed when attacking a marked target (a buff that would last 1-2 seconds and refresh on every attack).\n\nR: Now visually very underwhelming instead of a teleport warwick should leap at 1000+ missile speed and be completely unstoppable during the leap. I tink the supress should stay and this ability should pretty much stay the same or very similar. No matter what, it should in opinion still apply multiple time on-hit.\n\nWhat I think this would achieve: Put more importance on warwick as a hunter/pick maker and keep him as a very strong duelist.\n\nSomething that I would see as fun, but might be unviable overpower or just unfun is some kind of life steal from total damage done on auto attack, which would include on-hit somewhere on his kit, it could be on his ult (and during his ult only) and replace to additionnal life steal gain.\n\nI would love to know what other think of this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Express672","date":"2015-08-13T22:39:18.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do not change nothing of Warwick's ult and E. These abilities make him UNIQUE. I think he needs new passive and updated Q. Passive's Damage  is inutile cause of Enchantement Devourer damage stacking. Q has a low range and massive mana cost. Make him new Q - usable to ganks, but let still the healing. It's utile to kill the frog at level 1 while jungling. Decrease mana cost, increase the range. W is also cool and makes pushing easier. Do not change it as much . I play frequently warwick, he is one of my main champions. As him  i can carry games easy and kill champions quickly. He is one of the champions with highest DPS . His burst magic damage on hit makes him distinct of all physycal melee carries. \n\nDo not add him skillshots. The game must contain champions which are easy for begginers and Overpower. I thik you nerf all OP champions. I remember  for example the nerf of Veigar(He was very cool and f***ing OP) or the nerf of Akali's ult range and detonation of ,,Mark of assasin''. You  made Veigar's Q skillshot and  it made him very bad. He was easier to play before the change. Each nerf reduces the champion's win rate. These champions who need to be updated must be more funny and easier to play. For example Ashe was stupid and bad champion. I didn't like her. Now, before the passive and Q updates i enjoy playing as her. She's very, very OP. Tristana too. Updated AP Tristana is a MACHINE. She was a junk before the rework. These are my ideas on Warwick:\n\nPassive(Innate):\n\nHitting neutal monsters or lane minions with basic attack will cause them to burn for 25% of target's current health as physycal damage over 3 seconds.Warwick heals himself for 80% of that damage dealt.\n\n\nQ - Hungering strike\n\nActive: Warwick strickes an enemy dealing 10% of target's maximum health(+100% bonus AD), slowing it's movement speed by 65% for 2 seconds and reduces it's armor and magic resist by 30%. \n\nRange:650\nCost:40/45/50/55/60 mana\nCoowldown:10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 sec.\n\nI added AD scaling, armor and MR reduction, and additional slow at all ranks,because he must be strong  and gankable early game. It need also VFX update. It sounds like WW's critical attack.\n\nW - Hunter's call\n\nI didn't change the stats of the ability . I added new effect.\n\nNew effect: When Hunter's call is active Warwick increases has 20/30/40/50/60/70 bonus armor and 15/20/25/30/35% crowd control reduction.\n\nI think it will protect Warwick from high damge from ranged AD carries while using the ability upon pishing or lane farming.  Crowd control reduction is pretty good upon fighting hard CC tanks or mages with stun or massive slow. I decide to still half AS bonuses to nearby allies, because it's usefull in team pusing or while ganking.\n\n\nE - I didn't change this ability. It's very cool. He can move quickly toward enemy champions and he's able to slow them with Frozen Mallet or BOTRK.\n\nR - This is the main skill of WW. It deals massive magic damage, does good ganks  and it's  very powerfull in teamfights. Remember Riot: Do not change it as nothing.\n\n\nWarwick is also strong in top lane. He is the best counter of Riven. I beat her each time when i play as WW on top. \n\n\nWarwick IS one of my favorite champions and i love him such as is it, but i will enjoy any changes except of E, ult and added skillshots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tachi","date":"2015-08-11T03:32:14.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please give Warwick some priority.\n\nplskthankyou","replies":[]}]}
