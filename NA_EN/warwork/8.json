The problem with it is that it's directly tied to her damage output (and that it occasionally throws you random directions). Her problems as an ADC stem from her lackluster steroid (a % bonus AD buff on a time-based cooldown with semi-random target selection that can't crit - coupled with one of the most underwhelming AS steroids with the same problem), the complete unreliability of blind as a mechanic in general - and that the valor proc is tied to her only escape/disable. Her ulti is amazing as an assassinate and re-positioning tool (even if you never auto while you're valor), and vault's interrupt/slow coupled with a huge amount of ground covered for an ADC escape tool is equally impressive.\n\nVault is, in my opinion, the thing that makes her most iconic (and the fact that she can turn into a bird). Ideally, they'd leave it mostly untouched - though they can move the valor proc somewhere else for sure. I want to see her Q be relevant as a damage tool (or get a *real* form of CC attached to it), and her steroid buffed or reworked. The ult works as is, but I won't mind seeing it changed. It would be better for ADC if it did flat damage instead of execute, but as long as it keeps some form of movement speed (esp the ridiculous out-of-combat it has now), I won't even have to change how I play her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klaustukast","date":"2015-08-12T16:56:00.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO E should stun for ~0,75-0,5sec and her ult should get more execute damage.

There's been some pretty compelling discussions on what kinds of changes would be interesting for Quinn there recently (specifically here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/comments/3fxjqj/why_skystrike_needs_to_go_and_525_needs_to_stay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/comments/3fxjqj/why_skystrike_needs_to_go_and_525_needs_to_stay/)). I'll summarize a bit of the collected thoughts real quick:\n\nI know you can't give details out at this point, but I really hope that the main change you're looking at has to do with her ult, specifically Skystrike.\n\nIt seems like a lot of her powerbudget was spent on giving her this gigantic AOE ult. And while there are some edge cases where having it be AOE is nice, it seems like the optimal use for such an ult would be in a team fight, where it would hit multiple targets. But in the middle of a teamfight is usually not at all where Quinn wants to be. 99% of the time it's used to execute a single target.\n\nCould Skystrike be reworked into a single target execute? For example, you could allow harrier to still mark a target in Valor form, and then Skytrike could do more damage to the marked target based on how many autoattacks you were able to get off in Valor form. Instead of returning in a hail of arrows, Quinn returns with a single powerful shot/dagger strike.\n\nAlternatively, you could remove the execute entirely and just buff Valor - would be neat to bring Harrier into this as well, give Valor some sort of buffed attack to marked targets.\n\nFor both her gameplay and her theme, it feels to me that buffing up the 1v1, target marking, and scouting/roaming/splitting aspects of her character would work well. \n\nI just really, really, really, really hope you don't rework her into a viable duo lane ADC at the expense of her solo lane ability. I realize my vote counts for very little, and I definitely trust you guys (your champ reworks lately have been really compelling), but I've got almost 1,600 games on solo lane Quinn and I would be the saddest of pandas if she wasn't viable there anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ignoble","date":"2015-08-12T13:31:04.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change scale?

Riot has done a great job making valor feel bird-like. Fast, diving, high attack speed thats sticks to a champion but doesn't just kill them instantly like rengar. It's perfect.\n\nIn terms of \"I just ult when I see a target\", I have no idea what you are doing. If you stay valor you have better ms, dueling, and sticking power. Every time I ult it involves a lot of decision making - where I can go, who I can get, hoe long to stay valor, etc.  It seems like you ult without a target in mind, which is a complete misunderstanding on a fundamental way to play league, and not something riot should mess with a good champion for.","replies":[{"poster":"XpsYZ","date":"2015-08-12T17:53:46.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also don't think that Valor feels very bird-like.
