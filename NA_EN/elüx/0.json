If you have any questions about that, though, you'll want to hit up the moderators on discord.\n\nOtherwise, I'm happy to help get this troubleshooted!  If you're having issues reaching to the game server, I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to both tune up and rule out possibilities that might be causing the instability.  Keep in mind, even though it may not be your intention to leave games, the system is still going to treat them all equally due to the negative experiences they cause.\n\nLet me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
