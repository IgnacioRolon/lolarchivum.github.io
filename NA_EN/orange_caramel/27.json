It's about him outplaying himself. You need to rely on blitz playing pourly or not doing well in order to win lane/game against blitz. If he makes no mistakes then you have no chance to win lane or come back into the game. \n\nEvery Blitz games goes the same exact way. They invade the jungle at lvl 1, nothing comes out of it because everyone knows that blitz is invading. Then he enters laning phase and sits at the edge of his bush, wards dont matter because you already know where he was standing. youre 500 units behind your casters because 1 pull and thats a summoner or death. So at that point you hope the enemy ADC starts pushing, which he does because hes just as thirsty as blitz. Then blitz moves into your bush and youre now behind your tower while the enemy ADC has been free farming and yours has gotten no caster minions and most of the melees. But the thing is about this laning phase is that he hasnt used an ability. He just stood there and by using the threat of him landing a pull he has your bot lane zoned out and under farmed. \n\nHis pull is so game changing that it being off CD is a big enough threat to zone entire teams.\n\nGod forbid he actually does land a pull.\n\nOr laning phase goes like: Blitz walks into lane and immediately misses his pull. Then he and his ADC is zoned for the next 20 seconds while taking a lot of poke. Rinse and repeat.\n\nYou can't outplay a Blitz, he can only outplay himself.","replies":[{"poster":"KapnStubby","date":"2016-01-07T23:13:01.919+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Couldn't agree more, this is honestly exactly what happens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chickendoodles","date":"2016-01-08T00:44:58.188+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am a game design major in school right now and I swear I complain to my game design professor all the time about how how much I hate blitz and how he is basically designed to make a game unfun.

I have hated him ever since I started playing league, I do not know why people complaint about Tahm but completely forgt about blitz, He is another super tank with basically two health pools, very good utility and stupid stupid stupid burst damage. He must be the most zone controler support in league.\n\nLet me give you a fair and reasoned argument.\n\nYou write that he's a nightmare against healers. Tell me, what is the only way to win lane against a healer? All-in. Without Blitz and Thresh, a healer lane turns into a farm lane. Blitz is their counterpick. He is absolutely necessary to the health of the game in that sense. Without him and thresh, healers would be the new meta and nobody likes it when the heal meta is strong because it turns into a farm for 20 match.\n\nSame as above for Kogmaw. I won't say Koggy is in the best place right now, but back when he was good, blitz was another good counter. Kog's late-game scaling used to be absurd. You had two options against him: beat him badly in lane, or have a comp that can reach and kill him late-game. \n\nTankiness, he's not nearly as tanky as you make him out to be. His passive has a high cool-down and scales with mana. Off the top of my head, he generally only has 400 bonus in his items with Frozen Heart (they generally don't buy Iceborne). If he's fed, he might have 300 from Righteous Glory. They also usually don't have much health (compared with actual tanks). Ali, Leona, Thresh, Taric, and Naut, will out-tank him easily. In fact, he really only out-tanks healers and mages.\n\nHis damage his somewhat  high, but is reliant on his hook. His ult is bursty, but nothing special since he usually has no AP items. You might see banner of command, if that. I like rushing FQ on him by switching from relic shield, but then you have ZERO tank ability for the first 20 min. \n\nHis niche is a risk/reward champ. You have good games and you have bad games with him. He can single-handedly win it for his team, or lose it. If you pick him as a support you trade reliability for pick ability. Thresh is better in many ways. Blitz is much better at one. \n\nIf you want to win against him, pick Ali. He's a brain-dead support that is sleeper-OP and often a pick/ban in LCS. If he hooks you, IDGAF, and walk away. If he hooks your adc, punt their adc across the map and walk away. Then win teamfights with his BS knockups.\n\nSeriously, as a support main I dread the days everyone realizes how strong Ali is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canidae","date":"2016-01-08T04:05:37.491+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've, personally, played Sona and Soraka into ppl like Thresh and Blitzcrank lotsa times.\n\nfor {{champion:37}}, it's a bit harder cause U can get punished more easily for her more aggressive playstyle \n- poke behind minions (this is HUGE. the more dmg U dish out safely, the less likely they would want to engage and the less likely for an all-in to end in their favor)\n- punish them when they miss hooks (thresh is a bit more iffy cause he can still engage with flay and ult and stuff)\n- poke them A LOT (doesn't matter if it's the tanky support or the adc, hit 'em both) but,\n- never get hooked (this kinda seems obvious, but it's not totally impossible to do. with minion waves and the nature of being a ranged champ, there aren't gonna be many opening for them to engage without them, in turn, being punished for it // thresh hook is a bit more forgiving as the amount of danger ur in is inversely proportional to the distance that U got hooked from, a thresh that lands a hook on you from max distance isn't likely gonna get a decent engage out of it vs a blizcrank pull)\n- post 6, U can use their grabs as a reliable initiation....FOR YOURSELF to use Cresendo (input queueing OP)\n- during all-in focus the adc (compared to their dmg blitzcrank and thresh don't really hurt that much, especially if U began lane with MR flats/scaling.

If you hook their ADC, Thresh can leave a lantern behind them and the ADC will take a significantly lower amount of damage than he might have otherwise. If you hook the Thresh himself, then he can easily use his flay to disengage, which should delay Blitz's knockup punch. If he's feeling aggressive, he can use that as his own opportunity to all-in, setting up a Box and using a Flay of his own, while also saving the hook for later.\nOf course, a Blitz hook in the late game into the enemy team usually means certain doom for your opponents. Blitz is a really fun champion to play, but he's among the most anti-fun bot lane presences to play against.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hawkeye5454","date":"2016-01-08T04:23:34.035+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that he is more annoying in the game modes like blind pick and team builder where you can't see that you have to counter him","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-01-08T17:25:14.903+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is the main reason counterpick will never equal counterplay","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SelflessTeammate","date":"2016-01-08T18:04:06.936+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The odd thing about Blitz is, as someone else already pretty much said, he doesn't actually have to do anything to be intimidating. In fact, it's when he doesn't try to pull you at all for a very long time that it puts you totally on edge, whether you're the marksman or the support.\n\nYou ever lane super-cautiously against a weaving Blitz, trying your hardest not to screw up your positioning and trying to bait his Q out, but he doesn't cast his Q *freaking even once* for like five minutes straight? Scares the hell out of you, doesn't it? You can't tell if he's just trying to intimidate you or he's legitimately waiting for you to drop your guard because he's actually a freaking God at it, he just wants you to lose focus first.\n\nIt really does scare the hell out of you when you come across a Blitz who refuses to swing and miss at any point.

The only reason this is balanced is because he can't exactly poke you with it, it's an all-in. There's a reason he's not built like a mage, he *has* to build like a tank (or tank support) because he will get poked to death when his Q is off cooldown.\n\nIf full AP Blitzcrank was viable, Riot would likely nerf it. But his weaknesses prevent that from ever becoming the case, thank god. Can you imagine if it was, though?\n\nThe base damages, however, should concern you more.
