On top of that he kept spamming chat in Spanish. The only thing in English he would say was \"surrender now\".\n\nAfter the game, he was still spamming chat in Spanish, so out of curiosity I cut and pasted some of it into Google translate and it turns out he was calling us \"pubic hairs of a wh*re.\" Pretty creative, to be honest. \n\nMy question is does the IFS catch verbal abuse in other languages? It was obvious that this guy thinks he can get away with being abusive as long as it's in Spanish. \n\nI reported him, but I'm not sure it's going to do anything. Maybe he'll get punished for the inting, I hope...","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2019-04-21T01:16:00.818+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I believe you did the right thing by reporting :)\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-04-21T18:58:31.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> My question is does the IFS catch verbal abuse in other languages?\n\nPretty sure it can.
