For one, they create a sub-species of marksman that a player can purposefully direct their development toward, but they also provide for an interesting skill matchup in opposition and slight alternative in allied composition. I think they fill a similar niche in playstyle, but offer different enough assets to their composition when it comes down to why you'd decide on either one. Granting them a hypothetical equality in balance -- graves fits better into a wombo combo composition, while lucian fits better as a kiting and chasing duelist. The option to offer variety to your team while still being able to play to your stylistic strengths is a good thing, and something the adc role in particular suffers from (to clarify, ability-wise -- not auto-attack-wise, haha.)\n\nChampion similarities can be healthy and good as long as what differences there are provide a unique identity, I think Lucian and Graves fulfill this concept beautifully.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FloydR","date":"2015-09-20T23:16:32.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please no Draven...

I would rather we enhance the things that irelia mains love than just create something cool, but too different.\n\nYou know, the big thing that bugs me about riot's dialogues is that by the time that you guys have them with the players, the main things already tend to be decided on.  Let's say there are 3-4 potential irelia directions, and of them 2 that will make her fans happy.  Well riot will have picked which direction they want to go in even if it pisses off half the fans before talking to people.  \n\nPoppy is a good example of this.  Riot picked tank well before talking to the fans.  Fans wanted her as a fighter/bruiser hypercarry/anticarry.  Well, screw the Poppy mains who build damage, they're getting a tank.\n\nSorry to sound so jaded but I've gone through too many champ reworks where the big issues of the champ was decided _without talking to the fans before deciding things_, a bad direction was picked for a lot of the fans of that champ, and no new champ was made to compensate for whatever was lost from the game.\n\nSoraka is another example.  A number of people had fun taking her mid.  She was a niche mid.  Riot didn't even think about them in her rework.  So you can't even play her in that role anymore just because her kit is so ill equipped to handle a lane she was viable in before her rework.  Did her fans want a health cost on her W?  Nope, a good number of them didn't and that's still one of the biggest complaints about her from her fans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-09-21T08:05:44.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there in any future plans a possible revision and feedback on Cassiopeia and people who are discontent with her?
