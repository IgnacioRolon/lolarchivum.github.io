This page gives so much detail for so many things that other sites can't track and I love seeing it. \r\n\r\n* Thanks also for the highlights, it's always very fun to use :)\r\n\r\n* Thanks also for item pages! these help getting through the shop a lot faster when you're experienced on someone. Thanks for emotes as well! they're always fun for bming the enemy or just some positivity with your team. They have a wide range of cool stuff and they're generally pretty funny.\r\n\r\n* Thanks also for the pages that I have used maybe once or twice but has made the experience when I use them much better, the skins page, chromas, wards, and icons pages as well.\r\n\r\n* Thank you for the new map! I played back in the day with the old one and god was it ugly, and the new map was certainly worth the effort and the time put into it. Thanks as well for all the updates to older champs (except maybe aatrox :( ) keeping them uptodate and looking fresh.\r\n\r\n* Thanks for League voice! it's cool that we have it and although I think most people use discord more often it's nice to have it occasionally when discord goes down or some caveman you know doesn't have it.\r\n\r\n* Thanks for positional ranked! I remember having to call your roles right as you got into champ select and GOD do I NOT miss that at all! Thanks also for parties being open or closed, it's always a nice way to have your friends join.\r\n\r\n* THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CLASH - I know it's been a big project that has taken a long time to get ready and working well but it's so much fun and even though I don't play with my friends because they are way worse than I am at the game I found a random group of people and it's been so fun, we haven't lost a game yet! Won the whole beta bracket and the small 2 day bracket that was out a while ago.\r\n\r\nSure I have lots of criticisms of league and riot and some of the things they do as I'm sure we all do, but a lot of the things they do has gone unnoticed and un-thanked, and hey they're human too after all they aren't perfect. So I wanted to post this and hope at least one rioter saw it :)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
