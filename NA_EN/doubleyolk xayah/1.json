WIll they ever happen again?\nThe increased price of RP was due to the high dollar back in ~2015 - not that I know much of global economics, but it has apparently leveled out since then.\n\nAnd then there's the \"Early sales\". Come on, seriously? 1350 RP (~7.40 EUR) NOW or 975 RP (~5.36 EUR) in 6 months? You know damn well the majority ain't gonna wait 6 months to save ~2 EUR. 2 EUR times ~12 million is a helluva lot of money. Better bring back the usual promotional sales again.\n\nAlso, Support ticket ID #29926085\nIf the new client really is gonna take over, add more error messages.","replies":[{"poster":"Mod RookDio","date":"2017-04-23T22:43:32.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey PaladinNO,\n\nDue to the age and necroing on this thread I will be disabling further commenting on it, however to get visibility on this topic once more please feel free to start a new discussion about it and link to it so any and all important comments in it are easy to get to for reference.
