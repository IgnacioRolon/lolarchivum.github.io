I hate Kayle. I play a fair bit of aram &amp; I keep getting stuck with her.  I keep having to use my re rolls. Not fun.\r\nI have carefully curated my champion pool so that I am more likely to get champs I like to play.\r\nI have 3 refunds remaining, but I just cant figure out how to get rid of her.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T23:32:48.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Minarde mentioned, we can look into your specific case about removing content.
