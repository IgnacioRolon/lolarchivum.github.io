When I started it the game opened a crash report and asked me if I wanted to send one. I decided to restart the game and try to start a new private game but whenever I open the game it asks me to reconnect even thought the same thing happens everytime I try to reconnect. Since there arent any bots or anything in the game I dont know if it will end. If anyone knows how to fix this please help. It only just happened so I dont know if it automatically ends or what. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"LMOAMintyFresh","date":"2016-08-18T18:36:17.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey anyone who reads this in advance it automatically ended for me but you have to wait about 15 minutes give or take. This freaked me out like crazy because I thought I wasn't going to be able to access my account. If it doesn't work then try to send in a crash report because eventually I did that and a little while after it worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T20:43:36.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The crash reports you are getting are bugsplats, and they usually happen when a piece of hardware or game file fails to render the game properly.  The fix could be as simple as updating your drivers, but we have a [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help go over steps for a resolution.

I'm having a similar issue as the OP and this is the first time ever this has happened to me. I've been looking through threads through section of the boards and Dev Corner and it seems to be an issue many people are experiencing for the first time. Before I waste time trying fixes that may do nothing and  getting frustrated for no reason, is this an issue Riot has acknowledged? Is it partly due to the new patch? I update my drivers and maintain my computer frequently and the fact that I'm just experiencing this issue with no prior issues is extremely suspect to me especially with many of my fellow LoL players experiencing similar symptoms out of the blue. If Riot truly believe this is just an issue on our respective ends let us know, or if you guys at Riot are suspicious that something in the newest patch is causing an issue please let us know so we can proceed accordingly. Thanks\n\nBTP","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T15:00:38.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues may be resolved differently depending on each individual case.  Even though the symptoms might be similar that doesn't mean it's the same.  For example, we've been tracking issues where some players have been crashing while opening hextech crafting or in champion select.  We've found out that in some cases normal troubleshooting wouldn't necessarily fix it because it was due to either a windows update issue or third party programs.  Players were instead able to get it resolved by removing programs like play.tv and overwolf.  I definitely keep a close eye when I see posts of emerging issues, and a lot of these resolutions were in part thanks to the community that helped troubleshoot and paid it forward!\n\nAs for your specific issue, give me some details about what you're seeing and when, and we can figure it out together!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
