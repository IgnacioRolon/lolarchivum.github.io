During this match, I had no intent on deliberately helping the enemy team and causing my team to lose the game. If you look at the game where I was playing as Wukong, it&#039;s evident that my KDA wasn&#039;t that great and from an outside perspective it looks as if I wanted to lose. However, I still continued to play and try my best against my laner who was quite fed at that point. I decided to go to other lanes to snag some kills, especially on the Anivia who was vulnerable in lane. I made mistakes here and there and I died multiple times to Anivia and her jungler, J4. My teammates started calling me out for intentionally feeding and I didn&#039;t know how to respond to them. My teammates then told the enemy team to report me as well, and the enemy team also believed I intentionally fed them. To add on, the rest of my team didn&#039;t do well against their own matchups and practically gave up as well. Looking back at my match history, I have multiple games where I had many deaths and people believed I was intentionally feeding, but this wasn&#039;t the case in all of them. I have a very erratic and aggressive playstyle but I do genuinely try to cooperate with my teammates regardless of what they think of me. I have no way of proving that I never intentionally fed, but I assure you the thought of intentional feeding has never crossed my mind. I sent a support ticket to Riot yesterday but no response yet, and the end of the season is approaching so I fear that my deserved rewards will not be given to me. I&#039;m aware that a lift on a ban would normally not be lifted under any circumstances, but I believe that this is one of those cases where the Instant Feedback system wrongly punished a player. I implore a Rioter to take a look at my case and consider an unban, thank you.\r\n\r\nLink to match history: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2638460811/202396175?tab=overview\r\nThe 12 minute game makes it apparent that my team gave up, but not as a result of my actions. They all wanted the game to end and quickly gave up, even as I continued to try to fight the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-07T23:01:29.456+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"10 deaths in 12 minutes, boots of mobility rush into a losing lane, and three deaths into the enemy mid tower don't really indicate not throwing.

We can tell exactly when and where you died. Lets see. You rush mobi boots and nothing else. You stopped farming. You died mid under their tower several times. As a matter of fact, the game says you died twice at 4:10 (Lol) which means you probably died, then immediately TPed to feed another lane. Overall you died 10 times in a 12 minute match. You bought absolutely zero items until 6 minutes at which time you bought a pair of boots which you upgraded to mobis a minute later\n\nNot a single doubt in my mind you inted. Not sure what would possess you to do that the last day of the ranked season. I wanted to warn you that your account is on super high alert. Any form of toxicity can trigger a permanent ban at this point. Even super mild toxicity. Do whatever you gotta do to reform because this is your last chance. Use these next two weeks to find a way to keep yourself calm.
