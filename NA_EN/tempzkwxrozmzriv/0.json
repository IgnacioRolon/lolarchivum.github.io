Recently I've had strange lag where my game briefly freezes like the frames have stopped whenever I issue a ping using alt/g/v such as to ping targeting something. It doesn't happen when I use hotkey pings which I have set to other keys. It doesn't occur again when pinging multiple times. The delay time also can vary, sometimes its just a few frames but others can be a whole second or so. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on what this could be, or how I could manage it? I tried looking to see if anyone else had the same issue but didn't find anything. \r\nThanks c:","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-29T16:28:52.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be some bad game assets specifically failing to render properly when using pings.
