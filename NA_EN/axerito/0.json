I came up with three changes and I will explain them below.\n\n1. Soraka&#039;s passive movement speed bonus getting Volibear&#039;s Q treamment. It feels really bad to lose all movement speed when you have to go around a wall to save a low hp ally. Decaying ms would make Soraka&#039;s passive a way more reliable tool to use.\n\n2. Her E getting a higher tickrate. Right now her E silence refreshes in 0,25 second intervals which allows many champions to freely cast spells when inside a silence zone if they get out of Zhonya&#039;s, GA or use things like Fizz E or Zed shadows. Increasing the tickrate to 0,1 second or more would greatly reduce the number of situations where this spell is not working as intended.\n\n3. Rejuvenation bonus from hitting Q procing from epic monsters. Right now Soraka is pretty uninteractive when it comes to contesting Dragon or Baron. She can only deal a small amount of damage with Q and use her W heal with no way of restoring her own health after using it. Allowing Soraka to proc her Q passive on epic monsters (but not large) would allow her to be more interactive with the game and feel more enjoyable for Soraka player to play around objectives. Not to mention a quite similar ability, Rakan&#039;s Q, works on epic monsters.\n\nWhat do you think about those changes? Will Riot ever implement them?\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2018-04-02T12:17:59.527+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"These are some really nifty suggestions.

Make her ultimate a skillshot (similar how Heimers grenade or Cho´s Q are working) which is globally.

This ult would also have a charge system. (Allies will see an indicator where her ult will hit)\n\n2. Increase the impact of her healing on the W but also give it a longer cooldown, so she has to make more impactful decision when to heal which ally (especially in teamfights).\n\nThis changes would increase her skill ceiling while also giving her larger room to be buffed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2018-04-03T00:33:29.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be willing to see her iconic ultimate changed if it meant we could have more fun stuff in the rest of her kit.\n\nAs for the second change, well, that just sounds like partially reverting her W to what it used to be (minus the armor buff) which is fine by me. Larger heals on a longer cooldown tend to be more fun for me.
