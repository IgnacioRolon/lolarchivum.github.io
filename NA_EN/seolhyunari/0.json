You newer players have no idea whats going on. \n\nEDIT: For whoever doesn't know how 1,000 was achieved (there was a very nasty comment removed): You needed to sell your boots at the end + go heavy on AP runes + buy elixir + have fully stacked mejai (old version) + have a team member with the original 'Will of the Ancients' for the 40 AP aura. Baron was another +40.\n\nI am NOT pulling numbers out the air: A full page of AP runes + AP/level mastery, + fully stacked Mejai (180ap mejai) + old Death Cap (155ap flat +30%) totaled nearly 500 AP. WITH JUST TWO ITEMS. Blue buff would give you 35% cdr and mana regen so you just used that.\n\nLeBlanc rushing Mejai used to creep people out for this reason, that was actually scary if she started \"snowballing\". This is when alot of mages got their original 'reputation'. For example original Vladimir simply hard-carrying lategame with his nuke-imir build where very few things could even survive his initial REQ combo (4 stacks on E always being kept up, and typically used ghost). People started calling Malz's E 'space aids' because his E would absolutely finish you after he nuked everyone hard with just his Q. Also the original Ryze being notoriously hard to kill or even stand toe to toe with lategame. This how mages were! They had super low base armor to start, were limited by mana costs early, and typically low base damage but good ratios so they really didnt do much at levels 1-3 and needed items. Thats why we never saw something like full tank Brand top, the class just didn't work that way. I first noticed that the community became very hostile towards mages being 'AP carries' when Zyra/Fizz were released. For Zyra, the complaint was that she had too much cc to have the standard mage ratios she was given, so she was nerfed pretty hard and vanished from midlane. And I think since then they started this philosophy of things with cc should not do damage, and things with defensive attributes should not give damage, and that bursty things like Fizz are unhealthy because of zero counterplay. Those complaints were valid to a point but I think they went wayyy overboard.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2017-07-26T15:09:13.420+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The 7th Sister,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OPs6ysI5,comment-id=000a0001,timestamp=2017-07-25T17:42:11.975+0000)\n>\n> lol only 600? and you act like AP applies to basic attacks by comparing it to AD?

The other thing that is important is that mages have damage and utility packed into their kits. Utility will 100% scales better then pure damage like marksmen or adcs. That's why utlity adcs are so highly prioritized in LCS play.  Mages not only have area of effect damage that can burst multiple targets, but also come equipped with large amounts of utility and waveclear. There is at least 10+ mages that will outscale an ADC or marksmen easily.  The other advantage is having massively long range to avoid engagements vs other shorter range classes.  Is the reason why siege comps are so brutal is from all the poke that mages bring to the table.   That and burst will always be better then damage over time, which marksmen are for the fact that it allows mages to unload their kits even when caught out or take out a squishy target instantly.
