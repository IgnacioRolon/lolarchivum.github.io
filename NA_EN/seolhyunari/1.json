Zed's combo for example will usually leave an ADC at around 20% hp after flash, heal, and then shields from supports which are almost always active. That would be fine, because lots of cds were blown in order to save the ADCs life, but the adc can simply drain tank back to full hp in a couple auto attacks because minions and monsters have little to no armor (thus huge crits grant even larger lifesteal)  - so the entire trade almost always ends up in the favor of the ADC.\n\nWhy do you think assassins are almost never picked in competitive play? Peeling and shielding supports are so god damn strong combined with that ADCs are capable of deleting entire teams while also having insane safety and good early game that whichever bot lane wins almost always results in a victory for them.\n\nAlmost without exception top teams in the LCK and CSL (Korea + China) put their strongest players in the ADC and support role. The only notable exception is probably Faker, but his adc is almost as good as he is. If bot lane wins, you win the game almost by default.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2017-08-08T03:38:42.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Akali can take less than a second\nEvelynn can\nKassadin can\nShaco I'm not sure about but I believe can\nTalon... yeah, he does\nAll of the other Assasins I listed there are able to use special niches to survive long enough for their full burst - or is listed as an exception.","replies":[{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2017-08-08T03:47:17.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lupan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=By3ORumQ,comment-id=0000000000010001000000020000,timestamp=2017-08-08T03:38:42.724+0000)\n>\n> Akali can take less than a second\n> Evelynn can\n> Kassadin can\n> Shaco I&#x27;m not sure about but I believe can\n> Talon... yeah, he does\n> All of the other Assasins I listed there are able to use special niches to survive long enough for their full burst - or is listed as an exception.\n\nNo, none of those take less than a second to 100-0 an adc unless they are egregiously ahead. They can chunk to say 30% but it's not a 100-0, they have to either wait for their abilities to set up for the 100-0 or wait for a short cd after the squishy is super low.\n\nTalon is possibly the only exception but since W is a huge part of his combo AND has a delay, I hesitate to call him one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2017-08-07T17:19:45.632+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lupan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=By3ORumQ,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-08-07T17:09:12.343+0000)\n>\n>  Your single combo as an assassin takes less than a second and deals more damage than multiple ADC autos. \n\nThis used to be true.
