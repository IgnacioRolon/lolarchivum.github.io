Very similar to how the tail on a Vulpix or a Ninetails looks looks for reference. Simplistic and could potentially reduce a lot complexity in her model :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-02T20:23:00.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Swizzle, \n\nI'm getting an 0/10 repro on this one.
