Based on this data, 70 something champions (far over half) HAVE gotten skins this or last year, and that's a ton of skins for half a year. And that's not counting the amount of skins that got Visual updates when their champions did, and the amount of champions that came out. Not many people realize this, but when a champ gets a Visual Update, all their skins that got updated take as much time and effort as making a 750 skin, and a new champion takes as much planning and work as a Legendary or Ultimate skin. It's really an amazing feat in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zenfro","date":"2015-09-06T20:37:34.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-09-06T22:34:02.189+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I doubt that popularity has that much to do with skins.\nAfter all making skins for less popular champs can be even more profitable for the game as a whole,because skins can make unpopular champs more popular,thus making more players buy these champs.\n\nOverall it has a lot to do with:\n-How many skins a certain champ already has(champs with a lot of skins will receive less skins,thats pretty much the reason why skarner got battlecaset and guardian of the sand so quick after each other,because he didn't have that many skins)\n\n-How easy it is to make a skin for said champ(thats why zyra&Zac don't get that many skins,zacs model is a nightmare when it comes to skins and zyra has extra models for all her abilities)\n\n-If said champ gets a big rework or not(thats why Yorick,Taric,etc.don't get any skins,because they get a large VU anyway)\n\n-If Riot has an idea they really want to add as a skin,they'll do it regardless of the above factors,sometimes a champ fits too well for an event or skinline,that they add a skin even if it goes against the above guidelines(thats why ekko&Rek'sai got new skins so fast,thats why Dianas second skin took so long)","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-07T20:03:52.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Assassin**\nKassadin: 4 skins \nKatarina: 8 skins\n**Fighter**\nOlaf: 4 skins\nRiven: 5 skins\n**Mage**\nSwain: 3 skins\nSyndra: 4 skins\n**Support**\nTaric: 3 skins (even though)\nSona: 6 skins\n**Tank**\nSion: 4 skins\nJarvan IV: 6 skins\n**Marksman**\nUrgot: 3 skins\nVayne: 6 skins\n\nI think that popularity does hold some standards.

Riven though, has to have a completely remodeled sword and a new slash for her R.\n\nCan't put much of a argument with the Swain one, but I still would like one none the less as Malzahar and Vladimir are in the same boat as he is and they got skins.\n\nI'm referring to **before** his planned relaunch as Sona was there almost as long as he was and she still got way more.\n\nUrgot's relaunch could be years away compared to how their going along with Poppy's and Taric's.

Examples include Hecarim, Rumble and Shyvana.\n- Had a visual update. Examples include Tristana, Heimerdinger and Sion. Especially Sion, who had an entire relaunch, the biggest update for a single champion so far.\nWith all that in mind, few of these champions require a new skin, and most who do are getting visual updates, so they might not get skins for a long time, even after their updates.
