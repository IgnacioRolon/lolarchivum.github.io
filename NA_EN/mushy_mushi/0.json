I tried changing the settings but even on lowest it drops from 60 to 40 all the time which is really annoying! Also, I don't really know how to describe it, but the image is really jerky all of a sudden, even when fps counter shows 60 fps... It makes me really sick and dizzy, now I have trouble finishing a game without feeling like I'm going to throw up...\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}} \nUntil now I was running the game on medium without any issues! If that's any help, graphics card in my laptop is Intel HD Graphics 3000 and I'm running Windows 10","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T00:40:11.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes, we definitely don't want you pulling vomit on your keyboard mid-game xD!!!\n\nWhen you mentioned that sometimes your FPS starts going crazy and super stuttery, but the FPS number still shows 60, it kind of sounds like you might be having problems with something called packet loss. Basically, that means that parts of your connection are getting corrupted before it reaches our servers. DO me a favor and grab the network logs from that match if you can and have this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them for any issues. Take a screenshot and post it here using something like Gyazo so that I can take a look with you!","replies":[{"poster":"mushy mushi","date":"2017-11-04T09:02:37.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there was something wrong with my laptop not with the game, luckily everything is back to normal now!
