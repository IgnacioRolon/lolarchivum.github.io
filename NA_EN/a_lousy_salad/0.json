It really sucks that you accidentally completed on of the missions lines without realizing, and even more shitty that it prevents you from getting that sweet reindeer poro. \n\nI've gone ahead and reset those missions for you, so make sure you refresh your client to see it take effect and complete the mission you want this time ^_^!\n\nPS Be sure to let me know in a reply if this didn't work correctly for some reason!!","replies":[{"poster":"techno bb","date":"2017-12-16T22:08:52.531+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"DEAR BEAUTIFUL AND DIVINE Broporo,\n\nI TOO have fallen to the clutches of the accidental BARON PORO..
