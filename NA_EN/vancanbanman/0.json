The boards say she has burst levels of damage (Can't confirm, source: Don't play botlane often and games end in 15 minutes anyway so I barely get to interact with her, also the last game I played supp with her on the opposing team we kinda stomped so she did nothing) \r\n\r\nWe know she can build mixed damage, (Which would be okay i guess if it weren't for the lack of good mixed def tank items [RIP {{item:3512}}  ] and the existence of {{item:3157}}, {{item:3135}}, and {{item:3165}}  )\r\n\r\nWe know she is super mobile with her ult able to be a flash with a shield in teamfights (and a good engage for picks if you get a good w snipe) with her e giving her MS AND Invis in top of it being an AS steroid.\r\n\r\nWe know she is unfun to play against\r\n\r\nBut how do y'all think we can balance her and make her fun to play against WITHOUT gutting her/ giving her a full rework??","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-10-27T04:57:26.270+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reduce the movement speed on her E at low ranks, but make it the same as it is now at max rank. Compensate with slightly better AD/AP scaling on everything else. \n\nThat's literally it. \n\nKai'Sa's problem is that she's both incredibly safe pick and a hyper carry. She has the mobility to engage on her enemies to secure kills or get away from a bad situation right out the gate. She can scale up to an absolute monster, but has a safety net in the laning phase for dodging skillshots and disengaging from fights on a low cooldown. \n\nMake her E start as a channel for her attack speed stim that slowly evolves into a pseudo-dash, not a speed buff that evolves into an even better speed buff. \n\nIf she isn't as safe in the laning phase, she'd be easier to shut down before she starts to snowball and would need to position better to make sure she doesn't get caught out. Higher scaling would reward players who actually lane correctly and play around her weaknesses with more potent damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-10-27T11:19:17.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She got picked again right now.  SPLYCE vs SKT. Can't say I am not amused though.\n\nEdit: Kai'Sa picked again, Round 2, by SKT this time.\n\nEdit2: SKT seems to like this Double ADC comps. They have done that 2 times so far. Won both.\n\nEdit3: SPLYCE picked Kai'Sa, Round 3, against SKT. I am starting to see a trend here.\n\nEdit4: Kai'Sa picked again by SPLYCE. Round 4.

It would be more interesting if you picked two depending on your teams comp and the enemy's comp. She shouldn't be getting all three every game. \n\nLike picking Q and W allows you to be a mage, picking E and Q gives you the normal hypercarry playstyle, W and E allows you to play like an assassin? Idk but from a thematic perspective it is kinda boring that she gets all three. Her evolving should be evolving to fit in with her team, not just become a huge jack of all trades hypercarry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShyImagoghnar","date":"2019-10-27T04:45:46.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"remove ap scaling from everything other than passive and w\n\ncompensation buffs elsewhere ofc","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-10-27T04:57:37.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I fail to see what that's actually meant to achieve.\n\nLike...I wouldn't necessarily be against it, but what are you actually trying to do with that change?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-27T06:38:41.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VanCanBanMan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x2QrMeYr,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-10-27T04:42:35.093+0000)\n>\n> games end in 15 minutes anyway so I barely get to interact with her, also the last game I played supp with her on the opposing team we kinda stomped so she did nothing\n\nwow yeah totes op nerf now","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-10-27T04:50:40.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":">The boards say she has burst levels of damage \n\nAnd there's your first mistake.
