When this happens, she's already near level 6 and once she hits 6, lane's over. You can no longer engage  since she'll just e you, at which point you have 2 losing choices: 1. stay to fight and let her ult and kill you or 2. back off immediately after taking the e and get outraded and be infected by tentacles for a few seconds. You get outdamaged in both scenarios. So you just have to endure her q and e spams and only be able to capitalize when she whiffs everything - ball is entirely in her court.\n\nThe most ridiculous part is the above holds true even if you manage to get a few kills on her early. She will always hold a dueling advantage when both sides land all abilities even if she's reasonably far behind.

And I'm not talking about a vessel making you unable to fight her.... No... I'm talking about one grabbed vessel chunking you and forcing you completely out of lane, not even being able to B but having to run all the way back to your base to not die to her tentacles. Then the only way I've seen her lose is for teams to split push around her and end the game without actually fighting her. Because she destroys 1 vs 2s and 1 vs 3s (and more if fed).","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-06-25T21:55:08.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"im stuck on level 5.Nobody will pick pantheon into my illaoi anymore :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-06-25T21:23:17.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sotere,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0Fe1Ae8J,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-06-25T20:59:40.579+0000)\n>\n> Up until now, they&#x27;ve been paying me.
