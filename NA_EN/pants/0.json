But when i am in champion select, and i go to change my ward skin that specific ward skin doesn't show up. It is inside of my accounts \"Purchase History\" but not on the actual account itself. I have photos of my purchase history and outlined the ward skin, but prefer not to link any pictures of my account to public forums. Is this a bug or is this intended for some strange reason? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:42:19.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're aware of some issues that prevent certain wards from showing up on both profile collections and in champ select. This is purely a visual issue, as the ward still exists on your account, you just can't see it. We're looking into a fix, but I don't have a timeline on when you'll see that roll out.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhixE","date":"2016-08-23T09:18:12.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same with me ! i get a ward from chest when i make to permanent and it doesnt show! and i get rising dawn ward!","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeniVidiVictory","date":"2016-08-15T22:16:58.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting pretty salty that I can't use my s3 championship ward.
