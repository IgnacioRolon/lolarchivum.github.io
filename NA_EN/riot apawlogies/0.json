Clicked on Hextech icon, client crashes. After re-logging in (and closing previous &#039;still open&#039; client), I note that my number of available chests had not decreased. Clicking on Hextech icon allows me to enter it no prob. This has happened twice that I&#039;ve noticed.\r\n\r\n1. Have Hextech chests available, note the number available.\r\n2. Play a match. Do not get an S-rank, a team-mate gets a S-rank\r\n3. Observe in post-game lobby that a chest was not granted\r\n4. Click on Hextech crafting, game should crash.\r\n5. Re-enter game, note number of available chests","replies":[]}
