We were wondering why he hadn't returned from an ordinarily quick trip to the loo, and just before ensuring he hadn't succumbed to frost bite or primal goring, I noticed that while he was offline on our friends list, his avatar was still listed in the Team Builder lobby. I just wanted to let you know in case there's a bunch of stalled Team Builder games out there, with one or more people disconnected and their comrades none the wiser, waiting forever in the ghost of a game that will never be played.\r\n\r\nKeep up the great work! \r\n\r\n- Happened roughly Nov. 14, ~11 pm PST\r\n- Friend does disconnect now and then, seems to be on the ISP side of things. Loses all connectivity, not just LoL for an extended period of time\r\n- He was not the party leader\r\n- No indication he was DC'ed, only knew from Friends list, ghost stayed in group. Had to disband and re-make\r\n- Timer kept going","replies":[]}
