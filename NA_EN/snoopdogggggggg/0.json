I muted the players that were harassing me, that were talking about sensitive topics such as race, religion and politics to frustrate me; so reasonably I responded in a somewhat toxic way before muting them. For this I was given a 14-day ban. My issue with this is- I do not believe anything I said in these games were ban worthy. Especially since they were so far apart and the comments were so mild. So I was wondering, do you think this is ban worthy? I am unsure at this point and feedback from the community and staff would help put my mind at ease.

It also looks MUCH worse out of context.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T04:56:50.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Kokua pointed out, those lines aren't really showing that you're trying to work with your teammates but just trying to put them down.

It wasn't just this instance that resulted in a 2-week, but rather it was due to your previous punishments being escalated since the behavior continued.\n\nI know you mentioned muting them in the long run, but overall, fighting fire with fire isn't excusable or the best way to diffuse a situation.

Racism isn't limited to certain groups, and you've been pretty racist towards whites in general. You're creating a negative mood for other players in the game, and put down other players based on their previous games. I would say yes, this is ban worthy.","replies":[{"poster":"SnoopDogggggggg","date":"2018-01-19T03:44:08.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do not apologize or take back anything I said regarding the first bit.
