The best way to prevent that from happening would be to use an ethernet/hardwired connection instead of wifi. If that's not possible at all, try going through the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure everything is properly configured. I would pay special attention to the steps on firewalls to make sure those aren't blocking your network!","replies":[]}]}
