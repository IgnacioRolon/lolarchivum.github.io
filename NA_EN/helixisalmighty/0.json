Usually, I manage to get 60fps most of the time when I set it to 720p and very low settings, as well as closing my other applications (my computer isn't very good). However, since this patch, at the beginning of every game now my fps never gets to even 40. Later on, the game becomes unplayable, with less than 1 fps. I can no longer play without risking ruining the game for my team because my fps is so inconsistent. I tried using both the beta client and the legacy client, but the problem persisted with both. \r\n\r\nHere are my specs: \r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010)\r\ncpu: 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\r\nram: 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\r\ngpu: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB\r\n\r\nHope I can find a way to resolve this, thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T05:12:46.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a number of things that could cause FPS issues on a Mac, but the most frequent factors are typically missing system updates or power settings.
