My ping doesn't change, I'm certain it has nothing to do with my internet, and my fps doesn't change. Everything in the game acts normal except my loss of control. It's not my keyboard or mouse because this is the only game it happens in, and I'm still able to do everything fine except control my character. I've ran a repair already and it's changed nothing. I honestly have no clue what it could be.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T02:31:39.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This often happens as a result of bursts of [*packet loss*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss) or *high packet buffering*.
