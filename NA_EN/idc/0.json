As stated in title fps jumps around from sub 30 to 144 where its capped. Ive tried lowering all settings, turning off all background applications, repairing the patch, checking my conntection and I can't seem to troubleshoot. Reddit removed my post before it could gain any traction, so here I am. I run the game on a 1060 drivers updated this morning. Before patch i was hitting 120 consistently ping was around 50~","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T04:59:25.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you describe your ping and fps jumping around, it makes me feel like something is trying to interfere with League or maybe those game files aren't working properly after the patch.

All my in game settings are as they were, as they need to be. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still having the same issues now.
