Over the years they've said he's been in and out and in and out of the rework team's work load because they said they never have been able to preserve his playstyle and modernize him. This is why it took having the dedicated relaunch teams that worked on Sion/Poppy available before they were finally able to make progress on pushing him through. The fact that he's been publicly announced and plunked on the Update schedule page means he's very very far in development, if not nearing completion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lysdexic1","date":"2016-06-22T17:54:44.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, i just had a great idea for a Janna skin!
