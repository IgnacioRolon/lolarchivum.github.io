I&#039;m constantly looking for ways to understand and breakdown the conceptual process for champions that I think work very well and are designed very well. There are only a few different &quot;early concepts&quot; of champions out there. And I think that a lot of people (or at least, not just me) would like to see some early designs of our favorite champions.\r\n\r\nThe ones that I would personally really want to see are:\r\n\r\n - {{champion:157}} Yasuo, the Unforgiven: Yasuo is one of those champions that got me instantly exited for him when I saw his reveal. When I first saw him, I instantly thought how beautifully designed he was. The way his color works with his overall aesthetic, as well as how it interacts with his environment. I mean, I&#039;ve taken to his design so much that I even wrote a 6 page design analysis on him. Involving design theories (trying to get inside the heads of the designers) and breakdowns of everything on him. Seeing his early conceptual stages would really be helpful to me, because of how much he has influenced my own art and designs.\r\n\r\n - {{champion:429}} Kalista, the Spear of Vengeance: I think Kalista was really brilliantly designed. She is a champion that (to me) is groundbreaking in so many ways. She is a female champion that looks practical in her clothing (exception {{champion:89}} ), she also is a whole new female body type that we haven&#039;t seen in LoL before. On top of all of that, it seems natural. it doesn&#039;t really seem like it was a character you guys felt you HAD to do, but more one you really WANTED to do. So, I think that seeing her concepts from early drafts to later drafts, would be really cool of you guys. [I KNOW THERE IS SOME STUFF OUT THERE FOR KALISTA, it would just be nice to see more]\r\nKalista final concept here: http://pre02.deviantart.net/5dfc/th/pre/i/2014/308/e/6/kalista__the_spear_of_vengeance_by_the_bravo_ray-d85a2r1.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n -  {{champion:432}} Bard, the Wandering Caretaker: For real guys, Bravo. Bard looks so nice. In my opinion, Bard is a really solid design. He seems so cohesive to me. The heavy Studio Ghibli inspiration is something that I noticed right away, and I would like to see if that was always there, and what kinds of stages he went through to become the beautiful, bearded, Bard we see today. [AGAIN, I KNOW THERE IS STUFF OUT THERE FOR BARD, again I just think it would be cool to see even more]\r\nBard final concept here: \r\nhttp://41.media.tumblr.com/8f675c85919d717b0aaf1cee9c5c0888/tumblr_nnxx49YjxJ1s0k4v0o1_1280.jpg\r\n\r\n- {{champion:236}}  Lucian, the Purifier: To me, Lucian is a very interesting champion. Meaning, I feel his concept process was very complicated. Almost like it took him a while to come to his full identity. I&#039;m just really curious to see what kinds of Lucians there were before we got the slick, vengeful, ghostbuster we see today. [SAME GOES FOR LUCIAN AS IT DOES KALISTA AND BARD, I just want to see some early stuff man]\r\nLucian final concept here: \r\nhttp://orig14.deviantart.net/f14b/f/2013/239/5/2/lucian___final_color_concept_by_eoinart-d6jybqu.jpg\r\n\r\nOkay, those are my main requests. I don&#039;t mean to sound like &quot;Oh man riot sucks they don&#039;t release concept art.&quot; And this might be A LOT to ask. But, I&#039;m hoping you guys will be able to share the early concepts with me and the rest of the league community.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you guys!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n- Obokuri (or, Kino)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2015-07-14T18:29:49.110+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you happen to catch the [Ekko Concept Timeline](http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1432919808/EkkoTimeline.jpg) we shared during his Q+A?

The fluidity of motion that leads to could probably open up some interesting gameplay and art expressions. Rollerblades also have a punk-ish feel (thanks to Jet Set Radio, I'm sure!), which is probably why they showed up for Ekko and Vi specifically at different points.\n\nFor Ekko specifically, this version came at a time when we were still trying to flesh out our punk genius from Zaun. We'd been talking about him being young, fast, athletic - somebody who could survive and thrive running around Zaun. I believe we were also discussing parkour-ish tendencies. One of the artists mocked that up to see how the team felt about the direction, but we decided that other stuff felt more right. \n\nPersonally, I think Ekko is rough enough around the edges that rollerblade motion wouldn't have fit him as well. Still, it's a cool thing. I wouldn't be surprised if we do something like this eventually!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Podge","date":"2015-07-15T00:32:57.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah!

You have to work with archetypes. Archetypes make it easier to get the cut of a character's gib without a lot of exposition. So maybe her personality isn't necessarily the most unique. But her silhouettes stands out from a line up, and she is unlike anything in League right now. Her visuals tell more than her personality does. And thats pretty solid character design if you ask me.\n\nI mean, take my main man: {{champion:157}}, Yasuo. Personality wise he is just your dishonored samurai. Your basic Ronin character. Aragorn in LoTR is a great example of that. Your once proud warrior who, either through hubris or apathy, has fallen from honor. Who, now is on a quest for redemption. \n\nLike, you can't ever get a 100% original character. In fact, what makes good character design is taking those old archetypes and add a new, unique take on it. Sometimes it might always hit home as hard, which is Jinx's case. But, I think trying to find 100% unique characters in a game without really ANY ROOM for exposition. \n\nAnd I'm not saying Riot doesn't put thought into it's characters, but rather, I'm saying that its a really big request for these characters that we can't spend a whole long story learning about.
