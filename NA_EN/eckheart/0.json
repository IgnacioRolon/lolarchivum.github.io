Then some chad on the other team bans Darius because no fun is allowed. Then I dodge and wait 5 minutes. I get top and lock in Darius. The enemy mid takes Kat from our mid lane and they dodge because their champ is taken. Next lobby the enemy team bans darius and I dodge and get a 15 minute timer. Why the fuck does this game fucking exist to ruin my fun. Fun Is not fucking allowed. Where the fuck is team builder. Fuck.\n{{sticker:darius-angry}}\n\nYou think I don't know I'm a hypocrite I'm trying to play a game and have fun.

You won't get the same 8-9 players that way, so there's no way the other team could know to ban Darius just because of you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2018-03-22T21:43:07.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eckheart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ab05GIJN,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2018-03-22T20:37:58.935+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s not the problem.

Honestly, he would be my top ban list champion if I didn't have such a hatred for {{champion:75}} but if Nasus is already banned then I auto ban Darius. (Though I only really ban Darius if I am going top lane. I don't mind Darius's Mid/Late game or team fighting, just lanning against him is not fun at all and ruins any hope for the early game.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2018-03-22T20:13:50.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irony\ni·ro·ny\nˈīrənē/\nnoun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-22T20:03:48.382+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about the fun of all the people who's time you wasted when you dodged twice?\n\nTake some time to reflect on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2018-03-22T19:48:01.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"well if you play darius no, no fun is allowed for enemy toplaner","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-22T21:44:53.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play blind, no bans to worry about then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boltonator","date":"2018-03-22T19:52:12.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try playing with friends so you only have the enemy team to worry about getting tilted for you picking Darius.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2018-03-22T19:50:02.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because it's not a game...it's a lifestyle.\n\nFortnite is a game, Monopoly is a game\n\nLeague is....League.","replies":[]}]}
