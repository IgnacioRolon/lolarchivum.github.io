Had an Ezreal in my game who started wishing death on our afk jungler ( he logged in for like 5 mins , kills happened in the meantime, so the remake option was gone.) and then just snapped at the rest of us for absolutely no reason , telling us we should die.\r\n\r\nHowever, things got personal. As I did not care to try at all and missed a kill, he started the personal attack telling me that I should die and my parents also.\r\nI said to everyone to report him, they did and I got a pop up later on that he got a warning. That&#039;s nice and all but here we are talking about a 10/10 rage, wishing death on people and their families.\r\nAnd as a person who already lost her mom , it made me really upset to have a teammate like that , wishing death like it&#039;s candy.\r\n\r\nShouldn&#039;t it be a bannable offense? I seriously doubt that he will just stop with a single warning ,from flaming someone else like that in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-10-29T19:17:55.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is, and I believe the system tells you that they've been _**punished**_ by the system, not specifically a warning.

I believe ban escalations are done so through manual review. Unfortunately, the system isn't perfect and it's not going to assign the appropriate punishment to all players.\n\nThe punishment uses the ladder system more often than not. So if he behaves poorly again before they're in good standing, they'll receive a harsher punishment each time.","replies":[{"poster":"GraceNovamon","date":"2016-10-29T19:41:56.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, I see how this goes.\n\nThanks for your response though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vormulac Unsleep","date":"2016-10-29T19:22:36.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"Nope.

The normal escalation of chat restriction into temp ban seems like it could be sufficient, as if the person is consistently nasty, then they will show a pattern of this sort of behavior, and will end up banned and losing their account eventually.  Whereas, if they are not typically nasty, and just having a really bad day, then the chat restriction is likely to keep them quiet until it blows over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-29T20:05:42.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is harshly punished, alongside racism and other hate speech. This sort of thing is easy for the system to automatically detect, and it usually nets bans.\nTrash rarely learns that their behavior is unacceptable, sadly. He will get banned and just blame the system for being broken, anything to not have to accept it is entirely his fault. The good news is he lost his account, and if he comes back, will just get banned again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-10-29T19:54:27.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If the tribunal would still exist, I would never vote to punish someone that wished death on some jackhole afker.\n\nNever queue for ranked if you are going to choose to afk.
