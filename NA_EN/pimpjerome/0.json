Anytime I try to get into a game, the client fails to open the loading screen after champion select and instead brings me to a screen with a \"reconnect\" button at the center.\r\nIn simple steps:\r\n1. Queue for any gamemode. Get into champion select.\r\n2. Champion select ends.\r\n3. The client turns black for a few seconds when it should be bringing up the loading screen.\r\n4. No loading screen opens, and the client returns to a screen with a \"reconnect\" button in the center.\r\n\r\nI can replicate this 100% of the time. This even happens for all gamemodes - even TFT, custom games, and the practice tool.\r\n\r\nCan we get anything from Riot on this? Do they even know this bug exists? Are we just screwed?","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-11-11T05:49:43.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you post your computer specifications.","replies":[{"poster":"PimpJerome","date":"2019-11-11T06:36:30.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Model: Lenovo Yoga710-15ISK\nProcessor: Intel Core I7-6500U CPU @2.5 GHz, 2.6GHz\nInstalled Memory: 16GB\nSystem type: 64 bit operating system, x64-based processor\n\nI'm no computer person but I think those are my specs?","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-11-11T19:16:33.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PimpJerome,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=YkIfTGmm,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-11-11T06:36:30.237+0000)\n>\n> Model: Lenovo Yoga710-15ISK\n> Processor: Intel Core I7-6500U CPU @2.5 GHz, 2.6GHz\n> Installed Memory: 16GB\n> System type: 64 bit operating system, x64-based processor\n> \n> I'm no computer person but I think those are my specs?\n\nThe one thing I do notice is that league minimum requirements look for a 3ghz processor while you are looking at 2.5.\n\nLaptops always struggle  more with games like league as they generally Lack independent graphics card and instead utilise integrated CPU graphics card which simply means it has to work to process the information while also generating the imagery.\n\nMonitor the CPU usage at launch of the game and ensure every background program including any internet browser is closed prior to game launch.\n\nPeople tell me that league runs just fine on laptops with integrated chip sets but from my personal experience it just isn't true and saw me just buying a PC to avoid frustration.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Datata","date":"2019-11-11T04:45:10.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to client setting > general.
