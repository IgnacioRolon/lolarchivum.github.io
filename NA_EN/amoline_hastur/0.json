You can make a strong team without a pure tank. You can make a strong team without a melee adc. You can make a strong team without an ap or ad assasin. You can make a strong team without a bruiser. You CANNOT make a strong team without a ranged adc. That is the problem right now.\n\nWhy does it matter what you can or cannot do? Rammus is OP but you don't need to pick a tank so he's fine?...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2014-10-15T12:59:54.165+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure even if you look strictly at primary roles, ADC (marksman, whatever) would still be the one with the smallest champion pool. Maybe support is lower but then you'd have to take into consideration all of the champions that are commonly played as supports and are primarily tagged as mages or tanks.\n\nThe only way to make ADC optional in this game would be to 1) make buildings take significantly reduced damage from ranged attacks and 2) tweek casters so that they are somehow able to put out the same DPS as an ADC in a fight (but then I'm not sure you'd want to fight this monstrosity). \n\nFace it, this is a game where the goal is to knock down buildings until you kill the Nexus, which is also a building. All the rest - farming, kills, getting jungle objectives - is only a mean to this end. So long as the game is played this way, LoL will be very ADC-centric because it is the class who has the best tools to take down buildings safely and quickly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NaCl Shaker","date":"2014-10-15T04:47:57.556+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"Jayce dominates entire teams from a long range with AoE damage.
