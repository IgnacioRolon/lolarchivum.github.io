Just don't be stupid about it though, probably once or twice a week I'll end up getting a quadra kill on the enemy team because they decided to 2v4 me and my Support bot lane. You have to really pin her down, even if she dies she can also blow up somebody as she goes down.\n\nDon't be afraid if she is pretty bursty, her Q does a large amount of damage and also immediately resets her auto attacks (like Sivir's W, but it does damage), so she might deceive you to believe she'll do more damage than you think in a sustained fight. However in sustained fights her W passive can do a ton of damage. At around full build I believe her W passive lets her do 130 extra damage potentially.\n\nAbuse her low mobility to set up good ganks, but remember she has one of the highest damage outputs for all ADCs and also has easily the highest early game damage output for ADCs, so making a mistake will let a good MF pick up a few kills.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-09-12T00:05:01.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news is, riot is already working on giving an identity to her!

She's not much of a jack of all trades. She does a few things quite well,(but in very uninteresting and/or generic ways), and she does many things extremely poorly.\n\n>She can kinda poke with her Q.\n\nPast the laning phase, this ability just gets used at autoattack range. Without the ult, her effective range out of the laning phase is pretty much autoattack range. I wouldn't call this poke. If this counts as being poke, than every ADC that isn't Vayne has poke.\n\n>She's kinda mobile with her passive.\n\nLet's be real, in a fight, she's one of the least mobile AD carries. The only carries less mobile than her are the ones who have literally no mobility. I'd take any other form of mobility over hers. If she's kinda mobile, than Sona is kinda tanky and Darius is kinda long ranged and Janna kinda does tons of damage.\n\n>She's kinda a lane-bully with her Q.\n\nThere's no kinda here. She's a lane bully. She's probably the single biggest lane bully out of all AD carries right now.\n\n>She kinda does good sustained damage with W.\n\nAgain, I wouldn't say kinda. She does good sustained damage. It's not a very interesting mechanic, but it does let her do a lot of autoattack damage.\n\nThere are a ton of team comps that she just doesn't work against, a lot of teams she can't work with, and many situations in general where she ends up being an absolutely terrible pick. That's not a jack of all trades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fiveofswords","date":"2015-09-11T12:29:45.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be extremely rare for me to even consider pressing the e button ever when i play mf. it really doesn't slow much, and it doesn't do damage. it costs a lot of mana. i think on average out of 10 games i might press the e button once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Android Cowboy","date":"2015-09-11T11:58:35.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she's great, now that you pint it out, for JUST this reason.

I've been playing her a bit recently, (when did the 150% crit damage chance on her Q happen?) and she's been fun to me. A strong early and mid game, but if you don't get super fed, she can fall off. As far as her being lackluster, I find her ult to be the greatest offender. Magic damage on her W is counter-intuitive, but having mixed damage on AAs isn't the worse thing out there. Her ult though, just feels really awful after a certain levels. I mean, its great for some level 6 burst, or finishing someone off under a tower, but after like level 14-15 just feels pretty meh. At that point you probably are doing more damage with AA's then the damage from it on opponents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2015-09-11T10:20:54.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really have any reason to pick Miss Fortune at all.
