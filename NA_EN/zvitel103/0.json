There is way to much lag and bugsplat that is costing us LP and games. Riot you really need to come up with a temporary solution to fix this. I have actually have a story about this problem. Today was a normal day was winning alot of games and i just got 94 LP in Bronze II. All of a sudden i get into a game and bam! Bugsplat. I tried restarting my client joining in and out but regardless my team went for a remake. I lost 20 LP and went down to 74 LP. This has never happened to me before and this is the first time I have ever gotten close to promos on Bronze II.
