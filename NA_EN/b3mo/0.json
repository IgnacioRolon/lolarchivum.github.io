That's disgusting. It has no AP anymore, 5 less AD, half the attack speed, and his R does no damage unless the person is low so using it prior to the enemy being at 30% is a HUGE waste of mana.\n\nTrinity is god awful right now on just about every champ. Even Corki is doing better with Rapidfire Cannon and Shiv since they do magic damage, provide more crit, and provide more AS. Trinity is a pretty garbo item now. It lost tons of stats for 10% crit. \n\nTwitch also needs a second crit item over a Ghostblade. He was able to make the 15% crit on Ghostblade work before, but now 20% isn't going to cut it. Better off with a Phantom Dancer or a Shiv.","replies":[]},{"poster":"B3mo","date":"2015-11-17T02:13:13.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey its just a help for bronzes so on etc....

It only works on bonus armor, so it's not going to do that much damage to squishies, and it would be better to grab another Zeal item to hit 100% crit","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2015-11-15T07:04:39.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vayne build lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"jeremiahBIO","date":"2015-11-15T07:00:09.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for this.

Its still very nice though! Now there is so many options, that anything could potentially work. And try to point out stats that each champions work best with.

Get a LW item (pick the one you need)\nBeing bursted too hard? Get GA\nAP is the problem? Get Banshee's\n\nIf none of these work, then just go for PD.
