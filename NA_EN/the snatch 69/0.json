Said he normally plays ARAM and it&#039;s his first time ADC. Proceeds to intentionally die through out the game. We don&#039;t look much into it because we just think he&#039;s a really bad player. I add him after the game to give him advice on how to play. He admits that he lost the game on purpose and is trying to get his account to Bronze 5.\r\n\r\nI wasn&#039;t able to report him in game because I thought he was just new. Is my only option outside of game to send a ticket to riot? There&#039;s not even a report option. When I tried sending a ticket, there was no where for me to put the images to give them proof. Can someone help me properly report this guy?","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-03-27T18:24:57.373+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sending this info to player support directly via a ticket is the best way to handle it.\nThey won't tell you the specific outcome, but they will look into and handle it.\nPurposely throwing games is punishable, yes.\n\nEdit: link--> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\nsubmit it under \"I have a question about League of Legends\" under \"general questions.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astrovert","date":"2017-03-27T22:47:12.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentionally losing a game is bannable, always report especially if they admitted to it.","replies":[{"poster":"FrostyPacy","date":"2017-03-28T14:10:23.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you can report a person once you get out of the end game screen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-28T01:18:10.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kind of thing is disgusting.
