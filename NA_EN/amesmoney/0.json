Please read!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play league quite often, but this problem just occurred (on 7/19/16) when I was starting a game. I finish champ select and go into the loading screen and tab out to finish watching a youtube video (there's only a minute left, so I just decided to finish it). I exit out of the page, and try to alt tab back into the loading screen, but everything turns black.. I wait a bit and tab out again, to a notification saying my internet isn't working, and that I need to retry again *LATER*! Later?? What? With this new /remake, I can't just wait until LATER? I check my internet, and everything is in working condition. My family members have no problem with the wifi, but I ask them to disconnect it, just to see if they're bogging it down.\r\nIt doesn't work.\r\nI eventually go to my task manager and quit League, to see if i can boot it up and just log in and join my team.\r\nI finally log in and load up, but the game has already ended. There was /remake, and I didn't have a chance to explain what happened. After this happening for another time, I've been placed into a lower Q priority. I still try to get into a game, but now, when I load up after champ select, the screen goes black, _even without me tabbing out_. It BugSplats every time!!! Again, I quit League, sign into my account, and try to load the game to find another 5 or so people have reported me.\r\n\r\nWhat do I do? I really want to play, but I'm so tired of waiting 20 minutes to get into a game, _and then not even playing it!_ My computer is brand new, with everything updated, so there's no problems there. I'm lost and honestly extremely frustrated.\r\n\r\nHELP!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-21T16:34:28.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can definitely see how frustrating this can be, especially on a brand new computer.

I go up to the champion loading screen, then boom, screen goes black and I can't reconnect.. I've read other threads about  this happening to other players in this patch. They have the same problem and have not found a solution. **I'm on the verge of tears writing this..** I just want to play with my friends again. I managed to get a few games in at my local university, but waiting that 20 minute penalty is *awful*. I actually played my last penalty today, but my computer did the same thing, and I DC-ed again..Another 5 game 20 minute penalty it is.\nIs there anyway you can get rid of my penalties and my DC-ing?
