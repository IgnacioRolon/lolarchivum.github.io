I was just able to log onto it using the old information but now I cant. I cannot change the password casue I don't know it and I don't have the email that it is trying to send the code to anymore. not sure what to do but all my friends were deleted off of my friends list. it seems like it reverted it to a previous time. I don't know if this is due to server maintenance or the server going down when I was logged in. but I'm ranked Plat 5 and its not showing my plat badge only shows placements and wins and losses. any help would be appreciated. thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T22:45:28.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Server maintenance was causing some of the ranked info to not display.
