However, we have not received it yet. I know it can take upto 2 weeks after the last day for the Icon to be given out, however, we received a message saying &#039;Riot Games has gifted you an icon&#039; which for other events meant we had got given the icon instantly. However, it seems to have bugged out and not given us the icon (even after showing us the message). I feel like the wave might be incorrectly marked as &#039;complete&#039; and many people in the wave may have missed out on the icon (at least on OCE). There are other people who do have the icon who received it during an earlier wave (which seemed to have worked correctly).\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-11T20:52:59.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Byte - \n\nThat icon notification that you may have been for Worlds Pick 'Ems (purely guessing here).

I am not sure but I don't think the notification was for another icon as I already had the worlds icon before I did the 'Doomed Minion' clicker task.\n\nAnyway, I did contact support about the issue (after the 17th) and they said they are aware some people still haven't received it and that I should wait till the 30th. I have a feeling that it did bug out for me and I still won't have it after the 30th but we'll see :p","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-22T17:50:30.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the follow up! I'm glad to see support was able to give you a better time frame. Of course, if you don't receive the icon by the 30th, please catch up with them again, and we'll get it sorted out!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
