It's not about giving the guy who hard carried an extra pat on the back, it's about recognizing the players on your team who made then game funner, less stressful, and all around worked to counter the standard levels of toxicity that tend to exist in most league matches.","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-06T16:39:19.701+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Fuzzy 0ne","date":"2017-07-06T16:48:58.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're here... any chance you know if this guy is hacked?\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/q5LdBeaT-pax-twisted-fate-coming-back-to-league-store","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-07-06T21:26:26.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You nailed it. \nWhen I tried out Overwatch I really liked the honor system there, but while it has similarities to what Riot developed for LoL, it has that one big difference: you are not honored for being a good player, but for being a good person.

The quote specifically says \"when I win.\"  Talking about the times where I hard carried games, sure it may not be often, and as we all do, I have losses and off games as I learn a champ... obviously not talking about that.  I guess you are just an angry tween that needs to be a prick on the internet to compensate for your own shortcomings... good luck with that in life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-07-06T16:40:22.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The screen shouldn't exist at all.
