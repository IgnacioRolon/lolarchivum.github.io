It monitors all matchmade formats, including bot games.  The only way to dodge LB penalties is to play custom games... and you can't gain XP from Customs unless you have enough live players and even teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-04-25T05:45:14.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well the leavebuster doesnt really care if you bother anyone or not","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gimpy89","date":"2016-04-25T05:34:02.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"step 1 dont get banned\ngg ez","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-04-25T15:41:43.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps consider, for once, the moral implications of what you are doing,\n\nHere's the thing, if there are human players in the game and you haven't informed them that you will be afk, then you're basically a scum bag.\n\nYou can rationalize it any way you want.","replies":[{"poster":"MaIevoIent","date":"2016-04-25T16:53:48.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Troll Armada,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cuEmg0Kw,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-04-25T15:41:43.865+0000)\n>\n> Perhaps consider, for once, the moral implications of what you are doing,\n> \n> Here&#x27;s the thing, if there are human players in the game and you haven&#x27;t informed them that you will be afk, then you&#x27;re basically a scum bag.\n> \n> You can rationalize it any way you want.\n\n In my coop vs AI games, I actually wanted other players to that while I was playing, so that the game wouldn't end so early. It gave me the opportunity to drag out games and test out full builds vs bots when other players doing in it. With longer games I also earned more points.\nYou should also consider most people in low level are actually smurfs, not new players.
