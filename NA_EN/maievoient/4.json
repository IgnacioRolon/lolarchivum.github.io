If you can navigate ships, then where are we now?\r\n\r\n{{champion:64}} We&#039;re on the deck of ship, and below us is the galley.\r\n\r\n{{champion:13}} That doesn&#039;t count as navigating, I thought you said you can navigate ships.\r\n\r\n{{champion:64}}  I do navigate ships, I navigate the inside of them.\r\n\r\n{{champion:13}} Well, lets if you can navigate where we&#039;re at OUTSIDE of the ship. Where are we in the sea?\r\n\r\n{{champion:64}} We&#039;re somewhere around 1033 feet above the sea floor.","replies":[]}
