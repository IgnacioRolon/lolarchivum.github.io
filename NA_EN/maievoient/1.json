Although it will never comeback, I made a new forum based off of similar concepts.\r\n\r\n**League of GD:**\r\nhttp://leagueofgd.infinigame.net/\r\n\r\nIt's a traditional phbb3 forum that should make you feel right at home. Visually, you should enjoy it better than boards, and it is more themed than geedee.\r\nYou can expect...\r\n\r\nsearch\r\ncreate your own avatar\r\npolls\r\neasy registration \r\nlate night GD\r\nmoderators\r\nupvote/downvote\r\nreport\r\na visually appealing theme\r\nquotes, images, videos, and a wide range of text editing tools with preview\r\nIt won't be reddit style\r\nA friend function\r\na reputation feature\r\nwill use the current ingame GD chatroom\r\nThere will only be one forum, instead of scattering everyone out too thin.\r\ntime features, threads will be sorted by latest post time with the time shown.

It's a place where you can enjoy the things you loved most about the old general discussion, but without the problems that you hated most.\r\nIt is not a place to destroy the GD community, but instead a place  that should have more potential growth than geedee or boards. The main objective is to allow non-GD summoners to embrace GD culture.","replies":[]}
