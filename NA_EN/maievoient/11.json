I might accidentally flash or throw away my ult sometimes by pressing the wrong key. It doesn&#039;t happen all the time, but I notice this happens when I can&#039;t rest my fingers on QWER.\n\nSo I got some problems.  I realize I play best when my four fingers of my left hand are able to relax over the QWER keys without using much muscle strain.  Because of the position of my laptop I have to twist my hand and wrist at an odd angle. This creates tension and also misaddressed keys.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YCmZrFA.png\n\nNotice how my arms at a uncomfortable angle.  If I try to extend my arms out, then I would be much further away from my laptop&#039;s screen.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vPrP7WS.png\n\nIf I try to push my laptop further away on the desk, then my hands would be more comfortable but I would still be much further away from the screen.\n\nUnlike a big desktop screen, I&#039;m playing the game on a 15&quot; 1366x7?? screen.   So I want to be as close to the screen as possible without having a bad keyboard position.  I also don&#039;t want to have to lean over my desk because that makes my neck sore if I do that for too long.\n\nWhen I&#039;m too far away from the screen I&#039;m less attentive and focused on things in game.\n\nAnother problem is that I have nothing to rest my elbow on. I have to use my shoulder muscles to hold my arms up. This may sound easy but it gets tiresome if I do this for more than an hour.  \nIf I don't hold my arms up a little bit, then my forearms are pressed into hard, sharp 90 degree edge of the desk and this makes my left hand go numb sometimes.\n\nAny solutions?\n","replies":[]}
