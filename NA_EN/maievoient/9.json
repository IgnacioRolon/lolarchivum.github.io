The fact that you were frustrated enough about your  ban to make a post and complain about it here shows that you will most likely miss this game if you quit.\n\nThe truth is that you actually still wan&#039;t to play this game.\n\nI wrote a guide about leveling up your account very fast. It should only take you about 5-minutes to read this guide.  If you follow my advice in the guide, you should have your account up to level 30 within a week. Then you can do your ranked placements again.\nhttp://www.lolking.net/guides/392167/preview\n\nEverything described in the guide is okay, and won&#039;t get you banned. Buying a new account will get you banned. \n\nAlso, playing without runes isn&#039;t as bad you think. The most important thing you still have is your game knowledge, experience and skill. Riot can take all your runes, champions, and skins but they can&#039;t take away your game knowledge.\n\n**Edit: Original Link Broke.

I use to think that too because I had a skin on almost all of my frequently played champs. However, I realized that I didn't even care about that stuff after the ban. I'm hoping other would realize this too.

The objective of the game, first and foremost, is to have fun. \n\nFor me, fun is being able to pick a champ I feel like using and playing them.  Now that I've been banned _(and I'm not going to say that wasn't my fault, because it was)_, the only way I can have this same fun again is if I either spend the better part of two years grinding IP or dump a ton of money on RP just to buy champions with.\n\nIt doesn't help either that matchmaking pre-30 is shaky due to the density of smurfs, and that I'm on the wrong end of it WAY more times than should be fair...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Review","date":"2016-05-06T23:46:12.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MaIevoIent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2oXvW00O,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-05-06T23:44:04.577+0000)\n>\n> So far on my new account, I&#x27;m about to hit silver 5 again.

Better hope you can find a way to keep a lid on your emotions when you play, because you HAVE to play to get your account back in good standing.
