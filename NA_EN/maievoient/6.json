I had to.&quot; responded Vayne\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**_------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  What Happened Earlier_**\n\nIt was a warm afternoon, after school.\n Vayne walked in from the door.  Her stomach was growling, her eyes were heavy, and her forehead was sweaty. \n\n&quot; I know I shouldn&#039;t be smoking at such a young age, but I hope Ahri didn&#039;t find my cigars. I forgot to take them with me in my backpack before coming to school today.&quot; thought [Shauna](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vayne).\n&quot; There&#039;s nothing more enjoyable than a nice smoke after school.&quot; \n&quot; Ever-since, my parents let Ahri live with us, it&#039;s been nothing but compromises for me.  I almost cried when she told me her past, and she has no where else to live, but she should still be more humble and respectful.\n\nShauna walked up stairs to her room.  Golden rays of sunlight beamed between the blinds and lit up the room.  \nAhri was reclining on Shauna&#039;s bed and puffing rings of smoke into the air. \nThe box of cigars was upside down and the rolls were spread all across the floor.\nEvery drawer of Shauna&#039;s dresser was open, and all her belongings were seen.\n\nShauna was disgusted. A large vein began to bulge on her forehead.\n\n&quot; Ahri, what are you doing?&quot; said Vayne.\n\n&quot; Obviously I&#039;m smoking, don&#039;t be so dense.&quot; replied Ahri\n\n&quot; You&#039;re not supposed to be touching my things, what the fuck is wrong with you?&quot;\n\n&quot; Your things?&quot; replied Ahri. &quot; You mean these cigars you secretly bought using your rich parent&#039;s allowance money they gave you?  Maybe if you let me use them, I won&#039;t tell them about your spending habits.&quot;\n\n&quot; If you tell them anything, I&#039;ll just let them know that you skipped school, and that you&#039;re also smoking.&quot; Shauna argued back, desperately trying to convince Ahri.\n\n&quot; I don&#039;t care what you tell them, because I&#039;ll tell them first, and you&#039;d be too guilty for them to even bother listening to what you have to say.&quot; replied Ahri.\n\n&quot; Ahri please, these are my things, and this is my room. Just let me be at peace. &quot; \n\nAhri laughed. She took one of the cigars and threw it at Shauna&#039;s chest. \nIt landed right between the cleavage\n&quot; Shauna, it&#039;s too late for mercy.&quot;\n\nShauna felt her face become hot. Then her eyes started to get become hot. \nShe felt pressure rising inside her body. Shauna said nothing.\nShe looked at Ahri, and then looked down at her own hand, and saw a knife in her hand.\n\n\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢\n⁢Time nearly came to a stop. Everything was in slow motion.\nShauna started intensely at Ahri.\nBefore she could even stop herself, she realized that she was already rushing at Ahri with the knife in her hand.\nWith one  hit, the knife wen&#039;t through Ahri&#039;s stomach and Shauna felt the knife stab the bed as if Ahri wasn&#039;t even there. \nShauna couldn&#039;t stop.\nAnother hit. Straight across Ahri&#039;s neck and Shauna felt the blade stab the mattress underneath Ahri as if Ahri wasn&#039;t even there.\nThird hit. Left side of Ahri&#039;s chest.\n\nAll of this happened in less than a second.\n\nAhri was shocked. She coughed out a spit of blood.\nAhri gasped. Coughed out another splash of blood and held Shauna&#039;s hand tightly.\n&quot;Ughhh!&quot; she made a sickening noise as she struggled to take a breath.\n&quot;Shauna, how... how coul...how could you do this to me?&quot; \n\n&quot; I&#039;m sorry Ahri, but you left me with no other choice... I had to.&quot; responded Shauna\n\nShauna could hardly believe what she had just done. She never stabbed anything or anyone before. She never been in a fight or even hit anyone before. \nShe had played with her father&#039;s crossbow before, but was never a violent person.\n\nAhri was silent, but was still taking shallow breaths. Shauna watched in shock and disbelief as Ahri continued to bleed.\n\nShauna realized that what she had done was real.\n\n\" Ahri's going to die, and I'm going to be a criminal on the run for the rest of my life.\"\n\nIf only there was someway to reverse what happened, Shauna would do anything.\n\nSuddenly, the ground began to shake. Shauna fell on her knees.\nThe shelf fell over.\n\nSteam was flowing out from the closet door and the door was shacking violently. The door cracked open a little.\n\nReaper Soraka stepped out.\n\n\" Who are you?\" asked Shauna.\n\n\" I'm Soraka, the Reaper. I take care of the souls of those who get wrongfully murdered by psychopaths like you.\"\n\nAnd so, Shauna pleaded Soraka to restore Ahri back. However, Soraka agreed to do that under one particular condition.\nAhri was healed, and Shauna had her cigars back, and now Ahri had more repsect for Shauna.\n\nNow if you wan't to know what that condition was, then you have to keep reading more Vayne threads.\n\n","replies":[]}
