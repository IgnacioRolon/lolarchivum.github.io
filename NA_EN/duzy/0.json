He feels just a little too spindly right now, and he just kinda increases in size with stacks.  I'd love to see his model evolve with his Feast stacks, like IronStylus suggested.  He starts off small but disturbing, but eventually turns into an absolutely horrifying Lovecraftian kaiju that absolutely NO ONE wants to run into.\n\nAlso, his Q really needs to tie into his biology.

In regards to kit, I've always felt Cho'Gaths kit was kind of old and awkward looking.  The instant true damage ult seems a little cheesy, but I guess it fits him thematically (eating his prey).  I think the best thing Riot can do is give him new (realistic looking) animations and particle effects for his current kit.  His Rupture is the one ability that I would change.  I think circle-based skill shots feel too \"gamey\" and not quite realistic or engaging enough for my tastes.  Something like Yasuo's Steel Tempest, Braum's Glacial Fissure, or Gnar's Wallop would add a more interesting game dynamic than yet *another* circle skill shot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2014-10-27T18:15:37.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"VU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2014-10-29T02:54:53.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho's hitboxes really need to be clarified.
