If it was prior to PBE launching again, that account likely won't work and you'll need to reapply. If this was a newly created account, I'd strongly suggest hitting up our account recovery team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see what went wrong. It's likely that you're using the wrong username, since your Live and PBE account names *can* be different.","replies":[]}]}
