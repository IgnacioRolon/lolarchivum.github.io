The client seems to be very unstable in comparison to some past times when it was pretty solid. I just received a 30 minute que time because the client locked up like a prom date that finally figured out you're trying to get it in. I normally don't care, but I think it's getting a little ridiculous to hold my account reliable for something that isn't not my fault. I'm running some of the best tech you can buy this shouldn't be a thing and I know the files are all good, I fresh installed to attempt to fix it.. Are you aware you have an issue with the client? ETA on a fix?  Still better than the pre seasons client though! I appreciate the work.","replies":[{"poster":"HardCore15","date":"2016-07-21T23:09:22.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem here -_-\n\n20 minutes waiting in queue\n\ni never leave or afk in game but Gamecrash made my champion afk and got reported after the game.\ni cant connect after champion select i got stocked in a black screen again and again saying client crashed please reconnect but wont go loading\n\n20 minutes waiting time in LeaverBuster queue is unreasonable in this case, i didn't leave the game my client got crashed thats a different story -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-21T22:38:22.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you go into more detail about when and where the client is locking up on you?
