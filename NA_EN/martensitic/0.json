If you insist on playing low tier champions, if you insist on checking brushes alone, if you insist on playing a tankjungler with a full AD build in a team with no tanks, then you don't deserve a win. You deserve bronze, you deserve lose.\n\nAnd ultimatly, if you blame your team you deserve report and ban.\n\nAccept that.\nAnd if you can't, uninstall.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-06T22:16:01.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lv16?
