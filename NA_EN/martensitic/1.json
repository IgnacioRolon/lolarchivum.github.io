A lot of matches tend not to reach that point. He's a late game support, which is kind of like saying he's sunblock that's only meant to be worn at night.

You can't give a support a powerspike at that high of a level.\n\nHowever, unlike Taric, Sona has Nami doing a lot of the same things and doing them a lot sooner. That hurts Sona.\n\n>high risk high reward\n\nThe \"high risk\" part I'm on board with. Sona is one of the squishiest champs in the game, and her kit forces her to get close to the heart of the battle with her only defense being a weak heal/shield ability that she can't spam to protect herself until late game. Very vulnerable, but forced into placing herself in danger constantly, even to poke.\n\nThe next part is where we disagree. \"High reward\" implies that she actually achieves something above and beyond other champs once she steps into danger. She's got the same aura issue old Taric had: a potential for thousands of gold worth of stats in a teamfight, but in reality that rarely happens due to the team spreading out and Sona's AoE being smaller.\n\nAnd if it does happen, no one notices.\n\nThat's a pretty lame reward, at least compared to other high risk/reward champs who get pentakills, big plays, and the satisfaction of observing the exact moment the opposing team shits themselves when they realize they screwed up. High reward isn't just winning a teamfight, it's about letting the player feel like that teamfight was won specifically because of them. You don't get that with Sona, unless you're in ARAM.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2016-12-18T06:26:52.427+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Support Main... Here are my views. Though I'm sure you too are a Support main, I didn't want to pop in and be like \"heh heh, I know everything even though I play top (or something)\".\n\n{{champion:432}} has great heals, incredibly powerful passive that slows, game-changing Q that slows or stuns, fast traveling E, and a R that stops a fight long enough for help to come\n\n{{champion:53}} not a Support like you said and isn't designed to be one\n\n{{champion:201}} passive that allows stuns and a Q that does kind of what Bard's does but a little easier, and W that stops strong attacks and is a great shield, and E that is kind of cool to see on a support, and an R that is really helpful in a team fight or when you are going to initiate (and he's hard to kill)\n\n{{champion:40}} is actually seen a little because of her kit that actually feels like it helps the team. Her Q is great for pushing, her W is great for stopping enemies from running away, her E is amazing as it is the only ability to temporarily give bonus AD and a shield of all things, and though her ultimate can be iffy it still heals for quite the amount.\n\n{{champion:117}} is not even on your list... She's actually a ton of fun and makes for a great support. I kind of wish she was somewhat easier to use but still her kit makes supporting a little easy. Her Q acts as damage and a slow (and can slow from very far away which is neat), her W speeds up allies or completely nulls an enemy, her E gives sight or gives an ally a shield (and pix on the W and E give the ally bonus damage). Her R gives an ally a ton of health and is great for if they are about to die. They even keep what they were healing up (that was not apart of the bonus health) while ulted which is kind of cool.\n\n{{champion:267}} is a strange case but none-the-less she deserves more than she gets. Her W is a bit high in price. Her E doesn't allow the bonus damage to hit towers. Her Q is her only saving grace. And her R can be stopped by Yasuo which is kind of what's really hurting her pick rate. I honestly feel that her E should be able to hit towers and that her W should be more cost friendly and not take away heal if it hits an enemy... (at least that's what I think I remember it does... its been a while since I played her.)\n\n{{champion:20}} is supper fun as Support, except that his Q doesn't work on actual enemies that is. I like that he can eat/heal himself and weaken maybe a strong minion for the ally to kill, but its kind of weird to use. But I still like it. He's not typically in lane but I think he's a fun champ to use. I believe his kit is very straight forward and very rewarding. He's strong but he's even stronger when supporting. With his W that gives a very long AS and MS boost, an E that slows enemies AS and MS, and even his R slows AS and MS (he's like a complete counter to champs like Jinx and Twitch who work off of this). I'd say he'd be a meta changer if many supports actually picked him up.\n\n{{champion:37}} just ins't seeing much in her supporting benefits which is what is really hurting her. Her Q passive to give allies bonus damage could be enhanced by a tiny bit, her shield duration or amount to allies could be a bit more, the slow she gets from her E is actually pretty good, and her R is just a easy to use stun. Its not that I don't think she's bad but her kit could use more in the means of enhancing and helping teammates which is kind of what the rework tried to do.\n\n{{champion:16}} got hit hard with the compensation hammer. To compensate the large heals she could give, they made it cost 10% of her health per heal which is just stupid. They just need to have her heals cost 110/120/130/140/150 mana per cast and take away the dumb healing passive that connects to her W. She will have a strong heal but that's kind of her niche (as they were so kind to point out). Its somewhat stupid to try and have a Support like Soraka have to get items like {{item:3083}} because they have her W cost 10% current health. The rest of her kit is actually really nice. Her Q slows enemies, her E still silences and can snare enemies, and her R still heals everyone for a grand amount. But that W just makes her so unbearable. She isn't really meant to be a Tank and has no real use for the health in her kit rather than to just stay alive. Its like asking Alister or Taric to spend 5% of their health to heal their allies, it just isn't right and it leads to where they are now with a means to heal themselves.\n\n{{champion:223}} is still a nice pick for supporting but I feel that his nerf to his E was a bit much... his Q slows enemies and can even stun but its not easy to accomplish this all at once. His W can shield enemies from damage, but I kind of dislike the amount of damage he deals to enemies if he actually eats them. It makes me again question why Nunu can't use his Q on enemies (even if its just a fraction of the damage). Getting an enemy out of a team fight has (in my experience) caused a great turn in many team fights and lead to many victories, so that in itself is amazing. I (however) an sad at the nerf to his E which wasn't needed (which makes him a bit easier to kill in general). His R isn't as strong and at least it doesn't effect towers and it only helps in weakening enemies.\n\n{{champion:44}} is actually very useful and he is indeed meant for late game, but even then his Q can be lack-luster and his kit can be hard to control at times. I kind of feel that his W should have a more or less one second cool down (and I mean this in a way that will just help his Q) as his Q only heals the person with his W on them (or if they are around the Q). I also feel that his Q just doesn't seem to heal at all the same as his original and if he only heals himself its also pitiful. The nerf is obviously on his Q and it makes it seem like it isn't doing its job. His W is to just give a shield, it doesn't even give bonus Armor like it used to, to nearby allies. His E is easier to use and far better, his R does more for team fights, and his passive is stronger and more meant for a \"Fighter\" which is what he is. I feel that if his Q were to take more from his bonus health (or was it current health) by 10% of his bonus health (and scales to 30% at max) then it would be amazing and work better. And if he is alone, the heal should grow to 12% (and scale to 36% of his bonus health) and even have slightly bigger numbers. I know he isn't meant to be a healer and this really won't make him into one but as a Support it kind of is his job to keep his ally alive and with such a weak heal... I can't really just depend on the small shield it gives. (I mained Taric in the past and like the change but hate how the new Q just feels so overly nerfed from the original.)\n\n{{champion:412}} has a lot to offer in his kit, but that was because he was the newest Support up until the latest 4 came into the picture (that being Braum, then Bard, then Tahm Kench, and then Irven). He has probably the most fun to use stun on his Q but its not as effective as Nami's (which can stun multiple targets) but it does its job if done right and can even get campers who are next to the tower to get closer for the allie to pick them off. The W is great for shielding far away allies or getting them out of tough spots. And the E is great for gap closing. Same for the R (which stops enemies from running) and is best used in a team fight. I still don't understand the reason a \"Fighter\" type support gets bonus unlimited bonus but still, he is a Fighter so his attacks need to be strong and he should be at least a little hard to kill. I'd say his slows could last longer if possible. At least for his ultimate's slows.\n\n{{champion:26}} is actually very useful. I've found out that his E is probably the most annoying thing to get hit with. The only problem is that its not great when used on an ally. Its kind of short and could last 3 seconds rather than just 1.5. I'd even say that Lulu didn't need her nerfs to her MS boosting W (or was it her E that did it...). His W could actually replace his current passive, allowing him to duplicate a spell every 10 seconds rather than passively give allies more XP. Not sure how this would be useful unless you were behind in XP... His Q is actually very useful now as it stuns enemies and his R is just as useful because a revive is a revive and allows for a second change (or to get enemies to stop hitting you for a while as you run away or attack). If his E allowed more time to give MS to allies and his W was something different that gave more to the ally, I'm sure we'd see more of him in Ranked games or LCS games.\n\n{{champion:427}} is still new and I can't say what I think of him just yet. I like his kit as his Q allows for Fighters to have an one-up on an enemy who is snared, his W gives cover from enemies (even if it is small), and his E gives a small shield. His R also barely deals any damage and can knock-up enemies. If I had to give him anything, it would be more of a shield on his E because its honestly the most Supporty thing in his kit thus far... but that's just me.\n\nThese are more or less my views on all the Supports. Also Leona isn't technically a Support even though I do view her as a Support with a passive that only works for allies, three stuns, and a slow all in one kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Veltox","date":"2016-12-17T16:38:45.599+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't see {{champion:16}} in pro-play because her kit is either meh  specially with {{item:3123}} being a thing or a walking fountain.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-12-17T16:41:06.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3123}}  has to be removed and riot knows it, the problem is that riot has no clue how to balance healings","replies":[{"poster":"Veltox","date":"2016-12-17T16:54:29.653+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah but {{champion:16}} still needs a rework.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2016-12-17T18:42:05.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We should buff their solo lane potential.

The decision making involved with choosing which one is  best for the game you're about to play is way more involved than 21-9-0 or 9-21-0.","replies":[{"poster":"sit kid","date":"2016-12-17T17:15:51.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mean to say say Garen had no options at all.

Some work better with them than others, and it is something they do EVERY preseason.\n\nImplement new stuff that makes certain champs op -> nerf -> remove that thing or repeat\nWe saw it with tank junglers where Gragas and Sej got too op because of cinderhulk. They got nerfed. Cinderhulk got nerfed. They haven't been touched in pro play ever since.\n\nNaut is probably getting nerfed as well. Poppy for sure. Why add it though.

TLD is 10% AP scaling, 30% bonus AD scaling. A 750 AP mage gets 75 extra damage on the thunderlords proc, and Garen with BC and 15 AD from runes will get 20 extra damage. That's only a 55 damage discrepancy from a glass cannon build vs a juggernaut build. Both get to enjoy the same base damage. \n\nMages might use thunderlords better than juggernauts purely because they can proc it from their ranged abilities, but ranged champs dealing damage from a longer range than melee champs isn't anything new.\n\nI assume by \"current mastery system\" you meant the pre 6.22 mastery system. The problem with SotA is how every champ in the game can use and appreciate extra health, and since junglers could stack it quickly, it was the only keystone anyone took in jungle. CotC was supposed to be an additional choice for tanks, since before for tanks it was Grasp if top, SotA if jungle, and Bond of Stone if support. Now all three of those roles have two good choices. CotC might be a bit too strong currently, but it's still better than SotA because its conditional power requires players to make wiser decisions than just recognizing the usefulness of 300 extra health.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"elon wątroba","date":"2016-12-17T14:39:13.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't q proc grasp?
