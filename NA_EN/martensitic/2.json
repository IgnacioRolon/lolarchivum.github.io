Bot tower has no natural defenses early game thus it's more vulnerable to getting rushed - which only got worst with the addition of tower first blood, almost all marksmen are vulnerable early-game and will be ganked repeatedly if left alone - and it's so much easier to have a dive that's worth it on a 3vs1 compared to a 3vs2 - an equal number of people are required to have some sort of Dragon Control, and a dedicated roaming support which occasionally helps bot when needed loses so much xp in comparison that it becomes laughably feast-or-famine, and the feast doesn't compensate for the famine.\n\n\nYou are 100% wrong. If you want to maximize your chances of winning, the support stays bot for at least the first minutes. Before, when bot-top laneswapping was still a thing you had a point, now you're just completely and totally wrong. And the facts speak for themselves. Even professional teams don't do it. The highest echelons of coordinated play all think it's not worth it. The Singed support guy had 30% win rate on his alternative playstyle after dozens of games as Singed \"support\", so not even constant repetition makes it worth it.

Aside from the obvious Galio or Cho, I mean.\n\nTanks aren't really hurt by buying a defensive item first, so that makes them pretty nasty to deal with when you're an assassin or burst mage; aka the majority of picks in the mid lane. Tanks probably won't follow the laners when they roam, but they often have some sort of AoE or can rush Bami to push the lane and put damage on the tower.\n\nPoke is going to be a concern, as most mid laners can punish melee champs that way. Then again, it's also a concern top lane.\n\nYour team greatly benefits from having a tank on it somewhere, and you can't rely on a support tank to be your frontline since they have a gimped gold income. So if the top and jungler both pick squishy damage champs, and the marksman isn't willing to pick Urgot, then no one should be bitching that the mid laner is Malphite. In fact, they should be **happy** that someone is helping diversify the team comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-12-03T20:54:44.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran into this situation a handful of times in  game as either the mid laner or jungler. The reason this shit is off meta is because if the mid laner roams than the jungler comes mid to keep the tower safe while mid is roaming or if the enemy mid laner is being highly aggressive than you gangbang that monkey until he/she gets the message or becomes so behind that your mid laner doesn't need help anymore against em. However this rests mainly on the jungler to be aware of this to take advantage and to a lesser extent thr mid laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muddafragot","date":"2016-12-03T20:37:44.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's great for plat players.
