For the bloodmoon jhin he had 1 glowing red eye which kind of resembles the Sharingan from Naruto wish they added that to bloodmoon yasuo. But they could of considered trundle to be a bloodmoon candidate for this skin line because his club resembles well.. A spiked club and he weilds something heavy like those heavily armored club weilding samurais would weild and a demon mask fits him him perfectly. Shaco could of been part of this aswell since he has a sinister face and he is a assassin so a demon mask would suit him. But i hope riot thinks about the champs that never gotten skins in a while and gives them something next year","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-02-13T10:31:57.365+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I want to see for the next turn of bloodmoon:\n{{champion:432}} Already wears a mask and let's be honest, meeps are basically [kodama.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodama_(spirit))\n{{champion:164}} Based on the [kuchisake-onna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchisake-onna) with scissor legs and slit mouth mask.\n{{champion:133}} With a crow for valor, reference to [yatagarasu.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-legged_crow)\n{{champion:48}} Like OP said, representing an [oni.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iron Wu","date":"2017-02-13T06:56:36.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:38}}  says hello.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-02-13T04:17:42.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you seen Blood Moon Kindred?
