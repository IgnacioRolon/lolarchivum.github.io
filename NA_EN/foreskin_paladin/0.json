I received some sort of message about how many players are experiencing connection issues, to click cancel on any error prompt and reconnect from the client. As soon as any game starts, my screen goes black and I get a connection error. I try to reconnect from the client, but the same exact thing happens, over and over. It is currently impossible to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyvz","date":"2016-12-13T01:36:43.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have a similar problem. After champ select it goes straight back to the client with the reconnect button in the middle that doesn't even work... The champ loading screen does not show at all. I've tried everything from windows update, video card update, compatibility, completing a full repair, disabling my firewall/antivirus and even trying a different internet connection entirely. The only thing I haven't done yet is uninstall and reinstall. I didn't experience this problem till around afternoon yesterday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T00:39:23.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the workaround for the known issue doesn't cause a change for you, it means this issue is an unrelated connection issue. This is most likely caused by one or more local network settings that conflict with your client's ability to reach the gamservers. I strongly recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in order to ensure this isn't caused by a common culprit.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surfin Bard","date":"2016-12-12T21:54:15.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it's been two weeks since whenever I log in my client won't connect to the chat, also I can't get into games after champ selects.
