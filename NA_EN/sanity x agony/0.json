(I honestly just wanted that level border lol) but it's brought nothing but people being toxic to me every game I go into. For example, today I went into a draft game and at the end of the game someone on the enemy team told me \"level 500 b****  with no life.\" Imagine playing the same game and telling someone to go get a life. I just enjoy the game more than most people I guess. They told me this in the lobby chat and guess what no mute option there...I just reported them and blocked but I know it's just gonna keep happening with new players I get into a game with. I also get people saying, \"level 500 and not challenger how are you that bad.\" \"You're level 500 you're suppose win lane every game.\" Please just allow us to hide our levels in the loading screen or give us the option to mute people in the game lobby's.","replies":[]}
