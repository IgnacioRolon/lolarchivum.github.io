The former because we need to know what cards your motherboard is compatible with and the latter so we know that the video card you're getting won't be too much for your PSU to handle.\n\nDepending on some computers, you might also want to make sure that the video card you want to install will fit inside the machine. This problem isn't as common as it was back in the day, but it is still good practice to make sure that it'll physically fit in your computer.\n\nYou might want to look for something close to this: \n\n- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150577\n\nThat's a Radeon HD 6670 which is a newer variant of the Radeon HD 5670 listed in the [Minimum and Recommend Requirements](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements) page.\n\nAlternatively, you can go with a slightly beefier Radeon R7 250X like this one:\n\n- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131662\n\nIf you're looking for something from the GeForce camp, this is also a good card:\n\n- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127788\n\nNow remember, you'll want to make sure that the video cards are compatible with your system before picking up any computer part. If you're unsure, I highly recommend having a friend with technical knowledge or someone knowledgeable help you out.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-10-06T05:24:37.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh. You seem to know quite a bit about tech. So I have a question for you. My gaming desktop I'm getting soon.\n\n8 core i7 processor at the speed of 3.0Ghz, up to 3.5Ghz (i think it's this one http://ark.intel.com/products/82930)\n16GB of RAM (but can fit up to 32GB)\n1TB Hard Drive\n240GB SSD\nRadeon R9 270X (this version I think it is http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA5751ZF7436&cm_re=Sapphire_AMD_Radeon_R9_270X_Vapor-X-_-9SIA5751ZF7436-_-Product)\n\nAbout how fast you think League would run?? Like, what would the fps in game be with those specs?? I have come across people with some godly fps and their reaction timing with quicker gameplay. Like up to 220+, 500+, and I even know some that gets 700fps like holy crap. While the average people get is 60-90fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2015-10-06T08:03:14.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nI am not that hardware savvy but i think over 100 should be possible. But that is not the reason i am posting here^^\n\nHowever, if your monitor is only 60Hz there is no reason to have more than 60 FPS. (Hz is the rate in wich the picture on the monitor refreshes). If you have a 144Hz Monitor you might want to have 144Fps. Having more FPS is ultimately a waste of energy since they cannot be displayed. Also they might even cause issues( i remember having a few cases where ppl had around 300+ Fps and got a slow motion effect).\n\nRegards Rkoturdo","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-10-06T08:24:29.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm. I was also reading about the 60Hz thing. I wonder what some people have. I know this one dude that gets like 500+ fps and it doesn't go slow for him. So I guess his monitor isn't 60Hz. I will have to check the two new monitors tomorrow that'll be coming with my new pc. My laptop monitor is apparently 60Hz though I get 90 FPS in game. So how fast a monitor refreshes can also determine how much FPS you can get??","replies":[{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2015-10-06T09:31:49.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nNo, how fast the monitor refreshes does not determine how many FPS you can have. They are seperate things. \nBut if you have 120 FPS the Monitor(60Hz) only refreshes every two frames(simplified) since he is not capable of refreshing fast enough to show all the Frames per Second. So they are not the same but are somewhat tied together. Its like a webside updating every 4 Minutes what is shown but everey 2 Minutes the content is changed. The side would just display half of the content since some of the changed would never be updated. Maybe that makes it a little bit clearer.\n\nTo the Slowmotion effect. Not every person with that high FPS numbers gets them, just a few had it.\n\nRegards Rkoturdo","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-10-06T05:11:22.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zStew,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=F4A9b9mL,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-05T17:56:36.794+0000)\n>\n> Hey, i have a pretty old computer but it still runs fast so i don&#039;t want to buy a whole new one.
