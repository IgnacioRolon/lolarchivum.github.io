It almost reminds me of the highly stylized and symbolic hand poses that some Medieval illustrations (and ancient Greek oratory hand signs).  \n\nThis one, for example, looks closest to the one that would have meant \"Wait a moment\" or \"I'm about to say something\" in ancient Greece.  Particularly amusing for Sona :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ink Rose","date":"2015-07-24T04:12:16.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much! <3\nI'm very glad to see you saw such an interesting meaning in the way I posed her hand.
