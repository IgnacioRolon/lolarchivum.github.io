Did I miss the memo?  Did we become OP or something?  Since forever, support life has been tough, which is part of the masochistic fun I suppose, trying to be awesome on a shoestring budget.  Finally a few seasons ago, you figured out, hey, maybe we could throw the third world country homies a bone and send some relief with quality of life changes.\r\n\r\nNow I can take reduction of up-time on shields; that&#039;s cool, just means you have to be boss with those clutch saves.  I can take nerfs to heal/shield %; I don&#039;t get it personally.  It was a cheaper way for an enchanter to meaningful without having to go ham on AP.\r\n\r\nBut I am baffled sirs, at this comment that no one uses banner and it&#039;s removal.   While I&#039;ll give you props for finally getting our sightstone in line, you took our face shield.  That was a dirty blow, and the damn tank one is still the most expensive one, but I digress.\r\n\r\nHere is an item, that builds from armor, gives situational movespeed towards towers (hello lane phase).  It is the right price at 2200g for a support.  Now let&#039;s say you fall behind, you didn&#039;t win lane, you&#039;re broke and busted and you just want quit.  Fear not, you have an item that can help you fluff your income, as you gain the kill gold of your promoted minion, but you can also pull off some clandestine win if you pop up in the side line at the right time, or after a pivotal team fight, to push some towers.  Were you the star player?  You can at least feel like you were in a black-ops sort sense.  And furthermore, it was just a good tank item concept.  So for someone in their infinite wisdom to remove this because no one bought it...\r\n\r\nI buy it just about every game on just about every support, but let&#039;s say I don&#039;t.  WTH?  It&#039;s not like it was oldschool executioners.","replies":[]}
