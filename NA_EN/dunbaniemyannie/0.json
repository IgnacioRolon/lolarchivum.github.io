Results not Surprising, System is Biased and has Flaws.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"TL:DR Riots report system only punishes based off chat logs. It claims to be fair and asks players never to retaliate but only to mute people and report them, however it does not hand out punishments equally. Actions in game can physically ruin the game and you cannot prevent that loss, chat can tilt people but CAN be fixed by muting, however riot punishes chat but does not punish trolls. Something doesn&#039;t add up. I present a couple of options to mitigate this.\n\nI do care about the issue and would love for the community to improve, as this is probably the only game where I&#039;ve seen the trolls actually have the upper hand and are able to inflict punishment on good players with little to no consequence. It also promotes a &quot;lets report so and so&quot; environment just like how everyone in the real world tries to sue each other.\n\nSo, as someone who is/was utterly disgusted with Riots &quot;chat scanning auto report bot&quot; because it hardly gets rid of trolls and punishes good people. I understand it benefits riot not to have a tribunal where players decide whats best for the community and riot moderates it but rather replace a human interaction with a piece of code which they hardly have to oversee, but I&#039;m not sure how that&#039;s best for or even helps the players. If an equal amount of resources from the cost savings was devoted to player issues Riot please feel free to let me know, in which case the return on your investment has not broken even yet.\n\nHowever, despite all of this I&#039;m a person of reason so even though I was pissed, when talking to some friends they wanted to try some impartial experiments I figured it might be a good idea\nNote: I did not participate in any of the games only looked at the data after. So no use in bashing me for ruining &quot;normal&quot; for random people I didn&#039;t order, execute or encourage it, just examined the results. \nFeel free to point out any flaws in the design or defend Riot if you want.\n\nThree accounts were created\n\nAccount A: Lets call this the **FLAMER** - This account always played exceptionally well in game but said a lot of nasty things in chat. \nAccount B: **Troll** -This account never said anything negative in chat, although did occasionally claim to be trolling or not care but would follow up by later saying they are not trolling\nAccount C: **Neutral Party**\n\nDuring each of the games the above scenarios would take place, Account B would run it down mid, build troll builds, intentionally feed or go to the wrong lanes, but was silent. Account A would get mad at account B. At the end of the game--not every game because it would diminish the report effectiveness account C would report one or both of the players-equal amount of reports over the total duration, and would encourage people to actively report the troll. Note that this was a biased hypothesis against the troll because I really wanted to stress test the system.\nNow I&#039;m happy to provide all of the data for each game etc...but, basically what happened was by the end of 50 games, \n\nAccount A: received multiple reports and account bans, finally was perma-banned\nAccount B: Absolutely NOTHING.\nAccount C: Nothing-as expected.\n\nThere is a plausibility Account B would go straight to perma-ban or ban without warnings because a chat ban wouldn&#039;t have harmed them, but if that scenario exists 50 games seems a long time to not have a punishment.\nNow, during the games while account A had toxic chat, any player could have muted account A, the overall impact would be small but would negatively affect the player experience by prohibiting communication which can be useful in-game to coordinate strategy if used effectively, however Riot has probably determined this is negligible in random solo-q type games because players rarely can develop a good enough relationship to effectively use it, which is why I suspect they allow players to play with chat bans, which I&#039;d hope they wouldn&#039;t do if the data showed that players with chat ban substantially lose more often from lack of communication. So Account A could have been muted and would not have affected the game. Player B did not say anything in chat, but there was no way to mitigate or &quot;mute&quot; the actions of a troll. There is no way to make it so their deaths don&#039;t negatively affect your team. There are likely three options. \nA) Ignore the troll- this may work if they get tired of trolling but it has no tangible effect and leaves it entirely up to the other player. Maybe you playing will inspire them to try, maybe not. You will lose LP for the loss but can report the troll hoping to clean up the community\nB) Try to reason with the troll via chat, be mindful that anything you say can and will be used against you to the fullest extent of the chat bot which scans logs. There can be a very fine line of what riot deems is aggressive towards an individual, and showing anger to someone wasting your time will likely get you reported for escalating the situation\n\nHere I don&#039;t see a winning situation, if the report system did anything then option A would be a consolation to player C and A who were negatively affected by player B, but since it doesn&#039;t they lose in both scenarios. \n\nNow in conclusion I FULLY understand why it&#039;s VERY VERY hard to report trolls and have any sort of CODE detect it. So I present 2 solutions to be pragmatic and practical.\n\nOption A) Its nifty that Riot has a record feature. Now I know they cant possible save every single game that&#039;s out there, but if a game is flagged for multiple reports of trolling why not capture it? Why not put the decision BACK in the hands of the community or have a moderator examine it. In this case hand out a VERY HARSH punishment to demonstrate this behavior will NOT be tolerated, and the punishment can be harsher because it required riots human resources to enforce it instead of a system. Due to the new found stigma of reports for actions and trolling ACTUALLY having an impact it will quickly deter players, as currently I&#039;ve seen many trolls say go ahead report me I&#039;ve said nothing wrong and the system can&#039;t tell I&#039;m a troll (or something similar). The only thing the system does detect is idling or AFK but it doesn&#039;t work if the person moves around in base every 30 seconds to crack the simple idle code.\n\nOption B) Adjust the LP +/- according to the performance of the player! Now again I understand sometimes you have a case where someone truely has bad stats and they are a team player etc...well that&#039;s lovely but chances are its a fluke if they are ranking up solely by that game after game, Have a +/- 5 LP for performance. If I lose and I&#039;m flawless on the game, give me only -10 LP and a troll who gives up, give them -20. Make them feel the wrath of their decisions more than those you&#039;ve stuck them in the pot with. I understand riot wants there to be a shared risk/reward, and there is. Losing 10 LP still sucks, so theres still plenty of incentive to work together and not alone. Alternatively, if someone wins and is the carry give them +25 instead of +20 and give the troll they carried +15 instead of +20. This system can scale with your ELO standard LP awarded and also can scale with how bad you troll... Say you were only slightly better than everyone, maybe you only get +1 added to your score. If you were slightly worse? only -1 from your base. This would also work better than having to win multiple games in order to see a change in your ELO.\n\nBonus Option C) Stop using the stupid chat scanner to report people from games where its a human response to be angry because your system is ineffective and you give them no solution or outlet. Bring back the tribunal where i know many people went years with no reprimand, yet were banned through the scan bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-08-07T18:20:09.226+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":6,"body":"> Riots report system only punishes based off chat logs\n\nThis is not accurate. Our systems penalize for harassment, intentional feeding, trolling, and AFKing.\n\nHowever, it is much harder to detect intentional feeding or trolling. The obvious response most people think of is to just penalize people who have a poor KDA. The problem with that is I can guarantee you I could go through each and every players' match history and find multiple games that would match this criteria, and the person was just having a poor game. Man, it would suck to get banned when you're already tilted off the face of the earth for having a poor game.\n\nMost of the possible solutions you outline, involve manual review. This just isn't possible given the large number of games. It would suffer from the same problems Tribunal had, which is why it was taken offline. The tribunal couldn't get through cases fast enough, and was eventually backed up with years of data needing to be reviewed. This resulted in players either never being addressed, or being penalized for something they had no memory of that happened a year ago. This pertains to your option A and option C.\n\nAdjusting the LP of players according to performance has a whole host of problems. Why would you ever want to play that team enabling tank or initiator? You may be hard carrying the team, but you are going to lose more LP because your KDA isn't as good. As a support, why wouldn't I only play Brand or Vel'Koz? I'm sure to have a better KDA.\n\nThat being said, we are constantly updating our systems, we aren't just letting them run and calling it a day. We don't post it in the patch notes, but we are constantly deploying. It's frustrating when you lose games, it's even more frustrating when you lose a game where you played well (win lane lose game, am I right?).","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-08-07T18:28:05.692+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you legitimately _the_ Tantram?

If punishments are harsh is it really that true you couldn't get rid of the black and white cases quicker and faster than it takes to level to 30? I understand the gray area is always hard to punish and its why Riot takes a softer stance on questionable cases.\n\nSecondly, As far as adjust LP based on performance-you're telling me there isn't math to analyze and understand relative tank situations, assists, objective contribution, average win rate, and make a determination via the data? I say hogwash, yes it may take someone with a PhD or Masters in math, but its hardly impossible. Run a simulation, put it on test realms, make it a soft system at first which doesn't give real punishments, but allows feedback into the validity of cases. Check a random sampling of said cases, tweak and adjust...same can be done with option C. All of a sudden people think there's a point to trying when playing with a troll-less rage and more fun.

You have to observe the game and this takes time. This is why you probably didn't get punished at the same rate.

Would you then agree its not effective?\n\nThere is also another factor that isn't fully accounted for in your experiment. With only playing 50 games and then stopping and drawing a conclusion at the end of those 50 games is that Riot has specifically stated that their punishment models are based on the hopes of reform.\n\nIf you got a punishment for those first 50 games and then played another 50 games the same way and got another punishment, then I would say it would appear that the system is just slow.\n\nIf you got a punishment after those first 50 games and then played another 50 games the same way without getting any sort of punishment, then I would say the system fails to punish trolls.\n\nThis is going to sound like splitting hairs but I'm going to say it anyway. I can't necessarily say whether or not it's overall effective because that's not the only factor in determining how good a punishment system is. I believe that you need to take into several things, including but not limited to: How fast does one detect and punish trolls (efficiency) and how well does this do in deterring and/or rehabilitating trolling in the population of players (effectiveness).\n\nI agree that it's not very effective right now because of how inefficiently it detects and bans trolls. When people believe they can troll for a long time without being punished, they will and it also encourages it because others see that people are trolling but not getting punished. This is why I disagree with your conclusion and particularly with the part where you said, \"riot punishes chat but does not punish trolls.\" This just demonstrates that it is an ineffective deterrent at the moment.\n\nI'll address each of your suggestions too:\n\nA) The suggestion about replays\n\nTantram himself has even stated he's watched player's replays in this section of the forums. This leads me to believe that option A is already in practice, which explains why it's so slow. Games take a long time and even if you speed up the rate at which the game plays, it is still very time consuming.\n\nThe other part of the suggestion is going to be addressed in the Tribunal suggestion (the part where you say you want to give it to the hands of the community).\n\nB) LP adjustments\n\nThis is difficult because based on stats alone, how do you really determine if someone played well or poorly? Tanks are going to have really bad KDA's but they're doing their job well when the team fight ends in their side's favor. Not every tank is going to get an assist on every kill in the team fight even though they have contributed to every single kill in that fight. \n\nAlthough this would be a more ideal way to handle wins/losses in ranked, the implementation is complex and I have no idea how to properly adjust someone's LP quickly without having to actually review the replay of the game. \n\nC) Tribunal\n\nThere were problems with Tribunal because when it first came out, I remembered that Riot had said that people overwhelmingly just hit punish regardless of whether or not someone read through the text to determine if there was harassment. This led to lots of false positive punishments and basically meant that the Tribunal system wasn't working because not enough people were trying to really determine if there was a punishment that should be going out to players. \n\nI participated in the Tribunal when it was used. It personally felt only good for detecting verbal abuse and harassment only because I didn't have reviews to watch. Now a revised Tribunal system with replays in addition to all of the game stats, chat logs, etc... (with the purple still being used to code text and also pings) could be implemented with weighted stats based on your performance.\n\nSo for example, you can normally review like 5 games a day. \nThere are reports for verbal abuse/harassment in 2 of the assigned games\nThere are reports of trolling in 3 of your assigned games.\n\nYou have a 100% accuracy rate of detecting and punishing verbal abuse/harassment\nYou have a 33% accuracy rate of detecting and punishing trolling\n\nThis leads you to get reviews of 10 games a day however you get assigned 7-8 games of verbal abuse/harassment and get 2-3 assignments of trolling games.\n\nIf you don't want to have the assignments system, you could try and do like a quest log kind of system. Rather than get assigned a game, have a pool of games listed and let people pick and choose which kinds of reports they want to review. \nEx:\n\"This game has an Intentional Feeding report\"\n\"This game has an Intentional Feeding and Verbal Abuse report\"\n\"This game has a Verbal Abuse report\"\n\"This game has a Trolling Report\"\n\nand then you pick and choose which ones you want to do and then based on your accuracy, the availability of those kinds of reports and/or combinations of reports increases based on your performance.\n\n(I'm not saying this is the best way to do it, but just offering a suggestion on another way to do it compared to how it was done before.)\n\nD) leaving it the way it is\n\nI honestly don't know if it would be better or worse to change the method of reviewing the games until we try more methods and actually have proof that a specific way works or doesn't work. Right now, I would say leaving it the way it is may not be the best suggestion because there are other ways to try and do this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-08-07T18:23:47.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how you presented this.

I believe that it could save Riot a lot of time and give them a much more effective way to handle that sort of thing. And if Riot is worried about accuracy, they could always apply some level of AI / machine learning to monitor the tribunal judgements and alert Rioters / give them the final say when it comes to handing out punishment.\nI believe that this system of filtering cases down as much as possible before they go to Rioters would be the best way to get accuracy out of existing and past systems of punishment, while still saving Rioters the most time. It's possible that Reporting and tribuning could become part of the same process, where a player is reported, then after enough times the tribunal steps in and does all the prep-work of analyzing the games and the player's behavior, then it gets handed to an AI or a Rioter to sift through and determine the best course of action.","replies":[{"poster":"DunBanieMyAnnie","date":"2017-08-07T19:00:31.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the kind words :) I tried to make it objective....and yes I was a scientist in a former life :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MsYorine","date":"2017-08-09T02:15:54.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot is a company, Companys need money, easier to perma ban toxic players and get them to spend money.\nHence the broken system that will never be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-08-09T04:23:51.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MsYorine,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=daRJEKZw,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2017-08-09T02:15:54.605+0000)\n>\n> Riot is a company, Companys need money, easier to perma ban toxic players and get them to spend money.\n> Hence the broken system that will never be fixed.\n\nThis is spouted by the people who are permabanned and are trying to shift blame from themselves to Riot. They blame Riot for being a greedy company because it feels a lot better than to accept that they're awful people.\n\nCorporate greed is a wonderful scapegoat but with a single iota of thought into the reasoning, it's easily dismissed from the plausibility scale of tin foil hat conspiracies.\n\nIf a person is permabanned, they probably won't spend money on the game again because of fear of getting permabanned again. They probably balance the risk and reward and that they know they're a risk factor and to not waste money, they will most likely never spend money on LOL again. Particularly with how easy it is now to level 1-30 compared to when LOL first came out. XP and IP boosts are no longer necessary.\n\nIt's also plausible that once permabanned, they will never spend money on LOL again out of spite from the first permaban.\n\nIf you try to say the account gets purchased, Riot also does not see that money. That goes to whoever spent the time botting that account up which will probably get banned for using 3rd party software after you buy the account.\n\nHowever, looking at a lot of streamers and youtubers who have gotten banned and open new accounts, the vast majority of videos I've seen have base skins and not premium skins... which makes me believe that people don't rebuy skins over and over each time they get permabanned.","replies":[{"poster":"MsYorine","date":"2017-08-09T13:36:14.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"No... pretty sure it's cus they are greedy, ban system doesn't make sense, good try though.","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-08-09T15:27:10.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MsYorine,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=daRJEKZw,comment-id=000c00000000,timestamp=2017-08-09T13:36:14.772+0000)\n>\n> No... pretty sure it&#x27;s cus they are greedy, ban system doesn&#x27;t make sense, good try though.\n\nPlease explain your point of view in an explanation of other than \"because you don't agree with me you're wrong\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-08-07T18:07:56.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"A) impossible\n\nB) Easily abused\n\nC) Preposterous: If its human to insult others, its human to troll too.

Who cares if it turns in to some sort of Social Justice Warrior and starts banning more long-term players, who have never had any issues with their behavior before, than actual trolls who need to be gone from the game? Who cares if it actually just starts creating all sorts of 'home grown trolls' out of these players, who now have a personal mission to ruin the game for as many people as they can? Who cares if it contributes to the complete and utter ruin of the community? Not our problem, we'll just say it's working as intended, and throw around all sorts of bullshit 'stats' to make it seem like everything's good...it's 2017 and nobody thinks for themselves anymore...they'll all just take it at face value and completely ignore the fact that there are toxic people in almost every game they play.  \"not our problem\"\n\nYou do realize that MOST games coming out these days are \"free\" to play, right?  You ALSO do realize that in order to access most of the 'cool' content in the game/save time you have to pay, right?

It's the fucking internet. There will ALWAYS be trolls. You don't ban the people who rage at the trolls, bc it just creates MORE trolls. You don't try to create 'safe spaces' on the internet, because you can't, short of issuing IP bans...which Riot already knows they literally CAN'T do.\n\nWhy can they acknowledge THAT, but not the fact that you can't defeat \"trollism\"?\n\nOh, and they DO owe us something.
