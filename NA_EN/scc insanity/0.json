But if you would let me choose I would take 400RP reward since this account is couple of years old I should be eligible for that cause logic? :D  Can you check it out rioters and see what you can do. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T18:18:36.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 400 RP was only for an account that hit the correct level to get the RP. Old accounts are not grandfathered into the old rewards, so you'll be getting the beginner hextech chest and key. Did you just hit level 5 before posting this? Sometimes there's a bit of a delay before the chest and key are added to your account, so let me know if this is still happening after a few hours after hitting level 5.","replies":[]}]}
