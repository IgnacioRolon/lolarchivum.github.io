I started playing him when the Warwick and shyvana crazed happened i was able to defend the jg on my own or at least hold out long enough for laners to come in.

I&#x27;ve been playing skarner a lot lately, and he snowballs really really well, and can just go straight tank if you need him to. Also #1 rule: NEVER FACETANK HIM.\n\nhe's also pretty safe. You can actually turn off his passive and unlike some oppressive junglers {{champion:19}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:77}} that feel like the whole map is their jungle he has clear weaknesses. What you say can be said pretty much for {{champion:106}} as-well they're just not playing him because well probably cause of the hard CC he is lacking and no ranged attacks. And it depends who facetanks him. {{champion:19}}  and {{champion:77}} can. In fact don't face tank them using skarner.\n\nLastly skarner is a team player. For example he really can't kill you with his ult only drag you away and hit you with his Q which does little damage so his team mates have to kill the victim for you. Also his stun too. Skarner unless he scales with items can't really kill anyone unless they commit to fighting him. Which is why the stun is strong imo because it gives team mates too much time to kill the victim if it's just skarner on his own then it's not really much. Basically in the end anyone can snowball if they are ahead, some champions scale if the match last long enough example {{champion:56}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:120}} but thinking of those 3 which one is the weakest? {{champion:72}} is he really unfair when you can shut off his passive that's not even broken, deny his ult,  and dodge his slow projectile stun? I don't think so when there's a champion that get's fed on you being low health that has gap closing suppression with no counter besides him missing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Titanium125","date":"2018-02-26T14:45:25.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then again, every jungler pretty much ganks toplane before three minutes lvl 3 and with double buffs, so maybe it's just that.

Skarner is a heavy farm jungler so he needs to have good scaling to be worth it\n\nSpeaking of gutting, what about Corki? He got hit incredibly hard while he wasn't even getting banned, wasn't getting picked a lot in competitive, wasn't even performing that amazingly (~52%) etc. There was a [decent amount of feedback too](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/ZAm3nfAc-corki-nerfs-blow-my-mind-if-they-go-through-given-the-ample-feedback).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2018-02-26T05:00:15.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey.  Could Skarner get a mini-rework again?  He is very frustrating to jungle against because he is extremely difficult to duel or escape if he gets any lead whatsoever.  It feels like he sometimes just ends up owning both sides of the jungle and there is little that can be done about it to contest the crystal spires 1vs1.  Getting teammates to help the jungler can be impossible in solo-queue, and if Skarner's teammates join in too then teamfights often feel at a disadvantage even in your own team's jungle.  It feels terrible to run into Skarner as a weak jungler, because you can't fight him, you can't run from him unless you have flash and he doesn't (or you're playing something that can pass through walls), and half of your jungle will be gone even if you manage to escape.\n\nIf counterjungling is supposed to be part of Skarner's strength, then that's fine, but please make it so that it feels like it can be strategically outmaneuvered rather than Skarner just running people down.  I think Skarner should have his mobility and dueling power nerfed, and he should gain a new \"ambush predator\" mechanic as compensation.  He should be able to burrow into the ground, gaining stealth while hiding, and then should gain a short duration but large movement speed and attack speed buff when he 'leaps' out of his hole.  This would match the hunting style of real life arachnids, such as the trap door spider:\n\nhttps://thumbs.gfycat.com/IdioticBlondBoto-max-1mb.gif?noredirect\n\nThis mechanic would replace his passive and/or his W.  I think a good way to rework Skarner would be to make it so that his passive causes him to automatically burrow after standing still for a few seconds, similar to Teemo's passive.  Where there are currently crystal spires, there could be buried sources of crystal energy which Skarner can burrow into in order to gain regeneration while stealthed.  Skarner's W could be heavily nerfed but granted a special interaction with burrowing, where if Skarner casts W while burrowed, he leaps out in a target direction and deals damage where landing or passing through enemy units, gaining bonus shield based on damage dealt (increased ratio vs champions and epic monsters).\n\nThis would feel fairer in my opinion and would be a lot more interesting than just charging in and locking down an opponent.  The Skarner player would feel like he/she outsmarted the opponent if they succeed.  If Skarner's opponent predicts the ambush and avoids where the Skarner has burrowed, then the Skarner's time is wasted so it allows his opponents to strategically outplay the mechanic.  Other than ambushing players, Skarner would use the ambush stat buffs to make clearing the jungle more effective.  Skarner could also burrow somewhere near the dragon/baron pit and then leap out for a steal attempt.\n\nLaying in ambush somewhere could be a risky action because it would allow the enemy to surround Skarner, but the W leap + shield could be used as an escape + survival option in that case rather than an engagement tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Banazîr Galbasi","date":"2018-02-26T21:47:18.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would prefer if he didn't have to deal with his spires at all.

Also, having an identity of \"runs you down and perma-CCs you\" is bull shit.  If he's going to perma-CC you then he needs a condition that involves him out-maneuvering you strategically, not simply being faster than you because that condition doesn't offer any kind of counterplay for immobile champions that encounter him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2018-02-26T19:02:20.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scorpions don't leap though, they don't tend to be as fast as spiders either. \n\nSpeaking as someone who owns both as pets, Scorpions are much more content simply lying in wait.
