Look at me. \r\nI asked you a very simple question you mouthy little shit. \r\nAll you had to do was answer like a normal person and we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation. \r\nI don&rsquo;t actually care what a 12 year old is doing on their iPad, \r\nbut no, you had to say &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a computer.&rdquo;\r\nDo you think you&rsquo;re in a Wes Anderson movie? Do you think you&rsquo;re Zooey Deschanel? \r\nYou&rsquo;re not. Don&rsquo;t ask me who Wes Anderson is, I swear to God. \r\nStop doing tarot and astrology readings on Tumblr for five seconds and just tell me you know what a computer is and I&rsquo;ll leave you alone.\r\nI don&rsquo;t mean to lecture you. I like your mom and dad, I think they&rsquo;re good parents, but clearly something has gone wrong here, \r\nand if they won&rsquo;t take it into their own hands then I&rsquo;m taking it into mine for the good of the neighborhood. \r\nYour dad has a laptop, so even if you had somehow avoided the room in your house that had a desktop computer in it until last year, \r\nyou&rsquo;re absolutely aware of the concept of a computer. \r\nI know you&rsquo;re not a weird &ldquo;no TV&rdquo; household either, so even if you thought that laptop was just some kind of weird heavy slate-gray folder, \r\nyou&rsquo;ve seen cartoons or TV shows with computers&hellip; I see you moving to open your mouth, don&rsquo;t ask me &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a TV?&rdquo; or I will absolutely slap you. \r\nBarb from Stranger Things-lookin&rsquo; ass.\r\nLook, it&rsquo;s starting to get dark, and a crowd is gathering, and I feel like this all might be a waste of time, \r\nbut I am absolutely not leaving this back yard until you look me in the eyes \r\nand tell me that you know what a computer is. It&rsquo;s really that simple. \r\nI don&rsquo;t want to make a big thing out of this, but I&rsquo;m literally prepared to go on a hunger strike if you don&rsquo;t admit, in front of me and God, \r\nthat you&rsquo;re aware of the concept of a computer. \r\nYou weren&rsquo;t dropped onto this earth yesterday afternoon, fully formed and with a taste for doing quirky stuff on the go,\r\nyou&rsquo;re not Athena any more than your dad is Zeus. Oh, you get that reference. \r\nYou expect me to believe you&rsquo;re familiar with the specifics of Greek mythological figures&rsquo; origins but not a computer? \r\nFuck you.","replies":[]}
