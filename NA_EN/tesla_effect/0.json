Its truly beautiful, and its in the visual and interactive format I always wanted to see for this world. Cant wait to see more projects Riot comes up for it in the future (and some other projects like the Timeline ;)  )\n\nBut the issues that bug me are emphasized with the return of certain icons and inclusion of new icons for the in-game Runeterra Map missions. \nEvery older Faction icon return as obtainable icons (which is awesome, I know some friends that really like to get icons like Piltover or Noxus  but missed them initially so this is just amazing for them), but why isnt the Void icon included as well? Is it because it can also work/categorized as a Race icon similar to the recent Darkin icon?\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/7b/Void_profileicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180221204437\n\nAlso why didnt Bandle City get its own Icon made and included as an obtainable icon through missions?\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/68/Bandle_City_Crest.png/revision/latest?cb=20180724185419\nThe Amazing Runeterra map included this new Crest For Bandle City and it looks so good not to make an summoner icon for it.\n\nAlso Could you update the Universe faction site so that it incorporates these new colored crests for Bandle City and Void that are introduced in the Runeterra map?\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/cb/Void_Crest.png/revision/latest?cb=20180724201159\n\nThank you so much Riot for your time, hopefully you reconsider some of my suggestions, or at least answer some of these conundrums that were missed in this recent massive Lore Update.","replies":[{"poster":"KestrelGirl","date":"2018-07-25T03:11:08.325+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We simply have not yet had a Bandle City update.\n\nIt will become an icon when the region finally gets a lore update.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-07-25T03:14:35.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KestrelGirl,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=yQ0sqZGb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-25T03:11:08.325+0000)\n>\n> We simply have not yet had a Bandle City update.\n> \n> It will become an icon when the region finally gets a lore update.\n\nI totally get you, but they did give us this Crest.
