The armor break is nice af but its the spell you max last because the reward to upping it early is too tiny to count. you want armor%break lategame when everyone has armor, not early\n\nAlternatively, her Q or E. Q is nice, but doesnt go through walls nearly consistantly enough, i wouldn't change it if i were re-doing vi. the E is essential to her combo and i like the charges system, so it'd have to be a good change.\n\nOne option is to take the xinzhao approach, combine her passive or an ability with another, and give her a new ability.\nI'd combine W and passive since W has no cd in the first place and you get first solely because its the best to clear jg, but you lose on any ability to level2 gank. I'd go with this approach if i were the one updating her, but she'd need base nerfs to compensate for getting an extra ability.\nShrug\nI'd love to see it tho, i hope he does it someday xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2019-01-23T00:22:26.337+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":9,"body":"I know how to rework Vi into a viable champion.\n\nPassive - Increased from 10% ==> 20% max health shield.
