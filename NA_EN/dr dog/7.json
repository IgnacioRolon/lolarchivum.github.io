If you are wasting time, you are wasting life. There is no reason to waste your life on something that will not benefit you, such as up to 20 more minutes of a losing game. \n\nThe game I just played was a stomp from start to finish yet the enemy team wouldn't FF. It ended with a score of 52 to 28 with a 10k gold advantage, every dragon, every tower on their side taken, in about 35 minutes and a TANK with NO DAMAGE ITEMS hyper-carrying. That, to me, is not a game that should've been pushed beyond the 20 minute mark. People need to stop clinging to their damaged pride and just FF when a game is hopeless. \"Hey they might decide to quit or just keel over!\" is not hope, it's delusion. In the time the game took after the early surrender point, a new game could've been started that they could've won by the time this one finished.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2019-01-09T18:47:33.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed agreed, ive had quite a few games where they're at our base at 17 and theres obviously no hope yet 2 premade butt buddies with the combined score of 3/17 press no so ill just get the people who dont wanna be there to stop defending and let them end, honestly imo duos should only count as one vote unless they have different votes so a toxic duo cant just hold you in a match for 15 more mins","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-01-09T18:58:32.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Dog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fLknOVUE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-01-09T18:47:33.424+0000)\n>\n> agreed agreed, ive had quite a few games where they&#x27;re at our base at 17 and theres obviously no hope yet 2 premade butt buddies with the combined score of 3/17 press no so ill just get the people who dont wanna be there to stop defending and let them end, honestly imo duos should only count as one vote unless they have different votes so a toxic duo cant just hold you in a match for 15 more mins\n\nFunny Fact: I recently had an account permabanned because of a game where one person rage quit after feeding into a 1v1 three times in a row, a jungle talon who was intentionally giving the enemy objectives as part of his \"plan\", and a support who just wanted to quit while the ADC didn't care either way.

Just because you are doing trash why should we feel the need to surrender? so many games where I have had an epic comeback or the game turned around. The problem with a lot of people in this game is where they \"think\" the game is lost and play like trash because they \"feel\" the game is over already and then are not playing to the best of their abilities.
