I think you've actually highlighted what frustrates many players (myself included!).  It's that visual rankings don't really show how good you are but most players believe it is the proof of how well someone plays.\n\nMMR being hidden causes us to only have the visual ranks to look at. This also causes an issue where, lets say 2 players should actually be at gold 1 and are currently at silver 4. One may find  their way to gold 1 fairly easy while the other actually struggles to get there. After enough games, they should both be at gold 1.\n\nThe problem being that, before that end point, both players skills are perceived as different and this can cause some anguish for the player that takes longer to get to gold 1. They might even stop playing.\n\nIf MMR was visible, or even some stat that said \"you're playing at a gold 1 level\" might help players understand that they just need to play more for their visible ranking to match up to what their actual calculated is.\n\nThat or get rid of the best of 3/5 promos as it just seems to add a grind and frustration. Id be more in favor of this than anything else","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2019-03-26T21:40:03.757+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"I tend to agree too from the Player POV.

Pretty easy to check looking at people's match histories, streams, and so on; you can consider Silver to Diamond elos to avoid \"extreme\" cases (absolute randomness in very low elos; the same bunch of people playing over and over in the very high ones).\nJust in case, this is often evident since the very first minutes, before snoballing effects can actually become relevant.\n\nMoreover, you find VERY easy games in **too many** cases, and after a while VERY hard games in **too many** cases as well. There is **NO gradualness**, and this is the main crucial point where you can see things are not as you said.\n\nSo what?\nWell, you still get an overall 50% win-ratio, but it's MUCH more controllable, and make players play a lot more to get to their deserved elo.

Visual rankings are *NOT* 1 to 1 to MMR, which is what matchmaking looks at when creating a team. The system is never actually against you. It works to try to match you with and against players so that you have as close as a 50/50 chance of winning every game, including promos.\n> \n> Looking at the stats for the game (might be a little off since some have played games since then), the match was fair and even on both sides. The system actually matched that game with your team having a higher % to win.\n> \n> I want to share this because matchmaking is always a frequent inquiry we get in support where players feel it is unfair but the system works as it is intended to.\n\nSO if what you are saying is true , that the system is working as intended and that we are just psyching ourselves out by using third party sites why doesnt riot officially show us ingame stats as to what rank . winrate etc they are in a game. You are saying third party sites are off then why doesnt riot make their own site or system which displays the basic info? mmr , elo , winrate , past rank etc. Wouldnt that fix alot of complaining that \"dash dash riot made me play against higher ranks etc?\" if the stats are actually simlar and fair posted officially by riot would solve quite a bit of problems imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-26T20:45:29.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey keyru, I had two like 7 game long winstreaks and i started gaining more lp per victory when they ended, is there a reason for this?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2019-03-25T13:44:04.657+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Sounds like some plats are demoting soon and some silvers are promoting soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2019-03-25T13:45:12.136+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":10,"body":"has nothing to do with mmr at that point, they intentionally put you with teams like that reguardless because thats how promos are","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2019-03-26T09:09:05.894+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Platinum galio demoted into gold since your game.\n\nThe platinum top laner is clearly a jungle main based off their champion stats.\n\nThe gold pantheon is a nocturne jungle 1 trick.\n\nThe previously diamond jungler is hard stuck in gold atm.\n\nAll of this leads me to think that yes, the MMR did matter.\n\nYour top laner has a near 60% overall win rate so he is climbing fast.\n\nYour adc was around where he should be.\n\nYour support was finishing her promos from being in gold (so roughly the right MMR)\n\nYour mid was 9-4 in her games at the point you matched up so her mmr was also higher.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tuition Fee","date":"2019-03-27T01:32:05.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Dog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bcQt4yeV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-25T13:45:12.136+0000)\n>\n> has nothing to do with mmr at that point, they intentionally put you with teams like that reguardless because thats how promos are\n\nMatchmaking has been botched. \nKeep seeing unranked/bronze players at least every other game in gold.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-03-26T11:36:00.905+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hethalean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bcQt4yeV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-25T13:44:04.657+0000)\n>\n> Sounds like some plats are demoting soon and some silvers are promoting soon.\n\n_**The balance is shifting in the universe.**_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Optifreak72","date":"2019-03-27T14:24:57.273+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don’t know why anyone is even bothering with this. Everyone knows the system is seriously flawed for both ranks and match making.  Everyone knows riot doesn’t care enough to fix it.   \nThis season is even more glaring than normal for NA because riot decided to do positional ranks and lp then switched it up screwing everyone that participated in riots new system.   They should have either let that go or reset the season completely.  The partial fix just created more problems since the didn’t bother fully fixing the issue. \n\nRiot should just admit they screwed this season hardcore.  Then go about actually fixing rankings, mmr, and match making. \n\n1. Fix the way mmr is calculated so it actually includes your personal performance in games (for all rolls)\n   \n2. Just get rid of LP and promos.  Use the fixed and more accurate Mmr to determine rank.  Really Promos for anything below challenger is stupid.  Once you earn your way out of a crappy rank you shouldn’t be held back based on the random luck of a 3 or 5 game set of matches. \nAlso if a player is disconnected, something easy to see with basic programming, In a promo forcing 4-5  it shouldn’t  be counted as a loss in the promo series for those trying to rank up.  If the dc person is the promo person or duo with the promo person than ya give them that loss in the promo series.   It can still be counted as a loss for overall ranked, but you shouldn’t be punished in the promo series itself.  \n\n3.  Only let qualified players/champions  play ranked.  You should not only have to own the champion to use it in rank, but more importantly actually have experience playing that champion.  It doesn’t have to be a lot,  3-5k prestige but we should never see a 0 prestige champion being used in ranked play.  Also under certain situations if you are under punishment for things like afk or inting you should also be banned from ranked play. Riot would need to step up and actually looking at reports and determining if punishment is justified or not.

Rank is purely cosmetic south of Master.\n\nWhat would be better is if the rank was transparent and evaluated in the background on a delay.
