The screen is not freezing but only my champion.The ping and FPS was normal will it happens,. I think its problem is even worse than normal lagging, because after normal lagging everything happens very fast,you might find you already dead.When this happens you have to watch your champion go straight into their turret but you cant do anything. I tried to set every quality (charactor, environment...) as low, but it didn't work. \r\n\r\nThis experience is a torture. \r\n\r\nSO PLS FIX IT.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T15:20:48.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be experiencing a connection issue to our servers, which is causing you to lag spike.
