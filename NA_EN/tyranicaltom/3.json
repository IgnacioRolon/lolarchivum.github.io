Also, how tanky are they? Are they Tibbers levels of tanky or are they Yorick ghouls level of tanky? Also, what is the point of his passive and what does he look like?\n\nHe seems like he would have a problem similar to old Yorick and Swain. They seem a little fire and forget however due to the reactivate and ult you give them purpose. I also wonder, is he melee or ranged and is he glass cannon or bruiser-ish? Also, your underscores are messed up. \n\nI agree with what this guy said:\n\n>  ThatShinyPiplup (NA)  - 2 months ago\nI like this idea of summoning units to fight for you (strats!), but if they cost 10% of your hp to use, Them sharing damage with lorde just seems a bit anti-fun to me.

Just like 5 quotes, some basic lore, and a picture would go a _long way_ in creating a personality for Lorde. I'll take a look at your other champ you sent me in a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyranicaltom","date":"2016-09-25T02:27:56.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, you would be able to control the puppets. he has 3 puppets, a tank, an assassin, and a ranged. I want him to be a champion who can just be in the fight, but not be in the fight, if you know what I mean. The reason I made it 10% to summon one, is so that he would be able to kind of sit back in the fight, in a safer area, but also be able to be countered, by the puppets costing 10% of his current health, not his max health. even with this crazy cost, I tried to balance it out by giving him a ult transformation that is kind of like sion. basically regen the health he loses, but made it so that he cant constantly stay in that powerful ult form by also losing health over time in the form. Again, think of a sion passive, but losing health slower, and getting the regen. As for an image, I would do some artwork, but I cant draw for shit. Don't know for sure what I want him to look like, but I was thinking maybe a guy wearing a torn cloak or robe, or something. I was thinking maybe a mysterous looking guy with the dark torn robes. When He ults, basically he will look like I giant scary ass looking puppet, maybe hunched over or something. As for attacks, I was thinking he would use his strings as kind of like a ranged melee attack, (kind of like thresh). In his ult transformation, he would robably have claws as a weapon. hope this gives you more insight on my concept","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FLY Tana","date":"2016-07-15T23:12:22.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So from what I can pull out of this, it seems like an interesting fusion of Azir and Yorick. I may be off base with that but that's what I pulled. An opinion on each ability:\n\nPassive: We all know how much we hate Fizz for becoming untargetable. With about 45% CDR, he can do this every about 4 seconds (estimating). Judging by the fact that each puppet is a 5 second cooldown, this could be reduced to as low as (estimate) 2.7 seconds. Perhaps there should be some sort of lock out mechanic (can only become untargetable every X seconds, lowering as he gains a few levels). For example, and this is purely conjecture, something along the lines of 25 @ 1, 20 @6, 15 @9 and capping at 10 @ level 11ish. The damage to his puppets hurting him is a neat idea that makes this a bit more fathomable. Also, how long is the untargetability? 1 second? .5 second? Nail that down and give me a message :).\n\nTL;DR: With 45% CDR, a 2.7 second untargetable (puppet CD) is kinda bonkers. Consider giving it a separate cool down not attributed to puppet casts that scales down with level and is not effected by CDR. Also, how long untargetable?\n\nQ: (this first part goes for all puppets, so refer to the following 3 sentences for each ability.) Perhaps the puppets should have some sort of timer like Yorick's Gouls (though to a much lesser extent as they are the brunt of your character's kit). Exact numbers would help a lot in determining if the ability is OP/Balanced/UP. An idea, since the puppets cost 10% of your HP would to give them 20% of your HP and 50% of your resistances, and you take 50% of the damage dealt to the puppets (meaning you could lose 20% of your health for a badly placed puppet. Unique: Feels like a ranged Azir soldier but the counter play is in the form that the puppet can be killed and used to hurt you (as for all the puppets). Try to establish an exact attack range. For reference, I believe Lucian is about 525 units, average for a marksman is 550, and Caitlin, who has the highest BASE attack range in the game, has 600 units. Another question that goes for  all of the puppets: how exactly do you picture him itemizing? I can put together AD, possibly some sort of brusier due to E's Puppet.\nFusion: I think stun is an inaccurate term for what that is, this has more akin to a suppression ability, where both of you are locked down (See Warwick and Malzahar ults). 2 seconds is really long time for a hard CC basic ability (for perspective, a MAX range Ashe Arrow lasts 3 seconds). Throw in the fact that it is also healing you, and this is like a 13 second cool down (which can be reduced to as low as 7.5 seconds) Warwick ultimate. The ability should either be VERY short range (I.E. Melee) or have a much longer cool down.\n\nTL;DR: Establish the AA range of the puppet, get exact numbers for scaling.\n\nAbout to play some games with friends, so I'll finish this another time. Hope it is a little bit of food for thought :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal 7 ","date":"2016-07-15T19:12:03.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like the idea , but most might say its just another {{champion:83}} , o3o but i like the puppet idea","replies":[{"poster":"Tyranicaltom","date":"2016-07-15T19:37:59.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but I also will make it so you can completely control their movement and kind of not actually have to be fighting, to fight.
