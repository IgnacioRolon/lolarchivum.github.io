Idea for RIot.","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have no concept made for this, but I think it would be cool if there was a champion (preferably a female because the other two time mages are guys) that ages as the game goes on. I was thinking some kind of passive that makes it so that the champion would start as a young kid with a set of abilities that slightly change as the game goes on and she ages. Like, imagine if she had a quick dash ability that gets slower as she ages, but more powerful and has some added effect, like a knockback. I think this would be awesome. Let me know what you dudes and ladies think in the comments below, or give this an upvote if you think it would be cool","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal 7 ","date":"2016-07-25T17:37:13.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm, ... what would be the time range for her to actually grow up ,.. considering most games dont last long \n\nwould her aging be designed like a tear item ? ... as in , the more spells you use , you stack up age points ,  the more skills you use , the more life experience you gain , aging her  depending on the amount stacked\n\nor maybe something like gankplanks silver coins , killing the right amount of minions allows you to grow up\n\nor would it be something like , lvl based .. \n\nlvl 1 , shes a small kid , annie age like , \nlvl 6  she becomes a teenager , \nlvl 11 she becomes an adult ,\nlvl 16 , shes an old lady \n\nbut over all , i like the idea + 4828484 from me :^D)))\n\n {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
