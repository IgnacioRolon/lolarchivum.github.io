With silver streaked hair, a cloak of mist, and a sword so strong it can shatter the lives of cities within seconds, those who see him, are left in awe and fear of the foggy figure. Though many just search for the lost man to find answers to their troubles and questions, there are few that wish to stand against him to use his weapon to their advantage. Those who enter the mist with malicious intent are never seen or heard from again. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.orizon-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/swordsman4.jpg \r\nfollow this link to see an idea of what I want him to look like. \r\n\r\nMy concept for Syth is to be an adc that will be able to get upclose and personal as well as kite and be your traditional adc. I do not have ability costs, cooldowns, and stuff yet, so I will also gladly take in and consider reccomended ideas. Let me know what you guys think in the comments below and if you would like to see this in the game, upvote it, so riot can see!\r\n\r\nAbilities:\r\n\r\nPassive:\r\nFor every 1 Point of AD, Syth gets AP; For every 1 Point of AP, Syth gets AD. In melee stance, Syth has increased health, and abilities cost no mana. In Ranged Stance, Syth gains increased movement speed, and abilities are no longer manaless.\r\nQ:\r\nMelee Stance: No Cost; Throws forward a clone of his sword, marking and damaging enemies hit and may be recast to bring the sword back, dealing 50% damage to marked enemies, but full damage to unmarked enemies.\r\nRanged Stance: Syth creates a thick fog that rains down blades, stunning and blinding enemy champions caught in the area for __ seconds.\r\nW:\r\nMelee Stance: No Cost; Vanishes into a thick fog flashing to the sword, picking it up, and dealing damage in an area around it. (If Syth is already holding the sword when w is activated, next auto attack deals increased damage)\r\nRanged Stance: Syth expands sword, increasing attack speed and the range of auto attacks\r\nE:\r\nMelee Stance: No Cost; Syth spins once, damaging and pulling in enemies\r\nRanged Stance: Sword rotates around Syth knocking back all enemies and giving him a shield, lasting _ seconds\r\nR:\r\nMelee Stance: No Cost; Sword is released into the air becoming a ranged weapon\r\nRanged Stance: No Cost; Sword is released from the air, and becomes a melee weapon","replies":[{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2016-05-21T21:26:55.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a lot, but cant say it's op without numbers.

I think giving the movement speed to the Melee stance would be more beneficial if he is wanting to go all close and personal, while giving something else to the ranged stance to compensate. Not a numbers genie or anything, just a few stray thoughts from a fellow player ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Tyranicaltom","date":"2016-07-15T18:50:26.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah you might be right.

It was deemed rather unbalanced, with good reason too.  And unfortunately, yours is a 1 to 1 ratio.  It's easier to get ap, so imagine if you had 500 or more.  That's 500 extra ad.  And unlike Jhin, his attack speed isn't capped.  Also, shouldn't have he have less movement speed in ranged stance?\n\nMelee Q is an interesting skill, not much more to say about it.\nRanged Q is overloaded, having both a blind and stun component.\n\nFor the rest of the kit, I don't really have any issues aside from it being a bit dull and the E having a knockback.\n\nMy advice would be to add some numbers and spruce the kit up a bit, as well as possibly replacing that first part of the passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyranicaltom","date":"2016-05-22T16:46:48.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the input! For the passive, I had blanks there becUse it wasn't supposed to be a 1:1 but I probably will change it. I wanted to give him extra movement speed to be able to kite mor in ranged form.\n\nFor the blind and stun on the q, the blind would only last as long as the stun, so when they are stunned, they are covered by the thick fog, so they are not able to see.\n\nThink of the e beng a really small kickback, just giving you enough time to be able to back up a little, break someones combo, etc\n\nI sure will! I am far from done from creating him. thanks again for the input :)","replies":[]}]}]}
