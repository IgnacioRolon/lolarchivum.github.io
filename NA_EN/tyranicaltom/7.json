I do not think his range should be removed, but instead, take away his Shurima shuffle (e) and replace it with a shield that also speeds him up (for escapes or engages). In addition to this, his turret passive is amazing when you actually use it, but there really isn&#039;t much use when there aren&#039;t downed turrets. In addition to the risen turrets, I think it would be cool if Azir was able to cover an enemy turret with sand and take it over for a small period of time (or disable possibly) and if your passive is used on your own alive turrets, it would give the turret enhanced attack speed and you gain gold of the minions killed. Or... Maybe, if used on your own turrets, it gives you the ability to link yourself to a turret (like how taric is able to link himself to champs) and you gain a portion of the gold from minions destroyed and, or, your sand soldiers gain increased damage under your own turret. As for the ult? It wouldn&#039;t really be the greatest for the removal of his ability to dash to his soldiers. So maybe somehow a new ult or changed hot would be a decent addition to his kit. Maybe it could have the dash implemented into the ult or something of the sort","replies":[]}
