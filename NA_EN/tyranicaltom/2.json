Demacia is no exception. Born of the Lightshields, Rix was always taught on how to rule men and wage war against the enemies of Demacia. At a young age, Rix had always looked up to his father and his older brother, Jarvan IV. One day, when traveling with his family, amongst the streets of Demacia, The Lightshield&#039;s caravan was attacked by band of assassins, led by Noxus&#039; Talon. During the attempted assassination of his father, Rix was lost among the crowded streets of Demacia. Feeling alone and scared, Rix was forced to go into hiding amongst Demacia&#039;s citizens, hiding his true identity. With no place to stay and assassin&#039;s on the hunt for the blood of the Lightshield&#039;s, Rix retreated to the sewers. After days of hiding in the sewers, hunger and thirst had come to best his fear, and he decided it was time to head back to his family. Upon exiting the sewers one night, Rix crept through the crowded streets of Demacia and saw what the citizens of Demacia were truly enduring. Families with children younger than himself starved down, so skinny, that they were days away from possible death. Enfuriated by this sight, Rix decided that he no longer wanted to be part of the people who sat in their fine clothes and warm houses with fat stomachs, while there were people starving and dying in the streets of Demacia every day. With a newly formed understanding of the life of the less fortunate, Rix pledged that, from that day forward to steal from those who had more than they needed and to give to those in need. Years passed and word spread of this hooded man, and Rix became known as The Righteous Thief, yet none knew of his true identity. After countless years of carrying out this title and become a master thief, Rix was approached by a man who said he was part of the High Counsil of Equity and was asked to join the league of legends. Seeing no benefit, to killing others mindlessly, Rix refused. Having been refused, this member of the High Counsil, explained that there was money involved, in which he could use to help those in need. With a newfound attention, Rix hesitantly agreed.\n(Rix is a melee champion who uses a dagger and lockpick as his weapons)\nPassive - Chests periodically spawn on the map, which Rix may loot for bonus gold. (Enemies and allies have vision of the chests). In addition, when entering the jungle, river, or enemy base, Rix silences his steps, and turns invisible gaining bonus movement speed until he uses an ability or basic attack. ( 7 second cooldown)\n\n**Q: Pick and Dagger -** _Cooldown: 4/3.5/3/2.5/2 Seconds. (No Cost)_\nRix attacks twice. His first strike may critically strike and damages target enemy, the second strike cant critically strike, but deals damage to a small area around him.\n(Deals bonus damage to Neutral and Epic monsters)\n\n**W: Smoke Bomb -** _Cooldown: 17/15/13/11/9 (No Cost)_\nRix throws down a smoke bomb, losing all aggro and all enemy and ally champions lose vison of the area within the smoke bomb. (Does not lose tower aggro)\n\n**E: In and Out - ** _Cooldown: 11/10/9/8/7 Seconds. (No Cost)_\nRix dashes to target enemy, dealing physical damage and stealing movement speed. May reactivate ability to return to prior location\n\n**R: Thief&#039;s Den - **_Cooldown: (Any advice on the cooldown)_\nPassive: When Rix comes within vision of an enemy ward, Rix gains vision of it, is not spotted, and it is disabled . (80 second cooldown)\nRix creates an entrance to the sewers, in which him and his allies may use to travel to other sewage entrances. \n\n_**((NOT 100% Sure on the ult, but I want it to be something like that))**_","replies":[{"poster":"I eat ass so hmu","date":"2016-09-27T00:51:14.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is his ult like a Rek'Sai tunnel but for allies?","replies":[{"poster":"Tyranicaltom","date":"2016-09-27T00:55:14.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, thats what I was kind of thinking. might change it, but idk if it would be op, goood or just bad","replies":[{"poster":"I eat ass so hmu","date":"2016-09-27T01:00:18.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tyranicaltom,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=8hYHkZU7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-27T00:55:14.913+0000)\n>\n> yeah, thats what I was kind of thinking. might change it, but idk if it would be op, goood or just bad\n\nIt's a good idea, but league has a lot of similar skills that get you from one place to another. (ex; Tahm Ulti, Ryze Ulti, Bards E, etc.). But these are my thoughts, not saying it's bad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2016-09-28T23:21:32.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I commend you for trying to make a thief champion, but there are a few things with this concept, IMO:\n\n1) What does he steal? If the chests are just scattered around the jungle, then there's no feeling of ownership (it's not stealing, so much as _discovery_). \n\n2) He _feels_ like an assassin, rather than a thief. Most 'thief' concepts I see put forth fall into this trap. He feels like a DnD or WoW style Rogue, which isn't super ideal, IMO. Like, he would jump out at someone, press his buttons, and if he can kill them, he does. If he can't, he runs away and tries again later.\n\n3) His lore is kinda bland, and _sewers_ are kinda Twitch's thing. I get that thieves use secret tunnels and passages, but I don't think the connection to sewers is a good design / thematic direction. \n\n4) About the kit itself: The passive is effectively Evelynn's Shadow Walk with the bonus of having chests spawn around the map, the Q is similar to Fiora's Bladework, and the W is effectively Graves' Smoke Screen, and E feels really similar to LeBlanc's Distortion. The ultimate is really low interaction-wise, yet it simultaneously gives away his position (because the map will go dark in that spot for the enemy) and the active is kinda cool, but, again, _sewers_?\n\n---\n\nI am biased though, you see, because I've been working on [my own thief concept](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:LivesByProxy/Heir_To_Blackblade:_Fulfilling_League%27s_Thief_Fantasy).","replies":[]}]}
