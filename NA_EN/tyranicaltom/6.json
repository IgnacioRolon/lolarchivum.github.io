Demacia is no exception. Born of the Lightshields, Rix was always taught on how to rule men and wage war against the enemies of Demacia. At a young age, Rix had always looked up to his father and his older brother, Jarvan IV. One day, when traveling with his family, amongst the streets of Demacia, The Lightshield&#039;s caravan was attacked by band of assassins, led by Noxus&#039; Talon. During the attempted assassination of his father, Rix was lost among the crowded streets of Demacia. Feeling alone and scared, Rix was forced to go into hiding amongst Demacia&#039;s citizens, hiding his true identity. With no place to stay and assassin&#039;s on the hunt for the blood of the Lightshield&#039;s, Rix retreated to the sewers. After days of hiding in the sewers, hunger and thirst had come to best his fear, and he decided it was time to head back to his family. Upon exiting the sewers one night, Rix crept through the crowded streets of Demacia and saw what the citizens of Demacia were truly enduring. Families with children younger than himself starved down, so skinny, that they were days away from possible death. Enfuriated by this sight, Rix decided that he no longer wanted to be part of the people who sat in their fine clothes and warm houses with fat stomachs, while there were people starving and dying in the streets of Demacia every day. With a newly formed understanding of the life of the less fortunate, Rix pledged that, from that day forward to steal from those who had more than they needed and to give to those in need. Years passed and word spread of this hooded man, and Rix became known as The Righteous Thief, yet none knew of his true identity. After countless years of carrying out this title and become a master thief, Rix was approached by a man who said he was part of the High Counsil of Equity and was asked to join the league of legends. Seeing no benefit, to killing others mindlessly, Rix refused. Having been refused, this member of the High Counsil, explained that there was money involved, in which he could use to help those in need. With a newfound attention, Rix hesitantly agreed.\r\n\r\n**Passive -** Every 10 seconds, Rix&#039; next basic attack against a champion gives 15 bonus gold. \r\n\r\n**Q: Enchanted Dagger **- _Cooldown: 5/4/3/2/1.5 Seconds.
