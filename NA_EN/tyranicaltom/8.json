He is a puppet master who is kind of evil and crazy like jhin or shaco. If you want to do this for me, let me know and ill give you some info on what I want him to look like. (Would preferably like a good artist who has experience and can do  artwork that would be good enough to be splash art).","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-07-16T07:27:39.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just take a photo of Lordi's vocal and post it and you got your skin concept :DDDDD","replies":[{"poster":"Tyranicaltom","date":"2016-07-16T08:04:48.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao so many of these jokes.
