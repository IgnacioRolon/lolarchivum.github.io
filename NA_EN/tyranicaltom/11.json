My idea for the rework is to allow the player to choose which path they want to take in game (like kayne&#039;s 2 forms). I think it would be better, than the current plan to completely shit on Azir, to allow the players to choose in game whether they want to be be the short range drifting god or to be the long range puppet master with no shurima shuffle. Just an idea. Let me know what you all think. It really breaks my heart that they are going to change the way he is right now, but I guess they feel there is nothing they can do in As it&#039;s current state. Imo he is such a challenging champion to play, but rewards the player in some beautiful gameplay if they take the time to learn him","replies":[]}
