Void creature as pet. Abilities unmounted cost mana, abilities in jungle cost no mana and when ulting, ally&#039;s health is replaced with the pet&#039;s health. May control pet to do separate stuff or can link with character to follow champ and target same enemy. When pet leaves radius, champ can only use E because it is petless ability. Pet deals percentage of allies auto attack dmg. When pet leaves radius, it also has lower health. When pet health reaches zero, it flees to champ side, no longer auto attacking until healed. Pet can use other Q and R when not in radius. When out of radius, w calls pet to champ. Pet doubles movement speed when moving toward champ after w is pressed, while targeting champ (cant be cancelled). when not following champ, targeting pet and clicking w is used to control pet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: \r\n\r\npet with separate health and targeted auto attacks.\r\nWhen entering jungle or river, you may mount pet for an increased movement speed and new effects. Pet gains increased movement speed even when not mounted while in jungle. \r\n_________________________________\r\n\r\nQ: \r\n\r\nsends pet dashing forward. Shielding any allies it passes and damaging enemies.\r\nMounted: jumps forward, dealing Aoe damage to all enemies at location and taunts monsters and lowers their damage towards self\r\n_________________________________\r\n\r\nW: \r\n\r\nchampion calls to pet, passively increasing atk spd and atks deal true damage. (Can only be used when pet is following champ)\r\nMounted: (passive) attacks and abilities now heal and do extra damage to monsters\r\n_________________________________\r\n\r\nE:\r\n\r\n champ throws spear forward, tagging enemy and marking them. Pets attacks now slow marked enemy champion\r\nMounted: jumps off and sends pet forward, stunning opponent and champion may recast it to travel to targets location, removing stun\r\n_________________________________\r\n\r\nR: \r\n\r\nPet fuses with target ally for a time limit, massively increasing attack speed, movement speed, damage, health, and replacing all abilities with a scream that scatters the enemies mind, turning all surrounding allies invisible for a certain amount of time.","replies":[]}
