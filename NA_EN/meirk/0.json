Most of them i won and got s rank \"not to brag\". Riot I played with my friend, and I've been told that the more friends on your team, the higher chance of keyshard dropping. I'm tired of playing games trying to get a key for awesome skins, but I just haven't gotten jack squat.

However, the more keys you earn initially, the less chance you have of earning them in the near future.

If I reroll three skin shards, do I have a 100% chance to get a skin permanent, or could it be something else? What about three champion shards?\n* Third, is it true that one can only obtain sixteen key fragments per month? I've heard it on the Boards, but haven't seen any official Riot confirmation.\n* Fourth, is there a way to tell when one's key fragment rate will increase again? I didn't keep track of the match where I got my first key fragment, so I don't know how long ago thirty days passed.\n\nThanks in advance!
