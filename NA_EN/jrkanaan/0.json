I started playing ranked at the season start and did pretty shit and only knew how to play a few champions. from there I put my winrate down the shitter but in that time I have really learned how to master my lanes and the champions I play. I always play {{champion:45}} because hes good against low elo players and because I always get told 1 tricking is best in low elo. The biggest problem right now is that I am matched with very dumb teams which gets me to losing streaks such as feeding trundle top laners and feeding towerdiving nasus jungle. I try to keep my cool in these games but its hard because it seems like every game I do is just a coinflip and most of the time the team I get is a joke. Its really hard to climb at this point and I want to see what u guys think and if u guys ever been here. I really dont like feeding trundles so help pls","replies":[{"poster":"Mavëríck","date":"2019-03-26T23:37:23.801+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abandon that account and make a new one using the knowledge you now have. You can't fix your win rate now and frankly, the LP loss is just too harsh at this point.

Either just keep playing for fun until season reset or make a new account.\n\nYour skill level and MMR is probably somewhere on iron 2-3, you are just in bronze 4 because of the league system preventing downmotion.\n\nUnless you _greatly_ improve your gameplay and pick up a 10ish games win streak, you're never fixing your MMR this season. You can just keep playing for fun (I did that at plat V 0 LP hell last season i knew i would never rank up i just stopped giving a shit after a while and just tried to have fun) if that's what you want. But don't expect to fix that winrate in one or two days of playing.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-03-27T00:31:03.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of the BLARING problems with Riots MMR system.   Accounts get locked into a rank and no matter how good you play you cant get out of it because its a Rigged system.  Once it thinks you should be at a Rank it will do its damnedest to make sure you stay there.   Its like having a Rubber band attached to your back and a Rank spot.  You can win and win and the climb up in the rank but the Rubber band gets stronger and stronger pulling you back until you start losing.  THEN it throws you down so far you might as well never have played in the first place.\n\nHaving to make a new account to try and stick that Rubber band at a higher place is stupid.   \n\nThe system does not allow for you to improve fast unless its a new account.\n\nIt WANTS you to play 1000 games to go from B4 to B1","replies":[{"poster":"karolmo","date":"2019-03-27T14:21:54.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system should just not hold you on B4 if your MMR is on iron 3. It looks really frustrating because the MMR system wants you to go down to gold/bronze/whatever but the league system locks you on platinum/silver/whatever. So the MMR system makes sure you never rank up.\n\nAnd yeah, it takes way too much effort to fix bad MMR. I've been in Legend on Hearthstone and climbed from 16k (absolute hell) to top 500 in two days of good winrate. If that had been riot's league system i would've probably climbed 1000 positions or the like.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-03-26T23:33:44.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"by actually enjoying it. it is only hell if you hate it. so by simply letting your hate go and liking it it will not longer be hell for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-26T23:32:05.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
