Why not show us while in the lobby?  I'm not computer illiterate so I imagine this happens to more than just me but sometimes I start a game and I'm lagging without prior knowledge.  Then i'm dealing with router issues or roomate downloads or whatever the case may be.  This could have been avoided if you gave me a latency monitor at the lobby.  If I see it in the lobby I won't even start the game until it's fixed, therefore not ruining everyone else's experience while I'm trying to fix the issue.  PLEASE DO THIS! THANK YOU","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T05:49:02.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the game itself is played on a slightly different server, your connection in the lobby wouldn't reliably tell you what your connection in game would be. We do actually have a newer tool that can give you a roundabout estimation called the [**Lag Report Tool**](https://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/), but ultimately it's up to you to be sure your connection stable and ready to play.","replies":[{"poster":"4nother Way","date":"2018-02-01T04:22:40.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The suggestion is to show that lag report stat in the lobby instead of making us leave the client to check our ping pregame and it's not necessary to be perfect we're talking about showing ping to google server or something but in the client.  Ultimately it's up to us ... no shit that's why were asking the dev's to make it easier to be aware of issues before effecting others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-19T03:23:12.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you mean the lobby prior to getting in a match, or the lobby when a match was found? I think if it was visible prior, it would be a nice heads up. If it was during the match lobby, I think some people would feel more justified about dodging and do so more often. \n\nI played a game a couple days ago (or tried to), and ended up getting a constant 800-1300 ping. After about 5 minutes in, I ended up getting a memory related bsod crash, automatically collected data and restarted, and tried to get back in as soon as possible. Luckily for me, this is the first time I've crashed in months (if not over a year), and I've never intentionally left or AFK'd past the limit even longer than that. Had I known that the ping was going to be that high and constant, I probably wouldn't have queued (though the cause of that high ping was likely my fault). After it restarted and reconnected, my ping was back to normal (130-200 is normal for me). On another note though, the client was perfectly smooth for me, it loaded up like it regularly would, so I didn't expect it to lag so intensely in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Furian Darktide","date":"2018-02-01T03:18:43.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely prior to getting in match.  It doesn't have to be the ping from where the server is at... any ping to show that you are within range of playing (50-150) would be helpful.  If i'm pregame inviting friends and see my ping (to whatever serve) is 500MS, no way I would start a game, no way my friends would want to start the game with me.  Seems logical to have it.","replies":[]}]}]}
