ARE YOU SERIOUS? from her Season 4 stats its half the dmg, does 50%? 40% of her PC passive... i dont quite know anymore after them LITTERAL 23 nerfs in a roll i stopped keeping track... If you're an adc and you're getting out poked by Sona you need to learn to trade, also if your support isn't poking her when you can't then your support needs to learn to play, ontop of all that IF you're using Leona, Blitz, or Thresh and you're not shredding Sona every time she comes up to poke with her STUPIDLY SHORT Q RANGE then you both need to learn to play :|","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-03-26T06:13:56.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In ARAM she is.

You could probably faceroll games by being a good Sona in bronze. When someone is last pick and they tell everyone that they're terrible at support, but none of the rest of the team listens, Sona is the go-to pick. So, either you get the worst support you have had in your life, or your opponents underestimate your Sona, and she actually helps you win lane. Other than that... she usually doesn't do quite so much during the late game, other than her really big stun. Like, if I had one complaint about Sona, it's the fact that it's practically impossible to miss with your ult as long as they're in range.\n\nOverall, there are much more terrifying supports out there. I don't really see her getting a nerf before Braum, Leona, Blitzcrank, Morgana, Lux, or Thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-26T06:07:39.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Sona is that while she is annoying... her hard counters happen to be the most popular supports.\n\nHer range isn't that far, and can put her at risk when poking (it's approximately aa range, IIRC, so if you lasthit the minion she's next to a Blitz/Thresh grab will make sure she dies in seconds).\n\nPeople consider {{champion:267}} to be Sona 2.0 (I disagree, but...) she has a point-and-click damage+heal spell, and a cc bubble that can be aimed past your minion wave, not to mention her ult has much farther range.\n\n*shrugs*\n\nI'd say Sona is balanced, but needs a rework.
