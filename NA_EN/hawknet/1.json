As you all know at this point, Urf mode went live at 10:00 PM PST - and the ensuing rush into the NA server resulted in some massive load on the login queue.  This has resulted in players getting stuck at position 1 for long periods, getting error messages that the server isn't responding, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs of writing this, the LQ was at 70,000 players and still climbing just prior to setting the launcher to Busy.  It's currently plateauing and beginning to decline at this point.  I can't give an ETA on when things will be all clear just yet, but will regularly update this thread with how things are looking.","replies":[{"poster":"Scrimsh√§w","date":"2015-04-01T06:19:01.373+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was logged in, logged out because i thought i had to update, and now i'm locked out forever. crying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hawknet","date":"2015-04-01T06:40:58.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've just opened the LQ back up, and are closely monitoring.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Androgotus","date":"2015-04-01T06:19:39.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got off work and waiting for this was the only thing that got me through a very stressful day rito pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"biohaz4rdx","date":"2015-04-01T17:34:49.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It have passed almost 12 hours since the \"did not receive a response from server\" message appeared and i still cant log in","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wrath of the D","date":"2015-04-01T06:27:51.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D/Ced out of a ranked game, and then discovered that I can't log in.

And, it's using/stealing resources?\nIf so, from a previous case, we could be compensated heavily, as it would be damaging to our hardware.\n\nIf NOT, then Riot should abandon their own network creation and let Pando Media Booster handle the data flow. Apparently whoever is in charge is not doing their job correctly... And the boss can't seem to see this. So, I need to say this. Doesn't matter who is not doing their quality control, someone needs to be sanctioned. Suspension or Fired. Of course even a warning would be fair game, can't have this level of service.\n\nSure if they made their own network, they could potentially provide better service, but since their new network, things been downhill across the board. Doesn't matter if some areas are getting improvements.\nThey need to gradually roll out their network and not just do a big bang, same concept cell phone coverage providers do with their network.\nYOU CAN'T JUST ROLL OUT A NETWORK.\n\nWho rolls out a network and just hopes it work out for the best and call poor performance a small hiccup?\nThis was done intentionally, or the person just did't know better and was incompetent!\nYou can only drop the ball so many times... I care and I will speak my mind.\n\nFor example Verizon, the most expensive and reliable cell phone coverage provider has rolled out Fios a really good internet provider for 5 years now and is still not in my area. Why? Cause they simply can't. Imagine, Verizon, a big company can't roll out a network world-wide or even nation wide in 5 years!\nJust stop Riot! Were not your guinea pigs, we are your clients, fans, your loyal support, but enough is enough!\n\nDo you think it's worth being sued?\n**Wasting Paid Internet Bandwidth is a Damage Players could potentially sue for.**","replies":[]}]}
