For anyone unfamiliar with terms such as &ldquo;[Helicopter Horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LVo2PJF5Wc)&rdquo;, or the glory days of [Ultimate Faceroll Sona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO0PDLs47qU), U.R.F. mode brings with it some truly insane moments for the game.  However, alongside the skill spam and huge amounts of death and destruction, the game servers take a serious beating as well.  Left unchecked, the extra load can potentially cause Bad Things to happen to the entire region.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for this possibility, we&rsquo;ve been working on a variety of tactics to keep things stable while U.R.F. is rocking.  During extremely high server load, you may experience longer wait times than normal when queuing up for U.R.F.  In extreme cases, the game mode could even be temporarily disabled.  You may also notice that U.R.F. mode against AI bots is temporarily throttled or disabled, which allows more headroom for 5v5 PvP U.R.F. matches.  Finally, the minimum number of players needed to create custom games could be temporarily increased.\r\n\r\nOur overall aim is to have as much uptime for U.R.F. mode as possible, without negatively impacting the rest of the region.  We&rsquo;re confident that U.R.F. mode will be a blast, and will take every precaution to keep the rest of LoL gliding along as well.  Our hope is that this post gives some advance insight into what&rsquo;s going on should any of the above tactics have to take place.  Alright then, that&rsquo;s all from us.  We&rsquo;ll be seeing you all on the corpse-strewn hellscape of the U.R.F. battlefield.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll be hanging out to answer questions.  Hope everyone&#039;s enjoying Urf so far!","replies":[{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2015-04-01T20:52:16.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for letting us know in advance!\n\nI'm curious how much of a beating the servers are going to take as people start coming home from school/work in all regions of NA and logging in to get their Ultra Rapid Fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawknet","date":"2015-04-01T21:08:34.293+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Garlyle Wilds,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=JzbtwbI8,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-01T20:52:16.715+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for letting us know in advance!\n> \n> I'm curious how much of a beating the servers are going to take as people start coming home from school/work in all regions of NA and logging in to get their Ultra Rapid Fix.\n\nOur estimates put a regular Urf mode 5v5 PvP game at about 50% more expensive resource wise than a standard Summoners Rift game.  The sheer number of extra calculations taking place from all the skill spam and mayhem make things run pretty hot, especially when multiplied thousands of times over.","replies":[{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2015-04-02T12:50:09.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wowow this black and red name is badass","replies":[]},{"poster":"APenguinOnIce","date":"2015-04-01T21:11:08.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually cant login.

Thanks for the heads up!\n\nResources are shared by all running game modes, so the only way to \"transfer\" those resources would be to throttle or disable certain queues.  For example, disabling custom games containing just one player means more room for everything else as a result.  The same idea applies to everything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-04-01T20:59:19.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok.
