I don't see any record of a purchase on your account.  I can't currently look up payment information, but if it was a credit card purchase, I'd double check to make sure it went through.  Sometimes on failed transactions the funds can be held in a \"pending\" state for a few days by the card provider.\n\nIf it wasn't a credit card purchase or the payment is confirmed on your bank statements, go ahead and [send us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll take a look :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wizaroni","date":"2016-05-10T04:00:40.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i payed for rp today and didnt get it help plz","replies":[]}]}
