Basically, packet loss means parts of your connection are getting lost before it ever reaches our servers, which can make this type of issue out of our hands. Let's test really quick for any packet loss to see what exactly is going on before jumping to any conclusions though.\n\nGrab your latest network logs from a game that had that weird lag, and let this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it.

[Here's](https://goo.gl/eC96Tg) the log from my latest game where the issue took place","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T00:11:43.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, yea so it looks like that game was suffering from an *awful* lot of packet loss, upwards of 45% even. Basically, that means only *HALF* of the game data was making it all the way to the servers and back which is why you had that weird lag. I would first take that screenshot to your ISP to show them the issues you're having to see if they can restart or fix the way your connection is being routed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
