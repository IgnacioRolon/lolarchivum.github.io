I've looked over your account and it looks like something went wrong after that tournament and everything was wiped instead of being reset. \n\nIf you can, reach out to them to get this fixed since this took place at their event. If they're unwilling to help you at all, save all the conversations you have with them and shoot them our way in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Once we can see that they're unwilling to right this wrong, we can step in and make everything right ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Predixtion","date":"2017-08-14T02:52:39.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there no other way? I will not be able to get a hold of them for a week. Im also not sure how would they \"right the wrong\". Like are they going to have to reimburse me or something?

I guess I have to wait a while cause of that. Could I possibly know is this something that could very well happen again to my account if I go to another League Unlocked events or is this just a really weird case?
