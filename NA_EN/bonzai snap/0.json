Now when she attacks she doesn&#039;t do the hip shaking, moving her legs back-and-forth motion anymore. I understand her kit got changed for the Pre-Season with the new Love Tap passive and all, but why did the AA animation get changed? Now it looks like she&#039;s stiff and her shooting stance although more realistic, is not as hot and &quot;sassy&quot; anymore. I was growing to love it tons ever since it got inserted in July. It gave her lots of character!  \n\nCould KateyKhaos or another Riot member please explain if there was a specific reason that ushered the change? I know I&#039;m probably the only one who cares about this, and that it&#039;s not the most important thing but as my favorite champion, it added a lot of charm to playing MF in my opinion. I put a poll up to see your opinions on the matter. Please let me know. Thank you!\n\n\nSincerely, \nBonzai Snap","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T23:08:27.791+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hiya Bonzai Snap,\n\nI spoke to the animator about this one and he said, *\"We mainly did it to address player/internal feedback that they looked strange and noodle-y at high speeds, and to help make the follow-through match the direction of the shot better to help with her new passive.\"*\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Bonzai Snap","date":"2015-11-20T04:41:44.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi KateyKhaos!\n\nThought my post was buried but so glad it didn't! Okay it makes sense. It's funny because I was thinking about this after posting, comparing her current animation to the previous one, and concluded that it was probably to make her more fluid or something. Glad my thoughts aligned with your comment. Aaw I'll miss the old animation as short-lived as it was. But it's justified. Now that I know the why of it, I can sleep tonight!
