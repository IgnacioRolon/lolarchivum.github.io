Toxic players have been ruining everyone&#039;s games and tend to blame or flame others.I cannot stand toxic players.A couple games back I was warwick with a huge issue of lagging and I told everyone I was at a 1000+ ping and they were understanding which I was fine with.For the understandings,a Lux decides to flame me for being trash at the game even though I pinged with a 1000+ ping.This Lux flamed me but had the most deaths and didn&#039;t even try to help the team.Even though I was laggy I still help my teammates.Personally,I am not toxic and I love playing with players that are understandable and mature.These toxic players are the reason why I and maybe you guys have second thoughts about ranked.Weirdly,I have friends that are chill but when I play with them,they are so salty for every move I make.I don&#039;t blame,get angry at them,or even flame them back because I know that they don&#039;t have the guts to say it to my face.Anywho,I think Riot should be high alert for people who are toxic.For players who are having a bad time,I don&#039;t mean you are toxic.Just players who do it intentionally.And I like to teach you guys that toxic players can flame you all they want but they won&#039;t have the guts to say it in your face personally.Good luck in the fields of Justice!","replies":[{"poster":"Bishasaurus Flex","date":"2017-02-20T06:10:48.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You act like you've never been toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Itankyou","date":"2017-02-20T07:19:31.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preach that truth big brother {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"AJRA2k16","date":"2017-03-02T08:08:06.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No my brother.Thank you for reading this and I know well that you're a good person and I like that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr Urgod","date":"2017-02-20T05:54:14.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I personally hate are the people that harrass you and flame you or put you down, but then compliment and act all nice to a fellow teammate with smiley faces n shit.

There's no like repetitive engagement with multiple players like other team sports, where you actually know the other person doesn't actually suck that much. People get mad because in this one game, which is their only impression of the other person, they are playing badly. Basically it's because people online are assholes, and they get mad when teamates suck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-20T05:35:38.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize a large percentage of the league community is around 13-16...
