Unfortunately, there's not much more I can offer here apart from submitting a ticket.  I looked into this for you, and it looks like you're creating quite a bit of tickets.  Doing this can cause a delay in response as well as confusion.  Also, replying to the same ticket constantly can drop you back to the bottom of the queue.  Hang tight and be patient!  We'll respond as soon as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"HentaiBlitzcrank","date":"2016-08-05T08:15:12.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ooh okay, sorry for but 2 tickets had no attached zip..., i will wait for a response","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
