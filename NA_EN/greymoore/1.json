During laning phase, I can't throw out E willy-nilly to clear waves or punish an enemy with Q+E when they wander in range, because my E is gated behind two requirements rather than just one (CD). It takes a little power from Kassadin, which makes his laning phase a little weaker without affecting his teamfighting. \n\nFor example, Kassadin vs Azir means you'll have E up a *LOT*, while you'll get to use it less against Varus. \n\nSide-note: Kassadin's E also functions as a sort of radar. If you stand close enough, you can actually detect the jungler being near Raptors by way of checking your E counter go up despite no abilities being used in lane. It's also a good warning for Shaco. :D","replies":[{"poster":"ReZisT Lust","date":"2016-09-17T12:55:08.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Push i just auto kass with my zap stick soldiers are my  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  people too  imma be a real leader and go full ad  Ra-merica","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2016-09-17T10:12:44.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you mean by benefit since its has 6 seconds cooldown???
