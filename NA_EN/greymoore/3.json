What one person considers to be \"balanced\" another person may consider broken/unhealthy. Balancing this game is like politics. People have different opinions and we won't always agree on anything. However, win rates/play rates etc cannot be disputed. 2+2 will always equal four. My point is numbers don't lie!

There is no such thing as a wrong number. Regardless of where the information comes from, these are REAL facts that cannot be disputed. And it really doesn't matter what build Ezreal uses. He uses multiple builds based on the enemy team. But since you brought up IBG, let me mention that he actually has a 46% win rate with it. I'd also like to point out that Ezreal is one of the only adc's without cc (Lucian and Sivir also have this problem). IBG slightly helps with this problem, but as stated by others he sacrifices a TON of damage for it. And again the ability that applies the slow is a skillshot, just like everything else in his kit. Almost all of Ezreal's damage can be avoided/reduced if you're good at dodging skillshots (or if you have minions to block them for you).\n\nAnd yes balance is completely subjective. Champions are balanced around personal tastes/wants instead of what's healthy for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2016-10-25T21:36:10.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There IS such a thing as a wrong correlation. \n\nhttp://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations\n\nThe number isn't what's wrong, it's the interpretation. Basically, saying that win rate directly correlates to health is a logical fallacy because **correlation does not imply causation.** In scientific inquiry, the interpretation matters AT LEAST AS MUCH, if not more, than the data. That's widely accepted in science, and those same principles apply to the data collected in a video game.\n\nSaying that \"balance is subjective\" like it's a fact is ludicrous. No sane designer wants balance that is subjective. Again, you are mixing up fact with interpretation. We all interpret balance decisions differently, but the ideal can still be objective. You're just plain wrong on that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-10-25T06:22:48.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Balanced\" isn't the right word.\n\n\"Unhealthy\" is a better one.\n\nAlthough it does vary, if it's consistent over time, that champion tends to be a proble,\n\n{{champion:105}} for example","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-10-26T00:49:16.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was trying to explain how\n\n\"unhealthy\" refers to the poor experience of playing as/with/against a champion \n\n\"balance\" refers to the strength of the champion\n\nthe confusion is because most OP champions (aka, \"imbalanced\") indeed have unhealthy gameplay.
