If an ability has a scaling of either type it will do increased damage based on that % bonus regardless of the final result damage being. For example: If Kat's ult scaled the same amount off AD as it did AP, having 320 AP would still have the same result as 320 AD.

This is actually a fairly potent combination; it gives her strong early game damage, and when she finishes MR and BC she does very decent team fight damage and cuts healing for everyone she hits. The MR was started with an EC to help cut the Ekko, Olaf and ADC healing that game.\n\nBut please, don't play this in solo queue unless you know why it is good. Specifically, it's good against Zyra because her E has similar range to Zyra E and MF can get a full ult channel off before the ult of Zyra R goes off.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IPromiseTomorrow","date":"2016-10-22T00:48:28.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also build Liandry's then put in Rageblade.

Then the MF ult wipes their hp away so the other side basically can't contest lane because they have a squishy support that can't go near.\n\nIDK why they didn't think to try a Braum pick but I guess they still took the series","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-10-22T16:14:16.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel brings hard CC to the table, MF doesn't.
