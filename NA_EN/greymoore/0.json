In terms of visuals, gameplay, etc. (even just mentioning those, champs like Nunu, Morde, Corki, Evelynn, Xin, Panth, etc. kind of blush in embarrassment at 2015's standards, yet they probably won't see this list for quite some time), there are a lot of champions that are left wanting, and the bar is constantly raised as technology improves and as the design team learns more and more from their previous successes and failures.\n\nThere was a Red comment earlier, mentioning that, while new champions/skins/events get login screens and accompanying musical themes, older ones will probably get such treatment unless they get a rework on the level of Sion, Poppy, or Taric--so that leaves the question of, is 50%+ of the roster going to get left in the dust?

You guys need to make his kit similar to Zed's yet also the antithesis of his because of lore.
