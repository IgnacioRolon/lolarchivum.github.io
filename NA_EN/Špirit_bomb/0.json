After seeing Championship riven being re-released as a kind of reworked version, what are the chances of Riot Singed returning also? Would love to know on behalf of my fellow singed mains who are dying to get this skin! Interested to hear from a riot member also :) Have been playing League of legends for 5 years and is the only skin i've ever wanted... \r\n\r\nThanks for your time! {{champion:27}}     {{summoner:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T20:18:38.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Per the[ legacy skins](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins#h1q5) guide, it looks like Riot Squad Singed is a limited skin.
