Everything you own is just stuff. You are just a sack of water and assorted parts. Cool... are we done overly simplifying things to make them seem meaningless yet?\n\nPeople apply different amounts of value to different things in life.

They might play this game and then get interested in improving the game, and then go work for Riot, and then make a career out of it that can effect the rest of their life.\n\nMaybe someone plays this game instead of going for a walk, and had they gone for a walk, they would have been hit by a drunk driver that veered off the road and killed them. That would have definitely impacted their future.\n\nMaybe some guy plays this game and makes a friend... and then he finds out the friend is a girl and then they find out they like each other a lot, meet up, and end up getting married and having kids and living a great life together.\n\nMaybe some guy plays this game and gets really good, goes on to compete in the LCS, becomes the best LoL player of all time and goes on to live a life of fame and fortune.\n\nBut yeah dude, it's just a game that has no impact on your future.\n\nThe only person with a sad perspective on life is you.
