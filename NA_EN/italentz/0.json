Leaver buster is as much a wake up call to fix issues before playing, as it is a penalty.\n\nFor the amount of games I have played this month 3 afk's isn't much. Now I remember 1 game which ended up in a remake because my client crashed and the other one I don't remember. Fact is I don't deliberately afk nor did I have internet issues or other things which I can be held accountable for. \n\nYou are telling me to fix issues before playing while first of all client crashes and bugs are not within my power to fix nor prevent and secondly if the client is bugged you start noticing it during a match and not necessary before. So I believe 2 things should be implemented.\n\n1: A way to see your ping in the client so you know whether it is safe or not to join a game\n2: A safeguard that checks if the client crashed or had bugs so you don't get penalized for it","replies":[{"poster":"SavageConcordia","date":"2017-05-18T12:53:51.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Load up in practice mode, that will test your ping to Riots servers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-02-07T23:38:01.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surprise surprise it's not what the original posts says. 3 games in a month is a lot I always run a practice game each day before I play to test my ping (I have high internet speed but sometimes it's questionable while playing League for some reason, and for client crashes).

I think the system may be treating the client issues that me and others are experiencing as intentional never-connects - because the client will not work for us.\n\nThree games in a month, when one of them is due to client issues that are likely not the fault of the player, hardly seems worthy of a leaverbuster, unless the player has only played 3 games in the past month.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-05-17T23:59:23.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is unusual for someone to be placed into LeaverBuster for a first time leaving/afking.  After the first game of leaving/afking you should have been given the pop-up warning from LeaverBuster, where you have to type in that you agree not to leave any more games.  After that, if you continue to leave games, after a couple more you are placed into the low priority queue with a 5 minute wait.  You really shouldn't have been placed into LPQ for a first game left.  \n\nWhile the [LeaverBuster/Low Priority Queue FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714) says that they do not remove accounts from the LPQ under any circumstances, it also says that accounts aren't put into it for a single match.  I would agree with Jo0o, a ticket to Player Support might be your best option here.  If nothing else, they can tell you whether your account was flagged for multiple leaves during the same match.  And if so, they may be willing to take you out of the queue, as that would be an error on the part of their system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-05-17T23:12:39.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never heard of that happening before. Very weird. \n\nI'd try a support ticket... maybe the client counted you as abandoning a game each of the times that it crashed during the one game?
