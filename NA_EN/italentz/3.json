Tabi?  Magic resist is still good, but not relevant here.  \n\nIt used to be 2+ members of the team would go FH (when it slowed AS by literally twice as much as now, and gave more armor for a lower cost) now I can't remember the last time I've seen a single person buy it.  Cold Steel, or rather, the passive it replaced before it was named, was a 20% ms and attack speed slow, not is a 10% as slow alone [which was somewhat recently buffed back to 15% at least, but it now has a shorter duration]  Randuin's active used to be a four second AoE movement and attack speed slow of equal value.  Now the AS slow is entirely fucking gone, the duration is fucking cut in half (only 2 seconds vs 4) and its even a weaker slow than it used to be (55% instead of 60%) while the item gives less stats, and costs more. \n\nHP regen is a joke, and tank items other than 'Mogs don't even have it any more at fucking all, except for {{item:3800}} which then has next to no defensive stats to pair with that regen, but with its active it is easily the single best tank item in the game currently, which say a fuckton about how much tank items have been utterly fucking annihilated.  Even if you have massive HP regen, its out of combat, like Ocean Dragon or Warmogs, and utterly useless in the fight which is the antithesis of how it used to be, with HP regen working for tanks to counter the lifesteal and spell vamp of damage classes.  ADCs still treat tanks as mobile fountains or HP batteries due to rune alone, let alone actual lifesteal items (which, of course, just got systemic buffs across the board +5 AD and -100g for virtually all of them) but tanks no longer have in combat regen.\n\nOh, and then think of all the extra instances of true damage flooding in.  Between IE and Conquerer, when I play a tank I die from between 45-75% true damage, even if the other team has no champions with innate true damage.  Died to a Yi and Vayne the other day as a Nautilus, took 89% of my max hp in true damage, dying in 3.7 seconds.  Sure they both had a rageblade, but I was doing well that game and had a full defensive build.

Like before a malphite ground slam or a cho'gath rupture landing would chunk a meaningful amount of their hp and they'd have to respect that damage. It became a race between the tank's higher hp bar but lower dps and the opponent's lower hp bar but better dps. Either side could win if they played it to their advantage and depending on point in the game. Now it's more often that the dps heavy champ doesn't give a crap about the chunk damage they might be up against from their tankier opponent. If it can't 1-shot them... they basically dps through it regardless of point in game or how well their opponent played and come out ahead. That's not healthy for the game.

But their damage was upped to... waveclear better and to be able to fight back against bruisers and fighters (within reason). I'd argue some are a bit too strong in the latter category compared to how they should be in lane. And as for the former... this can easily be fixed. Take tanks' main waveclear ability(s) and cut the damage said ability(s) do to champs. Like you do 80 damage to champs with a spell but 120 damage to minions. This gives them the waveclear they need while not making it like the meta (quite awhile back now) where maokai could delete an adc while building full tank. Pretty simple fix. And it allows tanks to waveclear and minimize tower dive potential onto themselves by bruisers and fighters in lane. But also rewards fighters and bruisers who can force them to fight away from tower because the tank won't be able to trade back as much damage as they do now. Because w/o items... tanks were doing comparable dmg to that of bruisers or fighters... which had to be the case because they needed that base dmg on their spells in order to farm properly since... no bonus dmg to minions on their abilities. Thus changing that let's them farm better w/o being stupidly strong w/o items to fight against AND removing much of why we needed conqueror in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iTaLenTZ","date":"2018-06-11T00:14:11.786+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scuffproof,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2lv5wuLt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-11T00:04:28.742+0000)\n>\n> I agree with everything except buffing Tanks.

There can be a lot of other factors that determine why they don't win games that last more than 40m. When you get shit on for 35 minutes and only the last 5 minutes you outscaled the opponent it might very well be too late to still win that game. Team morale might be very low and, people giving up and it can already be the case that you are 1 or 2 inhibs behind and the opponent is just waiting for Baron or Elder to spawn to finish the game.

Imagine if crit items cost 10K each, crit ADCs would still be the absolute best once they got their items, but getting there would be such a burden that it is not worth it. This is the problem that they are at right now, they do not have a chance to get to their items before they get overrun.\n\nIt is not a great design philosophy to leave a whole subsection of marksmen in the gutter for a long period of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kantan","date":"2018-06-11T20:20:36.103+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"late game in 2k18 LUL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-06-11T21:56:21.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Honestly I don't miss adcs\n\nlike half of the toxicity on a team would come from an adc who was slightly behind or something, blaming his support, blaming jg, blaming mid\n\npinging question marks if you didn't get a kill on someone\n\nseriously I don't miss adcs, I'd rather just have another lane for literally any other class","replies":[{"poster":"lil koda","date":"2018-06-11T22:52:19.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"so, you had toxic adcs, and riot only nerfed crit adc's, and people are still playing adc, so there for the change took away all adc's from you? you still have adcs like wtf are you on about","replies":[]}]}]}
