Lets change the only tree that benefits tanks to suit it more for adc's","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":126,"down_votes":36,"body":"_&quot;Resolve&rsquo;s multiplicative scaling for tanks is simply too high across the board. We&rsquo;re reducing the effectiveness of the class at the mastery level while adding flat-health options for squishies who actually want some defense, even if they&rsquo;re not stacking it.&quot;_\n\n**Veteran&#039;s Scars **\n\nHEALTH BONUS:  +4% total health &rArr; +45 health \n\nWhat a joke! Reolve Tree is meant for tanks, not squishies. They already have 2 trees that suit them better than tanks. 45 HP is the equivalent of 4% bonus HP at 1125 HP. Lategame with 4000 HP you lose 160-45=115 HP, including the nerf to Deadman&#039;s Plate you lose an extra 100 HP. \n\n**Unyielding **\n\nBONUS ARMOR AND MAGIC RESIST:  6% &rArr; 5% \n\nThey also lose 1% bonus armor+mr\n\n**Bond of Stone** \n\nDAMAGE REDUCTION WHILE ALONE:  2% &rArr; 3% \n\nDAMAGE REDUCTION WITH AN ALLY:  8% &rArr; 6% \n\nALLY BLOCK TURNS OFF AT:  15% health &rArr; 5% health \n\nAnd lose 2% damage reduction in teamfights or when getting help from the jungler in lane.\n\n\n**TL;DR: **I can live with the change to Bond of Stone because 8% damage reduction was too strong but I can&#039;t live with the multiple nerfs tanks received this patch. Losing at least 215 HP, 1% bonus armor/mr and 2% damage reduction is too much for a class that was already getting screwed over bij adc&#039;s. At least you could have the 2 masteries coexist.
