Champions with Kalista-levels of mobility should not exist in the first place.\nA good mobility move is one with inherent risk - the champion has reasons to use it other than escaping, and it has enough cost/cooldown that they are vulnerable when they use it offensively.  Any champion with multiple dashes (or mini-cooldown dashes like Kalista/Yasuo) violate this.\n\nThere's a reason that most of the oft-complained about champions are ones capable of multiple mobility moves in a very short space of time.","replies":[{"poster":"RoodToob","date":"2016-03-30T00:18:44.723+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"Actually, people complain the most about champions that kill them.

His ultimate only resets itself for a few seconds after getting a kill - until he hits level 16.

From levels 1-10, Pyromania has a timer on it once primed, and will fall off if an ability wasn't used in that timespan. At level 11, Annie's passive \"unlocks\" and remains at the ready until her next spellcast.\n\nSure, it's more awkward than Darius's rework and adds a bit to her burden of knowledge, but given how simple Annie currently is I'd say it's a cost she can well-afford to pay.\n\nEdit: Whoa downvotes.

OR... or maybe, we could dial back the mobility... Id say creep, but it seem like mobility \"many zero cooldown dashes\" as opposed to creep that new champs get released with. Almost as if it was an arms race to beat each others champs in overpoweredness/mobility.\n\nThe notion that you guys sit around and look at a champion design and say \"Sure is mobile, but it's ok ANNIE IS IN THE GAME so it will all work out\" frightens me.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2016-03-30T13:51:12.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">Annie is basically an assassin, she rolls up, burst her target down, walks off... skips, she skips off.

As a result we believe it's worth accepting the limited counterplay you have once Annie's in range of you, or when she has Flash up, frustrating though that can be.\n\nI just want to say that I do like the Annie flash capability.  There are plenty of champions that do well with flash burst combos.  The only disconnect I have with Annie is the fire shield being weaker and working on Tibbers.  I suppose it was intended to add extra play, but it really doesn't do much for her play style and no one goes out of their way to save a Tibbers.\n\nAnyways, I agree, the game needs champions like Annie.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2016-03-30T05:01:27.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tTpXAMBe,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-03-29T20:58:56.861+0000)\n>\n> We don't think anyone likes Annie flash ulting onto them and bursting them down.

It's 1k+ units plus flash range for her combo. That is by no means short range.","replies":[]}]}]}
