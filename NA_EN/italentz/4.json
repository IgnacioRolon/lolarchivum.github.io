Coming from a Nocturne Main\n\nComing from someone who has played Nocturne since I started early season 2. They don't need to \"make\" him an assassin. He *is* an assassin. And I'm shocked you find him unhealthy.\n\nI've always seen Nocturne as an assassin/melee carry. If he builds tanky at all it's because he has to, not because he's optimized for being or intended to be tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"afk soon btw","date":"2016-09-26T04:43:27.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has decent Burst but outside of his Q and R his Kit has more about a sustain Fighter than an Assassin. \n\nI also go full AD on him and I oneshot ADC with him but thats like saying Graves is an Assassin or AP Malphite is an Assassin because they can also oneshot. \n\nLook at out AD Assassin: \n\nTalon is \" supposed \" to go in with (R) - E - AA - W - Q (R) - R away. \n\nZed is \" supposed \" to go in with R - do zed stuff - R away. \n\nRengar is \" supposed \" to go in get Armor from his W and get out with his heal of his W.\n\n\n\nNow look on Wukong \n\nHe goes in with W-E-AA-Hydra-R, slips through the Frontline, deals massive Damage and hopes they die. \n\nIrelia goes in does Irelia Stuff, Slips through the Frontline, deals massive Damage \n\nXin Zhao goes in, Ults everyone away except his challenged Target, deals massive Damage. \n\n\nSo what is Nocturne ? \n\nAn Assassin or a Diver ?

If they wanna make him an Assassin, they need to change his W and E\n\nI think only his E is unsuited to being an assassin. His passive could also use a rework regardless of whether he is a fighter or assassin, though I do hope he doesn't lose his sustain.\n\nHis W allows him to dive pst the frontline. I honestly just wish it became a little more like fiora's riposte in that it blocks all the damage and cc during its duration. It would have been cool if it could allow him to steal damage from the spell that hits him for his next auto. But otherwise, I think it is ok for him to have it as an assassin, because it is a defensive yet offensive steroid.\n\nIn the old days assassins didn't have escapes. Zed's ult left his shadow behind the target. I don't understand how talon uses his ult an extra time according to you though. If he goes in with R, and uses his abilities, he can't reactivate it, it's on cooldown, in short, talon has only one more he can use to escape, which he usually has to use to engage. \n\nAkali goes in, and can't get out more often than not. Diana acts as an assassin more often than not, and can't get out once she goes in. More often than not, the original true assassins were similar to Nocturne, with nocturne being just a tad bit more auto based.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DJ Lucio","date":"2016-09-26T13:02:57.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's depressing, just started to learn her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kewlipo","date":"2016-09-26T03:27:27.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-09-26T05:29:39.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Irelia only needs 1 item {{item:3078}} and can build full tank after that and she will still destroy your carries in 1 point and click stun duration after using a minionwave to dash to your poor carry.\n\nSo what you're telling me is that an ADC who builds 0 durability items dies to a bruiser who builds a damage item. Shocking.\n\nThis is the case for many bruisers, Renekton for example builds a Black Cleaver or a Hydra and can absolutely destroy a carry, why wouldn't he, he built a damage item and the ADC has done nothing to help them survive against that damage item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orcmaniac","date":"2016-09-26T16:05:33.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I juat ban her every game i can","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-09-26T15:52:18.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iTaLenTZ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9kkBuAfi,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-26T03:24:06.563+0000)\n>\n> I built 0 defensive items so I should be invincible\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"55976771DEL2","date":"2016-09-26T15:43:07.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you haven't noticed mostly Irelia doesn't go more damage items after Trinity.

Irelia's late game, in comparison to other dive fighter's, is nothing special. She's a midgame champ. Always has been. If your team is shitty enough to not do anything and let her just walk all over your carries, it's not irelia that's the problem. You might as well bitch about wukong, vi, jarvan, and diana, because they all have a better late game than irelia. Just raw dps, she might be better than most in her class, but she offers little utility.\n\nWukong is pretty sleeper op though. Whine about him if you want an upvote or two.","replies":[]}]}
