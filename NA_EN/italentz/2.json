That's what a fucking juggernaut is. Hard to kill, immobile, and deals a lot of sustained damage. If you want to say the idea of Juggernauts in general is unhealthy, then fine, you win, because I don't really know what to say to that.\n\nPoppy? Unhealthy? The only reason people complained is because people were using her ult in ways that weren't intended, and there was an easy fix to that. They could have made it so that she could ONLY deal damage to the person they targeted, so that way, you would ACTUALLY have to go for that person. That way, she would be a diver who did exactly what a diver is supposed to do. Single out a target and kill them. Actually, that's also what assassins are supposed to do, except even quicker than fighters. Unlike assassins, however, divers tend to get out alive even less, unless they played really well or were ahead. So, unless you want to say that divers are unhealthy in general, no, Poppy didn't deserve to be turned into a mentally retarded support for her ADC.\n\nUm, how was he an AP Rammus if you weren't supposed to be stacking MR on him in the first place? That makes no sense. Also, I'm sorry, but isn't the role of a tank to like, get in and soak damage? That's what his W did amazingly well, as well as his ult.

Other people are not required to share it.\n\nLol. Yorick's playrate? Yorick's kit health? Do you know how fucking oppressive Yorick is in the laning phase now, and how useless he is outside of it? They tied his ghoul strength to last hitting minions, and since you don't get the opportunity to hit minions outside of lane, and don't get the opportunity to kill minions in teamfights, he's VERY weak in them.\n\nPoppy had problems, I'll admit. Some pretty big problems. She'd slam into you and brutalize you, and it felt pretty unfair, I guess, but she still slams into you now and it feels unfair. What's even worse is that you can't even fucking dash away anymore, and if you don't have a dash, then her W is 100% useless. Do you know how fucking binary that is? They could have easily fixed her ultimate without having to completely change every ability except for one.\n\nGalio's kit was fine. There was pretty much nothing wrong with it. He had the same level of counterplay he does now, maybe even more. To be honest, I don't have much of a problem with this- Not as much as with Poppy and especially Yorick. They removed a perfectly fine champion and replaced him with a perfectly fine champion. I'd probably play the new Galio a lot regularly if he didn't take up the slot of old Galio.\n\nSion... Yeah. His playrate was almost nonexistant. I only saw him like, three times out of 1000 games. He had the option of going either AD or AP, and both were perfectly viable, but that's because two of his abilities were incredibly strong with AP, and two of his abilities were incredibly strong with AD, which was... Really strange. It's clear he was meant to be played AD, though, because he wielded a big fucking axe, and his lore made a lot more sense with his AD playstyle. What they did to him made no sense, though. Instead of reinforcing his intended playstle, they just scrapped everything about him completely. No AD, no AP, just some dumb CC Tank. It's funny, how his name used to be \"The Undead Champion\", and he functioned much more as a Juggernaut, but when they changed his name to \"The Undead JUGGERNAUT\", he became less of a Juggernaut.

Including the delay on his Q, it gave him far more reward for working harder while also making his kit less binary. Also, people have in fact been begging for the full reset in the late game because it felt odd otherwise.

Blood Rush makes it obvious when he's strong and he's rather weak without it. His E can now be body blocked, by minions no less, reducing the free poke he gets on you just cuz he's AOE'ing the minion wave or something like that.\n\nThe reason he dominates in LCS is because of the damage amp on his ultimate, something coordinated teams can abuse a thousand times more than the average yolo q of 5 while also being a safe laner. The damage amp was in fact stronger before the rework, and the safety issue was handled by making Spirit Visage less effective for making Vlad a 1 item wonder.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=iTaLenTZ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TgrOoprM,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-12T22:24:37.143+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:13}} Maybe the 10th rework will hit the mark\n\nHes pretty alright now.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=iTaLenTZ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TgrOoprM,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-12T22:24:37.143+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:90}} Received 2 minireworks after the rework nobody ever asked for.
