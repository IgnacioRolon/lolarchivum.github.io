This is literally the difference between winning and losing games due to not being able of contesting Baron, drakes, or generally being useless in forced teamfights. To put matters worse the only core item on Amumu that gives CDR is {{item:3001}}. This is the reason why Amumu is trash. Instead of that stupid &#039;buff&#039; to his E that accomplished nothing reduce his ult cooldown.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-09-16T00:19:01.567+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Fiddle's ult is barely anything like Amumu's ult?\n\nAmumu's ult is a burst of damage and CC.

That means having cooldowns up. \n\nFor example, Annie's flash-tibbers combo is one of the most reliable engages in the game. When pro games were very slow paced in prior seasons, Annie was a strong pick (especially as support). However with faster pace games, Annie is no longer reliable because her flash isn't off cooldown enough to have the combo up when it's needed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
