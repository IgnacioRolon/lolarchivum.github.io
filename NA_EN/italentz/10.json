The average game is decided within 10 minutes because towers are nothing but piles of gold for the enemy. Towers have become a burden rather than safeplaces for you to farm earlygame. Earlygame towers used to give you safety but now they are dead weight waiting to get farmed. Also so many champs kits have ways to avoid towers nowaydays that it has become pathetic to watch. The more the game progress the more towers get even worse if that was possible though.\r\n\r\nTowers have become so fucking meaningless that there is just no point in trying to turtle anymore to come back from a bad start. To make it even worse you now have Rift Herald 2 shotting your tower ones your jungler or toplaner gets behind. The snowball effect is so fucking damn huge that you can now even surrender at 15 because there is no fucking point in trying to play the game any more. Towerdives at lv 3-4 are very common. At level 11 every tank/healer/shieldspammer can tank 30 shots easily.  Nexus tower gets rekt by 1 superminion wave.........let that sink in. Even a soraka with a long sword can now succesfully splitpush the game to victory. \r\n\r\nThe game has been prived from all strategy and has just become a clownfest of who gets the early lead and turns it into a stomp. Games are so stupidly one-sided that even winning doesn&#039;t feel satisfying any more. And don&#039;t even dare to pick a champ who needs to scale. You just lost all your towers in champ select mate. \r\n\r\nSo yes Meddler and Ghostcrawler keep telling yourself the game is in a great state and towers are fun and useful. I, for one am more than done eating your shit for the past 2 years. \r\n\r\nMake towers great again to allow strategic diversity and competetive gameplay rather than stomps. I don&#039;t want to surrender at 15 because the game doesn&#039;t give me any options of making a comeback.","replies":[{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2017-06-08T23:27:38.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't think being rude to them is the solution I can't agree more on turret state. I can't even think how can it be in high elo where teams actually know to prioritize objectives instead of fapping in the jungle once they have a lead.. And it's already frustrating in low elo. A tower dive should be an execution requiring mechanics, especially early. Atm almost every jungler can dive you  and survive/kill you even fucking up majorly (like being cced under tower) ..  If you loose first tower/drake /herald you lost the game unless enemies fuck up a lot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strad","date":"2017-06-08T23:10:56.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh look another diamond EUW crybaby who thinks they know better than the entire riot balance team!\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ya≈õuo Main","date":"2017-06-08T23:00:13.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler is fine.
