Maybe, but how about scaling everyone else down first before hitting the Ashe of Mages?\n\n2 most OP diffrence between these champions u said and Ahri is these champions needs to be in meele range to deal damage but ahri has a long long range PLUS  these champions doesnt have any CC except fizz ult which is not even comparable to Ahri's CC because it has 5 second delay on it. PLUS zed and Talon makes a team full AD which is a huge disadvantage for their team . not to mention that the winrate pickrate between these champions and ahri is .... .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salvor Hardın","date":"2019-03-26T16:22:59.894+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"But she doesnt have sustai..... oh wait.\nBut she is weak against tanks..... oh the true damage xD","replies":[{"poster":"jng dif victim","date":"2019-03-26T16:27:36.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Salvor Hardın,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cgIL2Q77,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-26T16:22:59.894+0000)\n>\n> But she doesnt have sustai..... oh wait.\n> But she is weak against tanks..... oh the true damage xD\n\nyea forgot about those . thanks for mention that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WorksAtAGayBar","date":"2019-03-26T16:56:34.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She fits on every team since she has a little bit of everything. Plus a champion with 3 dashes, decent waveclear and a good cc ability will always be useful. Her damage isn't crazy and that nerf to the CD of her ultimate they did a while back actually is pretty detrimental.

She did 1800 damage to me in my last game when i was renekton in 2 seconds with only 2 items same level as me and i had almost 3 items (yea i know i should stack MR) but definitly she doesnt have \"WEAK BURST\"\nand that 4 champions u mentioned. Talon makes his team full AD and he doesnt scale good he is useless late game.\nzed ? Same as talon.\nKassadin ? kassadin needs to be in meele range to deal damage while ahri's charm and her shits have 999 range.\nKata? Same as kassadin and plus kata and kass dont have any kinda CC. not to mention that the winrate and pickrate diffrence between these champions u said and AHRI is not even comparable","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Netorare","date":"2019-03-26T17:30:47.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"People become shittier and shittier at dodging skill shots witch each day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kumiho Ahri","date":"2019-03-26T18:12:09.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Normal assassins reach the power spike much earlier\nNormal mages have way more CC and utility in general\nhttps://imgur.com/Jn7NVd1.jpg[/img]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2019-03-26T16:37:38.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"tbf this has been the case for years, and people do periodically complain about ahri.  her stats stay roughly what you have here 54%+ wr and 8%+ pick rate.  i don't think riot thinks she's too strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tailypo","date":"2019-03-26T16:30:32.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can expect her to dodge nerfs until sometime early next year when her $100 chroma is no longer available.","replies":[]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-03-26T16:49:17.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So in laning the ult will be 130 seconds and in team fights it is used as a engage ability and it is also used as a engage ability in lane too sometimes, so you know just keep acting that somehow it means ahri has survival ability. Its like saying sion ult is a great survival ability yeah it can be used like one but 90% of the time it will not be used as one. \n\nCan you actually give a reason for ahri being boken that's not just reading description without understanding how the ability will actually be used.\n\nAlso love that you don't understand statistics and just look at winrate and say reeeeeweeee. I want you too look at mid lane pick rates in diamond and if you do you will notice that ahri has a really low ban rate whereas the rest of the top ones has around 20% whereas ahri has around a 3% meaning no she is not statistically strong and also shows people in diamond don't think she is strong either.","replies":[]}]}
