Mischievous and young (don't you perverts even think about it). And at least Ahri&#039;s lines will match the splash art as well. When you listen to her voice lines and then look at the actual splash art, it doesn&#039;t match that well. If you think we should have this as the new Ahri splash, vote this thread up!\n\nAs for the creator of the splash, it is Knockwurst.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the support on this.

And since seduction is \"the process of deliberately enticing a person, to lead astray, as from duty, rectitude, or the like; **to corrupt, to persuade or induce to engage in sexual behavior**\" it kinda does fit. And then there's this line \"One traditional view portrays the femme fatale (or, you know, seductress in a movie term) as a **sexual vampire**; her **charms leech the virility** and independence of lovers, leaving them shells of themselves.\" Ahri eats the life force of her victims...sounds similar to me. And, my final quote of the night \"In modern representations, a succubus may or may not appear in dreams and is **often depicted as a highly attractive seductress or enchantress**. So you know, strike three, you're out. Ahri is, for all intents and purposes, a succubus.

I'm fairly sure that her right tit doesn't need to be -physically- and -visibly- flattened by the top she's wearing for her to be seductive. I'm also fairly certain that the design of her skirt need not be altered in the splash compared to the model just to show some butt.
