I can't imagine them doing Snowdown and Blood Moon at the same time. I'm really bummed. They have had the splash arts showing for a week now and they haven't made them available.  I'd rather they just keep the  splash arts down until they physically release the skin/champ/ They've done the same thing with the last 3 Champion Releases","replies":[]},{"poster":"JBMagic","date":"2014-12-16T08:43:43.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to know too!!
