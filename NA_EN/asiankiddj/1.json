I'd also add that I have a 3 year old daughter (whom is awesome btw) and she can interrupt me at any time. I still don't leave or afk and make sure she's down for a nap or someone else can watch her if I queue up.  It's your responsibility to make sure you've got time to play.\n\nRIOT can't justify any excuse because any excuse you may have is irrelevant to the 9 other people whose game you just ruined.  Things happen. And that one game that your ISP blows up (happened to me, Verizon took down a major backbone cable mid game and it affected thousands of players) isn't enough to warrant a leaverbuster. But when you consistently and, in this case,  willfully leave or afk a game it needs to be made certain that you understand it's not acceptable and RIOT takes steps to shield the community from what you're doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"korbcron","date":"2018-01-20T02:51:19.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it should reset every season though","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dovahkiin416","date":"2016-11-07T20:22:19.445+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They only reset when you play enough games, and don't go afk in them.
