Do you know what resolution you have the game set to?  Are you on a 4K?  Try resetting your Config folder to default, which should return your resolution to normal settings:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"asiankiddj","date":"2017-02-09T17:26:38.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It fixed the issue, thanks! <3 +1","replies":[{"poster":"noobiexD","date":"2017-07-18T15:12:24.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happened to me and when i saw ur post and replies i fixed it,thank you a lot,its happening from 3-4 weeks. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"asiankiddj","date":"2017-02-09T15:53:39.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: THIS HAPPENS ON DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS TOO!","replies":[]}]}
