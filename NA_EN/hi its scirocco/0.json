( In most cases)\n\n> Thornmail arguably does more damage per game than the 75 AP does.\n\nOnly if you stack armor and that is still only against certain class and for certain class+ there is problem that mages are whole group of classes that have use for zhonya. So this \n> Thornmail is universal, whereas Zhonya's is almost mage exclusive.\n\nIs bullsh;t... And its about mages being OP because of that item rather than that item itself, so if there was zhonya with AD then it might not be as good as actual zhonya, not to think that there is GA that is even less that that, but we already talked about that where you just denied potential use of zhonya while admiting that ppl still use it to avoid dangerous spells that can many times save more than 50% of your health bar which is amount GA gives ( hooks, full combo from burst all kinds of burst champions and etc.) and you havent answered me yet on why you are still silver on smurf account when you are D2. It should be really easy for you to get higher...
