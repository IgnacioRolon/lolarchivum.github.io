If you admit that it's not that simple once again don't put dumb formulas. Hell the instant any sort of formula is used it's the instant people will \"game the system\" so that they can int freely.

This system should only help to evaluate fake or real reports from other players, not automatically report players by it's own.\n\n\n\nYes there is always the possibility that some troll or player with bad/flaming attitude may possibly report the bad/rookie player\nhere the reporter will be check consequently (did he flamed? chat value)\n(reported and reporter should always be valued, you really never know who is in the right, as you know sometimes the reporter is the actual problem)\n\n\nAs you said and I said too, players will always find a way to come around the system, it's just natural as the cycle of a new door lock or antivirus and  burglar or hacker finding a new way to get in. Same here\n\nAnyway talking it openly it's actual not really appropriate for such a thing, but if this discussion can some how find approximately the right path Rito will hopefully take this in hand, lock the or delete the discussion and peace out.\n\n\n\nFor Bad/Rookie players, \nheartly, the best way to get out from that cycle is to be open to tips and comments from other players (Do not close your self in the shell of \"No No No No, it's your fault not mine, I'll keep doing what I know it's working[but it's not]\") If you've done something wrong and some one tell point your fault just do not repeat it, no one will report you in that case if you learn the lesson. \nEvaluate Objectively the result of the match and Do Not Follow All The Guide Of Streamers! But try to evaluate them from real guides to Simple Entertainment. \n\nPlay Pve (clear kda with no dead and at least several kills and assists)\nand then try to learn the basic tactics in PvP\nAnd Always Be Open to Comments! \nwhen you start to close your ears and eyes, you know where you are...\n\nTake care","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-03-28T04:34:35.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be really nice if it was actually that simple to detect feeders..\n\nIt cant tell if someone is maliciously feeding, stoned out of their mind, or just bad.
