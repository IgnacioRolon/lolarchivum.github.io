That helps to create a toxic enviroment where players who dont perform well in games blame their team mates and those who call them out get punished instead. LOL is a competetive team geam where players should be urged to improve and not defended for being bad. Even if the comments from my better teammates werent nice, I always accepted them. I deserved to be flamed and it helped me improve in the game. They have reasons to be frustrated and that reason was me. Its sad that those people who are helping acutally get punished. Riot should try to create an enviroment where that doesnt happen, although i know its hard to tell if that person is realy just better or just being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-08-13T18:56:01.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a big, noticeable difference between helping and flaming.
