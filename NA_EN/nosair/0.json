No one really cares anyway since people use smurfs all the time (heck this is a burner for the boards) and the icons are kinda so generic/pretentious no one really uses them. Heck I wish they gave an icons like poros or something to denote rank instead of these weird shape stuff. \n\n\nAlso I prefer challenges in game and being better than someone over some fancy boarder anyway and I think most people only care about your actual skill and anyone that calls you out because you don't have a cosmetic item really shouldn't be listened to anyway. Then again i smurf to help my friends climb since they kinda suck and need coaching to get to even gold with me as their duo. I wish riot hadn't made solo and duo a thing  again now i can't boost them all at once anymore and have to try using other smurfs or use my plat accounts which make it difficult since the mmr system adjusts for it. But o well at least i can get them all that flex stuff together, then the duo stuff.....I hate smurfing just to help friends that bug me to death....but at least i don't get on their accounts like some people do to get those boarders.\n\n\nAlso don't get boosted/buy accounts plz people that stuff pisses me off when you get in a plat or higher game and then someone sucks so bad you want to hit them with a brick and they don't know how to even play passive when they are counter picked. Like i know you are trying to be cool, but you being in a high elo game pisses everyone off when they can tell you are boosted. ","replies":[]}]}]}
