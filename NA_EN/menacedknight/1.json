So im asking if there is any way to get rid of the leaver buster quickly","replies":[{"poster":"MenacedKnight","date":"2017-04-10T17:40:42.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so the true story is that these are not the only instances that this has happened as i have had connection issues in the past at lan parties while borrowing my friend's laptop ( he hates windows so he uses linux and wine to run league. in my opinion its asking for issues) so i disconnected before but these are examples that happened once i had my own pc. before i had to use my moms computer running windows vista (again asking for issues) and have had a couple of instances on there. so I have had issues in the past which lead up to where I am now. thanks @mokuto bunshi for the advice but, planning is one of those things that i am not good at (adhd)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-04-10T13:51:54.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"be sure to check whether you'll have plenty of time to stay throughout the entire game or not.\" This right here means so much. Playing video games seems to require expert scheduling. Me and my friends have a general rule. Play any game you want anytime,,,, EXCEPT league. Only play that 1 hour before and AFTER an scheduled happening. Personally, I am trying to learn how to play the system correctly. For example: Yesterday I was playing as GP. Fist thing I did was tell my team \"THIS IS MY FIRST TIME\" ~~well guess what, as I was playing top against renekton and got the first blood bot the team was happy at my awareness and... I digress~~. Guess what, I was called miod game to go somewhere IRL. As I did that my net disconnected... magically and I left and came back. This morning I check... no bans. Probably because In any free time I can find I spam play  games as to thin out that (\"keep in mind that you won't get hit with a low priority queue after only one or two left matches.\") Requirement. \nOh yeah, because my net shut off magically the team didn't blame me for leaving. In fact after going 1/0/0 with first blood and D/Cing They went on to win and I even got honored...\n\nTL;DR Play by riots rules and you will win even if you loose. They do this to make the game better for OTHER players not as much out of concern for you because to them the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Use that mentality and you will win the day.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n{{champion:41}} \n\n]\\'[","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T03:24:55.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is pretty unfortunate that so much real life stuff kept happening that pulled you out of games.
