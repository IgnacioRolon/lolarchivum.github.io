That is why I don't play TFT (but that's for another time). Riot thinks that playing urf against the same champions every game is stale and boring so they introduced random champions. Unfortunately every time I see ARURF there seems to be a specific champion pool decreasing diversity. Every game is still the same matchup but now it's a boring matchup defined by riot. in URF I'd see one champion strong for a day then overnight a different character is found to be even stronger. Now in ARURF it's a stale same champions are strong. I used to see almost every character be tried in URF (even losing to a 50/3 adc ivern) now its just... shaco turns invisible runs around the map and murders everyone. I'd really like to see the diversity brought back through URF, where every champion is built every possible way to see what is strong and what is not.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhody","date":"2020-01-19T23:01:35.482+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly if Im gonna be brutalized by broken champs Id rather it be when I play a champ I actually wanna play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2020-01-20T02:13:04.487+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"URF has never been fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2020-01-20T02:31:01.008+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KVbqbFsC8e,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U9PULLrL,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-01-20T02:13:04.487+0000)\n>\n> URF has never been fun.\n\nNail on the head right here.

It was fun for the first couple days before people started spamming Sona and Ez and shit. I would love to just sit there and have fun but Urf is basically Summoners Rift right now: You die in 0.2 seconds. Back when the game was actually about strategy, the thought of spamming abilities and watching people melt was fun. Now its not fun, its boring, because this is basically how the base game feels now. So I can't help but be irritated that I can't do anything without insta-dying to something way more OP than everything else. The random-ness of it solved the lack of diversity but now i can't even pick a champion i want to try.
