Its the same thing with the OK hand sign. It wasn't until people on 4-chan started talking about how they wanted to \"troll\" the media by trying to turn it into a nazi thing that it became controversial. I don't remember which synagogue shooting it was, but the shooter was making an OK hand signal in his mug shot. Its not a \"troll\" anymore when white nationalist terrorists start doing it non-ironically.\n\nThe reason these \"panics\" start is because when the media brings attention to these things, and makes them mainstream, malicious actors cannot use these things to dog whistle to each other anymore. It makes it harder for them to organize, and it makes them unable to do public events out of fear of backlash. This reduces their recruitment capacity, thereby reducing the amount of extremists. \n\ndon't fall for the reactionary appropriation of free speech propaganda my dude","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2019-12-05T00:59:09.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Problem is when the complete opposite happens and it becomes something publicly derided because of the contextual &amp; fringe uses of whatever imagery is on \"trial\" by the media.

They don't have any responsibility to report on whats important.\n\nI mean, free speech is good for expressing unpopular opinions, but what white nationalists are doing is engaging in historical revisionism and dog whistling to dishonestly get their points into public discourse. They actively target people with mental issues to indoctrinate them into conspiracy theories. Its dishonesty, and it needs to be addressed publicly so that people understand what is going on and don't end up falling for this stuff. A lot of their talking points need a deeper historical context to debunk than what you get in highschool. They are actively lieing, and IDK if that should constitute free speech. Ideologies professing to revoke the rights and freedoms of different groups probably shouldn't even get an opportunity to spread their message or beliefs. If they ever become popular, then groups will lose their right to exist, or share their own free speach. Its the classic paradox of tolerating intolerance. If intolerance is tolerated, then when those groups gain political power they will revoke rights from the tolerant.\n\nNo like, the shooter had a manefesto that listed many white nationalist talking points, like how \"his people\" were being replaced by immigration. bruh ur joke wasn't even comparable.","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2019-12-05T03:24:38.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hate doing this to people, but what if the nationalists only care for their own agenda in the same way the media does, then?

Thats their motive, its their ONLY motive. That is why they do a bad job, they don't care about accurately informing the public, they are there to make money. One of the ways they do this is by clinging to a political party because sponsorships, lobbyists the media and politicians are pretty much a pipeline to each other.\n\nWhats different between the media and nationalists is that nationalists genuinely want to make life worse for other people on a policy basis. It will cause actual harm if their beliefs gain traction and a say in actual political policy.\n\nDriving them into their little nationalist groups doesn't increase their recruitment in any way. What does bring people into their ranks is seeing people like Richard spencer on CNN or college campuses. And if \"your personal beliefs\" involve deporting mass amounts of minorities from the country, or rewriting the holocaust to support your political beliefs, then they are a threat to the concept of democracy and need to either have their freedom of speech stifled by any means necessary. \n\nI have no clue what argument you are trying to make actually. Is this some giga-enlightened centrist argument? Like, no. Ideology is a set of policies and values that you want society to hold. Its one of the most important components to a democracy, and people who do not like democracy, and are invested in conspiracies want to dismantle it. By ensuring that people who want to destroy it cannot recruit more people, it can be more easily preserved. \n\nI really don't know what you are trying to say about the people in the white house trying to get us to argue? Are you trivializing politics or something? I get if political issues don't affect you in any shape or form but healthcare for my family has been the top of the priority list for years now, and there is a lot of other issues that directly affect my family. Voting is the only way that people can make their life better in a lot of ways, so if you are trying to handwave political discourse as a concept then, IDK what to say really. Congrats on stuff not affecting you?\n\nIf you are saying that the parties need to cooperate  with eachother then thats a hard no from me. I do not want any conservative to get a SINGLE word in healthcare policy because they are diametrically opposed to solutions that would most benefit me and my family. Its like that for a lot of issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2019-12-05T08:46:19.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'm saying is that you're complaining to people who can't do anything about it, and you in doing so are doing exactly what the people responsible for it want: you're allowing them to distract you from the issue, even with the issue itself.

You seem to think that one line of thought can maintain the motives and goals of every human without understanding that many people's goals run completely contradictory to other peoples goals. \n\nHealthcare for instance, one party wants to make it universal, one wants to privatize it. Do you think that there is a \"humanist\" answer here? I mean there is, its completely universal healthcare. They are completely polarized choices. There is no overlap here. In fact, there is no meaningful discussion either. One is just objectively worse than the other, but because of money and lobbyists one of them gets to exist in the political sphere despite no other developed country taking it seriously. \n\nDude, there is absolutely no issue where compromise with an enemy party has been beneficial to a broader populace. Its a lie that \"civil\" people tell themselves because they mistakenly believe that cooperation is value that can be extrapolated to people who have completely different interests for similar topics. \n\nIDK what you mean politically minded people only focus on the politics of issues and not the issues themselves, they aren't mutually exclusive and solutions to problems are part of the political process. You can't get important and helpful policy through without debate and a fair political process. Lobbyists, money, propaganda from for profit news sources and lieing politicians make it difficult to do this, but you aren't advocating for an alternative. \n\nAlso, Biased doesn't mean I'm wrong. Reading studies and understanding more about solutions to problems that other countries have implemented, and forming opinions based off of them makes me both biased and right in a lot of cases. being biased and being objective aren't necessarily mutually exclusive either. I've been on both sides of the political isle, and after realizing I fell for propaganda campaigns proposed by billionaires I realized that the solutions you propose to support are being stifled by people who benefit from keeping status quo. \n\nI don't know what you are trying to propose here. All I'm seeing is a lot of flowery language around the word \"people\" with no clear direction, proposition or solution. I mean, republicans and democrats have entirely different values. One wants healthcare to be universal and cheap while the other wants it to be privatized so they can make shareholders more money. There would be no support for republicans if they didn't have for profit propaganda arms funded by billionaires. Whats the humanist solution to this? how do you propose to get a humanist solution through? Do you think that we should compromise between the two parties again? It didn't work last time with the ACA considering we are back to paying $1000 a month for insurance again for 3 people. Compromise always gives shitty results to people.\n\nI don't know why you are talking about human nature when there is nothing natural about how we live today. We aren't hunter gatherer societies, we dont walk around naked in small groups. We live in developed societies based off of agriculture with complex government structures that allow us to organize areas with millions of people in them.  Humanist isn't even mutually exclusive from anything I have been talking about. If you value solutions that help people rather than maximize profits then you are probably somewhere within the Social Democrat-Democratic Socialist range, which is probably the only ideology that value human life more than money or obscure and frivolous concepts like traditional values. If you want to push ideas (policy) that will help people then you need to start swaying people from conservatism as a whole, which is essentially, the definition of politics. \n\nim probably not gonna respond to any more replies.","replies":[{"poster":"Inari Fox Orrion","date":"2019-12-05T17:58:52.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're still missing the many cases of, say, republicans whom favor universal healthcare or even just cheap healthcare in general, but w/e.

If you cant afford insurance and you end up in a US hospital you are gonna be 150,000 in debt in a lot of cases. Insurance premiums end up being $1,000 a month for my family, and deductibles are in the $2000-$10,000 bounds. If you think that further allowing for profit insurance companies to control healthcare (like republicans are trying to do by gutting federal funding for heathcare and removing the mandate to cover people with preexisting conditions) in order to increase a CEO's bottom line has any moral equivalence to a Universal healthcare system like Medicare for all then you are actually delusional and should refrain from democratic participation. Sure, you can find maybe 1 or 2 republicans (like mccain) who voted to keep ACA in tact but the overwhelming majority of republicans vote against government healthcare. Republicans are in the pockets of insurance companies, there is absolutely no fucking way any human being can think that privatization of a market where consumers are held hostage is a good thing. The US is the ONLY developed country where you have to pay this much for insurance. There is absolutely no comparison between US healthcare costs and other countries healthcare costs. \n\nIts either you don't have any understanding of policy difference between different countries or you are being intentionally dense. The fact that you are calling me a science denier, when you unironically think that there is no difference between a party that is trying to stop climate change, and a party that does everything its its power to deny and obfuscate the conversation to protect their oil donors is a fucking joke. I know its hard for an enlightened centrist to understand, but there are many examples and studies that show that certain political policies will result in certain outcomes, and that there are parties that tend to take these into account when making policies. For example, Democrats want to do something about climate change, Republicans are funded by oil barons and will run down the clock as much as possible in order to secure as much profits for their donors at the expense of cremating the earth with us along with it. Politics isn't as frivolous as you try to make it out to be\n \nEinstein and Elon huh? Elon hasn't done jack shit but its pretty telling that you go straight to the bootstrap argument without understanding that there are millions of people who never got a fair shot at life simply because they were born into a country with inadequate welfare systems. Think about all the people who were born that were prevented from being einstieins  because their schools couldn't get clean water, extensive college prep classes or proper technology like computers. People born rich don't have to worry about that, they get to go to the private schools and get into harvard cuz their parents have the money. Trust me, it isn't through giga-centrism \"both sides are basically the same\" bs that the world will get better.\n\nIf you think republicans are so worried about healthcare implementation, then how come every developed country in the world has implemented some form of universal healthcare? Seems like there is a lot of different examples to use. Dishonest argument on your part. It really shows that people like you exist only to preserve the satus quo. Now if ur parents are millionaires that would make sense, you wouldn't want to alter a system that benefits you now would you? Or maybe you bought into some other kind of propoganda aimed at keeping you skeptical of politics as a whole in order to keep you from being engaged and advocating for actual positive change. It happens, I was there once before I started learning about different countries. \n\nUr a giga-centrist. It seems ur kind of confused about my political leaning though. I believe in social democracy, I think that capitalist society can continue as long as there are extensive re distributive policies aimed at making sure there is a level playing field regardless of income level. You want to know why western politics is more divisive? Its because we allow citizens to participate in government. You don't see this is Russia or china because their citizens are completely disenfranchised from their governments. Those aren't great places to live btw. \n\nWhen you get older, maybe meet some more people, perhaps even have your life affected by a certain policy one day, you will understand how important participating in the political process is. Maybe read the hill every once in a while, listen to a political podcast, you will start to understand just how diametrically opposed the two parties are. Everything is political. Everything is subject to some sort of regulation or top down decision making. Understanding this, and realizing that you live in a country where you can vote, and affect some of it is a really cool thing, and you should take some time to do some more research on it. goodbye","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-12-03T20:16:21.282+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":4,"body":"Huh.

In part because, as a mod has pointed out already, there was at least one case in the past where the logs were not displayed correctly. Mostly, however, because I believe that there's little point to this forum if one immediately assumes that people are lying when they present evidence.\n\nBut the argument that it would be inane to edit logs like that… I mean, at it's core that's a sensible argument. I truly do not understand why anybody would put so much effort into something that is so obviously pointless.\n\nAnd yet there were cases where people have done exactly that. I've seen cases of much more effort going into lies that very obviously could not deceive Riot. Absurd amounts of effort, that to this day still baffle me when thinking about it. Sometimes even bizarre amounts of effort that couldn't even fool regular players if they were looking thoroughly enough.\nRegardless of their reasons - assuming  they have any - \"why would anybody do something so pointless?\" stopped being a convincing argument for me quite a long time ago.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Milky Stars","date":"2019-12-04T13:06:22.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in just to upvote this because that toilet brush part made me laugh a lot, thank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IloveIsa7","date":"2019-12-03T20:08:51.307+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait..
