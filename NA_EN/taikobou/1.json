Remember how we can't have normal flex during the whole week? but Odyssey gets 12 different queues. xD (we already have 5 queues for intro,cadet,crew,cap,onsl)\nThe easiest way is to make missions require 5-man premade. You go in the normal queue if someone is good you invite them for next until you have a 5man.
