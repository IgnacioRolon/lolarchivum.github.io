This lands me in the lowest spot when the guy who went out three or so seconds after me gets the next one up.\n\nIt seems like because we went out in the same round, we should earn the same prize, regardless of whether he stacked his braum with a warmog's and thornmail to turtle, or I stacked my kindred with offensive items.\n\nI guess to sum up, it's as if a defensive approach is rewarded while an offensive approach is punished, even though we both still lost.\n\nNot sure if this is the community sentiment, but I'd like to hear back.","replies":[{"poster":"BlksDstroyCities","date":"2020-01-14T19:03:12.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game has more problems than things right at this point.

Only if players X and Y would both end at the same score, say -13, would the tie breaker be who died last.  As it is, it's just weird.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2020-01-14T08:49:54.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed the same for what it's worth and it made the gamemode pretty boring to me. It feels like it takes a lot longer to finish out a full game now compared to last season of it and I just can't be bothered.
