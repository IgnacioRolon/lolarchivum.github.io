Here is the post content that I have put on the boards feedback thread multiple times and tried today to put on help & support because of the above reasoning:\n\nI am trying to read threads that interest me, but I can't find any posts in the red tracker that I want to read because it is flooded with help and support.\n\n1) I realize that this is probably not the board to put this in, but let's face it, Riot doesn't read the Boards Feedback board anymore.\n2) I do really appreciate all of the help that Riot provides to people on the Help & Support board, but it FLOODS the red tracker so nothing else can be seen.\n\nIs there any way to add a feature to the red tracker to sort by a board section? I prefer reading red posts over anything to see their responses to everything and the red tracker is (was) a wonderful tool for that. I just can't read it anymore and it sucks.\n\nFigured I would post in here since you guys respond to everything posted in the Help & Support board","replies":[]}]}]}
