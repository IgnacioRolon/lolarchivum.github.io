I've heard sometimes changing to other region fixes it but it doesn't work for me and \"repair\" client doesn't work for me anymore, but it used to work before.\r\nRe-installing helps but i have to let it update for hour or two which makes no sense...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T18:44:36.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your patch to the updated client may not have gone to well.  In this case, a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)may be needed to return things to order.  You can select to update again to the testing version from there.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"EternalProphet","date":"2016-12-09T21:24:57.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats another problem. I have to reinstall game after every patch and waiting few hours for client to update is not so simple.\nIm not sure whats the issue but i already reinstalled LoL twice because this happened one month back and now i have to do it again. I wish there was easier solution.\n\nEdit: Could changing to client beta help anything?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T21:32:32.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having to reinstall every patch definitely sounds like something's wrong.
