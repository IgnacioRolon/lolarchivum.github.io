More questions about the BE + IP changes.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot, I'm on my 5th account, and my first account was created in 2013 and had one game that year. another game in 2014 and then i started playing properly in august/july of 2015 when the bilgewater event happened. Due to some mixups and stuff i'm now on my 5th account, so i was wondering;\r\nWill i get one of the veteran icons mentioned in a post?\r\nCould i get a BE refund for all runes and stuff over all of my accounts? Even just the first one if i got the BE from that after the refund i'd be overjoyed. Ive spent probably around 3k hours+ on this game over the years and i'd love to feel some reward or something back for all my time and money ive put into the game, y'know? Please don't just go off of how old this account is, please go off of the oldest account linked to the email.\r\n\r\nAlso, for some reason the boards think that this account is under level 7 or something when it's been level 30 for a good few months now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T16:24:43.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The conversion are specific to each account, so it wouldn't be possible to transfer them all into your fifth account.  I'm not sure which veteran icon you're referring to, but Honor icons that are being rolled out this month are also exclusive to each individual account.  Let me know if that clears things up!  \n\nYour account may also need to sync up when you're posting on the boards, but it looks to be showing as 30 now!","replies":[{"poster":"super duper  top","date":"2017-09-02T16:25:57.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was talk somewhere about icons for people who've played a long time, but i dont remember where","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-09-02T17:09:20.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor icons.
