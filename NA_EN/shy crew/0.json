I had 0 RP and 0 IP, when I click play, It said an error. I went to the lol status it said you need to own at least 16 champions in order to play. With no amount of currency, i tried to buy a champion: Ahri. It worked, however I still can't play, because I have 13 champions. I refunded Ahri, now I can't buy anything that will get me 16 champions. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T05:27:51.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes there's a delay in adding the PBE stipend to your account automatically.
