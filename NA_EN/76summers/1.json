On a team Lee has one job usually, insec laners....  If he does not due that what good is he?  He steals dragons and gets out alive, has very high mobility, but he is not that powerful in the late game.  How many normal games have you played with a bad lee sin.  He is very hard to master and get good at so that's why his win rate is so low, people say hes bad or op but actually its just the skill level of whoever is playing him.  I think that could go for any champion in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-12-14T01:15:59.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Junglerboy16, that is not why at all. Lee Sin is hated because he has been tier 1 for 4 seasons in a row. He dictates what junglers are Viable.\n\nIf a champ cannot compete with Lee Sin, you dont pick them. Thats how it has been for 4 seasons. \n\nIs he still king? Probably, but perhaps it is too early to tell. I honestly think his q needs to cost more energy or travel slower. Even a longer cooldown would work. Lee's only weakness is missing q, and even if he does, the window to take advantage is stupidly low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-12-13T16:29:30.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, there is a lot of anti Lee sin mentality on the boards, because people are like lemmings: one person says Lee is still OP, then another, and soon everyone is saying it all over again.","replies":[]}]}
