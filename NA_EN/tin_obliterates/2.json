Not to mention that 975 skins are supposed to have something more to set them apart from lower tier skins anyway according to your own guidelines, and also try to remember that one statement you made that 975 skins during reworks will only get new particles or recolors if the skin looks off without them (Like Exiled Morgana, I think it was). \n\nAnd I'm pretty sure with Lord now having an awkward mix of purple and green spells (and let's not also forget the **purple** gems on his armor and mace) with the recent changes, he fits that criteria as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-07T14:28:19.525+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"When would half-assing VFX be acceptable at any point in league's life, until now?

Between this, and the whole Kayle/Morgana thing, what happened to riot games?\n\nIt's so messed up. First they talk about not giving 975 skins particles anymore to not cause any confusion with skin prices and what each tier offers, then they release shit like Conqueror Alistar that has a new recall and new particles (some other examples include Birdio and Blood Moon Evelynn).\n\nThen you look at their skin guidelines and unless you're completely blind in both eyes you'll clearly see that the page states this for 975 skins: \"Superior (975 RP) Pushes the champion a step beyond a simple costume change, with more immersive qualities.\" (listing skins like Chemtech Tryndamere and Foxfire Ahri both of which are examples with new particles).\n\nThen during the whole issue with Exiled Morgana issue they stated that they'll give 975 skins VFX if the default ones don't fit them (which they did for that skin), so they'd be going against that now if they just left Lord Mordekaiser unfinished like he is now. (And I'm almost certain that if this one guy that worked on this stuff was given more time and permission he would've done it himself, so why shouldn't a full team of people be able to do it?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2019-06-08T09:20:10.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tencent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fawful","date":"2019-06-08T02:10:26.026+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cmon Reav3, this is pretty ridiculous.

Reworks are tricky because if you have 520 rp skins getting particles then people may expect them on newly released low price skins.","replies":[]}]}
