The issue described in this thread and a few others created around the time this thread was created was an issue where even if you reinstalled or restarted your computer it would not start up. This only happened on Windows 7 and only happened for some Windows 7 users not all.\n\nI am not sure what is the current status on the bug where attempting to start League while its shutting down fails. We are aware of it though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot BlueMonday","date":"2020-02-21T01:15:21.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Same here EUW Windows 10\n\nWould you be able to reach out to player support? We identified an issue with Windows 7 which I believe was just fixed 2 hours ago. I don't believe we are aware of an issue with these symptoms on Windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Kpt JUDr Danko","date":"2020-02-24T13:56:49.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To sumarize issue with client not starting, if you attempt to start the client within about a minute after closing it, the task manager will show its process for a second and then the client terminates itself, if you keep opening it, it keeps terminating itself, you need to let it rest for about a minute to be able to open it again.
