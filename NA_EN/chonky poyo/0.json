She's going to be on PBE for an extended period of time in order for her to get the proper amount of quality testing! She's very very complicated.  @u@\r\n\r\nThis is from a board about questions frequently asked about DJ Sona. Honestly, I'm a little dissapointed that it won't be in patch 5.3. I was really looking forward to it, but anyways, what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"NeonVolt","date":"2015-02-05T18:07:09.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I still can't understand...why they're posting all of this information if they aren't ready to release her.

I understand it's complicated...you seem very upbeat. I'm obviously not trying to insult the quality of the skin, but rather the marketing. I love this skin so much...I want it so very badly...but there's nothing I can do...I was so excited to see it on the client...expecting it to come soon...I earned and saved around 30 dollars specifically for this skin. Sona is one of my favorite Champions...I feel very tormented right now.  Why not release it unfinished? I will gladly give you my money. I am in financial trouble currently...and I hate to admit this but League makes me happy. Playing with friends, people...etc. I may not even be able to afford DJ Sona when she is released...Maybe I won't even have internet. To me, prepurchasing DJ Sona would be worth it.

It sucks that they get you happy and going and then say, \"You may have to wait a lot longer than 2 weeks.\" which is the usual PBE wait time.","replies":[{"poster":"NeonVolt","date":"2015-02-05T23:37:55.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's like holding a cheesecake in front of a bunch of hungry people. \nThen saying I'll give it to you next year. \nBy then no one will remember or want to eat it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-02-05T19:48:12.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew she wasn't coming in the next patch, was pretty obvious.  They do that often with bigger projects like this.  She's pretty much like a champion rework at this point and needs lots of testing before she goes live. They've already worked out the main problems they found in their private testing, so now the PBE testing is here to find anything else so that she's all good for the big release.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chonky poyo","date":"2015-02-05T11:43:25.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hyped myself up way too much and now its just like RITO WHY, WHY","replies":[{"poster":"Mellori","date":"2015-02-05T17:22:11.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did that too.

Now I'm considering spending what I bought and re-buying when she's actually out, but if she comes out sooner than April, I don't wanna have spent it and not had the money when she's out, in the case she's on sale for only a day or so. :/\n\nSucks, really.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EvilScotsman1974","date":"2015-02-05T14:29:57.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its crazy that people are trying to think she would be out soon, valentines and lunar revel are within the next 2 weeks 14 feb and new years in the Chinese calendar is on the 19th, so we have jinx and the warring kingdoms nid and kat coming, to top it off sweetheart annie and heartseeker varus are due with the annie skin already penciled in for 5.3.\n\nLets look even further, there are 4 other skins, the Inquisitor (warden) and marauder skins that have been on the pbe for a couple of weeks now that will probably be released before dj sona.  The sona skin has JUST been released for testing on the pbe and most skins get at least a month on the pbe for testing before going live, then think that dj sona is an ultimate skin so there will probably have to be a lot of testing and texture rebalancing and little things here and there worked out.\n\nTBH i am not expecting to see her till mid March or early April and am not getting my hopes up that she will be released before then, now if she comes out before then i will be happy as i am looking forward to it.\n\nI guess people just want the new content but would then get upset if they released her and loads of bugs were found and she had to be disabled for a time to fix it, then what an uproar you would have.\n\nAll good things to those who wait guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Circuit Bear","date":"2015-02-05T19:47:03.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its more of a situation where hype only lasts so long, like with Heroes of the Storm.
