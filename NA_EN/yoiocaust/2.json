Riot Lyte did serious damage to the ranked ladder with the introduction of DynamicQ and even more so with the removal of SoloQ. Riot admitted this and promised to bring it back.\n\nWill they keep that promise?\n\nWith how disastrous seasons 6 turned into, I am pretty sure they will.\n\nConsider this.\n\nTryndamere, president of Riot games made a blog post about the situation with DynamicQ and he mentioned that if things didn't improve with the system then he would personally step in and force the devs to bring SoloQ\n\nI am pretty sure that's exactly what happened, because a month or two after he said that an announcement was made that SoloQ was indeed coming back for season 7.\n\nTL:DR: Pretty sure that are under strict order from the big man himself to bring back SoloQ, so they probably will.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-13T14:20:40.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The promise was to make solo queue solo alongside DQ.
