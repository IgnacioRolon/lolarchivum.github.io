She can be gentle and sit back, but then become aggressive and disrupt the whole enemy team. Her moves are just really cool. I mean, with her Q, doesn't anyone else have flashbacks to Naruto and the first big battle they were up against? Her heal is surprisingly strong with ap, and damaging as well, plus just the way it works is really interesting. Then with her E...well there's nothing cooler then hitting an E on your adc that gives the last bit of damage/slow to really catch a person out. So in short....
