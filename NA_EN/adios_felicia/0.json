During this time, our primary focus is to come with up a good thematic for a champion, and then discuss the kinds of things they would need to make the fantasy come to life. For example, giving Forsaken Jayce voice processing made since since the skin is dark, and his normal tone is pretty light-hearted. In other instances, if a weapon doesn't change - Arclight Vayne - sounds aren't as big of a discussion point, but particles are because her base is much darker in terms of particles, and arlight is known for its golden/white color scheme. \n\nIn the particular case of Irelia, we felt that since she was particle light, she would be a good candidate for simply a model and texture swap, which has her fall in to the 750 RP skin. We also felt that a recall wasn't necessary for this thematic. Although, any 750 could always be argued to be a legendary in some format, but it's always a discussion of 'what does it need, and then we can talk about nice to haves if scope permits.'\n\nOnce we finish a skin, that's when the pricing occurs. E-commerce, as well as people on the skins team discuss how we feel about each skin, explain what each skin has in it, and we reach a consensus for what the skin should be priced as.","replies":[]}]}
