Vision wins games, and riot made those trinkets cheap. To play to live, dont tower dive and die when we are winning, that is not worth, trading kills is helping them more than us. Get scuttle crab 2 min before dragon spawns, this greatly helps dragon control. Dont just counter pick champions, counter building is even more important. \n\nAnother thing to note: I am not in school, but i do work 35-40 hours a week. I may not be on every day (I do play a lot though), but if we set practice times i should be able to take off and make it on for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maltie","date":"2015-05-24T16:58:25.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Maltie\nRank: P2\nMain Champs: Bard, Thresh, Morgana\nAge: 17\nExperience in Role: Ive been switching roles for a while but I mained support for a while\nExperience in League overall : Um, Ive played every role?
