But, as I leave the base and enter the lane or jungle, my fps slowly drops to 70, and then 60, and when the minions or jungle monsters spawn it gets as low as 40 to 30. Anytime several champions use their abilities near me my FPS can get into the tens. I ran through all of the  troubleshooter and it fixed nothing. My FPS is the same and behaves the same at all settings.","replies":[{"poster":"JJswim","date":"2017-01-21T21:42:17.451+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same exact issue","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-01-23T06:23:38.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Let us know if your case is different.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/dEU1EdIT-fps-problems-in-71?comment=0005)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":" IllllllIIIIIII","date":"2017-01-21T15:42:32.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a GTX1080 and i normaly get around 300fps ingame.
