(so ignore the technical features unless you really think those features change or otherwise impact the communities sense of identity).  If you don't think there is a difference, do you think a difference will develop?  If you do see a difference, where do you see that difference going?  Toward 'old GD', farther apart from 'old GD', or something else entirely?\r\n\r\nWhat can you say about the community that was 'old GD'?  What was 'old GD' at its best?  At its worst?\r\n\r\nWhat are the most important aspects of the LoL General Discussion forum that would, could, or have previously caused you to embrace the place as a community?  What makes 'GD', 'GD', so to speak, in order from most important to slightly less important?\r\n\r\nNo tldr, if you don't care about the questions then you aren't the target audience.
