However, I get 60 ping on LAN and 50 on NA. What could cause this?\n\n\nI have looked at my routing and it seems that I stay inside Florida the whole time. I have tried using Haste to see if that fixed the issue. I have even changed my DNS settings and flushed my old ones as demonstrated by Riot's own troubleshooting video. None of these things worked. The ping is stable and clearly playable, but it bugs me I don't know why it is so high.\n\nI would love to be able to experience this game on lower ping and just wonder why I would get higher ping on a server that is literally right next door relatively.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:43:25.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely that little bump is just coincidence or due to slightly different routing between the servers. 10ms difference isn't too big so it shouldn't be too bothersome, and it could also be stemming from the Verizon issues we're seeing all along the east coast.\n\nIf you want to see exactly what's going on, you could run traceroutes to the NA and LAN server to see the differences. Use a program like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run these traces, and feel free to post the results here and I'll go over them with you!\n\nNA:   104.160.131.1\nLAN: 66.151.33.248","replies":[{"poster":"Harmonic Waves","date":"2018-01-22T04:18:08.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thanks for the reply,\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -
