I build {{item:3110}} {{item:3082}}  to lower her attack speed and build up some armor... and wowee!\n\nStill died in about 6 auto attacks with my ulti going.. took 1/4 my total dmg as true dmg over the course of the game.\n\nHonest question here; what am I supposed to do as a tank to mitigate the amount of true damage in this game right now? It feels straight up awful that nothing I do can stop someone using conqueror or having some native true damage built into their kits who gets a slight lead.\n\nIt&#039;s true what they say there is truly too much true damage in this game, and the true solution is less true damage.\n\nEDIT: I had {{item:3047}} {{item:3401}} built as well.. and I am looking for what items i could have built to be more tanky tanky\n\nEDIT 2: I didn't realize her passive dealt %hp true dmg as well.. so even if I build HP it wont lower her true damage.. looking like my options for counter play are dwindling pretty quickly if i cant build armor, hp, or attack speed debuffs to keep her from gibbing me in 4.5 seconds. \n\nEDIT 3: I don't want this to devolve into a jircle cerk over vayne/yi/trynd/other true dmg champs specifically.. i understand they all have \"counterplay\" (sigh)... I'm talking about the sheer prevalence of true dmg in this game and how as a tank you have literally no way to mitigate that dmg and it feels awful to build full tank and die nearly instantly to a champ with true dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2018-10-23T13:02:05.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Building health would be the most sensible way to counter true damage I think...

Now, with a rageblade build, its closer to 60-75%, but nowhere near 90% as you erroneously claim.\n\nSecond, that is average across all champions in that game, over all game stages.  As she leaves laning phase, gets more attack speed, and ranks up W more, a higher percentage of her damage will be true damage.  Additionally, as the true damage has no flat component, but she gets flat AD steroids, has base damage on items and abilities, and also the fact that squisher targets have less armor, so they mitigate less physical damage while also having less health to begin with means they take a disproportionately high amount of physical damage relative to Vayne's actual damage output. \n\nConsider then, that Vayne will optimally be targeting squishies as much as possible, and tanks as little as possible (out right avoiding them until other targets are dealt with if she can) so the percentage of her damage averaged across the game and across all targets will not be even representative of her average damage between enemy champions on average, as it will be a weighted and heavily skewed distribution towards your bot lane and less so towards the jungler.\n\nThen, additionally consider that tanks have more armor, so a higher physical damage reduction, while also having more health, so Vayne's true damage is already significantly more to tanks from their own HP stat alone, but Vayne's physical damage is also less.  As a result, it is not uncommon to see Vayne doing 40-60% true damage to tanks, 30-50% physical, and roughly 5-10% in magic damage from shiv, runes, etc.\n\nAgainst a tank, her Q tickles, her W procs, however, are massive nukes.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-10-24T04:49:32.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All that propaganda ignores one major blaring thing: Although Attack speed and Guinsoo's procs may increase the rate of her W proccing, there's still the same number of physical attacks in between, and her Q has a friggin 2 second cooldown, and is ENTIRELY why her kit works.... Q is what stealths her. Q is what does near double damage. Q is what repositions her to be able to E and wall knock. \n\nIn other words, attack speed plays a very little role in the Phys damage/True damage ratio, because the rate of fire is always 3 to proc, and Q is spammable.\n\nThe only thing that really changes the ratio of Phys to True...... is Armor, and the amount of HP she is versus.

Darius has way more counterplay than just cc. Aka get inside of q range (easy to do), spell blockers, dashes/kiting, undying abilities (tryn), revives, heals/Shields, movement speed, not to mention his E is high cooldown and somewhat telegraphed. High hp also counters him because he is a great counter for flat true damage and dar has no form of % how damage built in. Grievous wounds also help a ton. Champs like tryn, Jax, yi, and mundo can straight face tank him. Even champs like talon can easily 1v1. I've been oneshot by ev's before at full build with one or two Mr items and lots of hp without anything I could do. Kayn can 1v1 as well by ulting at the right moment and preventing stacks, fiora reks him too, even early game.
