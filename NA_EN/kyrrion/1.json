I appreciate it & I want to ask your consideration on changing the term, \"Grounded.\" I definitely think it should be changed as I feel we can do much better.\n\nMy ideas:\n\nStagger\nParalyze\nHamstring\nDisable\nStall\n\nStagger is my personal favorite though I believe\nDisable or Stall to best convey this particular impairment (impair is a decent one too).\n\nWhich do you like best from my list? Please pick one!\n\nI will add... I also feel the mechanic needs tweaking.\n\nI don't think it should prevent 'magic-based' movement (e.g. blinks/flashes/teleports), only dashes... it's just non-sensical that way (\"let me silence your magic, but only the transportative kind\"). Gameplay-wise, fantasy-realism aside, I think it'd be better too.\n\nI also feel it should stop dashes in their tracks. Or if unwilling, please ensure the duration of the Staggering Effect doesn't begin until the dash has expired (if cast during).\n\nI like how it applies a minor slow, though. I think that's perfect.\n\nWhat do you think, Meddler?!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-29T21:34:51.252+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"We talked through a long list of terms, those included. So far Grounded's the one we're happiest with, in terms of conveying what specifically it applies against (movement, but not basic right click movement).

Hamstring's pretty good, ties really clearly to movement, it's very physical though and carries more thematic expecations and in  this case a widely applicable term's useful.\n\nGrounded stops all movement effects in part so it's not too Feast or Famine. Applying it solely to physical feeling effects both introduces some loss of clarity (are Talon or Ezreal affected or not?) and makes it much less applicable in many games. Ability to lock out Flash in particular by contrast gives a baseline level of contribution (and slightly encourages use of other Summoner Spells on champions they're almost good choices on if facing a Cass or other champion with a similar effect).\n\nAs far as stopping dashes in progress goes so far we're targeting Grounded as a more pre-emptive effect, rather than an interrupt.

Or post knock up stuns. Or they're targeted. Or they're on a low cd with no resource cost. Or they _do_ in fact last 1 second or even _longer_. And some of them are on champs with rather high pick rates.\n\nIn fact I just looked at a large number of random champions with displacements and found that the majority of the displacements with a set duration last 1 second, particularly knock ups. Unfortunately we don't have numbers for the durations for some of the shorter ones like Orianna's R, which I think is due to the duration varying based on location of the spell and the champions hit. However there are also ones with longer duartions that constantly vary like Gragas' R as well.\n\nHere's a list of champions I checked who have displacements that can last 1 or more seconds.

Though the cost and cd of such effects is of course also a factor because that in part decides the frequency at which they occur.\n\nDo non displacing, non purely slowing CCs last even longer on average? I don't feel like checking but I'd say probably yeah. But not stopping dashes and blinks also causes those CCs to be largely or entirely wasted quite often. As a Morgana main I can't even begin to convey how common it is for me to hit someone with her Q but have it not matter at all because they still go over the wall, behind the minions, or at the very least out of my W before being unable to move.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2016-03-30T20:28:59.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question: How does Grounded interact with Kalista's passive?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2016-03-30T00:02:03.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uzpqGYvh,comment-id=001600000001,timestamp=2016-03-29T21:34:51.252+0000)\n>\n> We talked through a long list of terms, those included.
