Tired of people trying to put together teams, but being unresponsive/not dedicated. So, I'm going to just make my own. I do work a full-time job and have a bit of a personal life, so this won't be an all-day-every-day team. I'm currently Gold I this season; have a goal of high Diamond.\n\nTeam Goal: I want a group of 5 people (+1, for sub) to play serious ranked flex with this season, for fun. Also have the ability to jump in some online tournaments, and have easy access to solid duo partners.\n\nDon&#039;t apply if:\n1. You rage super hard easily.\n2.

I have almost a year experience on a competitive ranked team, we competed in a lcs style league and placed decently each season in it. im a pretty passive person so I get along with most people and I understand the difference in 5v5 situations and solo que situations pretty well due to my experience.

Am very obsessed with having the highest CS and pushing my lane opponent out of lane.
