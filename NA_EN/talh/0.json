Does anyone remember League of Legends in season 1-4 where strategy existed? Here&#039;s every game now:\r\n1. Mid or Top will solo kill or get a kill from a gank.\r\n2. Whichever solo laner got the 1st kill will start stomping everything on the map.\r\n3. FF @ 15 or win/lose before 25 mins anyways.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t remember the last time I was in a team fight with baron and/or the game on the line, 45 minutes in. The longest game of my last 10 was 33 minutes long. The longest game I could find going through all my matches on the League website was 36 minutes.\r\n\r\nSuggestions to fix it:\r\n1. Bring tanks back to a level where they can actually survive 1 assassin&#039;s damage. (preferably be able to survive a team&#039;s damage)\r\n1a. To this tank suggestion, make sure their damage is in check so they aren&#039;t tanking AND nuking *cough-cough* initial juggernaut patch\r\n2. Make towers DRASTICALLY tankier, but lessen their damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Common Satyr","date":"2018-11-22T04:37:35.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see just as much strategy as before. game is still about not overstaying and warding around objectives then taking objectives after a catch or team fight.

Recently I tried him botlane - enemy team had 4 tanks; Yi shreds tanks, right? Wrong, you get CCed and bursted in the AOE by base dmgs. Very unreliable champ. Still, we won, but that was because enemy team had Ezrael - which is a dogshit champion that few can actually play and started misplaying lategame.\nIrelia, Jax, Fiora and Camille are somewhat similar to Yi. Fiora is maybe the worst in teamfights; aside from being very good in 1v1s, because of her no counterplay R.\nThe biggest abuser of conqueror is Yasuo that you didn't mention for some reason. He has no cds and spams HARD Q and autos even early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-11-21T20:41:36.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait you just built him wrong.

I played him bot, because that was only avaliable. He doesn't die to tanks in 1 v 1 , not in teamfights, especially when we are 3v5 defending our base, while our top Jax or mid Zed is splitpushing or dead in sidelane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LetMeCarry1983","date":"2018-11-22T02:33:34.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anìmê,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7M4HQ80I,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-11-21T18:51:51.653+0000)\n>\n> I would rather see a nerf to champions that have too much true damage in there kit;\n>  {{champion:114}} \n\n\nOh hell no.

For 1v1s, Jax, Teemo, Vayne, Tryndamere, Yasuo and Yi can beat her. And in general, she is an extremely weak team fighter. Even if she gets super fed in lane, carrying vs a team that always groups is still a coin flip. You are completely reliant on the enemy team making mistakes and not making plays yourself. You can try split pushing to put that dueling power to work but I've found that 90% of the time, your idiot team mates just die and then it's inhibitors falling, dragons dying, Barons getting slain and so on. So you're basically stuck trying to shoehorn her into role she isn't meant for by grouping. Fiora has some serious problems that make her almost unviable in the current state of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talh","date":"2018-11-21T18:54:44.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fine as well, but the problem of champions dying too quickly will remain.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-11-21T18:56:44.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe a tiny bit too quick, but it is that they get abused in lane too hard so then they can never get tanky and that certain champions deal too much true damage with either conqueror or because of their kit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2018-11-21T18:19:10.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"More durability has been added to the game and turrets received a major buff with plating and damage increase.","replies":[]}]}
