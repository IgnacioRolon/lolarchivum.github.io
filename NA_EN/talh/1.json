I actually grew up on League of Legends. I started in Season 1 as a 14 year old and am now 23. This is the reason I am a &quot;Forumer&quot; instead of just a &quot;Quitter.&quot; I love League of Legends and want it to come back to the game I remember. Riot did always say this is a strategy game first.\n\nI am frustrated that this strategy game with mechanics mixed in has now turned into a faster-button-masher competition. There was a time in League of Legends where macro play was just as, if not more important, than micro play. That time has passed. I am forced to play assassin characters and try to snowball harder than whatever assassin/bursty character on the opposing team in the first 10 minutes of the game. If I fail to do this, I lose. Average game time in the rank I play (platinum) is 28 minutes ([https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/game-durations](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/game-durations)). I can&#039;t even give an excuse to my loved ones &quot;Hang on, I&#039;m in a league match.&quot; The league match is over before they even get impatient.\n\nI love outplays and quick big damage like the rest of everyone, but there needs to be a ceiling. No matter how fed a Zed/Talon/Akali/Insert other burst champion here gets, they should not be able to 1 shot a big boi tank like {{champion:31}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:33}} , etc. And on the same point, a champion like {{champion:86}} should not be able to 1 shot {{champion:84}} just because she picked up 3 kills early, is now the villain, and made 1 small misstep.\n\nDamage needs nerfed across the board. I&#039;m not a game developer and also question my own intelligence, so I don&#039;t know how this is done. I do know as a player though that I don&#039;t get home from work and want to sit down to play League of Legends. I don&#039;t spend time daydreaming about team compositions or strategies anymore. When I do think about League, it&#039;s thinking about the recent patch notes and trying to figure out what the next damage exploit I can use. (smite talon mid is back, btw)\n\nI think I speak for maybe not everyone, but a large populous of the LoL community when I say &quot;We do NOT want shorter games and more damage. We WANT Moscow 5 level of strategy back. We WANT that 45 minute baron call where {{champion:85}} and {{champion:32}}  both have ults up and are looking for a big wombo combo to finish the game. We WANT the Support roaming mid at a random time for a spicy 3 man gank for a slight advantage because dragon is spawning in 2 mins.&quot;\n\nFor now, I&#039;ll be a Forumer and Patch Notes reader waiting for the core of the game to come back to strategy.  If this never happen, thank you Riot for many years of a great game. I can&#039;t support this new game.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-11-26T16:45:49.826+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":1,"body":"im in the same boat as you, the battered wife.

Due to what? I mean, I have been paying attention to patch notes pretty regularly, and haven't noticed any \"Champions now do 15% more damage\" change.\n\nChanges that I did notice:\n\n- Both enchanters and tanks with overall less utility and more damage (Thinking about {{champion:40}} {{champion:516}}, as examples).\n\n- Key recent additions and/or reworks: {{champion:555}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:84}}. Two of them are Assasins, so they can easily one-shot and have easy escapes, and the other is... an hyper-mobile bruiser with a ranged multi-stun that also destroys everything and everyone besides the occasional counter-pick, if she's not fed. All of them super hard to peel, with loads of damage, two of which are specially good against shields, two of which can towerdive for breakfast, all of them having access to either defense-stats penetration, hybrid damage or both. So, they further decrease the efectiveness of both tanks and enchanters despite being assasins and divers. And the things that breaks them the most is not damage, but their insane mobility. Other one-shot recent additions: Evelynn, Assasin Kayn, Zoe and the latest, Neeko.\n\n- Runes Reforged: This may be the biggest player in the damage creep problem. Even Resolve has more offensive than defensive options now. Then there's Dark Harvest, Electrocute, Conqueror…\n\n- {{item:3095}} {{item:3147}} > {{item:3031}} {{item:3085}} // {{item:3135}} > {{item:3504}}\n\nTo me, all of this just looks like a burst meta. Anything with good CC or mobilty that has a lot of burst and outplay potential has become incredibly popular from what I can see. And I think the reason for that is recent new champs and reworks getting better at mobility and burst, as well as enchanters and crit adc's being in a really bad spot (due to reasons stated above) and tanks being better at damage and engages than at tanking or protecting.\n\nI may be super wrong tho.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-11-27T02:22:59.945+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"runes reforged lowered champions' overall base defenses, added even more damage to the game, accelerated snowball potential (seriously, did you know you can get 100 gold just for using an auto attack after an ability?)\n\nwhile adding large amounts of additional burst to the game in recent updates.

Soooo much stuff changes in a desperate attempt for them to try and find a new meta that appeases to esports.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-11-26T21:25:53.507+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I’ll be the guy who points out the obvious here - \n\n_What the hell is a Summoner?_\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}\n\n:^)","replies":[{"poster":"Talh","date":"2018-11-26T21:30:14.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's what you are when you play League, they refer to players as Summoners... \"Summoner's Rift\"\n\nYou \"summon\" a champion and then control that champion to destroy the nexus?","replies":[{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-11-26T21:47:30.776+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot retconned the Summoners and the Institute of War a couple years ago.

Damage is insane and resistance is useless. If you want to tank hp-stacking ends up being the only real option, and there's a limit to its usage.\n\nI've noticed the trend of increasing the work-arounds and direct nerfs to defensive play and I'm honestly surprised people call more for damage reductions and not resistance efficacy improvements, since the nerfs to counter-play both large and small-scale are so blatant. \n Things like shield duration/strength are confusingly inconsistent in philosophy between champion classes and positions, newer support actives/bindings dealing pretty significant damage instead of offering outplay potential (both large and small-scale, think banner splitpushing for example). \n\nResistances are either:\n- Overwhelming (you didn't snowball, have fun hitting a brick wall from levels behind while you get smushed by a snowball)\n- Useless (guess who has a handful of resist-ignore items and rendered your entire game worth of gold worthless, half of the enemy team!).\n\nAnyone noticed people building straight hp-damage items can soak up tower shots (like a dedicated tank usually would) when they're fed? I feel bad just watching it tickle me without having actually done anything to counter what is supposed to be a formidable death-tower -- assuming they live long enough to even force me to take more than a couple of hits, damage creep being what it is...\n\nI grew to love Bruiser Riven for the old-season-fights feel of slow sustained damage dealing/receiving (unlike the boring assassin builds). Now the only way going bruiser works is building like a 'juggernaut', which is a stupid concept, damage and survivability should have been fairly linear opposites balance-wise, I know it never was but that's a good indicator that balance has never had a clear direction. The existence of current PD alone is testament to how clueless Riot is rn. Passive outplay potential is more favourable than the once consciously-utilised active of the old Quicksilver Sash? Why are they discouraging agency in a video game? I have no words.\n\nWith the introduction of preseason, starting with a bunch of free early damage makes laning feel super cheesy -- but a massive disadvantage myself if I choose to opt out of my abusive runes, as burst champions absolutely decimate anything with a few poke-stacks of harvest under their belt and snowballing being encouraged by riot in each subsequent patch.\nThat's not fun, it's bull. Why would anyone play ranked?\n\nVery much a child's game now in terms of ease and strategic reliance, but I guess that's fine for their bottom line, so it's fine for us.
