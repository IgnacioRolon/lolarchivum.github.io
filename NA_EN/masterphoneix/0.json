If you are at a 20 minute LPQ already, that means it has happened several times before. If you are having issues with crashes or disconnections you can seek troubleshooting assistance here and through Riot's support knowledgebase or Player Support. Please try to fix those issues before playing more, because as much as you think it's unfair for you to get a penalty, it's more unfair for your team to lose a player.

You'll definitely want to get the crashing resolved before it causes more penalties for you. The most common reason for crashes is because of an unstable connection to the servers. Our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) goes over the most common solutions. However, if you're seeing [bugsplats](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) or graphical issues, it's likely the issue is caused by drivers or corrupt/missing game assets. \n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}]}
