They used to be fatter, respawn more frequently but worth more (2 buffs for lvl 3). \nAnd they heavily nerfed the vision game (used to be able to have 3-5 wards on you, or pre vision changes as many wards as you wanted).

Yes because junglers that would prefer not to gank early and instead want to farm more will suffer more than junglers who want to gank at level 2. Level 2 ganking will be unaffected since scaling nerfs don't really start until level 3. Keep in mind there is no catch-up experience anymore from jungle camps. Now that scaling only occurs once every other level AND that scaling value is down by about half from previous scaling, you are looking at a very significant decrease in jungle experience, much of which will be made up for in lane by succeeding in a gank and killing the target. Power farmers can't make up that loss and will lose to ganking junglers every time.\n\nNo because jungler presence is really high, but I'm not convinced this will solve anything other than further shrink the pool of viable junglers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2019-01-24T04:19:17.832+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know how early game junglers can spam gank with little incentive to farm and manage to be 3 levels above the enemy jungler because they gain lane priority for every free scuttle and the enemy jungler can't do anything about it making the opposing jungler just undealable?\r\n\r\nThat just became worse because now the behind jungler will have a harder time coming back, and the winning jungler has LESS incentive to go farm minimum wage XP when they can just win ganking and shoving lanes sapping XP instead.  \r\n\r\nThe reason early game junglers spam gank isn't because they have the XP to get away with it, its because they don't need the XP as much as other junglers who have to scale into the game, which indirectly, buffs early game and nerfs anything that needs to scale and makes the behind jungler get snowballed even worse.
