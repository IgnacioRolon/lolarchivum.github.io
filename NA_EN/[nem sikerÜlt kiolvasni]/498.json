The only thing I dont understand is why create spear of shojin?  The current essence reaver is an issue on everyone from jax to renekton to fiora and riven.  It's not that it was good on them, it made them oppressive because no matter how gold inefficient the base stats are, that passive might just be the most gold efficient thing I've ever seen in the game that isnt on a multi minute cooldown.  Champs that can get their ult down to under a minute at 40-45%cdr(triforce+spear+cosmic in sight) will almost permanently have it up and hell if you are beating a jax with a billion resist and near perma AA immunity.
