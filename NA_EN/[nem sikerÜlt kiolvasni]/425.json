I'm really looking forward to their AHQ game to see if they make it a good one, but I am kinda worried TSM may get bounced and not make the bracket which would be super sad.\r\n\r\nI think Fnatic did super good coming into the game and realizing where their strengths lie, and I think Huni is just an interesting player in general. I'm kinda sad that Fnatic is bringing back Rekles though because seeing a team come together like they did this season was really cool, and yellowstar putting together a team of less experienced player and them doing so well was really cool. I really wanted to be able to just like Fnatic as a team and organization not just because they win, and have a team to root for from EU. I know from a skill perspective it probably makes sense, but the whole reason I watched EU was because Fnatic and UOL both seemed to just be willing to support their players and focus on team chemistry over bringing in big names and we don't really have that much in NA (except C9, but I've just never been a huge C9 fan). Bringing in Rekles when he was obviously not as committed to the team or his teammates just sits wrong with me and so I'm hoping TSM gets another shot to to take them down.","replies":[{"poster":"Buzanami","date":"2015-05-09T08:56:31.478+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm not a fnatic fan (I actually was hoping Elements would pull through) but I think everyone can agree Rekkles leaving Fnatic then asking to come back when Elements didn't work out is a dick move.

I would say this is a clear sign NA isn't really much if any better then EU. Not to mention Alliance was irrelevant after this. So EU didn't even have their top 2 Teams when NA did.\r\nIEM Katowice - NA did great here, TSM performed out of their minds. But what EU team did you really face? SK got figured out and turned out to be a one-trick pony. You faced the #4 and  #5 eu teams at best\r\n\r\nOverall: I'd say NA did perform better then EU in the last year. But either both EU and NA were irellevant in the tournaments. Or you never faced top tier EU teams.\r\n\r\nWhat it comes down to is this:  Thinking you could win versus China or Korea would be extremely arrogant. To get ouf of groups their two most important matchs to focus on are EU and AHQ. As the wildcard region is pretty much a free win. So if they didn't properly prepare versus EU that's probably the biggest mistake they could have made. And if your coach can't properly prepare you for international events i'd start having serious doubts about how good he really is.
