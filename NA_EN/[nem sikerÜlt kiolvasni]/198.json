We didn't get QA signoff until too late in the patch, and somewhere along the line our product team and our comms team miscommunicated.\r\n\r\nWhile I've delivered a lot of bad news before (nobody likes it when their champion loses 5 AD), I'm really sorry to be the bearer of this bad news.\r\nLike you all, I am excited to see this in game, and I look forward to enjoying it with you when it goes to live. This feature will be on PBE soon, and we intend to ship it with the next patch.\r\n\r\nEDIT: As an apology, I have attached this drawing of Vayne.
