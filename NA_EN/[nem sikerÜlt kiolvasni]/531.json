The same goes to Garen's R.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea behind it is that there are some things you should know because it can lock you out of getting the MINIMUM out of the ability, while others shouldn't be given out freely because it'd consistently give players the MOST out of the ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Vacant Shoes","date":"2019-10-08T21:49:08.197+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"So what about cho?","replies":[{"poster":"sillyscylla","date":"2019-10-08T22:20:39.783+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"He's not supposed to require skill to play, duh.
