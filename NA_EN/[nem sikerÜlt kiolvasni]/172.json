We know it can be difficult to keep up with different regional leagues, so we want to make it a little easier with Must Watch Matches: a packaged rebroadcast of the 3 most exciting games from each week of LPL, LCK, EU LCS, and NA LCS. Must Watch Matches will air twice on Tuesdays for both EU and NA audiences at 6:00 PM CET / 10:00 AM PDT and 6:00 PM PDT / 2:00 AM CET.","replies":[{"poster":"mrackham","date":"2018-03-13T00:35:28.176+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the promotional material for each week, it would be nice to have a spoiler-free blurb about why each game is a must-watch (aka why it was picked/what makes it interesting).","replies":[{"poster":"Bi0major","date":"2018-03-13T10:47:48.317+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good idea. I will say that we went back and forth about whether we are selecting the best game on paper or the best game. In the end we decided to index on best game but I think there is room for spoiler-free blurb as well. Will talk with team for sure. Thanks for the suggestion.","replies":[{"poster":"bobbybigwheels","date":"2018-03-19T20:18:47.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like the best game.

Something like that would be cool to watch, without the hassle of keeping up with each region.

I keep up almost 100% with the NA scene, but I just don't have time to dip my toes very far into the other regions. This will be a good way to ensure that the games I watch from other regions are worth my time as I am not as emotionally invested in them. It will also be good for hyping my international expectations for NA success. Good idea Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alturgist","date":"2018-03-13T03:54:44.308+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not do four matches: one from each region?

Let's see how this performs in the current format but always open to consider doing a fourth game for the reason you pointed out. Also, to the comment below, we are just working with regional leagues that already have english casting offered and our insights show that overwhelmingly you the majority of crossover is NA/EU/LCK/LPL.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortadulo","date":"2018-03-13T11:17:19.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am retired and will admit to watching every game from NA/EU/LCK and even the LPL games that don't overlap with LCK.  Not everyone has the time to do that so this will catch on very quickly imho.  Though the overall meta is similar, each region has its own take on things and you see get to see a lot more variety between regions as well.  This should serve to break down the lack of variety some of my less die-hard friends complain about from time to time.  Not only that, but it will serve as a great way to introduce fans to players that they don't really hear about until just prior to  MSI, Rift Rivals, or Worlds if they only watch their respective region.   I cast my vote for a 4 or even 5 game (for LMS) replay","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Camba4ever","date":"2018-03-13T05:04:46.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"logged in to up vote this, excellent addition, Rito plz  :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Man With Nö Name","date":"2018-03-13T08:19:51.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it would be 5 really, LMS, LCK, LPL, NA and EULCS.","replies":[{"poster":"unfw1","date":"2018-03-13T12:25:12.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMS has no English Broadcast.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Murray Man","date":"2018-03-13T02:47:48.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will it also say what patch each game is on?
