Really. Support needs items makes them relevant. E.g. items which increase the duration of CC-s, allows personal teleport to friendly turrets, whatever.

Easy prey less gold.","replies":[{"poster":"JacobusSimon","date":"2017-05-01T19:27:44.552+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem with adding items with powerful effects like that is the potential for abuse from non-support players. An item that simply increases CC duration, for instance, would be devastating on a lot of mages. That's the point of the quests, gating that power behind something that non-supports generally aren't willing to invest in.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are ways to abuse a reduced gold reward for killing a support, too. Things like playing a lot of flex picks like Lulu top or having a five-man that queues as all-support could cripple your opponents' income for the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"dark100dark100","date":"2017-05-02T10:38:44.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Easy to solve that. E.g. just make a new item: elixir of support. You can only buy it before you leave the fountain at the first time. You also need to consume it soon (e.g. 1-2 min, so you can still sell it if you accidentally bought it). It should have a strong negative effect on standard laners, but allows buying support specific items. The idea of \"killing a lane minion disables support specific passives for a time, and this cooldown could increase forever\" seems good. You can also have other effects such as if you kill somebody, and there is an assist, he receives the killing gold (the kill still credited for you).\n\nJust think about Overwatch. The supports there don't do much damage, but they have game changer abilities. And it works well, and people like playing supports there. In league items destroy roles, since even support champions can do damage with them. Take away the damage and give something in return. Something which allows helping to your teammates without giving you damage.\n\nHowever the proposed changes will never make supports better. You need far more radical changes. If you play tresh or bard you already have a quest, now you will have two. Quests are fun to kill time, but they don't make the role better. If your team is always in trouble, and you have to help them, it actually makes the situation worse. I really don't like when you don't have time to collect chimes because your help is needed all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"shggfhdh","date":"2017-05-02T19:18:03.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the whole overwatch metaphor is good except you overlook one thing, overwatch has 23(?) heroes I believe.

Now if you could switch mid game to a fizz who has an ability to dodge it then you would be fine but you cant... this isn't overwatch after all.

Do you know how hard it is not to take an easy kill just so your ungrateful adc can become fed? \r\n\r\nThe quests are adding something exciting for supports to do while helping their team. Your role as support is not to kill as many people as possible. Your job, is to protect your teammates and set up kill potentials for them. However, you probably won't be doing that every game because you may have a frozen lane. These quests give supports something else to do and give them rewards for helping out their team and making risky plays.","replies":[{"poster":"SleepySorceress","date":"2017-05-02T11:49:22.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If \"securing\" kills is the main concern here, why don't we add a unique passive to support items that lets them benefit from assists? Maybe higher gold reward on assists, or a stacking system (on relic shield for instance) that increases armor/magic resist/health for every assist. It's kind of like a support quest, but focused primarily on getting your ADC kills. I feel like this wouldn't really be abused by non-supports because buying support items would be like accepting they will be getting assists. It's not a flawless idea, but I feel like it would fix some major weaknesses of supports without letting other roles benefit heavily. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"LordXemnas23","date":"2017-05-02T14:17:00.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it would make a little more sense. I would imagine relic shield quest would give you a reward like reduced CD for it's active, or give two shields at once before it goes on CD.  Spellthiefs would give you more slow opportunities. Ancient coin.... the extra level is nice, but it was really known for the amount of gold it gave you for each nearby death. Good for getting expensive support items sooner plus its speed boost active. \n\nI agree that getting those three support items would be useless to other roles as that would distract you from your primary role. Perhaps if they made the main support items like the jungle items, they would be better. Then again, we still haven't tried it yet, so we can't judge the new system if we haven't even experienced it yet.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SNOW SOS","date":"2017-05-01T19:55:39.932+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't get the logic behind switching {{item:3001}} and {{item:3102}}.

What is it with people and them hating the CC and mobility ultimates. Seriously, to League players, if it doesn't blow up enemies, it's useless. As a hardcore Bard main, I love the high risk, high reward ults, Kindred and Ryze are just a few examples of those. However, depending on how you use them, your team would either love you or hate you.  And no, one mishap of an ult does not mean you go yelling at me because you were stupid enough to dive in for a desperate kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Civility","date":"2017-05-02T04:09:24.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I'd just say that I don't find him boring at all.  I like taking the risk of engaging enemies and then trying to escape with a well-timed Q if things go sour, or using that Q to hold someone so I can finish a 1v1 kill.\r\n\r\nI guess the active W and the E can be a little underwhelming, but they are definitely useful, and if they had more impact Malphite would probably be unreasonably powerful.\r\n\r\nI'm sure they could adjust those abilities a bit and make improvements, but for myself, I don't feel a strong need for that.\r\n\r\nAs to Bard's ult: Bard players will probably never see full justice, but there are definitely times when a Bard ult can really ruin a situation.  For example, it's happened to me more than once that I ult several enemies as Morgana, and then Bard ults *me*, allowing those enemies to escape and then possibly turn on me and kill me.  Everybody makes mistakes, but some of those lend to a feeling like the Bard is trolling.
