People play them for a particular feeling or satisfying moment, and this applies to all MOBAs (which is why Battlerite has been picking up in popularity now that it's F2P, cuz it skips straight to those moments)\r\n\r\nFor example, as a non-Heimer main, I would imagine it's the fun of creating a little mini-base of turrets. The most enjoyable part for me when I *do* play Heimer is establishing a little zone of control and waddling around in it.\r\n\r\nI *do* play a fuckload of Teemo though, and it's several things.\r\n- First, shrooms kills have never, and probably will never, fail to make me smile, which I can say is something League doesn't make me do very often at all anymore with the direction Riot has taken it in the last several years.\r\n- Second, it's immensely satisfying being a tiny hamster, popping out of stealth when you're fed, and watching some big tough Darius run for his life because he knows the hamster can blow him the fuck up in a Q->auto.\r\n- Third, Teemo is just plain oppressive, but in a fun way. With the exception of what Aery has done to top lane (sorry about that, melee tops), nobody has really ever called Teemo an \"overpowered\" champion. Frustrating and annoying sure, but not in the way people feel champions like Zed or Yasuo or Riven or Zoe or whatever are annoying and infuriating. Those champions, when they're oppressing and annoying you, *feel* busted. They ruin fun. They just outright are not fun and you want them removed from the game while they're pissing you off. I can't speak for everyone obviously, but I think for a lot of people Teemo is aggravating, but in a way that makes you want to squash his stupid little face with a spiked boot, not in a way that makes you want to smash your keyboard through the screen and quit the game. I like being fun-annoying, not infuriating annoying, and in general when I play him I joke around with the enemy team and we all have a good time. Getting them to say \"god fucking dammit Teemo get the hell out of my jungle\" is another one of the most fun moments for me in League and legitimately is one of the only reasons I ever play the game anymore. It's *fun* being a little bastard, provided you're just being a pain in the ass and not legitimately ruining someone else's fun like most cancer-champs do in this game. No matter how fed Teemo gets, with the right jump on him you can delete him pretty much instantly, so it never quite feels like \"this champion is so overpowered wtf Riot\", and that makes all the difference.\r\n\r\nAs for Ziggs, it's the same thing that makes Junkrat in Overwatch fun: The crazy bombslinger archetype is just, well, fun. Flinging bombs all over the place is fun. For me, Ziggs is most fun when you either A) are in a teamfight and literally just spamming bombs all over the fucking place, or B) land that sweet semi-global ult and nuke their team.\r\nOne of my favorite moments in League, ever, was the time I got cornered in blue-side Red Buff's bush, and dumped my whole load of burst right on top of myself. I died, but I got a quadra off it, and that's a moment that really can't be replicated with the same kind of satisfaction using any other champion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo really, with any champion, it just usually comes down to a distinct moment, or handful of moments, that are only possible with that specific champion, and are fun enough to that person to warrant them playing the champion a lot. Everyone probably has one with any champion they're particularly fond of.\r\n\r\n\r\n....Which is why it's fucking idiotic that Riot INSISTs on reinforcing the viability of only like 35 champions because E$ports requires flashy \"plays\" (read as: \"hey look I'm just fucking playing the kit of the oppressively and idiotically mobile champion the way it's meant to be played in a totally normal way ooooooh so much skill\")\r\n\r\nSorry Heimer mains, guess you should try not being so broken with that insane 51% win rate.

All in all: they reduced Heimer's lane survivability, his turret survivability, ability to heal/repair turrets, and now they make his ult garbage.
