What happened was my email service assigned to the account has shut down, so I decided to make a support ticket to make a new email for my account as I cannot change it normally as the old e-mail is defunct, after my first support ticket they said that I had to log out and do another ticket as a account recovery, I did that and since then I have not been able to access my account. My main account name is StrayInu with Username **[REDACTED]**. I had no issues login in before this, just because I wanted to update my email address I lost my main account, I mean, if it is such a difficulty to fix the email change, please at least change my account back how it was so I can have it back again, that is the account with my friend list, and gifts given to me by my close friends. I may be a bronze with a bronze account, but it is my account with my favorite name that I am deeply attached to. Please fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T03:14:02.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We cannot address account recoveries here on the boards, but if you continue working with our specialists in a support ticket, we should be able to resolve this together.

I recommend a way to access tickets when not able to acess your account, because I could not see the status and unable to ask questions without creating another account. It was a frustrating experience.","replies":[]}]}]}
