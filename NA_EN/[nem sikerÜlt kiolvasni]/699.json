Put him in full ref uniform with a {{item:3140}} over his eyes. You know, like every ref. His first q is a soccer ball, but for the followup dash-q, he would sprint towards the target quickly blowing on his whistle in sharp short bursts (this would transition very well into his e btw). His w would be the same as it is now except it would have an animation where he gives the signal for advantage holding both arms out as he dashes towards his teammate. His first e would be he blows his whistle really loudly and for the second part he raises his arm, and pulls out a yellow card for a slow. And for his ult, he raises his hand for a red card, then before he actually kicks the crap out of the target like normal, he winds up but doesnt actually ever throw the kick because before he does his victims flops backwards, flying through the air overreacting as they throw their hands up covering their face and scream before landing on the ground. Just like real soccer! :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lèè Sìñ","date":"2014-06-18T19:34:54.942+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":10,"body":"HES BLIND","replies":[{"poster":"plumpy99","date":"2014-06-18T19:56:22.287+0000","up_votes":153,"down_votes":5,"body":"ALL THE REFS ARE BLIND!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fat hog","date":"2014-06-18T19:22:51.036+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":2,"body":"Striker Lee Sin would be great.
