How could the elders reject what was so patently true? How could they turn their back on revelations brought from the very summit of the holy mountain? Her fury built at their willful blindness, and blazing orbs of silver fire spun in the air around her. With a scream of rage-fueled frustration, Diana’s sword swept out, and where it struck, silver fire burned with killing light. Again and again, Diana lashed out and when her fury ebbed, she saw the carnage she had unleashed. The elders were dead and Leona lay on her back, her armor smoking as though fresh from the forge.\"\n\nPantheon is the only Aspect who is truly taken over by the Targonians (space parasites). Leona, Diana, and Taric were all given knowledge, power, and purpose, but were left as themselves. As shown in the above quote from the new lore, it was very much Diana - of her own will and her own rage - who decided to murder the Solari elders. \n\nLeona had no hard feelings towards Diana until she murdered Leona's friends and colleagues (and almost Leona herself) in front of her eyes.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2016-06-22T19:09:13.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're missing the very next sentence where Diana is appalled at what she had just done and goes away desiring peace but is still haunted by the half memories of the past.  \n\nYou're also missing this bit from Leona: \n\n\"Leona brought Diana in under armed guard, for her warrior instinct sensed something awry in the girl’s demeanor. Presented to the elders, Diana spoke of the Lunari, an ancient and proscribed faith that venerated the moon, and how all the truths the Solari clung to were incomplete. She described a realm beyond the mountaintop, a place where the sun and moon were not enemies, where new truths could show them fresh ways to look at the world. Leona felt her anger build with every word Diana spoke, and when the elders rejected her words and named her a blasphemer, Leona knew it would be her blade that ended the heretic’s life. \"\n\nThis is before Diana did anything wrong, she's just talking of what she discovered, and Leona is growing furious just at Diana talking.  She's also apparently fantasizing about being an executioner.  So much for the once noble paladin who IronStylus said would be so heartbroken to have to kill this girl.\n\nAnd yes the Aspects are parasites.  They're not gods, yet establish people to worship them as such. They have mystical cosmic power, but use it to enslave their allies.  They've spread across the entire galaxy and yet still possess people to do their dirty work for them.  Leona even says in her color text\n\n\"The being she had joined with atop the mountain longed to burn these men with its cleansing fire\"\n\nThe space parasite is inside her now.  And what's worse it's apparently a pyromaniac sociopath.\n\nReally the entire race of Space Targonians sound like a bunch of jackasses.  The one exception would be The Protector, because unlike The Pantheon and the sun and moon aspects it doesn't seem to do any weird crap messing with Taric's head.  They just seemed to talk for a bit, gave Taric a bit of direction on how to do a job Taric always kind of wanted to do and then buggered off.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mayønaka","date":"2016-06-21T18:09:58.783+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"I hope {{champion:131}}  wins if that does happen.
