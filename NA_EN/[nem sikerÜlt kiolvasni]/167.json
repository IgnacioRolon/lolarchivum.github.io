Since both versions are on the current client, you can set up your summoner name on the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nYou should also report this to the client devs over at the [client discussion ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)boards for feedback.   Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
