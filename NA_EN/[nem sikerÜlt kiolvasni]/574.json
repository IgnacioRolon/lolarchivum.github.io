Please, tell me!\" Replied Ezreal (440 RP), almost begging the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it seems that URF's removal was just too painful for you. Trust me, it was painful for all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just don't get it!\" exclaimed Ezreal, \"this was a perfect mode to try out different strategies, combos, etc... Why not leave it at least in the custom games section?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Kennen as he started removing his gloves, and cleaning up his desk, getting ready for his next patient, \"I guess that would be too much to ask.\"\r\n\r\nEzreal left the doctor's office, upset and annoyed. [Gothic Orianna (260 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KYuB_i5RgI), who was Kennen's receptionist, greeted him with a cold, lifeless voice. Followed by her ball, which flew towards Ezreal at great speed in order to hand him the medical bill. He swiped his card on the ball, and then it flew back to Orianna.\r\n\r\n\"Come again soon,\" her Glados-like voice replied.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped out into the streets, more annoyed than earlier, he heard a woman crying for help.\r\n\r\n\"HELP!\" The woman cried.\r\n\r\nEzreal recognized that voice. It was Ahri (487 RP). Ezreal was a gentleman, so he knew he had to save her.\r\n\r\nHe used his arcane shift to move faster, but then he remembered URF was over. His cooldowns were back to normal, and so were his mana costs.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it...\" he cursed under his breathe, as he tried running towards the damsel in distress.\r\n\r\n\"Ezreal,\" said a voice beside him. [Warring Kingdoms Jarvan IV (675 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6MC_NRmDdE) was running beside him, \"you heard that too?\"\r\n\r\nEzreal nodded.\r\n\r\nSoon, they saw Ahri nearby, running away and screaming.\r\n\r\nSinged (292 RP) chased her with incredible speed, leaving puddles of poison as his trail.\r\n\r\nEzreal used his arcane shift and hit singed, then used his mystic shot. Both hits got the enemy's attention, who then started running at him.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" Ezreal yelled.\r\n\r\nJarvan leapt high up in the air, and then landed, smashing his spear on the ground, lifting a wall of rocks around them.\r\n\r\nBut Singed remained outside the rock.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Asked Ezreal.\r\n\r\n\"I'm helping!\" He said.\r\n\r\n\"Bring it down!\"\r\n\r\nSinged laughed at this, as he tossed a bucket of his mega adhesive at them, and then continued chasing Ahri.\r\n\r\n\"BRING IT DOWN!\" repeated Ezreal, \"just press R again!!!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" replied Jarvan, as the walls around them crumbled into dust.\r\n\r\n\"Screw this,\" said Ezreal, as he walked towards the opposite direction of the fight.\r\n\r\n\"But...\" said Jarvan, \"the damsel in distress! We have to save her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what she gets for charming Singed,\" replied Ezreal without looking back. All he cared about now was going home, where dinner was probably ready by now, served in a bowl of rubies and a cup of emeralds.","replies":[{"poster":"Nolan Vileno","date":"2014-04-14T14:47:16.050+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":62,"body":"Sucks that your story is getting buried under some guy who just copied the spotlight links.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Moriuz","date":"2014-04-14T15:00:42.672+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"Better than getting buried under \"RP GENERATOR!\" spam =P","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2014-04-14T15:04:20.260+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":13,"body":"Seriously what is wrong with that guy?","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2014-04-14T16:40:53.860+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"For the record people: I was talking about the guy who spam the RP Virus link.
