But when I open the log file, I found THIS below, which shows that it's stop responding because a single file is miss, which indicates the files need to download. ONE SINGLE FILE!!!!!\r\n\r\nThen I used \"ping l3cdn.riotgames.com\" to test my network, it seems not my problem. Though there are many pkg missed, a connection stable enough for file transfer can be established.\r\n\r\nNow the file missed is \"filelist.versioninfo\", can I copy form somewhere else?\r\n\r\nI really hope that you Riot guys can provide a dmg or something which include the full content of the game, which can run without patch. Even need to re-download after every patch is OK.
