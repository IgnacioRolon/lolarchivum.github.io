At least for many nights. My wife and I run a therapeutic youth program and every night we bring our kids in for a few games of league. We noticed when some of our kids played each night they were able to learn how to cooperate better. For many of our kids that struggle with reading and math, they put extra effort into learning abilities and how they scale. Many other benefits were showing up and we made it mandatory to play.(they don't complain)\r\n\r\nNow we got to this point after three years of playing. That all started after we adopted our son and were trying to find a way to spend time together. We found league. It started off small, playing a game after work and homework. Bots first (intermediate was so hard) then we got gutsy and played some ARAMS. The wife hated them so we had to balance the two games types. \r\n\r\nOverall League has played a huge role in how my family has grown together. We have a night of gaming and talk about everything. Most kids don't talk with parents like he can. Of course the conversations are league, girls, league, sports, league, food, league, go to bed, one more game....ok. \r\n\r\nSo...League is life.

I ended up playing it hardcore for months on end, met a bunch of new friends with crazy backstories and played with them for quite a while.

And all my friends who once played together addictively kind of just became a band of quiet brothers who seldom played together. Now League leaves me with a very empty feeling when I play, but don't get me wrong I still have a passion for it. It helps me push myself to extremes that are hard to find irl.

We took turns using the computer playing matches and he helped me learn every character and helped me improve. When league came out he introduced me to it and walked me through the tutorial and helped me learn the basics of a match. My first champion was {{champion:18}} Tristana and she remains my favorite to this day. Over the years, I eventually met a man named Adam online who I learned also played League and we played from dawn 'til dusk. He was an amazing shot caller and helped me improve even more, and we joked about our favorite champions and other nonsense to the point where we were talking every second we were sitting at our computers.\r\n\r\nThrough Adam I met a man called Andrew, who has cemented himself as our unrelated sibling of sorts. He was our jungler usually and we always played together. We were both heartbroken when we heard of his deployment to Afghanistan and we sent him care packages and always talked whenever we could get the chance. We'd briefly talk about the patch notes with him, new champ teasers, all that good stuff. He's currently deployed to South Korea for work, but he still calls us all the time to discuss his life, how he's doing and of course, League of Legends. As obnoxious as he is, I never would have met him if not for this game, and he has become an irreplaceable part of my life. \r\n\r\nBack to that guy Adam I mentioned. Eventually he decided I was cool enough to fly 3000 miles to visit and after spending time in person together, we both agreed this was a relationship we wanted to pursue, regardless of the distance. Every night we'd play matches together and chat on skype. 2 years later, this man showed me a ring in a box and asked if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. Our friend we connected with through league, Andrew, attended our wedding. 14 months after that amazing day, I packed my bags and moved 3000 miles to America from Canada and I'm now happily living with the love of my life.\r\n\r\nI hear people say how much they hate this game and it's community, but my experience has been life changing.

As the weekend progressed we got rained out and had to come inside, his brother proposed we play World of Warcraft which was quickly turned down because well we wanted something quick and easy, hit up the good ol google and came across \"League of Legends Clash of Fates.\" Spent an entire day dying over and over as twisted fate top building 6 phantom dancers with no regrets.\r\n\r\nEventually hitting level 30 at the start of season 2 and finally understanding that champion selection and team comps matter I started reading up on the game. I remember very specifically in my senior year of highschool I downloaded this app that had all of the champion abilities as well as the items in the game. I memorized that thing, I knew everything about this game and wanted know more so a bit of searching brought me to surrender at 20 and reign of gaming. \r\n\r\nThis sparked the next chapter of my League of legends life, October 16th 2013  I created an Instagram fan account for League of Legends known as \"Leagueofupdates.\" This account was something like Moobeat was doing at surrenderat20.net, we both used to datamine the PBE as patches were pushed out to get the content out as soon as possible. Being something that hasn't been seen on Instagram yet the account blew up, within a year I had 15,000 followers gaining traction in the game and across other medias. The year after I had 70,000 and being noticed every game turned into a normal thing for me. I had a small taste of being famous in a growing community and it was exciting.\r\n\r\nThat same year I figured this game is becoming a big part of my life so I wanted to get in touch with the devs that made it. Started following whoever I could find anyone from [Steve in Product](https://twitter.com/stevemz) to [Katey](https://twitter.com/KateyAnthony). This led to making alot of cool friends to this date. At this time I was still in school for Bio-med and not liking any bit of it. With all this success on social media I figured I would apply for esports social media position, got through a few stages of interviews only to not get the job to my boy Joe (would link his twitter but not sure if he wants attention). \r\n\r\nThe next year was my graduating year and still didn't want to be in Bio-med, so I started trying to learn a new skill to see maybe if I could make I could do something I loved in the community I am in love with. Allstar's were in LA this year so I figured I would go and enjoy the games considering it was so close. Got a tour from a friend of the Riot office and instantly fell in love, i knew this is where I wanted to be. On the last day of the games I hit up Scarizard challenging him to a little smash bros throw down (which i lost miserably). So he signed me in and we went backstage to the sm4sh for setup they had in F building, only to find Darshan and some of the EU casters sitting playing. Me trying not to lose my cool I sat there and kinda grabbed a remote and played it off. \r\n\r\nHeads up I couldn't keep my cool, I watched the top laner of the my favorite team lose money to one of the nicest guys I've ever met on the Internet and couldn't be more giddy. That same day I met a bunch of other Rioters who I've known for a while but never really sat down and talked with and it was surreal seeing them as faces rather then profile pictures and 140 character tweets. \r\n\r\nWhat I may have forgot to mention, my parents told me I should quit playing video games and grow up a few years before this so they don't know any of this. I flew to LA from Toronto without them knowing to attend these events. \r\n\r\nThe last bit of the school year ended, I moved to Los Angeles to work for Riot as a contract photographer for the LCS and was beyond happy with life. I would keep this going if anyone cared but it is def long. I attended team parties and drank and hung out with the grows I grew up watching, I think the moral of the story is if you have a dream to be somewhere always work hard and always go towards your goal. \r\n\r\nR.I.P Harambe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellfrost","date":"2016-09-01T23:52:57.712+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":10,"body":"well It all started a while back long long time ago when.......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno one cares, give us urf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-09-01T21:22:56.307+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"League helped me open up a lot and appreciate the beauty in this world.

I told her I didn't really find it interesting, but I saw it as an opportunity to have some fun with her and to get to know her better as well as her hobbies. So as with everything I do, I read up for about a week on it learning about the game and it turned out to be so much more complex than I thought. There were so many intricacies and nuances. And I am always one for stimulating gameplay and challenge. I told her I'd play and she was so excited.\r\n\r\nAfter a few games, I was hooked. But of course, I wasn't going to fully admit it.. c; League quickly replaced my gaming need as I was now going to college and didn't have the time to play games that would eat up my life (I'm looking at you Skyrim). So a game a day kept me nice and healthy as that relationship became more and more unhealthy..\r\n\r\nIt was such a strange falling out. We didn't really make the decision to break up. It just ended happening that way. In the end, I never quite understood what got us to the point where we couldn't stand each other. And so there I was, staring into Summoners Rift, trying to fill the emptiness I felt. An emptiness that I honestly still feel today. She was unlike anyone I had ever known and the only things I could bare to keep was a picture, our memories, and this game.\r\n\r\nOf course, this game quickly became all my own rather than a coping mechanism. Through her and this community I've grown as a person and I'm thankful that she passed through my life.

That login screen was so legit. I still remember the chills of being greeted by that orchestral music, and watching those green souls go flying around. God, that was so cool.\r\n\r\nI think {{champion:266}} and {{champion:103}} may have been free that week. I remember practicing with them and slowly, very slowly, getting better. To this day, they are both my favorite champs. (You couldn't force me to pick one over the other!)\r\n\r\nAnd the rest, as they say, is history.","replies":[]}]}
