Burning Tides had the full package: Black Market Brawlers game mode, a new ARAM map, lore progression, character development for several characters, cool Bilgewater themed skins and an awesome present for Gangplank enthusiasts. The Shurima event was mostly a retcon of previous lore with an awesome game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Flames99Fuse","date":"2015-08-26T20:15:57.665+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree, even though my computer was busted for the Burning Tides event so I only got to two like two or three games at a friends house.

However, URF had no actual Lore event surrounding it. But Ascension was the best lore-related game mode to exist within LoL. BmB wasn't even very fun except for the fancy minions and some interesting items.  It had such a unique play style, and I enjoyed the fact that they actually made me WANT to play Crystal Scar. You also get to fight freaking Xerath. I mean hes basically the equivalent of Baron in Ascension and being ascended just feels so great. But I rest my case stating that ascension is better than BmB.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AsianOnboard","date":"2015-08-26T23:38:36.368+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disliked Ascension if only because it marked when Riot started half-assing the lore pages on champions D:","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Sunglow","date":"2015-08-27T13:02:03.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Majority of the Lore is still pretty good. _Riot_'s decided to put the full lore on the **website**, and only part of it on the champions tab in the client.

Over time it became a floating city with mini shops and services floating along beside bilge water. but when the wars where in progress and the world was being ripped apart, massive stalagmites and columns of rock protruded from the oceans disrupting a particularly large gathering of ships around bilge water (they could be planning to take over noxus or piltover treasury or something) and in there attempts to flee, the escaping ships sealed there fate, getting stuck on top of the ever rising pillars, when the mist had settled, few where left, but miraculously nearly every ship was nestled atop a perch of granite, and the S.S bilge water had finally dropped its anchor for the first time.
