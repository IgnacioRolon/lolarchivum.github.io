The English-language Facebook page for League has nearly 15 times as many followers. Say what you will about its effectiveness for real discussion, but it's true. Also, there are bigger non-English speaking League communities. This is nowhere near the biggest League community on the web. \n**Second, and more to your point: For now, the boards are the \"official Riot community\" but they're not as big as Reddit. And they also kinda suck. I personally think they're not very useful except for giving developers an official, riot-owned platform for posting thoughts or interacting with players.** So IDK. I could imagine a world where we kill the boards and start pointing English-speaking players to this subreddit, but it'd be a pretty disruptive change. And this place is run by you guys, not us, so we're a little hesitant to post our own content (beyond AMAs) here for fear of drowning out what y'all are talking about.\nIt's true that Reddit threads sometimes give me stage 3 bronze v cancer, but it's the same way with the boards. **I think probably our current setup is fine, although I'd like to maybe kill the boards** and give the devs a place to post whatever they want on something like the Nexus.\n\nMy bad, looks like he did specify why he didn't like the Boards, I just have a bad memory.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-05-23T02:35:20.072+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't help us at all... he's right there are shitposts everywhere, something we'd all like to solve but killing the Boards will only redirect all the shitposts to Reddit.
