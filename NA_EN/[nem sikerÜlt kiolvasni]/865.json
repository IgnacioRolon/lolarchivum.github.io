It requires a lot of work and effort to do so. So salty NA fanboys go away, but honestly;\r\nTSM number 6? They won a major international after 2 Bo1 and 2 series (Bo3 and Bo5) against the weakest teams in the tournament. You can say it was pretty much \"gifted\" in that sense.\r\nHow many analysts take their time to make this? Have you ever heard of the term \"outlier\"? \r\nI don't follow China that much though I know EDG is doing great so I guess you can place them above GE Tigers. \r\nWhat you CANNOT do is put down the Tigers just because they had ONE bad performance against a team they didn't practise for becasue they didn't expect to face them. THAT is the outlier. As much as you can't call TSM the number 6 in the world just because they had an outlier performance in a \"gifted\" tournament.\r\nThe same way you can't place SK below CLG after a \"bad\" performance in a tournament that CLG didn't even make it in. There's a saying here that says \"To lose the first place, you had to be first once\". To perform bad in a Major, you first gotta make it in.\r\nI repeat, salty NA fans, let me leave this clear; EU is better than NA, yet NA is performing way better when it matters.\r\nAnd again, to analyse properly, you gotta isolate the outliers. And you, beloved redaction section, should learn to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"The Green 8 Ball","date":"2015-03-17T23:36:33.303+0000","up_votes":206,"down_votes":12,"body":"You can't just say EU is better then Na without any tangible evidence........you say that they are \"clearly better\", but don't show up \"when it matters\". If anything, your comment supports that NA is better because they show up and win and advance in major tournaments (last year's worlds NA had 2 quarter finalists vs EU's none, C9 advancing further then European teams at San Jose, and the improved TSM just won IEM while EU teams didn't even advance to the finals). Maybe you are caught in some bizarre reality where Fanatic winning the championship in Season 1 makes EU better then NA, but when comparing recent success at international tournaments.... I'm going to have to say that NA has shown an increase in potency, while EU seeming has fallen behind as of late.

Lets also add that 90% of NA teams have two fcking Koreans.... YEAH MAN FULL NA TEAM MY @SS. You guys cant win anything without a korean or European by your side. \r\n\r\nTSM has one American, two european and two Asians. That is a ot of \"American\" skill right there for you, considering the fact that that most of the work that team puts is done by Bot, mid and jungle, which if I´m not mistaken there are no Americans playing those roles.\r\n\r\nMean while the only True NA Teams like C9 and others are showing REAL NA SKILL.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, only two teams have Koreans, the rest are all Europeans, so what those that tell you? Well, they dont need to pay to win like you pathetic TSM.\r\n\r\n\r\nGo ahead cry about it and downvote me. But TSM cant win unless there are Europeans and Koreans on the team. Admit it, Americans suck and need help to show that NA has power, when in fact they dont. They only got money.\r\n\r\nThat said, the reason TSM is not a full Korean team is because NA teams are obligated to have one native American on the team. So your dear toplaner is the reason your team is not disclalified.\r\n\r\nWithout Dyrus, TSM would have been eliminated from the LCS. So dont come showing off that an AMERICAN TEAM won an International event when in fact TSM ONLY HAS ONE AMERICAN ON THE TEAM.\r\n\r\nIf you still think NA has a chance at winning anything then you´re dumb. The only thing NA can do is buy more Europeans, chinese or Koreans into the NA LCS, just so they can CHEAT their way into worlds and finally feed their ego.\r\n\r\nONE thing though, yes they represent NA LCS, but they are NOT FROM NA, they are IN NA, but they are not FROM NA.\r\n\r\nEvery region has full region teams, meanwhile NA has to buy their way in order to get somewhere. Something I´m not liking one bit is that EU has started doing this aswell. \r\n\r\nI know it sounds round \"omg you hate people from other countries to come play at others\", I dont mean that, but if you want a European team, then they should be European, otherwise they arent. \r\n\r\nTSM is not an NA team, its an international team.","replies":[{"poster":"krumpitz","date":"2015-03-18T21:23:36.319+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"WildTurtle is more NA than Dyrus is really...

I think TSM could stand on this level, at least the way that series was played.  That said, GET/JA/SKT I would put above everyone else.  Those same macro mistakes you just don't see in LCK.\r\n\r\nThe one thing people focus on in the WE vs GET series is that GET had some stellar underperformance to allow it to happen.  By this logic, the bottom Chinese team beating the top LCK team lends credence to the idea that top Chinese teams are better than top LCK teams.  However, the narrative doesn't play up enough the idea that WE also *overperformed* in that series to a significant degree.  If GET were underperforming to around the level of LDG, and WE were overperforming to that level, a flip of the die and WE wins 2-1.\r\n\r\nI think this series' outcome is being taken too far in the LPL vs. LCK argument. WE is such an outlier anyways bringing in a brand new roster that's impossible to plan well against, especially when they dark horse past GET's expected opponent in CJ, giving them less than 24 hours to prepare.
