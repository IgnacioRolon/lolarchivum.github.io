Outside of model animations, what about debuff/CC animations? Most of them (while admittedly for the sake of clarity) seem to have a major detachment from the game. For example, when someone is silenced a bright white chat bubble will float above their head; it's obvious for good reasons but it also detracts from the visual immersion. Other effects, like knockups, sometimes feel unsatisfying because the character model is frozen while being blasted into the air. I know that newer champions have different walking/running animations depending on whether they've been slowed/hasted so it'd be great to see some flailing or unbalance of sorts when they're suddenly knocked airborne. :)","replies":[{"poster":"FrankTheBoxMnstr","date":"2014-09-27T13:57:21.846+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir and Gnar have knockup animations where they're lying on their backs and flailing their arms and legs.

You couldn't do liquid before or something? What about Vlad's Sanguine Pool or Nami's water abilities?\n\nSecond more important question...if you even went out of your way to develop new asset to create Zac, you ever consider reusing some of the assets to make another champion similar(aesthetics-wise) to Zac? You have to admit that you could use a few more \"out there\" champions in terms of aesthetics.\n\nThird and just throwing this out there...is this the reason why Zac's only skin is nothing more than *\"Zac...but purple!\"*?","replies":[{"poster":"nickstravaganza","date":"2014-09-28T09:29:56.495+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac's complicated because of how his rig's set up. The joint hierarchy is very different to allow some of the blobby motion we added. There was also a lot of model swapping for his different moves as well as some of our earliest parametric anims. Vlad and Nami's effects are actually created by the VFX artists, whereas Zac was a mix of effects and animation.\n\nFor the second question, every champ is different with custom... well everything. But we learned a lot from Zac though that we still use today.\n\nHis complexity was probably part of his skin choice, but I'm not the best guy to ask","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"a puffpuff","date":"2014-09-27T03:40:42.766+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":5,"body":"So Riot... is this new... uh... new jiggle technology going to be implemented in any... possibly female champions that are coming?
