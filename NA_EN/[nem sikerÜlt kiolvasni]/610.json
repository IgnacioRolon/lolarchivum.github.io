It was removed for a reason, a list of them in fact.\n\nTribunal only slowed down after it removed rewards and removed the button from the home page of the site.  Riot basically relegated the feature to die removing the incentive and hiding it from newer players who weren't aware of it.\n\nThe reward system was a problem, since you could meet the minimum accuracy by just spamming \"Punish\" each time.  There was no effort to thwart this other than removing reward incentive.  They didn't track how much time was spent on the page, they didn't track actions being used to filter through games, they never put reports through that were meant to be Pardoned to check if people were paying attention, they went straight at the incentive system instead of making an effort to pull out the bad actors.\n\nRemoving incentive from anything through is a garbage idea.  I know Twisted Treeline and Dominion have been failing before they got removed, but intentionally excluding them from events basically punishes people who like the mode.  When your time can be spent doing something that will reward you vs something that gives you nothing, why would you do the latter unless you really, really loved it?\n\nReally the thing isn't perfect but acting like its a failure just because of the concept is incredibly dishonest and the people who talk about how Tribunal failed rarely put into context how Riot effectively buried the thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stexe","date":"2019-11-05T20:11:29.167+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":3,"body":"The Tribunal actually look the situation into effect.

I've had the report accuracy of 98% and i've been there judging games on a daily basis, up to my daily limit imposed by the Tribunal itself. At one point, i've taken notice that started judging reports that were months old, which means that there existed a bottleneck where there wasn't enough people doing the work or people just spammed reports left and right and there wasn't enough people to keep up the pace.\n\nAll in all, many people literally never bothered doing this when Riot axed the IP rewards per correct case because people were just pressing \"Punish\" in order to expedite the free IP process and were correct the majority of the time because everyone else did the same.\n\nThe Tribunal wasn't accurate and letting others police themselves had very big downsides. That's why it was replaced by an automated system that can keep up pace with the reports and remain consistent in the verdicts.\n\nThat being said, if the system is struggling to catch some cases of \"under the radar\" griefing, these cases can easily be sent to the players via the trimmed down Tribunal and left for the masses to judge - according to their language and all. This feedback can then be used to train the system to better recognize these griefing attempts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2019-11-05T21:44:01.419+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean...
