DUH! So without mana regeneration, I won’t be able to complete my first quest in 10-15 minutes (depending on who I’m up against) and therefore, will not be able to impact the map overall by being able to place more wards because I’ll need to build a Tear and what not to get than mana flow coming. \r\n\r\n+ no CDR for Eye of the Frost and the final one is another horrible thing to do. It’s hard to get 40% CDR quick and this upgrade helps achieve that in the first 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nThat’s 10% CDR + high Mana Regeneration was the reason people were incentivised to play aggressively and get the quest done, even if it meant putting your life on the line. And now you take it out like it’s nobody’s business. \r\n\r\nThen there’s the entire thing about penalty for Support players to not farm.
