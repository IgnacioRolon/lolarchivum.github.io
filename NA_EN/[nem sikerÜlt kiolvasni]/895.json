What a beautiful thing. It was the one intangible idea of life that had been taken away from Azir. There he was, lying breathless on the ground with blood everywhere. He was not dead, however. His eyes moved quickly as he tried to move, but couldn't. There was no help on the way and the ice began to spread more rapidly with each passing minute._ \r\n\r\nFour hours later...\r\n\r\n_Soraka and Rek'sai look for the building, but at this point it was hard to tell since half of Demacia was completely frozen._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:421}} \"Whatever you need to do with that vial, you've gotta do it quick.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Well, that just got a lot harder! How am I supposed to find this building when everything is all frozen?\"\r\n\r\n_All of the sudden, Lissandra appears and shoves Soraka to the ground._\r\n\r\n{{champion:127}} \"Looks like you're going to have another problem now!\"\r\n\r\n_Lissandra started to form the ice shard in her hands when Rek'sai uses her wrath and cuts Lissandra multiple times with her tail. Rek'sai then grabs Lissandra and prepares the burrow._\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Wha- What the hell do you think you're doing?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:421}} \"I am going to get her as far away from here as possible. You go and get that vial to the building!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:127}} \"Vial? WAIT! NOOOOOOOO!\"\r\n\r\n_Rek'sai then charged up and sped away. Soraka stood up and walked towards the taller buildings, hoping to find something that may provide her information as to which building is the one. As she walked on, Demacia got a whole lot lonelier. The city of great power now turned into a complete ghost town. Then, out of the corner of her eye, Soraka saw golden armor and a bunch of red ice around it._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Oh no! This can't be!\" \r\n\r\n_She was right. There was Azir, laying lifeless under a thick sheet of ice. Soraka immediately knew that this was the building and started to climb her way to the roof using the little shards of ice here and there on the building.  When she got to the top, she almost fell back down when she saw the frozen Gnar there. Luckily, she regained her balance and went to the center of the roof, where there was another dead body. Tahm Kench's body was also frozen, but emitted a nasty smell due to his rotting body. Soraka opened the vial and poured its contents onto the center of the roof. The ice then began to unfreeze, but at a very slow rate._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Damn it! That was all the vial had! This day just keeps getting worse...\"\r\n\r\n_Meanwhile in the hospital..._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} _waking up_ \"Ahhhh! So, what did I miss?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} _packing his things into a bag quickly_ \"Oh, you know, a whole ice storm that is about to turn us into ice. Look, I know you just woke up, but we need to get the f**k outta here!\"\r\n\r\n_The room was a mess. Shaco's clothes were all over the place and the room smelled like rotten milk._\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} _diguisted_ \"Ugh! What is that smell?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"Oh yeah, I stayed here for the duration of your ENTIRE F**KING COMA!!!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} \"Now you're getting mad?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"Ok, just need to take this backpack and burn the rest of these clothes!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} \"BURN THEM?!?! Are you crazy? We can donate all of these clothes to the National Amumu Foundation!\" \r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? THE NATIONAL AMUM-- That THING is a F**KING SCAM!!! THE ONLY THING HE IS GOING TO DO IS BECOME FRIENDS WITH YOU AND THEN TAKE ALL OF YOUR F**KING MONEY!!!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} \"Calm down! What the hell has gotten into you? So what if it's the 'snowpocalypse'? Since when did we become scared of nature?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"I don't care. We are leaving now!\"\r\n\r\n_Shaco grabs Jhin and pulls him out of the bed. Then, realizing that Jhin is naked, he points in the direction of where Jhin's clothes and weapons are. Shaco heads out and runs towards the exit. He then finds the doors and opens it._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"Lissandra, you are truly a b**ch!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} _stumbling out_ \"Wha- Wha-- WOAH! What in the f**k just happened here?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"Well, what a shame. This party died quickly.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} \"Look over there! There are two convenient motorcycles parked right there! Plus, neither of them are damaged!\"\r\n\r\n_Both Shaco and Jhin run over to the cycle and turn them on. Both of the cycles belonged to Senators visiting from Zaun, but Jhin and Shaco could give less of a s**t._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"Woah! Would you take a look at this! They also have full fuel to last us a trip to Shadow Isles!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} \"TUBULAR, DUUUDE!\" \r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} \"If you ever say that again, I will personally shank you until you can say the 'ABC's' backwards in less than 9 seconds.\" \r\n\r\n_With that, both of them put in the destination as Shadow Isles and rode away from Demacia._ \r\n\r\n_Meanwhile, at the top of the roof..._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Wo-- Who's there?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} \"It's me. We are going to end this once and for all. Where is she!?!?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"HOW COULD YOU DO THIS YOU EVIL TWO- SIDED PRICK!?!?\"\r\n\r\n_She shoved Garen many times and beat him with her staff._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} \"OW! Stop that! It's actually me! STOP! I am good now. I have been given some medicine to prevent that from happening ever again.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Oh. In that case, you're late. Rek'sai just took her far away to some place. I am not expecting to see her ever again.\" \r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} \"Then we must get to safety. There is a boat on the docks going to the Shadow Isles... you have to come!\"\r\n\r\n_Soraka agrees and both of them start to walk to the docks._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"So, why is everyone trying to get to the Shadow Isles?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} \"What do you mean by 'everyone'?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Well, Swain and the rest of Noxus... Oh... crap.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} _chuckles_ \"This will be more interesting than I thought!\" \r\n\r\n_In the VOID laboratories..._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:161}} \"Test subject #2, ready for launch?\"\r\n\r\n{{item:3512}} \"Not yet. Give the test subject a few more days of rest for effectiveness.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:161}} \"Good enough.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"Well, well, well. What do we have here?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:161}} \"Test subject #2, but I like to call him Omega Squad Teemo.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"Very good. We will launch him as our weapon in the Shadow Isles. Looks like everyone is moving there now.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:161}} \"Looks like Lissandra helped us more than we thought.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"Oh no. Her goal was to take over the world with ice, which would really ruin my plans. So, as soon as I located her... she is going to die.\" \r\n\r\n{{champion:161}} \"Sounds like a plan!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"Make sure our little friend here is ready to fight in two days... we have a Rek'sai to catch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thank you so much for supporting Beyond the Void: Season 1 by either commenting, upvoting, or even just reading it!
