He is 100% skillshot reliant, save for one auto-attack. You can technically dodge all of his abilities (just a fun fact, not actually like a legit amount of counterplay)\n4. Tanks will shut him down, as he has a lot of trouble against him.\n5. He needs to get ahead or at least break fairly even. As a melee champion in a lane filled with ranged champions, you can abuse his W's long cooldown to harass him all day. As long as your other lanes aren't stupid and ward up, which, admittedly, is rare in solo Q, he can't snowball off of them.\n6.
