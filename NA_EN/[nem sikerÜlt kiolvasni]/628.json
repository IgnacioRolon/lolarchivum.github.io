You are still not in kill threat because 1. you can farm by tower if being focused - diving a nasus is kinda a bad idea. 2. Galio won't 1v1 you - giving you free reign to push and demolish towers just as you would in mid lane when galio ult's or tp's away from lane. 3. You still do the exact same thing in teamfights - a bit less effectively since you can't run ghost and flash (unless... mid takes tp to swap roles/lanes with you mid/late game). 4. Your team bans the obvious, best counterpicks before 2nd round of picks; if they pick it first round, you can simply counterpick the counterpick and swap nasus the exact way you say skt would swap galio out of the nasus lane. Ta Da. 5. Your team drafts strong with their bot and mid (maybe sup or jg too) and can either set up 1-3-1 or 4-1. This let's nasus skip out on teamfights and just play pve killing towers to win the game.\n\nWe already saw successful nasus at worlds even if he didn't get fed early.

I should also state that I'm not against the players or the team, they are one of my favourites.\n\nBut here:\n\nThey put the most mechanically gifted player on Galio every single game, and he's not the most interesting champ to watch. You could say that the other teams should just ban it, but this just proves there's no proper in game answer. It's an overtuned unkillable champ before you even get items, and it still has hilarious waveclear. And it's a fine strategy to abuse this to win, and because SKT is smart, they do. \nThat is smart, but not exciting. \nDraft is boring to watch because you know what will happen, they make a comp that works around galio. They are also a big Kog player, which I also find 1 dimensional and boring, though this is not unique to them.\n\nThe pace is slow, they use the same strat 99% of games, and it's not so much a question of other teams adapting against it or to it, it's whether or not this makes for interesting gameplay, which so far I am saying not really. And I am someone who likes the underlying strategy in a game, and watching map movements, vision wars etc, i'm not just in it for the skirmishes.\n\nIt was the same story last worlds, picking annoying or boring champs and abusing them to victory. Again, it is smart, just not as entertaining as watching misfits or RNG push them. If every team tried to do things the way SKT does, I would 100% stop watching- same reason I almost did stop watching in S5- the games get very monotonous and everything is very expected.\n\nHope this helps clear up my personal point of view a bit- I am not trying to hate on the team.","replies":[{"poster":"01BigCheese","date":"2017-11-03T06:37:48.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for a thoughtful response.

The matches they had with RNG and Misfits were especially entertaining because SKT had to adapt to the unique and surprise picks. As Blank said in his interview, they were pushed to the limit. Huni added that their match with Misfits were hardest professional games he ever played. SKT playstyle works for them, why change if their strategy continues to bring them the wins? I personally enjoy their methodical and slow paced games. It's intelligent, highly strategic and technically challenging. They need to win over teams that already know their strategy. Besides, every team has their comfort picks and SKT has their own; we can hardly fault them for that.\n\nNothing lasts forever, so in the near future, another team will beat them with their own combination of winning strategy and technical mastery.
