You could watch tickets being sold back by scalpers 2 hours after all tickets were sold out for like $500, which is too much for many video game fans.\r\n\r\nThere is actually a difference here, as Pax PRIME is not at the beginning meant to exist only for NA Regionals, but for video games in general. That's why many people are also getting surprised by all tickets being sold out.\r\n\r\nI hope that next year Pax will have improved their management of the sales, because it's becoming very frustrating for a lot of people, some tickets having been bought by some who were trying to have 4-day passes for their friends and themselves, and at the end bought 12 tickets for 4 people.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Livin Like Titan","date":"2014-07-16T04:24:56.761+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"TEXAS!!!!!
