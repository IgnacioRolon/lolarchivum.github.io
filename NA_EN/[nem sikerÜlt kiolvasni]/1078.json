It all started when Zac “the slippery” (487RP) and himself were having a few shots of Whiskey in the “RiftWalk Runaway Saloon” owned by Kassadin (395RP) “the kid”. Kassadin was in the back watching his entertainer for the Saloon Warrior Princess Sivir (260RP)with great interest as she danced to a new hit called “Darude – Dongerstorm” that Mecha Kha’Zix (675RP) just picked up on his piano. It was quite an enjoyable afternoon until he showed up. The saloon doors swung open as no one other than High Noon Twisted Fate (487RP) walked in. The room was silent as Twisted Fate “The cardslinger” walked up to the bar and ordered a bourbon. “Looks like that whisky burnt more than your throat” He chuckled as he pushed brand off his chair. Brand looked up more fiery than ever and with a glare in his eye dared twisted fate to a duel. “Tomorrow  at high noon you and me middle of the road no tricks” was all that he said as he turned and exited the saloon. As soon as he left the joint was filled with the noise of bets of who would win this duel that would happen tomorrow. The next morning there was no one in the town that wasn’t in the saloon waiting for high noon. The odds were stacked against brand 20 to 1. Kassadin was rolling in the money as there were more customers than he had ever gotten before since the saloon had opened.  They all fell silent once Brand and Twisted fate left the saloon and started to walk towards the road taking different directions. They walked thirty paces and turned ready at any moment to start the fight. Kha’Zix was playing the most tense music he could think of and Zac was kind enough to provide the Tumbleweed. “On three go for you fire” Twisted fate sneered as he started to get ready with his gold card. “One,Two,Three!” Twisted fate quickly threw his gold card stunning Brand for a few moments as he tried as hard as he could to get as many auto attacks off. As soon as Brand was able to move, he quickly started to hurl fire at Twisted fate. With his combo going off and the card master being immobilized he immediately put a ring of fire around Twisted fate and was ready to deliver the final blow. But just as quickly Twisted Fate flashed out of the ring and began to ult. There was a murmur in the crowd as Tf began to start ulting far off where Kassadin was waiting for him. Brand saw their plan now. The duel was a set up! With the duel bringing so much business Kassadin and the cardslinger would quickly make their escape spending their fortune however they pleased. Quickly Brand ulted at the escaping coward. With the ult heading towards Twisted fate he disappeared next to Kassadin.  With a smile on his face Brand turned around and started to walk off. The crowd saw in the distance as both Kassadin and his accomplice were both incinerated by Brand’s ult. With the crowd on the streets congratulating Brand he turned to the wreckage of Kassadin’s Stage Wagon and said, “Looks like that fire burned more than just you Twisted fate”  Brand quietly went inside the saloon and ordered a whiskey for he knew that more would challenge him once news of his victory spread.

It's all in the cards.\" Twisted Fate slipped a deck out of his right sleeve, and did an impressive one-hand shuffle. With a quick wrist flick, he slipped one card out of the deck and tossed it face up on the table. \"Hm, red.\" he mumbled to himself. \"Well, will you help? What does a red card mean?\" Twisted Fate looked up from the desk. \"It means I'll help you, but this ain't gonna be pretty. Lady Luck's smile is fading fast.\" Zac started walking out the door. \"Let's get going then, we don't have much time!\" \"Not so fast, partner. We can't do this ourselves. If the cards are right,\" he said, slipping a gold card out of the deck, \"there's one more person we'll need.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Mecha Kha'Zix (675 RP) sat in the corner of the rustic office, stealthed. *\"...It means I'll help you...\"* That was all he needed to hear. Kha'Zix quickly ducked out of the room, and started running down the hall, steadily approaching the blank wall at the end. At he reached it, a small rift appeared in the wall, just big enough for him to dash through. Stepping through the rift took him to a bigger, more modern room, where he rejoined his allies. Kassadin (395 RP) closed the rift behind Kha'Zix, and looked towards the other side of the room at Brand (440 RP). Brand looked at the two void creatures, \"Ready to set the world on fire?\" Kassadin turned to Kha'Zix. \"Well, can we count on not being... disturbed? You know too well that both Brand and I need to concentrate for our plan to work. If this succeeds, we can take over all of Runeterra. I can open up rifts anywhere, and Brand can send fire through them. With our combined power, we can burn all of Runeterra fast enough that there will be no survivors.\" Kha'Zix turned to face Kassadin. \"He's going to show up. Twisted Fate will come here.\" Kassadin chuckled \"Surely you can fight him off if he is... alone?\" Kha'Zix smiled in realization, \"Of course, and there's no way anyone else can get here fast enough.\" Brand stood up, his fire burning brighter and hotter than ever before. \"Let's begin cleansing the world then, shall we?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Kassadin began concentrating on opening rifts long-distance over Runeterra, and Brand got ready to pour his hottest fire into the rifts. Right as he was about to begin covering Runeterra is dense flames, an eye appeared over his head, along with Kassadin's and Kha'Zix. A ring of cards appeared on the ground on the far side of the room. \"Wrong move, Cardmaster\" Kha'Zix muttered as he moved towards the cards. High Noon Twisted Fate appeared, holding three gold cards. Before he had a chance to throw them, Kha'Zix leaped towards Twisted Fate, metallic claws bared and ready to destroy. Right before his claws sunk into Twisted Fate's body, a giant green blob hurled itself in the way. Kha'Zix stumbled back, confused. \"Wha- how did HE get here so fast? I thought they were too far away to...\" Kassadin looked over to Zac in alarm. \"The only way he could get here that fast is if they also got help from-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- At that moment, the far wall of the room crumbled, and out of the smoke shot a rounded blade. The blade hit Brand in the shoulder, bounced to Kassadin's arm, and then bounced across the room to Kha'Zix, and then shot back out of the room. \"Heads up!\" called Warrior Princess Sivir (260 RP). High Noon Twisted Fate unloaded his three gold cards on the shocked and now-injured creatures, and finally Zac pulled them all together in a heap at the center of the room. Kassadin drew in a breath \"You can't stop us... we're... too...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    -- \"Nighty night,\" Twisted Fate said, as Kassadin, Kha'Zix, and Brand fell into unconsciousness. Runeterra was saved... for now.","replies":[{"poster":"pikk51O5","date":"2014-05-26T16:43:32.584+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"...wow.

The foe has two assassins, both very different from each other, but both snowball beyond anyone's control. Sivir would have a better view of the enemy jungle, see, but their support dc'ed 10 minutes in and Sivir has had to go it alone since. As a result, no wards besides her small little trinket. This time, however, the enemy bot lane had pushed too aggressively and taken a few shots from the tower, and with her ultimate active, she now had the rare opportunity for a 1v2 double kill, against a **High Noon Twisted Fate (487 RP)** as an ADC and his connected support.  She has just used her little trinket in the river bush so she has but one terrifying choice for the double: to facecheck.\r\n\r\nMuch rather than a weakened bot lane, she faces the two terrifying persons in question. Before she can react with her ult, the Void Spikes of **Mecha Kha'Zix (675 RP)** slow her, and suddenly, the Void space dude known only as **Kassadin (395 RP)**Riftwalks right into her face. With a kill easily in their sights, they decide to wait for a little while, to toy with their prey.\r\n\r\nBut Sivir is curious. \"Hold up a minute. Kassadin. Kha'Zix. Aren't you two, like, sworn enemies or something?\"\r\n\r\nSuch a quick question from the victim catches the two cold-blooded killers off guard. \"Now, see,\" retorted Kassadin, \"I went to a desperate place after I got reworked. The Rift was so hyped about how I was to be nerfed to the point of no return, and I sank into a classic case of Void depression. However, one match, I found the truth: I was no longer perma-banned and I was still as overpowered as I was before. In my burning desire to wreak havoc against those who wanted me out of the dreadful meta, so I teamed up with the other hunter you see here. He's a robot now, too, so it's not really against my anti-Void creature-thingimajiggy stance\".\r\n\r\nBut being a bloodthirsty robot and wanting no more time to wait before Sivir is slain, he cuts straight to the chase and goes for the kill, but just because Sivir is alone in the bot lane doesn't mean that she is alone on the Rift. Suddenly, **Brand (440 RP)** appears from the mid lane, landing his Conflagration on Kha'Zix and letting it spread to Kassadin before landing his Sear, holding a trapped Kha'Zix in place as Brand an Sivir get an unlikely kill of of the robot. Kassadin barely manages to RIftwalk away and is recalling, but is too distracted by the shop menu to see Sivir's jungler** Zac (487 RP)** leap from over the nearby wall and end his life once and for all. So much for two unkillable assassins.\r\n\r\nTeamfight wins are teamfight wins, but Kha'Zix and Kassadin were still fed to a degree, and had snowballed to the point where the other team was hopeless. Just as the enemy team was at their nexus, and all hope was lost, SIvir was about to finally die, but three words of an overpowered newcomer echoed throughout the RIft and gave the desperate team hope even as the newly reconnected support was still level 5:\r\n\r\n\"Stand behind Braum!\"\r\n\r\nSo I know you'll be skeptic, but contrary to some beliefs, I am NOT a smurf of Lord Moriuz, or anyone else. I am just someone who loves these little stories for each skin sale, I've read every one since a started playing not too long ago.

He was wearing his fancy Western get up and swaggering around in his fancy coat.  \r\n\r\nWhat we were planning was dumb. We were busting into Kassadin's lair near one of the Chasms that lead to abyss of the Void. Mr. Fate wanted to steal Kassadin's Rift walk device to make his Destiny ultimate mapwide. I was coming along because Sivir was coming. I sort of follow Sivir around. You would too if you saw her in her battle bustier clutching her boomerang.

The Lair was basically just a pit that was hidden by void energy. Sivir's shield cracked it open for us. Unfortunately that meant that it was down for when Kass's guard dog (actually he's more of a bug). Fired a vicious volley of void spikes at her.\r\n\r\nI exploded from my box like a giant green bowel movement catching the spikes in my gelatin and feeling my passive burst me into four pieces to preserve my life.
