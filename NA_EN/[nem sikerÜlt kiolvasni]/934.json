(some from Rito Q&A).So lets get started. \r\n-You can get 1 chest per champ per season when you get a S grade (S-,S,S+). Another limit is you can only receive 4 chest per month (about 1 per week). now that is 52 chances in 1 year.\r\n\r\n-I personally, although a mediocre champ base, have a champ base of 56 owned champions. about 15 I could play to get a S grade by myself,15 chest would quite a small amount of chests to get in a year. (Given other info). there seems to be a way to scam the system if you have really good friends. If you cant get a S with all those 52 different champs, you can have a friend who is good at a champ get a S in a premade with you. This will allow you to get the chest for that champ. So say Im bad at Hec. I can have my buddy get a Easy S with his Yasuo,Fizz,Garen,Darius,Jax,victo... Sorry Im digressing, in a premade with me while Im playing hec Jung,or something, to get the chest for Hec.\r\n\r\n-Skin shards chart for disenchanting and crafting. \r\nRP value          Disenchant          craft\r\n975 skin    =       322 essence =    675 essence \r\n1820 skin   =      610 essence  =    ?\r\n3250 Skin   =     1073 essence  =    ?\r\nthese are the main skin types people will care about, it seems to be about 2 (975) disenchants + specific (975) skin shard= That (975) Skin At about 52 chests a year this seems ok. If you only were getting Skins shards, but you get icons, ward skins, and champions in there too! Someone opened 1000 in PBE got 316 champion shard, 591 skin shards, 54 ward skins, 39 Icons. along with 39 double gifts and 40ish gems(re-rolls for the chest). From what I have seen the ratios are good with legacy, legendary and ultimate skins. \r\n IF a Riot DEV reads this part of the comment only or if you could send this to someone who can make this happen. I feel this Part is \r\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT !\r\n-Not offering these for IP is a BIG mistake. Even if its 3-4K IP for the set, This is something you NEED to get out, people have WAY too much free IP sitting around. You need to add this Especially if you plan to also add champion shards in the mix. Personally, I dont know about everyone, I will never buy a champ for RP ,it {IMO} is a complete waste of money when you can just put time in and get it. So there needs to be a way of opting out of getting champions shards, or purchasing it with IP. I say because I try and fail,I like skins way too much, to keep my self from spending too much money on this game. Also if Im limited on the number of chests I can earn each year and 10 of my 52 end up being champ shard at the end of a YEAR, I would be greatly disappointed in my loot from a years worth of chests.\r\n \r\nAS always thanks for reading my comment. If you made it down this far xD. Ill see you on the Rift! Also if you are in PBE and can fill in a comment of a better graph for the essence that would be GREAT!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-02-05T00:59:56.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It really shouldn't be so hard to get an S ranking.  As someone who only got to Silver last year and mains support I can get an S ranking on pretty much any champ within at an absolute maximum of 1 games.  And that includes champs that I have never used before.  Even on my worst champ by far (Vayne) it only took me a couple games to get an S ranking.  I do still like the idea of spending IP on hextech but there is something you should think of.  Someone in your position SHOULDN'T burn IP on hextech stuff.  You should use your IP for more useful things like champions, runes, and rune pages.
