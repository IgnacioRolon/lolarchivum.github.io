There used to be a time where ANY negative comment used to be down-voted into oblivion just because Riot was infallible. But Riot's been out of sync with their gamers for a while now.  \r\n\r\nMy theory as to why: There's no consistency to the game anymore.  It makes it frustrating for long time gamers who don't want to have to re-learn the game, or find a new main, every few months.  \r\n\r\nFor me I finally lost interest when they nerfed Anivia's R>E combo a while back (my long time main). Anivia was considered to be fine for like 5 years, and then all of a sudden she's randomly considered OP, and a staple of her gameplay was deleted. Now she's just frankly not fun to play anymore. \r\n\r\nI feel for all the other characters which have been through the same thing. But I've already moved on, I only logged on to see if URF was coming back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Birdie Sànders","date":"2017-03-21T18:14:25.858+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":">{{champion:133}} After putting at least one point in Behind Enemy Lines, Quinn respawns as Valor after deaths for the rest of the game\r\n\r\nPlease explain, Im too dumb","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-03-21T18:19:37.382+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quinn won't have to activate her ultimate in the fountain.\n\nThis won't actually change anything for Quinn players aside from being a little more convenient.
