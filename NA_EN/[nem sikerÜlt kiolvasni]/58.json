I loved that. It is now only available to hear if you turn on the music and can only sort of hear it in the background. I wish there was an option or something to turn that on and off like there is with music and sound effect.

When on an enemy's turn, the champion hover does not appear on the right side nor in the center.\n2. Champion splash occasionally does not sync up with what the summoner is actually picking (eg. Summoner hovers Ahri and then Veigar, but stays on the Ahri splash)\n3. FPS Spikes are everywhere.\n\n**Minor Issues (Mainly aesthetic)**\n1. Primary and secondary icons do not have the same look to match the Hextech feel that the client is going for and is downright ugly when seen on the banner ( Sorry design team :[ )\n2. Lack of pick quotes as well as the lock in sound effect for other players. It's very quiet and when not focusing on the client, it's hard to tell who is picking.\n3. Stock image of SR sketch at the start of the draft. Could use something else, but hey it's the alpha","replies":[{"poster":"Neforus","date":"2016-08-25T07:08:36.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess I'm not the only one that has a problem with regards to lag in my laptop, got an i7 on it and it lags as hell.\n\nAs for the champion select, I'll add also the voice for who team is banning or picking, and add the option to change your load out while waiting for the picks to be finish. I tried to access my skins while waiting for the picks to be finished but I cannot access it for some reason but it is minor anyways.\n\nOverall, good work on the draft mode, just need to work on some issues especially with lagging on high end laptops (such as mine).\n\nPS\nCan anyone tell me when Ranked Draft will be release?
