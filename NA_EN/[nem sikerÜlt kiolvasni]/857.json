C9, if you watch their games make very intelligent rotations and have one of the best shotcalling in the world. SK if they can't get ahead they don't do much, they have pretty poor vision control. This isn't saying SK is a bad team, they are one of the best western teams. Oh and C9 being exposed that's already been done, SK is not very good at playing from behind which has been shown in their losses and this could be very bad especially since thay have a korean team in their group. C9 can play from behind which means they will stand a slightly better chance against a dominating korean team like GE Tigers.
