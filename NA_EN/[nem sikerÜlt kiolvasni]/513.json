He is a ranged-tank lane-bully scaling tank shredder. He's OP because he's too hard to kill, not because of spellbook. It's the same reason why Gnar is a huge balance problem, because he's a ranged-tank hyper-scaling tank shredder.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlankxShot","date":"2018-10-09T18:23:00.814+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"I look forward to no longer perma banning graves","replies":[{"poster":"BlankxShot","date":"2018-10-09T18:28:20.851+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":2,"body":"so now I can perma ban Akali {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowardly Clown","date":"2018-10-09T20:34:42.473+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"But the nerf is so slight","replies":[]},{"poster":"Final Raid Boss","date":"2018-10-10T18:36:07.067+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 ad omegalul","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eden Credits","date":"2018-10-09T20:27:40.277+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":28,"body":"Hello? is riot games fucking retarded, another patch and no nerf to the major champions in this game.

No one's gonna touch Ryze, Reksai, Skarner, Azir, or Ornn? They're some of the lowest win rate in their lanes and for the most part they're severely underplayed. Can we do something about that, like make them more relevant, I know ornn's abilities and passive make him hard to lane against as he almost never needs to back, but he's super mana hungry and can hardly sustain lane against champs that don't use mana. Skarner is a weird jg, his tactic is build full speed and tank, but when it comes down to it, he has one stun which is on a huge cooldown that only lasts for a few seconds on a single person, just like malzahar's but doesn't do damage. Skarner's slow is rather hard to use and gets slower the more things it goes through, kinda making it impossible to gank a lane that has minions in it. Reksai is just underwhelming, needs a bit more power to be relevant and useable in teamfights and solo hunts. Ryze... just sucks in general, might be easier to remove that champ or totally rework him.
