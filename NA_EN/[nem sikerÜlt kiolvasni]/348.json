First, Square Enix did nothing wrong when suing these \"cosplayers\". Second, it wasn't fan-art, they actually profited from the \"cosplaying video\" and they also used unauthorized live-action scenes of the FFVII franchise. You cannot profit from something you didn't create, which in this case is the character(s) (and no, as bad as it sounds not even when you make the costume from scratch). You cannot sell something that doesn't belong to you neither can you profit from it. When I saw the comment I read the article pertaining the suit and so I wanted to share my thoughts.

I never said \"WOMEN do not play LOL.\"  I said \"THESE WOMEN so not play LOL\"  As in the particular females in these photos.  Which is in not even a remote way a sexist comment.  I'm well aware that millions and millions of women play video games.  So calm down people.  Eat some prozac or something.  Of course you could notice the fact that every single female in these photos are attractive as hell and it is more unlikely that they game.  I know I'm blowing a lot of gamer fantasies here but your average gamer girl isn't a model on the side.  Also, out of all the photos chosen, your telling me that only attractive women were capable of making a outstanding costume? I doubt it.  Id bet a lot of money that some other women had better costumes out there but didn't make the cut because whoever voted on these voted with their little heads rather than the large one.  But hey, I'm sure there are a shit ton of gorgeous girls who play this game (BS) and they all know how to make amazing cosplay costumes (BS).  Well I'm a gonna go back to reality and you guys can stay in your angry land of delusion.
