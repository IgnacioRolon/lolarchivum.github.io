I have used the forgot user name/ forgot password and i do not receive any emails. ( i have check spam and all other folders)  I submitted a ticket yesterday and even on early today and have heard nothing back so i figured if theres a tiny chance of help here i would try.  \r\nI have not been on lol for a long while and wanted to play with some friends but cannot access my account?  I have tried all my passwords i use and nothing and non of the recovery tools are working.  I looked up and found some old post i have made in the past and noticed that my account doesnt have a summoner icon, i dont know what that means.  I'm scared my account may of been hacked?  but i don't know and i am not hearing anything back from support.","replies":[{"poster":"CyberHayabusa","date":"2016-12-29T20:13:31.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3rd day and no response from my ticket support :( any help please i dont want to lose this account","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T22:59:27.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll need your ticket number so I can check your ticket, but just as a heads-up, all account recovery tickets (if submitted correctly) will be done via email from your end, so you'll see a reply in your inbox once you get one. Additionally, the Holidays slammed us pretty hard, so response times a bit longer because of that, just letting you know. :)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"The Hentai Hero","date":"2016-12-29T23:16:34.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i finally got the account back literally like 15 mins before you posted.  Someone hacked the account and i got it back.  Unfortunately they spent all my saved ip on a name change and other stuff so im trying to see if it can get reverted or refunded.\nThanks for replying though, i was really worried i was going to lose this account after having it for like 6 years","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CyberHayabusa","date":"2016-12-29T01:58:55.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant check the status of my tickets because i cant login to that account since i dont have the password -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"CyberHayabusa","date":"2016-12-28T23:29:02.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for some reason i am having some weird error with the account i posted this on so i have to use this one?
