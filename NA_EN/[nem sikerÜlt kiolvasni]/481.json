If the people that players listen to don't use these terms, the players generally won't either.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're wondering why I say that \"ADC\" is a bad term: 1) Not every marksman builds straight AD.  Some can build AP or hybrid, and you can bet that I'll go with hybrid damage if I'm last pick in an all-AD team.  2) \"Carry\" and \"support\" are actually synonyms.  3) Of course, people use the word \"carry\" to refer to the player who distinctly had the greatest influence toward his or her team's win.
