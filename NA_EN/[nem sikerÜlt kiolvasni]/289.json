When she gets pissed she goes into a rage for a brief period, increasing her attack speed\n(attack speed wont work with Q passive, which allows it to be stronger than if it synergized forces her to go melee instead, represents her throwing a tantrum)\nQ: macey's mace builds momentum while she hasnt attacked in 1 second, charging up its range and damage up to 100% (perhaps?) and 3-400 range over 2-3 seconds. Macey can activate this abiliy to half the charge time and remove the attack penalty\n(like threshes e passive but with bonus range and AD scaling, active changes her gameplay briefly)\nW: mace sweep: macey sweeps her mace, dealing damage to enemies around her. if shes behaving sweetly, she instead just trips enemies up, grounding them for 2 seconds and slowing them\n(basic aoe,could have the weak zone thing that darus Q has (makes sense) when shes pissed, she aims to hurt, when shes sweet, she goes easy on her opponent)\nE: macey either dashes to an ally or an enemy depending on her mood, if shes pissed, she attacks an enemy, if shes happy, she rushes to an ally.\nR: bad temper: 60s CD, for the next 6 seconds macey can freely change between her moods\n\nquickly jumbled together but i think its unique enough, could definitely use some tuning, could add some bonus effects to her passive as there is currently no benefit to being sweet, perhaps damage reduction would work? sort of like 'ouch that hurt, but i forgive you ^_^' moving into 'OK, X@ NOW IM PISSED! IM GONNA PUNCH YOUR TEETH OUT!'","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T20:55:43.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a cool concept, but as *TheMightyDavid* mentioned, this type of post belongs on the [Concepts & Creations](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts) board. It will get far more visibility there, and you're much more likely to get constructive feedback from the community tailored to these sorts of things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jyu VioIe Grace","date":"2016-07-28T05:47:48.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Re:Zero its a great anime,  and I think your champion idea is cool.
