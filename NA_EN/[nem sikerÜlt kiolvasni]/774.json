I really didn't like the way that the play-in stage extended MSI; I have to imagine the play-ins here will cause much of the same fatigue if I try to watch it again. It also bothers me that they don't specify whether each of the 4 major regions will be split into a different group. If there's a possibility that we can get #3 seeds from NA, LPL, and LMS in the same group, for example, I don't like that at all.\n\nAlso, I don't like that LCK gets an automatic walk. Yes, I realize that their teams are going to get there anyways, but this whole 'seeding by last split' thing isn't working for me because it holds a recency bias that doesn't even apply to the following tournament. So much has changed between MSI and Worlds that regional power between LPL/NA/EU/LMS will have entirely shifted. I think we're to the point that most viewers just want to see somebody beat the LCK, and it doesn't help that we're handicapping one of the other major regions and simultaneously giving the LCK an advantage. The only benefit the top seed/region should have is in the seeding itself--any other advantage shifts too much favor.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-08-25T23:44:35.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't a fan of the format either when I first looked at it, I understand the whole \" X region did bad this year, so now this is their punishment\" but it's too early to do that.  For example, when College football introduced the Playoff-Format the league didn't do it that year that they announced it, but instead 1-2 years after so it gives teams time to prepare for it, on top of that lets not forget that Riot always seems to introduce a new meta/patches/changes like 2 weeks before the biggest tournament in the scene.   \nSo an X region that was kinda bad, gets a bad placement, a bad group and a new meta, too much in my opinion. \n\n  I love watching league but honestly I was fatigued after the play-in stage myself and that's something an audience member shouldn't feel, especially when it's like 1/3 of the tournament itself.  \n  I like adding more teams to Worlds so it feels like an actual WORLDS instead of just 4 regions and LMS but the possibility of those X regions facing LMS/LPL/NA/NA #3 and might eliminate such regions only to face higher competition is head-scratching in my opinion. \n\n  Point is, I personally would have liked to see either more teams in 4 groups or 8 groups with 4 teams in such, instead of 1-2 rounds of play-in stages for teams to get fatigued only to get destroyed by LCK.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hiro157","date":"2017-08-23T02:43:13.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why can't C9 make it to worlds without playing in the gauntlet?

CLG would then have 100 if they get 2nd, IMT 90.    And the tie breaker would be who got more points in Summer and that would be IMT.
