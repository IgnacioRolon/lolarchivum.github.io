I think the art is nice, regardless of what it displays. Not everything had to be gay because one rights movement happened, and clearly the artist didn't back off because time was clearly spent on this art.

I expected a lil' bit of gay in there ngl, and didn't find any, but there's no reason to be upset about it. Especially considering that Riot would NEVER have the balls to do some LGBT cards considering their game is on Rusia and Asia, a country and a continent that are particularly homophobic.\r\n\r\nCongrats to Zuqling for making art for Riot though.","replies":[{"poster":"TBondDaBlazer","date":"2017-02-14T22:46:02.841+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"you got Taric/Ezreal xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"raee","date":"2017-02-14T22:17:58.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a close friend her Zuqling, I can say shes an ally for the LGBT community :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2017-02-14T20:07:38.447+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sure do love myself {{champion:119}} ","replies":[{"poster":"TwinkletoesKat","date":"2017-02-15T16:50:36.209+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a new Valentine's Card Idea,\r\n\r\n\"I love you more than {{champion:119}} loves {{champion:119}} \"\r\n\r\n10/10","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bubblandstuff","date":"2017-02-14T20:52:06.577+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa is that a new champion on Vi's magazine?!","replies":[{"poster":"Fluffybunny645","date":"2017-02-14T20:54:54.739+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you talking about that's Aatr... oh I get it ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reisuke Naoki","date":"2017-02-15T01:45:56.197+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually looked at it again because i kinda forgot Aatrox existed.
