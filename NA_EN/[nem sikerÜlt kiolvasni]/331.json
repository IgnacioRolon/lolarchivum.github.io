For example, if immortals makes it to finals with TSM and loose to TSM, then TSM will be NA's number one seed and Immortals will have 90 points but so will cloud 9 sense they got 70 from the spring split and 20 from the summer split. I am assuming they will pick Immortals sense they have the better record for summer split but they do have the same amount of points so i am curious as to who they would pick as second seed for NA.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2017-08-22T00:48:07.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Summer always takes priority, thus IMT would get in.","replies":[{"poster":"Steefness","date":"2017-08-29T21:21:36.980+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is pretty ridiculous.  C9 made playoffs both splits whereas IMT stunk it up in the Spring.  C9 has shown that they are more consistent but are punished because they had a slightly better showing the previous split.  What's the point of even having the point system if that's how you're going to do it, just give the second seed to the second place team in Summer.  Backwards thinking, and possibly influenced by the desire to have different teams represent NA (as if it matters).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Domermac","date":"2017-08-19T02:42:40.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why is LMS the only region where there is a bracket? To me it says seeding is extraneous. Probably creates more playoff competition but seems a little PC for professional gaming. Ribbons, ribbons, ribbons for all! First seed should get a bigger advantage IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Steefness","date":"2017-08-29T21:25:37.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They've allowed regions not named NA or EU to regulate themselves, to set their own rules for how things are determined.  That's why you see the weird things like the old game 5 blind pick rule in LCK, or the splitting of the league into two groups like LPL first did and EU followed.  Look up non sequitur, it fits what you're bringing up.  Most professional sports playoffs involve a bracket system exactly like the one LMS is doing, where the top seeds play the bottom seeds, and it's just like the split playoffs are laid out in NA and EU with the top seeds getting paired with the lower seeds.  It has nothing to do with PC, and there's no reason to bring up politics in a video gaming comments board.","replies":[{"poster":"Domermac","date":"2017-09-01T15:05:20.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand the bracket system and that most professional sports use it. However if you looked across the other major regions (NA, EU, LCK, LPL) you'll notice a bracket system playoff to decide the 3rd place team for each region at worlds. I'm saying that I think LMS being a bracket for the worlds qualifier is stupid. They've already done that for the title of their region. Points are accrued over two splits, a team that is more consistent and has more points should be rewarded more. If you've fought for that advantage, you deserve it. Hence the PC of making it all equal anyways, your non sequitur comment leads me to believe you missed that. Also I think its naive to think that video games are devoid of politics or their influence.

Sure now 24 teams instead of 16 get to say they went to worlds. No one expects anyone but NALCS, EULCS, LPL, and LMS to make it out of the play ins. If this happens there will be only 1 wild card team in the group stage and that would be from the GPL because they did the best at MSI. They get a slot in the 2nd seeds.

By my count i see 12 teams seeded into groups directly and then 12 other teams set into the play-ins. I can only assume that those 12 will compete in some type of knockout bracket system for the remaining 4 seeds for worlds. If there is an article explaining this I would appreciate a link; if not, why not? I must admit I do like the changes being made to how Worlds seeding works. I think the extra international games being played by regions not named Korea will help to improve those teams. I almost look forward to the play-ins more than Worlds itself, the games appear as though they will be much more competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-08-29T20:05:14.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play ins round 1   four groups, three teams each.
