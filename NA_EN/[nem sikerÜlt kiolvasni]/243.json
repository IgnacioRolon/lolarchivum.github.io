The problem in lower elo's is players instantly tilt as soon as they see their top laner is 0/3. \"GG FF@20\" Now, in diamond, this may be a problem because players understand how to use their lead to carry and end a game quickly. Lower elo players do not! Just dont tilt, and wait out the game. Chances are, the game is going to reach that 45 minutes where the top laners massive lead is now completely irrelevant.

You can't expect to climb with the attitude that your team sucks and you deserve to be higher. There is a reason why several people can do \"unranked to challenger\" streams. Its because they have the skill's to carry a game. I feel this goes overlooked by many players. You can be very good at the game, but still not have the specific skill set to actually carry.

However, let me give you this:\r\n\r\nWhen you enter into a game, you can rule out the possibility of being a troll/feeder yourself, right? That's pretty good news for your team! That means there are only 4 potential feeders/trolls on your team, since you can rule yourself out. However, for the enemy team, there are FIVE potential feeders/trolls, since you can't rule any of them out. ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR! On the macro scale the enemy teams you play against will have more trolls/feeders than your team does. Which means unless you have a lot to improve on, low elo is especially easy to move up in due to the easy games where the enemy has trolls/feeders. Looks like you have a lot to improve on.
