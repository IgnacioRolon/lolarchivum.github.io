Sure the game was the same but the music was so soothing and relaxing with a hint of mystery. Even though those graphics are far outdated by today's standards I would go back to the old winter rift in a heart beat because of how different and cool (no pun intended) it looked. If you prefer other things that they do for winter then by all means enjoy them. I like the poro king thing but not as much as Winter Rift but that is just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"The Noodle","date":"2015-12-01T03:25:22.889+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"This really makes me wish i was playing since the game was released, since i started last year the snowdown was my favorite event.
