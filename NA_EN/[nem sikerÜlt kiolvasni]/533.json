TSM has the easiest group and they still are struggling, while C9 and IMT have the two hardest groups and are thriving. EDG and AHQ are not weak teams yet C9 was able to make them look like wild card teams. Likewise Fnatic is amazing yet IMT made a quick comeback after punishing a mistake by one person (much like a Korean team would do). As goes Korea, they could have two 1-2 teams and in my opinion they will have that next year if the current trends continue to happen. Korea is no longer a guarantee anymore, and if C9 and/or IMT cleaned up their play we could very well see an NA win over the \"most dominant\" region. This could just be NA bias, but NA is no longer a region that can just be ignored or counted out of finals. There is a very real possibility that an NA team makes it to finals, or even wins, this year.

I notice how you purposefully left out IMT, who went toe to toe with the team that I predict to be the most likely to win the tournament (LZ), and still look like they could beat LZ this week. As goes C9 they were able to beat an EDG that was one team fight away from crushing SKT, and that tells me that C9 are still competitive. To say that C9 will not make it to finals just because they looked bad in a single game is absurd. TSM is a whole different story. TSM was gifted the easiest group, the only one without a Korean team, and they still look like they're under-preforming. They were losing in their game against FW all game until a couple of late game team fights, and then they actually lost to a European team. The only game in which TSM looked dominant was their game against WE, the weakest Chinese team at the tournament. You did ask the question, \"Where would you put SKT, RNG and LZ,\" and to answer it I would place all three of them at the very top in this order: LZ 1st, SKT 2nd, and RNG 3rd. I've mentioned this on previous comments on different articles that I believe that NA isn't going to win worlds, it's just their best chance to win it since season 1. I feel confident enough to say that an NA team is almost guaranteed to make it to Semifinals. If NA advances from Semis I would be amazed and extremely happy, but I have my doubts about them making it any further than that. But doubts do not mean that it is impossible, and you cannot just say \"NA is bad\" and not elaborate on it like other worlds. It is clear that NA has shown up as real contenders for this tournament. I think that this year will be like last year's MSI where some will be like me and overestimate NA by saying we win the tournament, while others will underestimate and say that NA is a wildcard region, just to have an NA team make to the finals and lose proving both sides wrong. I respect your opinion, and statistically speaking you're not entirely wrong to say that NA is unlikely to make it to the finals, but I disagree with your whole \"There's a 0.1% chance NA makes it to finals and if they do it's because of Bjergsen\" line of thought. There is little that can actually support that statement, and if I had to put a percentage behind NA as a region winning worlds I would say something more along the lines of 30%, unlikely but still possible under the right conditions.","replies":[{"poster":"Flanman","date":"2017-10-11T13:03:23.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all TSM/Fw were back and forth all game. 2nd TSM handled WE pretty easily.

Part of a team's strength is not doing things that lose you games.  Part of being a strong team is not throwing good lives after bad, not initiating unfavorable fights, not throwing games.  knowing when not to make a 50-50 baron call, not flashing foward and getting yourself blown up at a crucial part of the game, knowing when to take a fight and when to avoid it, knowing when to walk away instead of throwing more lives and more gold over to the other team.    So the fact that last week, those other teams did these things that lost them games against C9 and C9 didn't do these things as much means C9 was the stronger team last week.   And virtually every 0-3 team in the field can point to well I played Team X better than anyone else.  But that is what 0-3 teams do.  They lose the game they were in and had a chance to win and lose other games too.   That's why they're 0-3.   To make the claim that those other teams were better than C-9.  No.  They weren't.  They did things to lose. C9 didn't.  That made C9 the better team last week.  But this week is a new week.    Perhaps those other two teams can clean up their act and be better than C-9 this week.  Perhaps not.  LOL isn't transitive.   But whatever happens this week, C-9 was the better team last week.   If we judged teams by who they Almost beat, Vanderbilt would be #1 in the SEC.  That's what losing teams do.  They Almost beat teams they were in the game to beat.  And they just flat out lose other games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Magnus","date":"2017-10-11T09:09:06.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The fact that C9 is able to capitalize on the mistakes of other teams while not having the same done to them makes them good.

It's a new week.  I certainly like IMT's chances.  But nothing is assured for anyone.     Regardless of what happens, I'll be glad as an IMT fan.  We were rebuilding.  And to make worlds... well everything now is just icing on the cake.  Didn't even expect to be here.  And here we are with a good chance to get out of groups.   \n\nBut credit to C9 too.  They didn't do well against the Korean team but took care of business the rest of the way last week.  Here's hoping they do it again.  \n\nAs for TSM, if IMt makes it out in second,  it is in our interest for TSM not to get first.   That way we have a chance at a team we know we can play with whereas if TSM comes out in first, we're probably going to see SKT or RNG......  RNG is a very tall order for Cody.  And SKT is a tall order across the board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2017-10-11T09:42:34.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you're being way too optimistic about NA's chances, looking at your posts in this thread. It is good to be confident in your region, but you also have to look at the games rationally.\n\nYes I admit C9 is good at capitalizing the mistakes of other teams, but that doesn't necessarily make them a good team. I believe you have to be proactive and dare to make plays to be considered good, otherwise you only win because the other team isn't good enough. If AHQ runs in 2v4 or 1v4 immediately followed by another 1v4, you can hardly praise C9 for capitalizing on that. Even a bronze team can win 4v1 if the enemy just mindlessly runs in.\nIf in a soccer match you win with 1-0, because someone from the other team kicked the ball into his own goal, would this mean that the winning team is good? No. As teams become better, they will make less mistakes, therefore the chances of C9 winning greatly reduce. \n\nOn multiple occassions have you said IMT almost beat LZ, but this is a bit far-fetched if you look at the match realistically. Korean teams are generally late game focused teams, so it really isn't weird that another team may have a gold/kill lead over them pre-20 minutes.\nLZ won with the baron they got, lets consider the standing before they took the baron. IMT were up 1.5k gold at 25 minutes and turret score was even. In no way was IMT in a prime position to close out that game. Once LZ got the baron, they closed out the game within 5 minutes, a game that was dead-even at that point. This says a lot about LZ, and even more about IMT. They got completely run over.\n\nYou make NA teams out to be way better than they actually are, and you put too much focus on individual games. BO1 games are very diffent from BO3 and BO5s. Just because a team makes it out of groups doesn't mean they have a serious shot at winning Worlds.\nMSF have looked rather impressive in their games, and they may make it out of groups. But in no way do I expect them to have any serious chance at winning Semi-finals (and then only if they get lucky with their Quarterfinals matchup).","replies":[{"poster":"Rathimas","date":"2017-10-11T14:39:12.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LZ with a baron to end game is what good teams do at that point in game.

But why not have wishful thinking? C9 beat EDG, a team that was legitimately one team fight away from winning against SKT, and they made it look easy. Sure C9 was dismantled by SKT in their game against each other, but that is to be expected when you consider that C9 had just come off an undefeated run through play-ins where they highlighted their weaknesses and became arrogant. I think that with the staff that C9 has, they could easily overcome that one loss and compete against SKT. And then you look at IMT who almost won against Longzhu. Their game against LZ was close enough to say that given another chance IMT might take a game off of the top seeded Korean team. If that doesn't speak for how over hyped Korea is currently, and how NA is not actually light years behind Korea, than I don't know what will. Perhaps an NA team winning worlds?

About C9 being arrogant, IMT have another chance etc etc. these are all hypothetical and most likely a little bit of of influence by bias. IMT has an early game lead yes but Fnatic also has an early game lead and was extremely close to winning against IMT and Fnatic got smashed in 20 min by Longzhu. I look at empirical facts and the fact is Korea has been untouchable in he last few years and NA has been probably one of the worst performing region at worlds. Korea is not overhyped lol they are just that good and their resume shows for it. I think you are way overrating NA just from a game or 2. The fact that this is the first time NA has looked decent in an international tournament makes you think they will be better than Korea.? And we only have maybe 1 or 2 matches of sample size between NA and KR this words. You know Korean teams have all lost 1 or 2 games in the first week of past worlds including SKT and in the end still smashed every region right? At this point looking just at factual evidence NA isn't close to Korea. At this point there isn't even an evidence to support if NA will ever surpass Korea. Based on a couple of BO1s? Korea has more talent and better overall infrastructure to NA its really not disputable. Like I said right now in terms of of potential I think China is the most likely to topple Korea based on the player base and how big league is over there. Jatt even said he's surprised China hasn't at least matched with Korea with their resources.

That is if we're talking nothing but relevant numbers here. But obviously that isn't the case because in your own argument you used speculation. Largely irrelevant information all round, including from me, but the difference is I never claimed not to have bias or speculation and you tried to use \"That's just hypothetical\" as an argument to discredit my own opinion. Of course it's hypothetical and speculation influenced by my own bias towards a region! That's the whole point of guessing who will win! That's why pick-ems exist! It's not to provide who had the best non-empirical analysis of worlds, it's to see who's bias is more based in reality. Sure this isn't pick-ems, but the whole point of arguing is to entertain the urge to root for your favorite teams. And those out there saying \"If you look at the data of x,y,z games than you can clearly see that SKT etc. win in yada yada circumstances\" but realistically that is nothing more than an educated guess on how a team will preform. Remember that every team at worlds is formed by people, and people will always make mistakes. In theory and in practice any team can win worlds, except for those already mathematically eliminated. If you want 0 bias, 0 speculation, 0 hypothetical, and only what can be 100% proven fact, all you're going to find are the amount of wins and losses each team has and player scores. Other than that you will find absolutely nothing in regards to what makes each teams better, not without including bias anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"korean dog","date":"2017-10-11T21:01:41.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Sure C9 was dismantled by SKT in their game against each other, but that is to be expected when you consider that C9 had just come off an undefeated run through play-ins where they highlighted their weaknesses and became arrogant.

And even in your hypothetical argument there are holes. IMT won early game against Longzhu, yes but Fnatic also won Early game against IMT almost winning the game and Longzhu smashed Fnatic in 20. How do you explain that then? There are no transitive property in league random variables can happen with BO1s. Thats why  I look at history and recent results SKT and Korean teams have shown to be more dominant in all stages of the competition while NA hasn't even made it past quarters ever. In fact before C9 won a Bo5 in Play ins. NA has not won A SINGLE BO5 at worlds since SEASON 1. Thats not hypothetical thats fact. You can discount history all you want as you can use the \"history doesn't matter only the past week matters.\" But history has shown time and time again Korea is the premier region and until that changes no argument of NA being better is ever close to being valid. These are irrelevant information you say? You're just being ignorant if you don't think these are relevant arguments as oppose to \"Oh NA has done well the first week of words so........NEXT YEAR THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE BEST!\" What \"relevant\" information do you have to support that bro?\r\n\r\nWhat part of Korea has dominated the past tournaments and NA has done nothing except win a few games this tournament is hypothetical? That is fact. You initiated a very controversial point that NA will surpass Korea and so far have shown nothing factual to back that up. I said Korea has lost games in the group stages of BOTH MSI(2016) and worlds(2013,2016)  in the past and still dominated the rest of the way. That is not hypothetical it is also a fact. So basically you just pointed out a beyond ridiculous statement that NA will dominate with no evidence to suggest any of it. You're entitled to your opinion but its no denying how far fetched and unrealistic it is. Last year doesn't affect this year true but it still much more reliable than for you to just say NA will be the premier region based off one week of groups.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
