You gutted him, and gutted him hard. There was 2 years of input from Aatrox mains on the boards, and you decided to ignore all of it.\n\nHe needs 5 stacks to get Blood Rush right? Okay, but all of his abilities are on a long cool down, and using Blood Price for the stacks means you aren't healing. The only buff his healing got was is it is higher now over 50 percent then previously. So basically in order to benefit from the healing you have not be using your now nerfed bonus damage, and also won't be getting stacks.\n\nFurthermore, the blood well drains faster than it used to. It drains immediately, and quickly. It drains WAY to fast. And because his Blood Well takes so long to fill up, if it ever drains to zero, you have no revive and its hard to quickly stack back up.\n\nHe does less damage now too, and receives less bonus Attack Speed. Even with his Blood Rush passive, that extra 29 damage at level 18 doesn't mean nearly as much as 100 percent bonus AD on top of a 200 bonus damage from his old Blood Price.\n\nIf you are going to move his damage output to his passive, it needs to be stronger. A flat 25% base damage is not enough. Put it in his W and E were it belongs. Gut the damage on his Q and lower the cool down and widen the knock up area.\n\nThis is a colossal screw up. Its not fun and its annoying.\n\nSolution? Well if we must stick with this new set up, instead of his abilities filling up 20% they should fill 25%, and the stacks should simply remain stay even out of combat or at least remain for so he can strategically stack and plan a dive. The Blood Well drains way too fast. First of all it now drains IMMEDIATELY after you stop attacking or being attacked. There should be a several second window where it doesn't drain, and then it should drain over 10 seconds. He needs a window out of combat where his passive is available.\n\nDon't kid yourselves--this was a total nerf. Either it was intentional, or it was gross incompetence, and neither one is acceptable. Riot has yet to respond to any post about Aatrox, even when it was in PBE.\n\nI just can't believe after 2 years this was the best they could come up with. A multi-billion dollar company. Very sad.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"CaliburnKing","date":"2017-03-08T19:25:26.538+0000","up_votes":103,"down_votes":49,"body":"it's not a rework. it's literally just a stop gap measure until they can give him the attention he deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"Failog","date":"2017-03-08T19:26:22.885+0000","up_votes":115,"down_votes":50,"body":"It only made him worse.

At least before I could fend for myself and it actually pushed me to become better considering aatrox is god awful this season. (I was forced to learn basically every nook and cranny about Aatrox, his match ups etc.) Now for the screw up...\r\n\r\nFirst off if you're not going to spend a lot of time in a champion then why even bother changing his kit? I mean why is Aatrox the odd ball?\r\n\r\n1.) His damage is significantly lower, it's  one of the first things I noticed. \r\n\r\n2.)His attack speed is so low even with the buff it's disgusting. Like seriously before I could get multiple autos off with botrk alone, but now I have to rely on a buff that seems awfully like darius'(Hit 5 stacks get ad and attack speed, except darius' is actually VERY useful to his kit)\r\n\r\n3.)While the buff is ALRIGHT it could be better, and it certainly doesn't match his old one. It's too hard to stack considering his cooldowns and it shouldn't decay either as quick or at all if they're going to keep his CDs the same.\r\n\r\n4.)His overall kit is kinda ruined. His w + atk speed was his strong point, the new heal is good don't get me wrong but his blood price does nearly nothing. Q also needs to have a non interrupt, like for real it's annoying and should be a thing already(It's basically malphite ult but not as strong? In a way)\r\n\r\nNow for the changes that I would like to see since they most likely won't revert him.\r\n\r\n1.)His passive...it needs a lot of work. Why would you make his revive conditional? Like really, its the only reason Aatrox is actually played somewhat and it also makes him slightly viable.(You really can't tell me otherwise because all you really need is a good team or champion. Take fiora for example, that lane is HORRENDOUS for Aatrox.)Anyways moving on...something I noticed while discussing with a few friends is that, his new passive stack and buff is awfully similar to Darius'. This would be great if he totally didn't rely on it to actually do something. Like DarkRaygnar already said, it's WAY too difficult to stack and it decays in an instant. Either buff the passive to have it scale by HP or per level or reduce the number of stacks to 3-4(1 Q, 1-2 Blood price, 1 E).\r\n\r\n2.)Passive attack speed either scales with the bars or you bump his actual attack speed stat up. (Even with atk speed runes and masteries I get 0.91 at lvl 2, before I could easily hit 1.16 or higher depending on my setup).The reason why his attack speed is so important is because it allows him to proc W more, and guess what? Its also his sustain. \r\n\r\n3.)I honestly have no clue how to fix new blood price cause it's all types of bad lmao, but I guess you could bump up the flat ad #'s. \r\n\r\nLast but not least...either revert E to magic or change ult to physical as well. I don't understand the logic behind changing one but not the other... Also E actually did a lot of damage early on in the game considering it was magic\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems like you guys are trying to make Aatrox a tank of some sort, kind of like darius?\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was pretty disappointed to see my old main get changed but for the worse. There's a lot of work needed to make him great again. Also please please please, there's no one better to ask for a champions changes then the community themselves, better yet ask someone who MAINS the champion. Most people will complain about this and that but don't actually understand how to counter that particular champion\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"LichKing234","date":"2017-03-09T03:17:47.801+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"also fellow aatrox main i havent gotten a chance to play aatrox well this version yet im glad i didnt cause i would have been disappointed, ty fellow aatrox mains {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}  ","replies":[{"poster":"Kogeki","date":"2017-03-09T03:49:32.087+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no kidding.

Not making changes to him as he was before made him untouchable for buff/nerf as far as riot was concerned. Another words it was always going to be a lose/lose situation should they have tried to do buffs/nerfs in the condition prior to these changes. That is literally what riot has said about these changes.\"In Patch 7.5, we decided to roll up our sleeves and do what we could to make Aatrox more safely tuneable. \". So the changes were intended to allow riot to watch in competitive game modes to see how these changes can be adjusted to make him a better champion with the existence of the new/reworked champions. Does this make him playable? Yes, though not the way he used to be played. Aatrox mains will unfortunately have to relearn how to engage and farm with him, but honestly with the abilities of new/reworked champions he was gradually being left in an uplayable position, or at the very least not in a position that riot could touch up with updates. Everyone needs to realize that balancing a champion takes a lot of effort and TIME. The effort has been done with these changes now all it needs is time so that the balancing can take effect. His passive drain? That is something that can be addressed in a later patch depending on what needs to be adjusted. Simply stating it needs to be \"X\" solves nothing. Playtime in competitive settings will allow players and riot to see how adjustments could sway one way or the other vs the 100+ champions vs items. Remember very clearly. This was a change only to make him able to be adjusted. Nothing more. It is not intended to be a buff/nerf in any way shape or form.

Maybe its because because I'm incompetent but I don't understand why they tend to make changes that will slightly change the champion to where they want him later instead of just putting it where they want his numbers to be.","replies":[{"poster":"TSM LuigiTheBoss","date":"2017-03-08T22:32:20.514+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah and the change made no sense dude instead of fixing what was wrong with the current kit oh here's lets take away how it originally worked and here's a whole new main mechanic of his kit with a set of problems to find and like i'm just like... bruuuuuuuh why????","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-03-08T22:48:28.244+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im a level 7 Aatrox jungle, I can't play jungle anymore.

I was just trying it out and whoever came up with his whole blood well and passive rework should not be allowed to rework a champ ever again. So basically to get your blood rush activated you need to e, q and then auto attack **9 TIMES** with blood price on. I could maybe see this working in lane where you can stack your blood price autos off minions and then engage but as a jungler the stacks drop off before you can get to a lane. So when ganking you literally have to q and e and then auto attack 9 times while not healing to get your passive up especially since his abiliteis cooldowns are so long, unless you have your ult but then you still have to auto 6 times. Plus they fall of so quick that a a champ like lb or ekko lets say could dash away and let them fall off and then jump back in pop you and your passive is junk. This literally makes no sense to me.

I understand this is essentially a band-aide to fixing the overall issues with Aatrox, but for the time being you have neutered this champion beyond belief. I used to absolutely love him, and would concede to the fact that what you described about getting out ahead and becoming a god through insane lifesteal could at times be broken. This was the solution though? Why throw a half-assed attempt at a temporary solution. You would have been better off deactivating him while you worked on his issues as compared to this... I believe that's exactly what was done with GP, but I could be remembering wrong.

Some games the only way to stop a few players are those Anti-heal items as you mentioned, Executioner was missed when it was gone and Morellonomicon doea not seem to be enough but it helps. I disagree completely. Some some champs are built for x(rapid lifesteal), and you have to build in response to it not stick to the same script. Not all champs take ignite, but it seems to be making its way back. If you don't want to build it get the support to build it, but you better hope they don't get exploded first.","replies":[{"poster":"Itsbeghdev","date":"2017-03-08T19:59:24.365+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it's not like anti-heal items are strictly necessary against drain-tank champions, or that they completely nullify them. If Aatrox is massacring your team faster than you can even target him anti-heal items aren't going to fix that, but if he's able to survive prolonged dives without melting you all that fast, then anti-heal items are going to help. If Swain is walking through a fight with impunity, you can certainly make him a lot more vulnerable when he does that if you cut his sustain, but that won't stop him from landing his basic abilities at range, or outputting his ult damage from safety. Self-healing is never the only strength of a champ, nor is cutting it their only weakness.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ÎnsidiouŠ","date":"2017-03-08T23:33:18.293+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"DarkRaynger is right, but too kind. Who in the hell thought this would help? What were  they smoking? His blood well only stays full a few seconds. So now his passive is useless. Its a pasiive-less passive. So how ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO GET BACK IN A GAME WITHOUT YOUR DMG WORKING or your passive? How are you supposed to gank and roam when your well goes dry in a few seconds or if you use your slow in combat? What he needed was early game survivability so he could use lane pressure against more matchups. If your well does not stay full how are you ever supposed to play against the burst of Xerath, or Syndra's/Lux 1 R and u dead? Why would you nerf a champ that is NEVER played in high level play? Why would you make him useless for climbing in rank? He needs that burst dmg even to lane when he gets a chance due to someone backup. Now he has no chance to catchup farm or reset a lane. He is an assassin not a tank. Who the heck tested any of this? one bot game is enough to tell you that you totally screwed this. Everyone associated with approving and designing this change needs to be walked out of the building forever. And BS he never healed through \"anything but a whole teams focused dmg.\" CC killed him, it's the latest thing from Q branch in case you design morons never heard of it. Your design team  needs to stop mimicking your worst on the planet support team.
