I really don't think that someone should have any doubt about the top three teams in this tournament - NJWS, Samsung White and Samsung Blue. Only thing I disagree with in this list between these teams is that Blue wins instead of White..

Season 4 the best of the weaker teams split off and joined the other teams making not just a top2-3 and forget everyone else but now every team had a chance. Plus newcomer LMQ worked their way up and was another top competitor. From week one it was hard to say who was going to be the top 3 and who were gonna be the bottom 3. Every team looked so much better and cloud 9 staying the same wasnt the lone powerhouse. This made every match count and I would guess even raised the standards of cloud 9.

Its especially insulting to have NJWS over EDG/Alliance/TSM/C9/Fnatic/OMG. NJWS had a good run in playoffs, but their regular season simply doesn't back up their ability to play at that level consistently.\n\nAnd, let's not forget, Samsung was hyped as one of the favorites to win last year, one of the \"top three teams in the tournament\" and didn't even leave groups. Finished in the bottom half of the tournament.

And why thats incorrect is because Korea plays with Circuit points and Samsung won their first circuit tournament (early S3) while it was in favour of Dade's meta with ryze mid and ori and stuff like that. As the season went on, it shifted towards the assassin mid meta and we all know who that favoured.. players like bjerg, faker, shiphtur excelled in that playstyle. So since Samsung won the first circuit, they had enough points to automatically qualify for worlds even tho they lost the summer and regional tournament going into worlds. So in fact dade was playing on a cahmp pool that he was very uncomfortable with. \r\n\r\nAnd now back to this year, just like last year.. SKT won the first circuit tournament (spring) in Korea which gave them the 500 points, but because the other teams had more points they were unable to make it. and in regionals this year SKT fell to other teams such as the samsung teams as well as NJS. And youre wandering why? Well atm u can see that even in the NA/EU scene, Ori and Ryze mids have come back into play. Gragas is no longer playable at mid. Zed is still viable but not as popular anymore compared to yasuo. teams started coming out with poke comps like using ziggs and Xerath and these are all NOT champs that we know faker for.

What happened last year was an unfortunate event of Samsung's head coach leaving as well as sudden patch change nerfing Dade's champion pool. That's why Riot no longer do sudden patch changes and let players adapt before the patch takes place. Also, Najin White Shield beat SKT T1K which destroyed Fnatic, C9, OMG, TPA at All Stars and KTB went undefeated during IEM. That's why they placed the Korean teams at top 3. Also, yes there is a chance of a Korean team just tilting as what happened last year however for that to happen it's a small chance. For example, Samsung had to go through those 2 changes JUST for them to make it to top 3 of their group. You argue other regions improved. Korea wasn't jerking off and did nothing to improve themselves. They also improved at a big rate. Right now Koreans are forced to improve all the time because teams are getting hungrier in OGN.

C9 also seem to be doing better and better with every international tournament they participate in.

This is a world championship, where everything's on the line. If you have no experience on a big stage then you probably won't be able to deal with all the pressure, and it's very easy to go on tilt.
