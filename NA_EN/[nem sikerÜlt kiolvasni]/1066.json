Bengi barely played (Aside from the insanely clutch matches in the Semi/Finals) and then we have MADLIFE coming in at the support role.... LOL... like who voted for him? His team got relegated at the end of the Summer Split... literally the only reasons why he is going is only because his name is probably the only Support Champion in the LCK that NA fans recognize.... and now my biggest complaint would be Pray winning over Bang in the ADC position. Once again... Pray is NOT as good of an ADC as Bang... Bang has proved countless times through insane Solo Kills that Pray just doesn't have what it takes... again NA fans literally just voted for Pray because of that stupid Ashe Arrow that was popularized at worlds... First of all it was Bang who started the Ashe Meta at worlds in case people forgot.. LOL Mouse winning over Marin as well in the LPL... but I don't really care that much tbh.....

I think the reason he got picked is due to his streaming. He is funny and has lot of fans in Korea. \r\nAlso, Bengi getting picked over peanut is no surprise. Bengi is much more popular than peanut in Korea. I'm pretty sure majority of Korean votes went to \"Beng the jungle god gi\" or the \"Beng the rift god gi\" \r\n\r\nBut seriously Mouse over Marin and Looper?
