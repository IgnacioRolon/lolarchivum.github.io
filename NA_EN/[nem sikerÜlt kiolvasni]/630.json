The only problem is FW's competition seems to become weaker at the moment with Karsa not joining another LMS team and Westdoor most likely retiring and while his counterpart is good(Chawy) he seems to never really deliver when it counts.  \n  I still gotta stay with **Flash Wolves** winning the LMS yet again most likely.  \n\n                                                                      LPL\nThe thing about RNG that I'm annoyed about is Firefox the coach for RNG seems to have taken the backseat to Heart a former SSB player and from his compared to Firefox's coach record as really been horrible.  Heart has literally destroyed the once Worlds 2015 LGD team that was coached I believe by Firefox and turned it into a joke in the LPL.  So replace a guy that took not only 1 team to Worlds but two that both really had no real business being at such tournament(LGD 2015 and IMay 2016) and replace him with Heart instead.  \n  Another thing is RNG replacing MLXG with Karsa really makes no sense as MLXG is a better jungler than Karsa in my opinion.  \n\n  Will RNG win the LPL?  Not 100% sure honestly but if I had to say I would have to go with one of these three instead of RNG( Bilibili Gaming, Edward Gaming, and Team World Elite)  \n  Edward Gaming will most likely not figure it's roster in time and so won't win LPL 2018 Spring with Ray joining from C9 and what Clearlove might do(retire or not) as well as Iboy looking to be replaced.  \n  I gotta go with the hot hand to win the LPL and that's **Team World Elite**\n\n                                                                 EU \nOh god, I have no idea mainly because more than 60% of the players are either rookies, no-names or just lacking that \"IT\" factor to their resume.  \n  Team So4 has Nukeduck and with him, you can kiss any chance at winning EU goodbye considering he hasn't been relevant since 2012 it seems.  Good group with talent but the team could implode as Nukeduck has an attitude of sorts and with SO4's coach being Krepo there could be fireworks if Nukeduck or anyone/fans etc mention Krepo's recent history.  Point is this team \"could\" be decent. \n\nTo me, EU will come down to four teams(Fnatic, G2, Splyce and a darkhorse Roccat to win the 2018 Spring Split)\n  With Splyce accruing Nisqy from team NV, I think he will lead Splyce to the Eu Finals against........ G2 Esports and the winner will be **Splyce Gaming**\n\n                                                               NA \n1...2...3...4..5...6...7...8...9...10......Why stop there...11 straight NA Finals for Team Solomid because why not!  \nThe biggest problem with TSM is honestly Bjergsen but with the recent coaching change from Parth to Ssong who coached Rox Tigers but was also a player(mid) back in the day(Najin Sword) he could potentially teach Bjergsen on how to actually win outside of NA but it will have to start with NA first.  TSM will most likely face Ssong's old teammate from their Najin Sword days and that's Team Liquid's coach Cain who back in the day supported Pray(Longzhu adc). \n   Winner of North America **Team Liquid**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrampledByWeed","date":"2018-01-14T07:50:06.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"setting NA back 2 hours is beyond dumb as fuck. now games wont get over until 10 or later depending on game length. if anything it should be moved up to 2 hours. fuck EU fans that want to watch NA... really we had two separate streams for NA teams last year but we have to worry about EU fans not being able to watch NA is beyond ridiculous.
