They want people to be able to main either champ in solo queue without being disappointed or screwed if they don't get their match to duo with, but to still be obviously stronger with that pairing compared to other pairings, for example Xayah and Rakan will be a better pairing than Xayah and Braum but Xayah and Braum will not be an inherently weak pairing it'll just have certain tradeoffs.\nI hope that answers your questions, so far I'm stoked about Rakan, I'm a support main and this is the kind of support I've been waiting for. lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ye Ole E Money","date":"2017-04-04T19:32:24.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can Xayah's ult let her wallhop?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seíshín","date":"2017-04-04T19:08:45.236+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What Is The Best Build For Xayah And What Do There Release Day Skins Look Like?\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Thrax The Red","date":"2017-04-04T19:30:30.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here is what the Release Skins look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ExCeeN8ZuI&feature=youtu.be)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChiliHotFries","date":"2017-04-04T19:06:59.881+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you take inspiration from {{champion:103}} when making xayah?\nAlso her kit looks more like a ranged assassin mid don't you think?\nIn all realness she looks dope :D\n\nAlso what do you think their ip and rp prices will be?","replies":[{"poster":"Vali Odynson","date":"2017-04-04T19:11:59.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't have the required get out that an assassin needs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigDaddyBrazzer","date":"2017-04-04T19:26:56.014+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":3,"body":"xayah is gonna be more of a jungle assassin adc than a actual adc and if rakan is in the game well believe they will show up in yr lane a lot\r\n ","replies":[{"poster":"Hungry Cancer","date":"2017-04-04T20:14:34.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has to setup considerably to do much damage, so she won't be quite as roam heavy as say a twitch, she's really built to control a lane; kinda like Zyra if you move away from your zone of control you'll be at a disadvantage until you setup the feathers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hiphopcantstop","date":"2017-04-04T21:20:09.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they can recall together does that means they can teleport to turrents together?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Potáto","date":"2017-04-04T21:12:49.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of the two champions synergy, better then thresh kalista who have good synergy, but their kits are made for each other, literally.
