So I'm gonna go ahead and explain briefly why the masses shouldn't get so upset if their favorite champ doesn't get a skin.\r\n\r\n{{champion:201}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:157}}  Are very new to the roster... Give them some time and be patient...\r\n\r\n{{champion:154}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:121}}  and even {{champion:222}}  Seem to have more complex rigs and animations, therefore would require tons more effort and bug-testing to get a skin to look good and play well. And if they did, they would likely be more expensive. Anyone with any sort of knowledge of game design, animation, and rigging could see that... I don't even play Kha'Zix and I see it.\r\n\r\nSome champs like {{champion:99}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:81}}  and {{champion:76}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:19}}  Have simple designs that can be categorized in one of two ways: Humanoid or Animal-shaped... Its a little easier to think of and design skins for these champs cause it could be as simple as a change of clothes or subspecies (Like Safari {{champion:51}}  or Tundra {{champion:19}} ) But that is much more of a difficult process if the champion doesn't fall into those specific groups as easily as the others like {{champion:161}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:31}} ...They're designs are so different that the process for champs like these will end up being a bit slower and more difficult\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** Quit pitching a fit about every skin release that you think someone else needed more.... You are not the Riot Skin team.... Get over it\r\n\r\nP.S. Riot, I love the new skins, They look incredible.
