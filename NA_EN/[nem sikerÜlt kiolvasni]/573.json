Beside the jungle, the path stretched from crop to home, but lately he’d found himself a companion on his long trek: a song, drifting through the woods with the cool fall breeze. He’d always ignored his curiosity before – pulled his hood up and marched on home – but this time… it was different. It was calling to him. The boy paused, peering into the mighty woods beside him. Without thinking, he dove into the trees.\r\nThe song filled him, pulling him through the brush. Thorns and nettles clawed at him, tearing through his clothes and ripping his flesh as he sped through the woods. Louder still, the melancholy voice sung.\r\nFinally, he burst through the undergrowth and fell into an open grove, there he saw the face of the voice, the ghastly yet awe inspiring performance of penta-kill, the song that was soothing was but a mere ploy to draw in an audience for the this once in a lifetime performance.  After the set including songs like light bringer, and deathfire grasp, the boy and the rest of the audience roared, heads jerking, fists pumping, it was not enough, encore.  With the call for one more rising, the band responded with its true finale, the final song of the night and for the audience, well, its once in a lifetime for a reason, for those who listen to the final song will die, after experiance the power, and non shall survive the metal of Requim.-press r-","replies":[]},{"poster":"JFRANKSTA","date":"2014-06-02T18:41:17.229+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"*and then sex happened","replies":[{"poster":"The Rat King","date":"2014-06-02T18:59:25.606+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"no and he was killed\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Arddun","date":"2014-06-02T19:12:09.886+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, sex *is* more likely, believe it or not.
