We've used a chat channel for game coordination and setting up groups for ~4 years, and it contains anywhere between 40 and 100 people at all times of the day with a total group of like 200-300 that use it. Being able to just mass invite the channel when you want to start a game is super helpful for a plethora of reasons, and avoids the huge hassle of everyone having to individually manage their friends list and update it for the rotating group of people who are actively playing League.\r\n\r\nIf you force this change through, it effectively cuts our community in half if not worse and totally bars entry for new people. The cap on clubs needs to go way, way up especially if the number is for permanent members and not just total online members.","replies":[{"poster":"MyFaceIsAPotato","date":"2016-03-08T21:43:49.302+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is BY FAR the most important thing I've read in these comments, and needs to be brought to riot's attention ASAP. There are so many good MMO games that cripple themselves for no reason with stupidly small group caps like this, and it's just sad.\r\n\r\nIt also seems weird to me that, after all this pushing for player to find a group of friends to play with this season, over the soloq experience of old seasons. WHy not go all the way and opt for giant clans of non-toxic players grouping together, like old the old school big MMOs had? If the solution to toxicity is sticking with player you like, why not let good players create legit communities within league, rather than limit a group to the most somebody could know outside of the game? I honestly hope more of the community speaks out about this before it just becomes an accepted part of the whole clubs deal, because as long as they do, I have good faith riot do something sweet with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iqqi","date":"2016-03-09T14:31:35.994+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree. the 49 limit is just way too small. I am also part of a large chat group and we use the invite system to find like minded people to play with. This change would make this system completely useless. There is no point to have a limit on the size let alone one so very small. HUGE mistake.
