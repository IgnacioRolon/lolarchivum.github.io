You don't need to change the region since the link unless your account isn't on NA, so you should be fine to signup there. Check out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for more details on how the system works.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heavy Machinery","date":"2016-11-21T10:13:47.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont use your NA account on the PBE, you create a new one using the form on that webpage you linked in your post. Then if you're selected you will get a download link to the PBE client and you use your newly created account to log in\n\nA PBE account (last time I checked) is automatically level 30 and has huge amounts of IP and RP so you dont have to worry about grinding to unlock things or anything like that","replies":[]}]}
