If they are made every few patches, then they become less prestigious and just who has more time to play league all year. If this prestige skin is bought only with money, then it falls into the money = prestige that skins kind of already are.\n\n\nEdit: A little extra thoughts,\nThe skins seemed prestigious for two reasons. The first is that they are released to celebrate a cool event , the second is that you have to play a lot for them during that event. The K/DA skins made sense, they were part of the biggest event of last year. K/DA Akali was thrown into the snowdown event to catch the tail of the K/DA wave. The bloodmoon skins and firecracker skins are old skinlines, if Riot can make bloodmoon and lunar events seem as cool as K/DA event, then they deserve the prestige status, if they don't, then prestige skins will seem less prestigious and more like the gold character and ability chromas they already are. \n\nI dunno if this makes sense or if it is a twitch chat BabyRage type of complaint. I just hope that they are tied to game events and that they are spread out a bit more than 4 in four months. Not every event needs a prestige skin, but if it does get one, make it count.","replies":[{"poster":"ﬁghter","date":"2019-01-08T20:16:25.954+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":49,"body":"Also, skins always cost money, I don't understand your money argument...","replies":[{"poster":"CithriaC","date":"2019-01-08T21:00:10.973+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"The prestige skins purchase option shouldn't only be money thing.

If this skin ended up as a purchase only thing, then the theme of them being bought with time is broken, and the only thing that would separate them from the rest of the skins is cost. \n\nThe only thing that makes them prestige is the fact that time is needed to get the skins without paying $250. If they are only bought with money, the only thing that makes them 'prestige' is that more money is need to buy them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ﬁghter","date":"2019-01-08T20:15:30.854+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":43,"body":"These are a fun incentive to keep on playing.

Shame too since I remember back when they were opposed to any lootbox or special prestige stuff. The only thing they had was Limited Edition (skins never coming back after X time) and Legacy skins (skins that come back every so often). They then brought back almost every single Limited Edition skin and keep coming up with new things to get money over having good content.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HightowerWarden","date":"2019-01-10T04:40:51.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I dislike the prestige skins being able to be bought at all.

If you do introduce a few chromas for the blood moon selection, why not do it for all the blood moon skins? The entire point is that it's a blood-red moon.
