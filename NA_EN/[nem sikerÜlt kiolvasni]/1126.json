Recently C9 was very inconsistent, and being that inconsistent, they can't really be considered one of the best teams worldwide.

C9 is extremely inconsistent at the moment, and won't perform better until either: 1. Hai performs better, 2. Hai's shot-calling gets better, or 3. C9 replaces Hai.\r\n\r\nWho else is there that's performing much worse than expected? BalIs isn't doing terribly. Meteos is still top 3 junglers in NA. Sneaky is proving that he's much more than just a support-style AD, and closing in on becoming best NA ADC; and because of that, there's no way you drop Lemon and mess with the bot lane chemistry. Thus, Hai's clearly the weak link of the team. ","replies":[{"poster":"pyroHedge","date":"2015-02-19T00:01:59.362+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hai is far from the weakest link for C9. If we look at their most recent loss against Winterfox, Hai was up 10 CS despite roaming twice and being in a disadvantageous matchup, and his shot calling got the team a commanding lead. It was only a couple of poor team fights that killed them, and fight-misplays are not Hai's fault.\r\n\r\nHai regularly agrees to bad matchups that benefit his team, buys and places more wards than any other mid laner, roams continually, and still somehow manages to sometimes win lane and carry a game. We hear all the time that \"C9 likes trying to get Balls going\" or \"they've really focused the bottom lane recently\" but I never hear \"Meteos is baby sitting the mid lane\" like I hear for other (legitimately) stand out mid laners like Bjergsen.\r\n\r\nGiven Hai's focus towards the team over himself, it should come as no surprise that the rest of his team's performance is among the best in NA. They are, of course, legitimately great players in their own right, but the extra warding, warding, and map pressure Hai regularly exerts cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nMoreover, every team that plays C9 says \"we win if we can keep Hai down.\" If Hai is really the weakest link then C9 should do better when the opposing team puts extra pressure mid and allows the top and bot to carry. But that's not what happens with C9. There's no other player in the LCS that is more indicative of his team's success than Hai.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the fact that every time C9 loses it's apparently Hai's fault. I don't understand that at all. What other team has a player that everyone blames for literally every loss?\r\n\r\nC9 have some serious issues to work out, certainly, but we can't forget either that they had the best showing of any non-Chinese, non-Korean team at Worlds last year. And that's when Hai was legitimately struggling. Maybe it's just time for C9 to go back and say \"let's get Hai to carry.\" That's actually what they did in their first season when Sneaky was more of a carry-support, and it remains their best season. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised that the further they've moved away from Hai as a carry the more they've struggled.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoo","date":"2015-02-19T16:32:25.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I haven't felt Cloud 9 suffering from play or strategy. Looking back on 3 of their 4 losses this year and I felt they had a pretty lousy pick/ban phase.  The game's they've won they brought more hard engage and were the aggressors most of the game.  The game's they've lost they've seemed to bring more late game team comps.\r\n\r\nLately, I think Meteos is having a bit of a time adjusting to new jungle paths and so he's not providing the pressure and snowball that he used to. It would be nice to see the old Ashe Zyra come back to the bot lane, but it seems the winning teams of late have learned C9's old strategy.  Right now the current meta favors aggressive team composition and C9 just seem to be behind that curve.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-02-18T03:05:45.407+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why is any Taiwan team above UOL, they are a pretty weak region.
