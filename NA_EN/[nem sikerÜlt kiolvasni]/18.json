I immediately change my password and am able to do so. Nothing has shown up on lolking about other games played or on my bank of any charges being made.\r\n\r\nI tried to login on the website but NO REGION AT ALL seems to have my account. Same with the client, every other region says \"Incorrect or invalid login info\" But for NA it says \"This account's region changed. Login to appropriate region.\r\n\r\nI have already sent a ticket to riot but it's been 3 days and still no info. I really want this fixed. \r\n\r\nI checked to see if other people were also suffering from this issue and 2 other people on reddit posted about this in the past 5 days. And on here it seems other people have posted too but no one seems to be able to help us.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-04-11T20:58:19.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you confirm with me what your Summoner Name is and the Region you are supposed to be on are?

If you already submitted a ticket, be sure not to bump that ticket by replying before you get a Riot response. Riot Player Support will get back to you as soon as they can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valhalis","date":"2016-04-11T21:24:47.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my summoner name is Sykhotic","replies":[{"poster":"Valhalis","date":"2016-04-11T21:26:18.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to create a second account just to read my tickets","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Smith1818","date":"2016-04-12T23:28:19.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're still willing to check, my Summoner Name is Alchemist919 on NA server\n\nI can't reply because like I said, it says my account was moved to another region, this doesn't let me login to the website either and apparently I have to be a higher level to reply to threads.
