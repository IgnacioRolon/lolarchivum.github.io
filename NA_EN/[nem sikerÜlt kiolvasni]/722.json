Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.\" I agreed and at 21 I have never touched a cigarette.

That'd be really cool and would make for some really interesting shroom use. Like you could place a shroom at a buff but the buff wouldn't set it off so you could just leave it there. also q being a skill shot is debatable..it might be interesing but it could also just make him frustrating to play since it could then be blocked by another champ, and trying to land the blind on master yi as he flies through the enemy team at you would perhaps be almost impossible if it were a skillshot.

The idea for his kit will never be balanced. There's just something about the concept of having virtually limitless flashes, and being able to have it on a 4 second cooldown (40% cdr)that screams OP. He doesn't have to win lane, or even come CLOSE to breaking even, because he just does anything and everything you could possibly want, whether that be split pushing with his enhanced auto attacks on turrets and never being caught for it, or being glass cannon and going in and out and destroying enemy carries with little to no risk (zhonyas and ult away), or having a tanky bruiser-ish build with ROA and IBG and being literally a garen with flash every 5 seconds, and way too much AOE damage for the ratios on his spells. In my opinion, ahri filled the niche of extremely mobile mid, and they did it in a very balanced way. She CAN be killed, she CAN be caught, and her ult is a DASH, not a flash.
