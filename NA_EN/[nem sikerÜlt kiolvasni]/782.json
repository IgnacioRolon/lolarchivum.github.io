They have a completely new lineup minus Bjergsen. The only reason why anyone should have a legitimate reason to hate on TSM is if they do not like Bjergsen personally. People are getting upset about how bad TSM is when there is only one member from last split on the team still. Also C9 isn't in because not enough fans voted for them. Fans voted on what team they wanted to see, and unfortunately for some people it may not be the team that they wish. In all honesty it doesn't matter because these players are far better than a great amount of us i mean maybe one or two people that are commenting are anywhere near the rank of them, others (like me) are low elo players that are voicing our opinions.  So no need to get upset about what teams are in because it comes down to the general public and everyones' choice when they had the chance.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcaneEmperor","date":"2015-11-20T02:23:35.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm fine with TSM being in the tournament even though I'm a C9 fan, although obviously I'd prefer it if C9 had gotten the vote.

One of the EU teams is going 1st. replacing our strongest team(UoL - FNC) and 2nd a team that hasn't even announced their squad. TSM are going to play their first official game with their squad too but UoL wouldn't even had enough time to train with their new squad.

TSM beat the 2 best teams in the world last year and were the pride and joy of NA along with Cloud9. Season 3 and 5 were the only times NA weren't proud. Season 2 we got cheated by Woong looking at the map and it caused all kinds of controversy and it cost him and is team $30,000.\n\nIf you keep moving the goalpost anything will fit what you want it to. You keep doing that and ignoring things. You said since Season 1 was EU vs EU that NA had nothing to be proud of and then don't even mention what I said about that logic meaning EU has nothing to be proud of since it was Korea vs Korea this year. You completely disregard Season one groups since NA topped them and then bring of Team Xan and that one -off win it had against TSM but fail to bring up that TSM still topped the group. You sing the praise of EU but never bring up their failures. You skip over Season 4 like it's nothing because NA did great and EU sucked. You say NA has nothing to be proud of when you're given proof they do from Season 1 and Season 4 showings. You only bring up level of competition (Team Xan) when it goes against NA but not EU. The Flash Wolves were one of the teams any team would have beaten this year in Quarters. Kabum E sports were a thing. ALL will tell you.\n\nYou're speaking nonsense and you move the goalpost whenever a fact s given to you that goes against what you want. You're never going to acknowledge that NA has done well at worlds even worth the proof of Season 1 and Season 4 staring back at you. There's no point further talking to you. You're just going to shit on NA and sing EU's praises. You'ere just going to explain away all the good NA has done at worlds even if it makes EU look bad and sing the praises of EU even if it makes NA look good. There's no point in continuing this as I've made my points and you keep moving the goalpost. You'll probably insult me or say something else but I don't care. I'm speaking to a brick wall who won't budge even when given facts. Go ahead and insult me all you want. I don't care care.
