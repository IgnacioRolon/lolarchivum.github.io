You said that you can log in to the client and website, but then later said that you're getting similar problems when attempting to log in as well.\n\nI'd double check the server when logging in/verifying your e-mail.  Usually when I see issues like this it's because the changes are being attempted on the wrong server.  If it all checks out or if you can't log in at all, go ahead and [send us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll help recover your account :D","replies":[]}]}
