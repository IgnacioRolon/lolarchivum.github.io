It takes a very long time to get to an advanced level. By that, I mean many many years. Like any skill, any sort of improvement is great even if it's small. Have a sketch book and draw often or whenever you can, especially for things you like to draw. But also try new things to push yourself. I'd recommended having a grasp on traditional art (pencil/pen) before starting off with digital art.

Basically, you'd want to have a little makeshift photo studio (have enough light in the room that you can adjust!). You can share the photos on online galleries (social media).
