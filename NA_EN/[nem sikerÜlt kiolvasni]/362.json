Passive has a ridiculous cooldown which you can't proc more than once on a tank because you'll just die, Q gets countered by a free item(oracle lens trinket) so you'll just die before you can even auto attack someone. W gets activated and rendered useless by duskblade passive, control wards, oracle lens trinket so you'll just die because you can't Q away or place a W down to fear them to get away. E same reason with Q. R, R just gets bursted down and it places 3 mini W's in an illuminati formation that would just be also rendered useless the same noted for W. I too was a Shaco main but I lost interest in the game but still play because \"theres other champions that you can play\" oh look 2/18/4 Talon we lost, 4/11/1 Rengar we lost, Xerath 13/4/9 oh we lost. Season 3 to 5 I mained top lane AP Shaco that only had to focus on my lane and see if the enemy jungler is in the top bush so I can waste their time with them standing there idling. Season 5 until now I gotta worry about control wards, oracle lens trinket, invaders, tracking the enemy jungler from skuttle crab wards, enemy laners going back to base or are they rotating to me with their duskblade, control wards, oracle lens trinket.. well.. I'm going back to watching anime because anime is better than league..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"773H","date":"2019-02-27T01:21:52.618+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice choice and good read!

Riven shouldn't deal well with tanks, but tanks are bad right now and nobody is taking them top because everyone shits on them (Too much damage, too few good tank options, lack of endgame scaling, short games, lack of any real impact on the map)\r\n\r\nRiven isn't broken.
