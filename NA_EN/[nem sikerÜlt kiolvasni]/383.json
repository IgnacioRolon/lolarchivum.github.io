We're saying the same thing in different ways. The above infographic is referring to high/low based on numeric value (i.e. 6 is the highest number) and you're using it based on seeding placement (i.e. 6th place in the lowest possible seed). Let me use an example to clarify the dynamic seeding process to make sure we're on the same page. ~~~~For example, if the 6th seed (DIG) and 3rd seed (P1) advances to Semifinals then, we'd get DIG (#6) vs. TSM (#1) and C9 (#2) vs. P1 (#3).~~ **UPDATED:** For example, if the 6th seed (DIG) and 4th seed (CLG) advance to Semifinals then, we'd get DIG (#6) vs. TSM (#1) and CLG (#4) vs. C9 (#2). \r\n~~\r\nI'll reword the description in the infographic for clarity to avoid any further confusion.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"PwnLove","date":"2017-04-03T22:18:58.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone! The #3 and #6 seeds were just two random numbers I pulled out to help illustrate dynamic seeding. I'm sorry that I made you all more confused with my implausible example (my bad!). Let me see if I can help clear everything up. \r\n\r\nAs coeurloyal pointed out below, most of the seeding is determined by the DIG vs. P1 match on Saturday:\r\n\r\nIf P1 (#3) wins then, they'll go against Cloud9 (#2) no matter what since FLY (#5) and CLG (#4) have lower placements than them from the regular season and will go against TSM.\r\n\r\n If DIG (#6) upset P1 (#3), they will be paired with TSM (#1) and the Sunday winner (CLG or FLY) will automatically be paired with C9. \r\n\r\nWe're working on updating the infographic ASAP.
