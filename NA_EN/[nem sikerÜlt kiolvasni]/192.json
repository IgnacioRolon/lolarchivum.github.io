For example let us transfer our accounts with 50% discount, and we would not be that man, I know that you have some troubles with the servers and everything, just I'm thinking, that with the discount, people wouldn't get that mad. It really sucks, that I when I came to NA, the account transfers are disabled.

I hope Riot realizes this an experience I'm going to share with others. Even if I do eventually get back into the game at this point I really don't want to involve friends and their money in a mess like this. There's been some major damage done here with their reputation for me, I'll definitely be posting about this on social media, I don't want this to be swept under the rug like they want- This is unacceptable.\n\nRiot, this is inexcusable. I've been your customer for over 7 years and this is the saddest thing I've seen yet. If I don't get get (at the very least) a free server transfer at this point I won't ever spend another dime on this game again, and I've spent well over 500 at this point, something I'm now greatly regretting.
