Like TSM and CLG would tie in points sooo who would take 2nd seed? I mean I haven't heard any of the casters talk about this in detail and I can't find a post about it so I just assume the higher placed team takes it?","replies":[{"poster":"Farmoar","date":"2016-08-26T19:39:28.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"TSM would make it in, as Summer Split points are weighted more than Spring Split. Therefore, TSM has automatically qualified for Worlds, they are playing for either 1st or 2nd seed. If TSM wins, CLG automatically qualifies for Worlds as the 2nd place seed. If C9 wins, TSM will be 2nd place seed.\r\nHope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HexaDecimel","date":"2016-08-24T14:32:23.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"TSM won the tiebreaker, never lost a best of 3 or 5 match against CLG this split which means in the event of a tie TSM would retain the higher seeding.
