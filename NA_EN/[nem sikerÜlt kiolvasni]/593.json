I usually don't write or post anything because I find no real reason for it, aside from repeating what other people have said. I log in and I notice that alot of comments seem to make fun of Sarah. The first thing I see is someone comparing Sarah to Skrillex. Yeah, I get it, similar haircuts or whatever. The thing I ask myself is, why say that in the first place? It seems to me that its a way to make fun of her, but why? All the other comments talk about her position or what it means. It just seems demeaning to me.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it is, \"Cool! We get to talk to someone involved with Riot.\" When I see her title, all I can think of is that she's probably involved with the creative process on either Champ creation or Item creation. Simple. Yet people use it or her appearance from ONE picture to define her. Which i find absolutely trivial. I just don't get it.\r\n\r\nI do understand that people like to joke around. I like the fact that the community can be very chill and laidback, but sometimes the things people say sound so... backwards. I feel that sometimes people say the things they say to get a laugh and that's understandable, but at the same time we have to realize that we are making fun of someone, just for a measly upvote.\r\n\r\nIs it really worth it?\r\n\r\nI don't think so. I've been made fun of and let me tell you, it kind of makes you feel unimportant. I don't know if you've ever been bullied, but its usually because of the way you look, sound, or act. We are all trying to find our place in this world and judging a book by its cover just seems \"prehistoric.\"\r\n\r\nI just want to say that I'm not trying to damn any of you. I want you to think about the severity of the things you say. Every action we take has consequences. So, please be wary of the things you say. Sometimes the weight of your words can be quite heavy.\r\n\r\nThank you for listening and good luck on the rift. fyi ZYRA RULES!!!!{{champion:143}} \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Snyp3r5","date":"2015-12-09T15:26:58.391+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Triggered{{item:2050}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bobjoesph","date":"2015-12-09T20:31:11.817+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"NoChill.exe","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Minifunky","date":"2015-12-08T20:46:07.144+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"curious, what concepts or w/e have you already brought to the community?\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Minifunky","date":"2015-12-08T20:46:55.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn. just read the thing imma day early\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Master Shoru","date":"2015-12-08T20:32:16.288+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:36}} < my face right now","replies":[]},{"poster":"CARROTLOL","date":"2015-12-08T20:23:05.318+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:67}}  glasses ????","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-12-08T18:33:14.254+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Not really familiar with her work.

Now, that means most skins are open to me buying them, then it just becomes an issue of which skin to get. But, there are two champions that challenged that rule and those are (were?) Vi and Jinx. My favorite style is the punk/alternative/goth style and seeing it represented in games is very exciting. The classic skins for both Vi and Jinx were extremely compelling and appealing, so I avoided all of their skins until...\r\n\r\nVi got the Debonair skin and I cannot turn down a dapper-looking Vi in a suit. She keeps the punk aesthetic while also looking very cultured and falling into a very nice looking skin series.\r\n\r\nJinx had the flapper and Firecracker skins which are both good but don't beat out that punk girl in her original design. They keep the attitude, not the outfit, which is what a skin is (we're literally buying costumes). Then they released Slayer Jinx. It's a zombie punk skin. It totally fits her aesthetic, her craziness, features new SFX, a propane tank with dynamite strapped to it for an ultimate, and other like-personalized effects.\r\n\r\nI, too, main Jinx (one of the three champs I have at level 5 mastery) and I adore the skin. It's very fun, sexy, colorful, and all those delightful things we enjoy about Jinx. I honestly don't know why it's generating so much distaste.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-08T18:15:35.855+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yay finally!
