I think they should be smarter with these nerfs for sure, but they 100% should balance around pro play. Especially since they made the game team reliant, so solo queue is a mess anyways. Keep in mind, balancing things for Pro Play trickles down balance throughout the game. Maybe Darius is op in bronze, but it's more so because people aren't experienced enough to play against a champion like that. It's more a case of \"learn/adapt\" than a case of power. Nerfing him for low elo means he won't be used in any other elo. Which is the wrong thing to do.\r\n\r\nThey have been using extremely direct nerfs to champions that are played in pro play, even if they don't need them or can be dealt with in other ways. Sej is going to be played in organized play like Pro Play as long as she's passable because she offers a lot to a team as a tank jungler that has good ganks around the map AND offers cc. So she's going to need to be gutted in order to not see play. Which uh....
