Just for the week put an outrageous IP price on the skin, like 10x. So vets with excess IP can find something to use it on. \n\nIt won't help new players at all. But it seems like one possible solution to IP sink.

Old players get the opportunity to buy some skins with ip while others have to buy with rp. If you can buy ip with rp then thats a different story.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-24T04:58:27.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, i am trying to help the community not Riot per se.

Actually it would make me happier since if I really liked a skin I could at least maybe get it, or get some cheap skins.\n\nMaybe they could have a limit pee champ or increasing price per purchase. But those limits both sound terrible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elitesam601","date":"2017-05-22T22:31:39.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Riot would lose money {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"TSE Cyborges","date":"2017-05-22T23:02:12.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"legacy skins for 20k ip xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"XNNinjaX","date":"2017-05-30T21:57:32.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can there be another {{champion:103}} sale\r\n\\","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corrupto123","date":"2017-05-27T04:01:54.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GIMME MY TYRANT SWAIN PLS RITO SENPAI\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Light Sovereign","date":"2017-05-25T15:39:40.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do these sales work for gifting?","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmperorEli16","date":"2017-05-25T13:12:54.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gift me bard","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thiief","date":"2017-05-25T02:00:29.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pentakill Yorick please!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterM1k3","date":"2017-05-24T14:41:28.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When is the May bundles?\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kshaway","date":"2017-05-23T15:09:50.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I swear, Bard is on sale practicaly every month...
