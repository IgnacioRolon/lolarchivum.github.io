I also don't think you can just straight up say Huni is better than dyrus considering he tend to get more resources put into him and Fnatic allow him to carry whereas Dyrus is kind of let to die while his team takes other objectives and gets Turtle/Bjerg going.

We saw TPA win Worlds a few years back. Say whatever you want buddy, but it still happened so a \"Cinderella\" story CAN happen.\nMaybe things are changing? Perhaps the East isn't the #1 region anymore? Probably not but if they're not in the grand finals at Worlds then we'd be force to consider it.\nThe brackets can't be fixed if everyone plays everyone and #1 vs #4 and #2 faces #3.
