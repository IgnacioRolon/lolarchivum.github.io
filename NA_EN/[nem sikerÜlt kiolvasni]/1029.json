As numerous people have pointed out, the only couter to yi is to cc and then nuke him. Allowing him to potentially get off w and reduce that burst even more than in the past is a horrible call - especially to anyone playing below plat. While individuals like myself may know how to play against him, too many don't and it makes for very unfun pub stomp games... for which you just wrote in patch notes you nerfed yorick's base mistwalker dmg growth. No sane person can think it's ok to nerf yorick damage because of \"low elo pubstomp\" while buffing yi's durability when he's far more of a pubstomp champ than yorick.\r\n\r\nGaren q nerf is far too kind to him. Other champions need to build damage to deal damage with their abilities. Compare for example garen q to renekton q... garen q with a sunfire cape will do more damage than renekton q with a cleaver. The base is too high - it should have it cut by around 1/3 with perhaps a bit more scaling ratio to compensate - reward garen for building some damage much like you reward galio damage reduction for building some ap or any of numerous other champs who need to build damage to deal meaningful damage. Considering how loaded his w is... I think this is a perfectly acceptable trade.\r\n\r\nFiora... I don't know what's wrong with you guys, but you don't seem to understand some very simple concepts. When hyperscaling champs like fiora or jax are just doing OK in laning phase, but being bullied by lane bullies, you buff them until they can trade on even terms with lane bullies w/o having to outplay anything at all. The concept of a lane bully is just that... to bully other champs in lane. They are SUPPOSED to win lane if they don't get outplayed repeatedly. They NEED that to have any chance to win. Buffing hyperscaling champs to the point they can win or go even w/o any outplay involved during laning phase is the equivalent to going... gee darius or renekton don't win late game vs a jax or fiora even if those champs make on mistake for the renek or darius to capitalize on. I guess we better double darius's passive damage and give him 20% lifesteal, give renekton stun a scaling to 3.5 sec and increase his bonus ad by 25% when he ults so they have a fair chance to compete late game. That would be utter stupidity... so why are you doing exactly that type of thing... AGAIN with hyperscaling champs in laning phase. They should lose lane to lane bullies plain and simple. Even if they get one outplay, they shouldn't be taking over the lane for the rest of the game barring major mess up or outside intervention, but that's exactly the direction you are heading with this type of buff for a champ that doesn't need one.\r\n\r\nStormrazor changes don't really do much for adc's in bot lane. They only hurt adc's in other roles who don't want multiple crit items and non-adc's who don't build additional crit. So it's a decent start, but probably not resulting in as much change as people expect it to. A bit more safety for adc who loses rush to stormrazor in bot lane too... so I guess that's nice for laning phase.\r\n\r\nWukong buff mostly helps out his jg role I think. He'll still win or lose toplane and mid much the same as he did before the attack speed buff. And perhaps that's the goal. Probably not what non-jg wukong's wanted, but at least he can have a place again. Still haven't really addressed his ability to nuke squishies mid/late from stealth... just made it so fewer people play him and he has to work a bit harder to reach that point. I don't think he's too op nor was he before the last nerf. Other champs did much the same thing as him and were left untouched for unknown reasons. It wouldn't even be an issue if adc's built a bit of defense early/mid instead of going 3 straight crit items or 4 straight, but I can't even blame them too much either because they almost have to or else they lose every adc duel and lack the same carry potential even if protected properly, so they are forced to go glass cannon and hope for the best. I think making resistances matter a bit more, toning down crit/adc dps somewhat vs champs who have resistances if the adc has no meaningful armor pen, reducing the movespeed advantage adc's get over other roles due to crit (really not ok - there's a reason melees are given more base movespeed; it makes the game fair to both parties), and in return reducing the burst potential of champs onto adc's building some durability (ga, maw, bloodthirster)into their kit so that adc's aren't 1-shot would be the way to go. I shouldn't be able to go cleaver, essence reaver, and sterak's renekton and flash 1-shot an adc with ga, bt, and zeal item; they shouldn't be able to perma-kite me and drain tank if I don't manage to 1-shot them. Give both parties a fair chance to show SKILL rather than making it a nuclear arms race like it's been for awhile now. This would also help adc's feel better about stuff like zed being in the game because they can feel ok about getting a ga to help lessen zed's 1-shot potential and make him have to do it twice to actually kill them; zed mains don't see zed nerfed for doing his job vs a squishy with no resistances.

But then I suppose you factor in the -2*7=-14 to give a total of -3 ad per walker at level 18 compared to before.\n\nJoke aside... I didn't think he was a real problem - almost never see him in toplane anymore. I know his walkers hurt if he lands his e, but think a more fair nerf might have been making them killable by one 2 aoe abilities per walker (ex: cho q plus w could clear all 4 if he hit each of them with both abilities) instead of reducing their damage. Yorick kinda needs his walkers to fight back against enemies in lane as his damage w/o them is inferior to pretty much any other bruiser. He should be rewarded for landing his e skillshot to direct his walkers.\n\nThat said, it can also be a bit too much of a pain to clear them in minion waves because their models are so small that enemy minions can block you from targeting them with auto's when they're in a minion wave. This means you have to retreat from the wave to clear them or lose a ton of hp to them. This is why I made the aoe suggestion which seems like a fair counter. While it might seem unfair to yorick, you also have to consider if his opponent uses 2 aoe spells on yorick's walkers... that's 2 abilities they can't use on him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PraySauce","date":"2018-08-29T01:13:01.843+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Yorick nerfs seem really excessive...","replies":[{"poster":"Grand Entrançe","date":"2018-08-30T23:13:44.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"shhh, we aren't supposed to know that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShoreyStory","date":"2018-08-29T11:29:06.957+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously?
