First time poster. Quick idea about bot evasion and their ability (Or rather, lack there of) to jump walls. Instead of focusing on making the bots be able to determine what walls they can hop using an ability or flash, why not designate a group of 'emergency coordinates' where the walls are thin enough to flash around the map. Right now, it appears that in 'emergency ' situations (situations where the bots take a large ammound of damage in a short amount of time) they seem to just blindly run back towards their base. Instead, I suggest they run to these 'emergency coordinstes' and use their flash or abilities to jump the wall. In this way, they don't actually need to recognize the existence of the wall, just the point that represents a way to escape if they use flash or a similar ability.  \r\n\r\nHonestly, this seems like a very simple solution that if implemented would emulate human behavior much better.

That said, this would get bots jumping over walls in at least some cases.\r\n\r\nThe hard part comes when you're trying to decide if it's a good idea to make the jump.  If a player decides to jump a wall, they often then make clever decisions about an alternate escape route.  Figuring out those escape routes and which are safe vs. not is pretty much the same problem space as getting jungling bots up and running.  Once you're in the jungle, pathing becomes much, much more complicated. Shortest paths are often not best, whether to run away or try to join up with friendly champions...the list goes much longer and with each one the potential for derpy plays gets bigger and bigger.\r\n\r\nPlayers are able to learn these decisions over many games, and eventually build mental check-lists that make reasonable decisions.  Emulating this for bots is very challenging, so we decided to focus on places where we could get more done more quickly.\r\n\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrugsWomenMoney","date":"2014-04-15T19:38:49.624+0000","up_votes":85,"down_votes":4,"body":"WTF!!

Id start the script by checking if Red buff or Blue buff is the optimal start from that champ, and have them go to each camp based off of if the camp is shown to be alive on the minimap or not. If they go to a camp thats been counter jungled, then they take a step back in the script and check which camp is next. As for ganking, they can determine if an enemy in lane is pushed past a mid point or not and take a few other factors in like their location in relation to the enemy and if its a good idea to go gank based off that information.

Adapting to enemy team play is extremely important for a jungler, and that's very challenging for bots.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we scripted that bots should do Blue->Wolves->Red->Wraiths etc, collapsing on that bot on their way to Red is very easy; a player would learn from this, making a bot learn this is very challenging.  \r\n\r\nAnother example: if bots gank extended lanes, setting traps etc becomes very easy. Again, players would learn, but bots would have trouble.  \r\n\r\nBecause of this, a jungler bot would be super fun for a few games while players figured out the patterns, but after that the predictability would be a bit of a buzz kill.\r\n\r\nIt is POSSIBLE to create jungle bots that are compelling and adaptable, but as you pointed out, it's a lot of (very fun) work.  We had to make a call where to focus, and we decided to focus on solid behaviors in broader areas.

Even though bots are still imperfect, I think it is a very good improvement compared to the old AI. :) Here are some things that I noticed about skillshot dodging:\r\n\r\nThe sidestepping is actually very, very impressive. When I was under level 20 I cannot even sidestep like that -_- and I sometimes still get pwned even now. So I think that was a really awesome change.\r\n\r\nHere's a thing though. In your particular code you mentioned: \"*is the target facing my way, yes, then dodge like a ninja*\"--- so I went into the game, and I find that bots are easily kited, since they do not bother to dodge my Q when I'm running the hell away and my champion is not facing them.\r\n\r\nAnd some other things, there is umm skillshot baiting. If bots just recently dodged a skillshot, they cannot sidestep a second skillshot. I'm sure you guys are on it ;3 \r\n\r\nBots also do not register lux ultimate as a skillshot ... yet o_o\r\n\r\nAlso maybe there are some small bugs. Garen bot ran across my tower while I'm kiting him. >_> Just a minor thing though.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, for a closing letter, thanks so much for making this change, and I really hope the feedback helps since I'm very excited about the improvements you guys are making. :3 \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nKai <3\r\n\r\n----x----\r\nDeer rito peeps,\r\n\r\nI know I should have posted it earlier but I forgot, but thanks so much for making the new support items (especially the new FQC), and nerfing all the champs that used to facepwn me xD \r\n\r\nAnd for nerfing Leona & Lulu!\r\nILY<3 \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nA Diehard Nami Fan [also,for creating this champion.]","replies":[]},{"poster":"FORESKlN JANNA","date":"2014-04-15T20:26:29.048+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will be ever be able to play intermediate bots in custom games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"kTGg8TYecZ","date":"2014-04-15T21:43:00.262+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played a bot match a while ago and noticed the bots came to lane before minions spawned.
