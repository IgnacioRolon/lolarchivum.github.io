Also garen's inability to die because of how ridiculously tanky he is makes it really hard to counter him with a low mobility mage or low mobility adc which are pretty much all i play. And being borderline bronze/silver (maybe? I don't play ranked at all so I'm not sure where i belong on that spectrum? i'll say silver 4 ish) i will make positioning errors and when I get a 700 true damage ult thrown down on me, there is no opportunity for me to try to outplay him, make an escape, or have my team help me at all. Excecution ults like chogath, garen, and darius are just really frustrating and do way more damage than seems fair.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkAngel134","date":"2016-01-05T19:28:13.804+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"the poro king game mode has been here so long i almost forgot that its only temporary... {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soul Blade","date":"2016-01-05T20:24:20.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, does anyone know what the actual percentage of getting a successful Legendary Snowball is?
