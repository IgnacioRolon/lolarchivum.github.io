Wager not many will read this, but whoever does I hope gets something out of it.\r\n\r\nFirst, we should separate DQ and the new champ select experience. I think most people can agree, aside from the support problem (which can be fixed), new champ select is a marked improvement over the old experience.\r\n\r\nSo, I appreciate that Riot's stance on Dynamic versus Solo queue is being presented this way. I disagree with it, but at least now it is out there. To paraphrase, Riot believes that DQ is more suited as a measure of your skill at playing with the team than solo queue, which is a better gauge of individual skill.\r\n\r\nI disagree - DQ merely reduces your individual impact on the game, while emphasizing *who you know*. There is a team integration piece there, I agree. However, DQ also removes agency (as in ability to influence the game) from players not in premade groups, which make up (in my experience) 60+% of teams in ranked. This is a feel bad behavior for individuals, and cheapens the \"ranking\" received by everyone in the game, because that number means something different for everyone in the game now, instead of being closer to a representation of individual skill for each player.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I want ranked to be about playing with 4 other individuals (or hell, 2+a duo) who are within a standard deviation or so of my skill level. I can't play with my friends even if I want to, as they are almost universally below the ranked threshold for us to queue together. And in general, I don't want to play ranked with my friends (normals are great) because there is an inherent pressure for me to carry. Solo queue removes that pressure, as the expectation is that you are either in the same skill bracket as those in your game, or about to move up/down since you are better/worse than they are. DQ has proven to have much wider swings in both skill level and personal agency (while also sometimes being an effective variant of solo queue when premades aren't present), and in general, that variance makes the ladder less meaningful. A less meaningful ladder reduces the impetus to play ranked (for me - I can't speak for others), which makes the queue less populated, which...you get the picture.\r\n\r\nI work a real job. Networking (what DQ feels like it prioritizes if you want to maintain game agency) is valuable skill there. I play games to get away from the real world for a time and have fun, not to serve as another surrogate job. If this is the direction you want to take the game, and a majority agrees - great. This won't be the game for me anymore. On the other hand, if this is you imposing a system the majority *doesn't* agree with...your \"decades\" hope will find itself sadly optimistic, and you should be re-evaluating, in that case.","replies":[{"poster":"Fukboi5000","date":"2016-04-14T23:04:37.508+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can relate to everything you said here.

If people were to truly play League in competitive environment, as in pro-level gaming, they would make a team of 5, not 3 or 4. For those who wanted to play team of 3 or 4, there is always option of playing in normal queue. I don't seriously can't understand why you guys got rid of solo/duo-queue and team rank (5-men queue) option. For those who really wanted to make a team effort and play \"competitive game\" with friends, they would play team rank. Instead of being stubborn and ignoring the opinion of majority, I would really suggest you bring back solo/duo-queue along with team rank system. Individuals stuck with premade of 3 or 4 suffers greatly. DQ also brings up problem with reporting. Whenever I report directly on LoL website, I always get \"Please use report system in-game\" non-sense. You guys are not going to look at 1 person reporting 4-men queue for harassing/intentionally feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meanie40","date":"2016-04-14T20:43:49.265+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":12,"body":"> Right now we're prioritizing the stability and health of a single queue - two would split the ranked player base and have a significant impact on wait times - and this is not a decision we’re taking lightly.\r\n\r\nMake the single queue solo queue, and bring back Ranked 5's for those who want to play with friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-04-14T20:28:25.557+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"improving the solo player experience against premades\"\r\n\r\nhow do you plan on doing that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-04-14T20:48:09.421+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":8,"body":"Yes, we understand you want this to be a sport considering how much you prioritize the pro scene environment over the actual game and playerbase.  We've known this for years, but at least you're actually admitting to it now so I guess that's a plus?\n\nAnd for Dynamic? Let's be real here, the only reason you want to avoid \"splitting the community\" is because you know that if the solo queue we were promised actually comes out, Dynamic will collapse in on itself and solo queue would be the most dominant system - a system you didn't want and apparently resent supporting with so much effort and focus on Dynamic - which is hated by a large number in the community. \n\nThe attempts to defend this system has led to us pointing out hypocrisy and slimy decision making that makes us call you untrustworthy.  You can play the innocent victim, but let's not forget about what led to this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gottrjr","date":"2016-04-14T20:38:31.858+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":7,"body":"You could have re-enabled team builder since you lied about solo q. But now we are stuck with dynamic q that most of the vocal community dislikes. Dynamic Q has a lot of flaws and we shouldn't have to work through them as you work through them.

You're killing the highest level of skill and ability with Dynamic Q.\r\n\r\nThere are not, I repeat are not, any tweaks you can make to the system that would stop SKT, ORG, TSM, or other top regional teams to give them fair matches when they Q as 5. The top tier, the challenger players, the pros. LISTEN TO THEM PLEASE. How are you going to find a way to make even match ups when a bunch of disparate duo's and triples with some solos thrown in, find matches in a reasonable time, WHILE Not making them unbalanced when you have maybe 100? players at that level playing at once? \r\n\r\nYou can tout whatever numbers and proportions you want. As you climb higher in ranked, the problems with dynamic get worse. More teams on comms, more people boosted above their individual skill, and less incentive to get better on your own. Why would we want to climb when every top player is saying that league right now as never been less fun? \r\n\r\nSOLO ONLY. Take dynamic Q away, if you want to play with people you know you play normals. Ranked is for try harding, ranked is for getting better, ranked is not for friends. Ranked is not for people who don't want to deal with random team mates. \r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexagon","date":"2016-04-14T20:41:27.207+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"What is Riot's explanation/stance on Dynamic Queue given that it is a system that other MOBA's have tried, recognized critical flaws with, and ultimately discarded?

Ranks don't mean shit right now because anyone can just spam games with the same 4 people and eventually gain synergy and climb with ease.
