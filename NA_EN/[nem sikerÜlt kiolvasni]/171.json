The article is highly detailed and relevant to my work as well, so many thanks to Riot's UI tech team for sharing! Since it's 2 months old I will ask a couple of questions here: \n1. What you are using for all the animations (there are quite a few)? From the comments I suspect it's CSS, but if so, do you use any dedicated CSS animation editor, or just code all the animations? In my experience creating anything beyond the most basic CSS animations is a bit of a nightmare; yet the new client looks very smooth (are the small VFX on the names embedded videos)?\n2. Linked to the above, are you using any vectors (like SVGs) in your designs? And if yes, has that been a problem in any way (things like aliasing, or performance hits)?\n3. One of the comments answers on the article page mentions the in-game UI is also HTML, but handled by a different system, is it possible to give us any details on that?\n\nI'd have more but I don't want to make this too long, thanks once again!","replies":[{"poster":"Maygin","date":"2016-08-05T08:11:26.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Elfdepadure,\nThank you for your questions!  I am a Tech Artist on the client update team (which basically means I get the awesome opportunity to work on a lot of the art and animation tech for this :-D).  So I'm going to attempt to drop a cannon barrage here on your queries.\n\n1.) All of our animations are custom made through a combination of CSS transitions & keyframes as well as JS code and animate objects.  Basically, we look at each piece of art and motion and determine the most sustainable way to build it using images, CSS properties, custom animations, etc.  In some cases, we have created custom animation state machines that allow us to link and blend complex motion together.  In other cases, we will combine CSS filters, masks, image slicing (and whatever else crazy technique I discover during a week of work) with all the combinations of web animation techniques to get the desired effect.  It mostly boils down to how specific a piece of animation is to the client or if it's global problem we need to solve.  You are correct that these animations can be a nightmare, but we are fortunate that we only have to make it work for a single browser and version.  (Oh, and I believe the VFX on names are css filters, but I'll have to double check that...)\n\n2) I have recently started experimenting more with SVG.  Overall, performance and art fidelity is pretty similar to working with images.  The key differences at present appears to be in the kind of image you are representing.  Images, especially those exported from photoshop tend to have a nice edge blur (think a nice fuzzy outline that makes them have a cohesion with their surroundings) where as vectors (like SVG) have a more sharp and boldly defined contrast.  Really, it boils down to 2 factors here.  If your piece of art is meant to be very structured and standout against it surroundings, SVG is a good way to go, otherwise, use images.  Second, we live in a word of ever increasing 4k monitors, so you can use SVG as a more scaleable option to offer for presentation if you don't want to use large images.  Overall, we built out most of our art with CSS and use images for more complicated art structures.   I'm certain there are some more tech-savvy Rioters who can speak to the actual code architecture differences between the various art implementation methods, but I usually aim to balance aesthetics with general performance and so far it appears that each art method is pretty close in an overall performance range.\n\n3) Gah, I am almost useless on this question since I've only ever worked on the client.  I would need to ask around the office before I could give you a better answer on this one!\n\nThank you again, and let me know if you have any more questions!","replies":[{"poster":"elfdepadure","date":"2016-08-05T10:53:03.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Maygin, thank you very much for your answer! I really appreciate Riot's team being so open with their process - and this is also a great help for me.\n\nSince you invited more questions, here they are! :D\n\n1. Considering how you build the CSS assets (as a Tech Artist), what is the workflow you guys are using when it comes to content creators? _I.e.: do you have a sum of dedicated UI Designers and Artists doing a fully animated mock-up first, and then a UI Tech Art team tries to implement it as close as possible, with a bit of negotiation back-and-forth?_  In my case, the transition from Flash to HTML meant a regular UI Artist wasn't given the same creative freedom as before, so the brunt of the work had to be taken by Tech Artists/Web Devs. I'm curious if this was also the case with your team, and how the team adapted to this new process. \n2. Related to the above, can you share the composition of the team that worked on the visuals of the client alone? \n3. I would be really interested to know more about how you built that VFX (to be clear, I was talking about the 'smoke' fx under the name plates).\n4. Talking about 4K, scaling was exactly why I mentioned SVGs: my approach was that using vectors will make scaling just workâ„¢ effortlessly. You mentioned you guys chose to go for bitmaps because of the better aliasing look - does that mean you are building different sets of assets for scaling on 4K? Or are you just using the 4K assets downscaled on smaller resolutions? \n5. Can you share what were the biggest performance issues (if any worth mentioning)? And how did you tackle them?\n\nOnce again many thanks, this is turning into an excellent read!","replies":[{"poster":"Maygin","date":"2016-08-25T07:15:21.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Again Elfdepadure!\nFor starters, my apologies for the incredibly long delay in my response, I've been heads down on some big updates and this is the first chance I've had to come up for some air (so hopefully you're still watching this thread for a reply!).  Second, I dig the enthusiasm and questions, it's always great to talk with people who are interested in the process for creating all this insane game software we work on.  That being said, let me jump right in and see if I can answer this for you.\n\n1. So yes, we do have a small handful of dedicated visual design artists who create the wireframes, the iconic language and final full screen comps for each part of the client.  As a tech artist, I'm working in the exact capacity that you described above.  The visual designers create the art and vision, and I spend most of my time doing the integration of that work.  We have been facing similar issues with the transition from Flash to HTML, in that with Flash, the designers could more directly work with assets and modify things themselves, but now they are more dependent on tech artists or engineers to make the changes for them since it touches the code base and requires code reviews or has a more global impact to the client.  To help alleviate this problem we have built component libraries and style libraries (things like commonly used colors, gradients, fonts, basic containers, etc.) which makes it easier to universally change an asset across the client and allows for visual designers to go in and make changes to css themselves if they are comfortable with that.  I've also been experimenting with how we set up our containers in HTML so that we can swap out images or SVG's and not have to worry about variations in asset sizes (think in terms that the spacial relationship between objects is often the most important part of creating a layout).\n2. Our overall team for creating visuals is primarily composed of a handful of visual designers, a couple of user experience designers, a couple of motion graphics artists and myself on tech art. (I might be missing someone else here, so my apologies if anyone on the team sees this and I forgot to mention a group)\n3. The VFX are from our awesome mo-graph artists.  They comp out all of that stuff with After Effects (and probably some other cool tools that I don't know they names of) and then present it to the team.  Between the engineering team and myself, we decide the best way to recreate it in the client.  Most of the time we use video or image manipulation/css tricks, but we are going to continue to experiment with other animation things like WebGL in the future (We are trying to be mindful of toasters and semi-toaster machines, so that weighs heavily on our approach to the kind of code and assets we use at the moment)\n4. SVG and CSS are great for simple shapes in 4k.  Almost anything that has a basic shape structure we design in CSS so it scales well.  The more complicated designs we have that have odd shapes, magic, specific shadows, things that overall would take a long time to make in web tech, we will typically export as images.  We do export images as 4k compatible and then scale them down for smaller resolutions, but this is on a case by case basis.  We look at the fidelity of each piece and determine if its required or not (i.e. A regular sized button with a magical background will probably need to be 4k, but a full screen background image is probably a bit excessive and would chew up people's memory so we would probably leave that one at standard resolution)\n5. Oh performance issues.  This is probably one the biggest rabbit holes for any aspect of development.  It's always a tedious process of evaluating and locking down the root cause of something that is causing a system to chug.  Off the top of my head, the main ones that have got me recently are drop shadow filters, 3d transforms and preloading assets.  It's not that you can't use them, it's all about selective process.  Basically, you have to figure out your baseline performance before and after applying techniques like those and then determine what your budget/threshold is and make smart choices for when you use them.  Preloading is a very important one to monitor since it is absolutely required for certain assets but can really screw up loading times or memory usage if you over do it.  Second to that, I have found that animations or art that requires a lot of post processing effects may not always be the issue for bad performance, rather they are exposing issues in the code architecture.  In those cases, you want to break down your art/animation and see if you can identify where the issue is happening and coordinate with your engineers when you find places where performance breaks despite any complex/simple art you have in place.\n\nI hope all of this helps you out, and again thank you for the patience in my reply.
