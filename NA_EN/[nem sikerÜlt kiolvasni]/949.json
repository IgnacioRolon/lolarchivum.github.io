Jinx has arguably an even mid-game and a way better late and teamfighting potential. Kog'maw is the god of hypercarries and has armor shred.

Graves is better in teamfights with his aoe burst and has a dash. \r\n\r\nTl;dr there is no 'best' adc as you might claim/imply every champ fits a comp, every champ has a purpose and has abilities that makes him unique or different compared to other adc's. Ashe is nothing different at all. I dare say that Kalista is arguably even or even better then ashe at some things in the game. Kalista has a sentinel. Extremely strong early game. Can create picks and has an ult that is an AOE knockup and with hurricaan cajn aoe slow and has unlimited kiting potential and basically a second smite. U wot m9? No adc better? Really?

You're absolutely right, tanks are going to fall out of favor soon enough, and we'll have a new meta dominated by a new strategy.

Hawkshot will only reveal for so long. Please keep in mind that new Volley's arrows can hit the same target more than once, but deal no extra damage or slow, while old Volley's arrows would actually hit you more than once, dealing more damage and making it more viable for shotgunning. As we've already explored with the latest addition to our roster (Ekko is so kawaii), Ashe isn't the most powerful for damage. Instead, she relies on a power window for a large portion of her damage, and her CC to attempt to force a fight with said power window. Her shared weakness with all ADCs is her susceptibility to dying while under the effects of crowd control. As soon as she gets stunned or snared, she's practically ~~Garenteed~~ guaranteed to go down in a teamfight. Silences also remove a large portion of her damage potential for a short while, given that ranger's focus wasn't activated beforehand. Concerning her ult, it isn't quite the easiest thing to dodge and it can often come in unexpectedly during team fights. The downside to it is shared with Super Mega Death Rocket (and to a lesser extent, Trueshot Barrage) with it being quite difficult to aim, given that it loses effectiveness when shotgunned. If your team is spread out or taking jungle routes, Ashe will often have difficulty hitting her target.","replies":[{"poster":"Exiles SoIace","date":"2015-06-02T03:22:56.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe's old volley could not hit a target multiple times the rest would go through so you could volley a champ through a minion wave but could never apply increased damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Briañ","date":"2015-06-02T18:40:45.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHEM- Kappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Code Red13","date":"2015-06-03T00:12:23.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If people would just learn to play {{champion:45}} they would understand that nothing is hard to kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxxToiletSeat","date":"2015-06-02T19:10:36.937+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always went legendary with her before her re-work.
