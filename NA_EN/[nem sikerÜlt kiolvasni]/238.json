Ya know, so people with multiple accounts don't have to go through the hastle (myself not included).  I can see why it could become bothersome.  Also, an option to mute pingers.  We have the ability to mute players, but they can still ping like total dicks.  And I know you'll be thinking \"Well yeah, sure they are annoying, but what if they really do need a blue flag assist?\"  Another idea would be to continuously lower the maximum pings if they reach that bar (From a total of 8 to a total of 7, so on and so forth).  Don't tell us you're gonna do that, because trolls will work around it, but just an idea.  Another great idea: Make a free skin rotation?  I'd like to believe that would increase consumer buying of skins (A couple of marketing classes under my belt)\r\n\r\nTL;DR:  Log out button, ways to mute excessive pingers, skin rotations.\r\n\r\nThank you, and thanks for being such a great company.

I love the new patcher and client, they look up to date and way better designed and all, but I don't know if you guys are aware at times people are tabbed out and click on the client to tab in instead of using alt-tab, and seeing the new client that's a link-galore and no matter where you click it'll be a new pop-out. \r\n\r\nIt annoyed me when the promotion pages were up and whenever I clicked on a wrong spot of the client to tab back into it, it pops up.
