Naturally NA would in turn reclaim their spots in the NALCS as new and stronger challenger teams are formed. After all in NA there is more North American talent than Chinese, European and Korean talent.\r\nIf u want NA or any other region to be able to rival the Korean, you should be happy every time new foreign talent joins any league.

The Korean iteration of Quantic gaming proved that you can't ship a bunch of strong players to the US and have them automatically qualify for the LCS. Quantic tried to rush their entry, so they got destroyed on the first day. LMQ had to invest a lot of time in the US. They had to climb the NA challenger scene and take part in the challenger series, a process that takes a least a split and a half.
