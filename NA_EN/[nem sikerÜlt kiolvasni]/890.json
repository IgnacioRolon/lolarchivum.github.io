Whatever they were chasing, it was fast, and the scent was fading quicker than he could chase it. Lamb caught up to him and rubbed his head.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : _You chased well Wolf. We'll stop here and rest a bit._ (She sat down and leaned against a tree. Wolf laid down beside her and Lamb handed him some of the Bilgewater jerky. She took out a {{item:2032}} and drank some.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **So where do you think that lantern wandered off to?** _I sincerely hope it didn't wind up in Mordekaiser's hands. We may never get those souls back if he has them._ (After a short while, Wolf's ears perked.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **You hear that?** _Sure did Wolf._ **I don't want to chase it yet. Not finished with my jerky yet.**\r\n{{item:3211}} : Kindred! Come to me! I have Thresh's lantern!\r\n{{champion:203}} : _Too bad Wolf, better finish it on the run!_ (Wolf growled as he switched to his floating head form, holding the jerky in his teeth as he flew after Lamb. Lamb ran toward the voice until she saw the lithe form of Kalista rushing toward her. Before they met, Kalista spun around, threw a ghostly spear behind her, and darted to the side. Lamb then leapt to the side herself as she saw the giant form of Hecarim galloping toward her.)\r\n{{champion:120}} : You can dart around all you want you little rogue, but your days in the unlife are over. (Lamb recovered and saw Kalista holding Thresh's lantern. She dodged a sweep of Hecarim's glaive and threw another spear of cold fire at him.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : _Wolf, divide and conquer._ (Wolf swallowed the remainder of his jerky.) **This should be fun.** (Lamb leapt toward Kalista as Wolf floated near Hecarim. Hecarim leapt toward Kalista to deliver a downward slash, but Wolf bit onto his weapon and held it in place. Kalista leapt toward Lamb to toss her the lantern, but had to quickly pull it back as Hecarim reached out with his front legs to kick the air between them.)\r\n{{champion:429}} : Can you absorb the souls from here?\r\n{{champion:203}} : _No, the lantern pretty much has to be touching my bow._ (Hecarim yanked his glaive free from Wolf and swung it low in a sweep. Lamb leapt back to avoid it clumsily and fell over on landing. Kalista landed weirdly but maintained her footing. Hecarim ignored the wolf head reaching to bite him and dove toward Kalista. Kalista side-stepped the attempt to trample her, but Hecarim's glaive had expected her jump, and the staff caught her in the chest and knocked her down.)\r\n{{champion:120}} : It ends here Kalista... (Hecarim reared up and then stomped down with a downward thrust of his glaive. The cursed metal plunged into Kalista's stomach. Her spectral essence beginning to fade, Hecarim hooked Thresh's lantern to his glaive.)\r\n{{champion:120}} : The Iron Order rides on! (He charged off into the darkness of the island. Lamb and Wolf quickly rushed to Kalista's side.)\r\n{{champion:429}} : I'm sorry...I tried.\r\n{{champion:203}} : _Sorry we couldn't do more to help._ (Kalista pulled at a spear in her heart, then let it fall from her hands near Lamb.)\r\n{{champion:429}} : Take the souls under my banner, and this spear. When you are about to kill Hecarim, stab him with this. (With that, her head fell back and she moved no more. Lamb held her bow over the fallen spirit, and a stream of souls flowed into the bow.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : (Picking up the {{item:3599}} ) _Wolf..._ **Say it Lamb.** _Time to hunt._","replies":[{"poster":"Flayed","date":"2016-08-24T17:49:48.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Continue plz ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rakanissance","date":"2016-08-23T18:29:47.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck you hecarim\r\nwhy would u do dis ;-;","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBuckeyeMan","date":"2016-08-22T15:23:02.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg best thing i have ever seen very nice\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OuijaBored","date":"2016-08-22T16:26:14.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"YAYY!!!
