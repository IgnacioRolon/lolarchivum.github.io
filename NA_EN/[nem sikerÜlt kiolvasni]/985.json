How about revisioning the champions that CANNOT see play due to the current state of the game (popular champions mainly). There's so many champions in League that aren't playable anymore at a higher level of elo. It's either META or LOSE now in D5+ [So lower may or may not understand]. Here are examples of popular champions that just simply cannot and probably will not see popular play again due to the fact that EVERYONE 100-0's them including supports \"like\" karma/brand/alistar - **Vayne** not only is she fun to play, but has a large mechanical incline, however EVERY ADC can do her job in the early game as well as the late game JUST AS WELL. Not only that, but playing a mechanically inclined champion LIKE vayne means you have to provide skill/timing(dodging/when to Q)/structures and cooldowns. Needless to say, with the new marksman items she is just 100% garbage. **Zed** Man, not only do people HATE playing against this champion, because he's \"slippery, 1 shots too op\" BUT he's just NOT that good. It's just like i stated on Vayne, he is a champion that has a high incline of mastery to be incredible at but you guys(riot) have put a cap on him with the extended nerfs, how EVERYONE can 1 shot now, even the easiest of champions. Players should be REWARDED when playing a highly skilled champion and doing WELL on that champion. Not a slap to the face when realistically Ekko, viktor, syndra etc ALL have better teamfight, burst, wave control, denial, and kill potential as a Zed in every point of the game except 6.**Azir** you guys took an entire 2 years to create a beautiful champion, yet you hide him away and create champions like Auru Sol that didn't let you think at all ENTIRELY. You guys had such a great overlay and idea on what you think you wanted this champion to be, and I had AMAZING hopes, yet we got stuck with that instead of this(http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d5/AoShin_Concept.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130908110634) Azir was a beautiful creation that has been stripped and overtaken by EVERYMID LANER. including urgot. He was a champion that had a academically higher skill cap and players USED to get rewarded highly. But now shurima sits to rust. **Orianna** A champion that's been loved and hated by every player in League of legends that understands a WOMBOOO COMBOO. This champion not only brought teams together in champion select, but the ability to turn the tides of a teamfight back in Season 3-5 and that ALONE speaks VOLUMES. Orianna is nothing more than a tin can that gets worked over by champions, again, with EVERYTHING in their kits out classing. She's a high skill capped champion but requires a team, surviving laning (WHICH IS HUGE, her mana costs are outrageous, even with a full build) Syndra can get at least 6 combos and still have half mana compared to Orianna. Control mages? Please Balance this. At the end of the day here, people are going to be salty about this post. I'm a veteran to League of legends and i'm not prepared to see the direction it's heading in. One too many settle changes (change can be good, and i'm open to it ALWAYS) but a new champion every month, with 1 meta shift in 5 months, broken champions aren't being fixed, but people complain when someones \"OP\" but EVERY CHAMPION around them including THEMSELVES are \"OP\". It makes a lot of champions un-stable and League is becoming 1 trick pony status with Annie/Master yi/graves. How does 1 outplay a graves that's lost his cigar. The game is in complete chaos (the Solo Q side). I understand that this is a team game and I should play friends, but not all of us have that necessity due to daily lives. League of legends ranked/balancing is unstable, and veterans like myself, I believe, can relate to it in someway. Things aren't right when every champion can 100-0, it's a way of balancing but at the same time causation because champions like ^ (stated above) just DONT do that game, I could list off plenty more champions - Kassadin, Xerath, TF, Kalista, Karthus and so on. These champions have always been and always will be the \"Omg he's a Legend on ___\". INSTEAD we get, oh, it's a graves/syndra/rumble/kennen/zac. The only Champion that has seen ANY kind of love is Lee sin and he rightfully deserves it. Worlds has been nothing more than a disappointment on so many levels. All of these crap teams are able to compete with these amazing teams BECAUSE everything is busted and easy peasy imo, games are lost in champion select and that should NEVER be an ending to a game.
