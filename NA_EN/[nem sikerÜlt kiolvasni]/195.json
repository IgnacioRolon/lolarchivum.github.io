Since the numbers/mechanics/visuals of some champs change each patch, the game state is actually different from when the mode came back originally.

So in preparation to relaunch the mode in 8.6, testers noticed that one Zoe could see another Zoe's W pickups, but was unable to pick them up. \r\n\r\nGame designers did work to make sure that any of one team's Zoe's could pick up allied pickups, with some follow up to get the drop rates to feel fun and semi-balanced. Then we play-tested, iterated a bit, and now we are running it through a QA test, which could lead to more development and testing. \r\n\r\nThis is one case, for one champion, and we tend to have many of these sorts of cases for every mode that we release, even including some of the original modes like Ascension and Poro King. It varies per mode, but unfortunately, to ensure a quality experience for you all, no mode can just be turned on at a moment's notice.

Im not disagreeing that you can't just turn a game mode on, because I understand it's not that easy but when new game modes went from patch to patch, even with bugs it kept the game fresh. Every week I'd play a brand new game mode and when I would take tough losses in ranked and be bored of ARAM it offered less stagnation. I'm personally not a fan of Blood Moon Hunt, but because it offers a different take on the game I dont mind playing it a bit here and there. If this game mode stayed live a whole patch though I know I wouldn't play it after a good week. Even URF I would get bored of after like 2 weeks and I absolutely love URF. I know I dont speak for everyone and I'm only a minor percentage of the whole, but how would keeping the same random game live for that long not become boring after a certain amount of time. Is there anyway to ensure the longevity of people playing that game mode for a long time? I'm just curious on how other people feel about this.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyCatFish","date":"2018-02-03T00:25:39.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then just ban Zoe in that mode.  You've done it before with other champs. \r\n\r\nI'm just having a hard time understanding why \r\nyou wouldn't have a small team of core developers specific to those modes just run maintenance on them?  \r\n\r\nNewer champs either are not available, or are available at a later date.  Give the job of adding new champs to junior developers!  Have them earn their stripes!  Make a big deal out of someone getting a new champ into a game mode!  \r\n\r\nDon't scale the department.  Don't add new features.  Just do enough to give us back what we already had.\r\n\r\nThis is where Riot, I gotta say, you're really losing me.  Dozens upon dozens of brand new \"NO ONE CARES\" skins are released every few weeks, now all at 1350 RP, which seems to be the new standard. You release all kinds of non-sense like emoji 2-D pastel cartoon balloons that likely took a handful of people hours to create, and yes, you sell only for RP.  You made these blue essence changes, but for some reason, I'm sitting on a about 2 metric kuricks of them right now.  Feels kind of useless so there not really a reward for anything.  You get random key fragments and random chests now and again, which is nice enough, but doesn't really justify some of the other things happening.  \r\n\r\nBut it's fine.  We take it.

You've made something so transcending of other games that it continues to revolutionize the idea of sport itself.\r\n\r\nIt is a pivotal point for everyone involved right now.\r\n\r\nRight now, all else behind us, you took away our game modes.

Riot has to develop a team of collaborative people to come up with another RGM. It's not like certain people have a job that is \"person who comes up with RGMs\". Even if it was, it takes a long time to put a team together even still, and people have lives at Riot, like you and me (hopefully you have one), so they can't constantly be working on some project for a video game. As for balancing, they still keep it somewhat balanced. Even URF Fizz wasn't obnoxiously broken. It was just really annoying to deal with. That's still considered \"balanced\" since the rest of your team is probably Ezreal, Veigar, Malzahar, and Teemo and you're the poor sap who got stuck with Tristana and are soloing mid vs. a Fizz and their entire team comp probably sucks ass compared to yours. Also, what about the interaction between the team? You don't just expect to assign a few people and they'll be best buddies. It's like a teacher creating groups for an Elementary School project.
