Sounds obvious, but like Dash said, players usually go on tilt and try to fight their enemy laner 1v1/2v2 just to die again... and again... and again... Obviously don't be a complete wimp, but ideally you want to take fights you _know_ you can win (when your jungler ganks for example).\n\nAs for contributing late game, it depends on the champion, sometimes you'll have to be careful about how you handle things if you're a tank since you're behind, but if you manage to catch back up in gold by farming as a bruiser/carry, then you can probably start dominating people decently (maybe not what you're used to when you're ahead obviously, so you'll still need to be careful, but you wouldn't be useless).\n\nI'm a support main so I'm used to getting carried (:3 and indirectly carrying), but I'm starting the switch to ADC so I can actually get some practice trading and csing and such. I can't tell you how many times I've had my ADC's/supports go super aggressive while we're behind and I just want them (or myself) to farm to catch up.
