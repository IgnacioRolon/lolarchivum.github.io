Herald has a much better niche than before and feels more useful than a mini Baron. Baron itself is a bit low in power and focused on less. May see changes, as it gives temporary strategic power for against objectives and for sieging, something Ocean and Mountain Drake are now doing permanently. More teamfights around Dragons somewhat removes the need to take Baron, teams can just end after a Dragon fight. Risk/reward of Dragon may be too shallow, losing a Dragon doesn't mean much, losing Baron is game changing.\r\n\r\n**-Mage Reworks (12:10):** Measured in two ways: distinctiveness vs. healthiness. Vlad was already distinct, but needed changes to be healthier. Succeeded somewhat, but still not in the best spot. How is distinctiveness measured? How a champion changes the game, i.e. focus on early game or late game, what objectives, what powerspikes, playstyles, etc. Old Darius and Garen, Diana and Akali, old Graves and Lucian etc. are good examples of too much similarity. MYMU tried to make a champions more distinct, succeeded pretty much (except Vel'Koz).\r\n\r\n**-Itemization Changes (17:50):** New items were aimed at just giving more options and facilitating differences (give tanky mages more options than just ROA, etc). Eliminate issues of Athene's vs. Morello's stat checking and focus more on variety. Hextech line was an experiment to see if certain items could be given clear strengths and distinctiveness, a lot like Zeal crit items.\r\n\r\n**-Supports (23:00):** Support gold and exp. Stronger catch up exp. Supports and Junglers are \"low income classes,\" but this is not healthy currently. Kill gold vs. minion gold, minions are worth so much gold and denying minions through killing is worth more than kills. Junglers and supports are not as impactful as laners, and this needs to be fixed. How to balance support items' low cost with its impactfulness so laners don't abuse it? Gold has too much of an impact in the game for two classes to have low incomes and still remain healthy. Create more options to give supports better and healthier choices (Aegis is too necessary, AP support items are simply outclassed by regular AP items). Support champs are not the problem, it's the systems around them.\r\n\r\n**-Assassins (35:40):** Why assassins? Too many similarities between assassins, not distinct enough. Kept assassins weak because they are too toxic when strong. Assassins are supposed to kill, but to make them less frustrating they are made to kill less effectively. This doesn't feel good for the assassin player. Want to bring more utility to assassins (more vision contributions, objectives, and out of combat movespeed for flanking). Want more assassins that are less focused on mechanical skill and more on game understanding and mind games. Give counterplay to assassins and give those fighting against them a way to outplay them to survive, rather than relying on the assassin messing up to survive.\r\n\r\n**-Game Predictions (49:40):** Assassin update will counterbalance the mage update changes and cause midlaners to think about picks. Preseason will be exciting. Teams playing more strategically around dragons (we have three Mountain Drakes so let's push objectives). Games will get faster as people learn the importance of objectives.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading guys! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Shaclean","date":"2016-07-09T18:16:50.288+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2016-07-11T18:23:18.820+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could eve get a rework too? I don't know if you consider her an assassin primarily or something else, but I feel like she definitely needs a very different kit -- she's either fed and deleting everyone thanks to her stealth, behind/even and getting blown up for building high damage and having only 2 semi-spammable damage abilities, or tanking damage (less effectively than other jungles) if built as a tank and dealing no damage compared to other tanks.\r\n\r\nSome possible ideas:\r\n**heightened ****speed **-- attack speed buff and removes slow debuffs (think her e and w combined)\r\n\r\n**taste for blood** -- spammable damage like kha q that stacks up in combat (like jax's attackspeed -- because vampires feed off blood right)\r\n\r\n**feeding time** -- regains percent of missing hp and mana for each kill/assist (amplified version of dangerous game -- rewards good eve's by keeping them in the fight -- something current damage eve's can't do because they're too squishy)\r\n\r\n**cryptic sleep** -- built in zhonya (cuz vlad has pool and fizz has playful/trickster to keep them in the fight longer/make good escapes)\r\n\r\n**nighthunter** -- enhanced movement speed when out of enemy champions' line of sight\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, this type of rework makes eve more about sustained damage in teamfights while giving her the ability to duel many people 1v1. She keeps her strength/identity of a champ able to roam quickly and surprise you by showing up seemingly out of nowhere. Good eve's would be rewarded with the ability to flank and pick off squishy champs if not faced with hard cc. They could survive the enemy team turning focus on them (for a small amount of time) via cryptic sleep and feeding time -- allowing their teammates to capitalize on their assassination of a carry similar to the way tf's can stun a carry and zhonya at right time to give their team the advantage in a fight. You could still even keep the ad and ap duality of eve (if you wanted) by making taste for blood scale more off ap and be burst focused -- not 1-shot stuff, but enough that a late-game adc needs some help dealing with that damage while keeping heightened speed a more ad scaling ability. Both could have some scaling with both ad and ap, but one scales stronger with ad and the other with ap.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't like any of these ideas, I would still like to see eve in the reworked sometime before next season.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thats Outrageous","date":"2016-07-08T20:50:04.155+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want {{item:2303}} {{item:2045}} {{item:2049}} {{item:2301}} {{item:2302}} {{item:3711}}  to recharge while away from fountain...\nSo I don't feel blind when they break my {{item:2043}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Maphu","date":"2016-07-08T21:55:15.804+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah like can we get 1 ward on kill/assist?

How about 20%?  I don't know how much of their playerbase they're losing or how many new players they regain on a regular basis... but I'm pretty sure the losses are higher and that's why they're pushing a lot to bring in new players and cater to the more casual crowd.  I could be wrong.\n\nEven if I am... people leaving is still something a sane company should at least look into.  People leaving left for a reason.  They had an issue with the product, the company or just weren't into the game enough to stay.  All of these things could become real problems for the product... in this case, the game.  And this is assuming they're not already.  \n\nPeople staying isn't a positive... it's the default.  People JOINING would be positive.  That means that the company is doing well, and the game is growing.  If you have ten of something and lose one, you've still got nine... so no big.  But if you never gain MORE, you need to be VERY careful about losing more, or you'll end up with nothing.  \n\nNow keep in mind that those \"somethings\" are customers and Riot needs a certain number of them to even afford to maintain their game... pay employees, work on new things, etc.  I don't think they're ANYWHERE near the red on this, but I think they might have peaked and are dipping now.  In this situation they have only two options.  Stall their decline by keeping the players they have for as long as possible... or try to get new ones to replace the lost players.\n\nExcept their attempts to get new players are driving old ones away.  Old players were the ones that helped Riot succeed in the first place, and their love of the game is what made it such a success in the first place.  Sentimentality isn't good business, obviously... but chasing away old players in the HOPE of getting new ones is very, VERY risky.  I don't think it's working and I'd bet they're still declining... possibly faster than they would have if they hadn't driven away a bunch of old players/streamers/youtubers (because who needs free advertising for your game, right?)... but again, I don't know.\n\nRegardless... \"Many more have stayed\" still means that they have less players than they did BEFORE, numbnuts.  Given that I see more \"bored of league\" or \"quitting league\" videos than I see fun ones these days, it's not really hard to see why new players might not want to get into a game that even the people who play it on streams/youtube for a living want to play.  I don't know if you played back in the glory days of the dunk squad, the pro as heck guide to Master Yi or Xin Zhao being a man.. but that was when the game was FUN.  Compared to that, the game currently feels like a room full of people bitching over who gets to take the last slice of pizza before they all ditch the shitty party they all came to.  \n\nIt's all a moot point tho, since the only thing that will prove either of us right or wrong is time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raiden27d","date":"2016-07-09T01:07:30.533+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"STATE OF THE GAME \"Well guys everythings a bit fucked atm.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tract","date":"2016-07-08T22:14:21.753+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anyone know were to find the timestamps of topics like they did in other podcasts like this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SAKELLARIOU","date":"2016-07-13T17:35:13.420+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aidan Zirene is the only person who makes sense.

Five of those points (on most supports) have very little impact. Taking those same 6 points and putting them into Cunning or Resolve offer more overall. For tanky and CC/disruption-based supports, the ms + cookies offer a lot more than the AS or AP (assuming they focus Resolve first). For mage supports, Cunning is usually the go-to tree because of TLD or windspeaker's. As such, the regen, ms, and flat HP in Resolve are necessary in laning (since they primarily rely on base stats for abilities, not the ratios). Oh, and reduction in summoner spell CDs is a necessity (exhaust OP!).\n\nThere are some exceptions, especially for the more burst-based supports (Brand/Annie/Zyra), but generally the other trees offer a lot more for a champion that relies on limited gold and base stats.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dauthau","date":"2016-07-13T12:42:54.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a BRONZE 2 (so low elo, not Riots targeted choice for the DynaQ change) I was in queue for low of 5 minutes, high of 12 minutes, average 8 minutes a couple of days ago (last time I played).
