Even if you tell your teammates to stop it they will continue doing it, even if they have complete builds. I had cases where people would literally use their ultimate to clear a wave before I get near one minion and they just tell me they want the gold fast and dont want to wait for me :/\n\nLet your supports have income too!

Riot's old line of thought was to encourage build diversification and innovation. This change along with a number of other decisions in the past (RIP Reksai AP Scaling) have cemented to me that Riot no longer cares about Diverse builds. There is now a Right way and a Wrong way to play this game. \r\n\r\nMy biggest issue though, is that fact that they're taking away the optimal Pyke strategy and replacing it with something that simply won't work. There will be 1 in 10 games where a Pyke support will have the Gold available to buy these items. These are the games that a player would likely already be buying into Duskblade and Black Cleaver because they have a significant lead. Buying Lethality from behind is Suicide!!! It's a stat that inherently scales with Level and due to this is Best when used by a champion with a level advantage on the opponent. Majority of Pyke games are now going to be Rush Mobility Boots, Rush Dirk/Duskblade, Gank Mid, Gank Mid, Gank Mid. If that doesn't work, you've lost the game for your team as your ADC will be penalized by having a mostly absent support and you will be an ineffective \"Assassin\" with no purpose apart from \"Hook, Stun, Hope your team can manage with only 4 players\".\r\n\r\nTank Pyke is still likely the best way to play, as CDR and Resistances are still the ideal purchases for him with a Youmuu's at 2nd or 3rd item simply so your W isn't useless. If you're planning on running the game with Lethality and AD items you might as well play him Jungle or Top and pray to god you don't get the impossible to win Urgot/Viktor matchup.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2018-11-07T10:24:52.049+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":45,"body":"we have less than a week and youre disabling ranked for this garbage update? keep giving me reasons to divorce this company.

This Pyke change is completely contradictory to that goal; I can't believe this went through. This change is enforcing lethality Pyke (in which there are literally only 3 items for him to choose) while hard nerfing all other options. Riot is basically saying: \"We want you to **ONLY** play Pyke as a lethality assassin and any other variations will be voided by this nerf.\" They put lethality scaling on 3 abilities. Why? Why would you have to deviate Pyke from normal champions by making his scalings based off lethality?\r\n\r\nI understand Riot's goal of trying to keep Pyke away from the Tank build, but if you wanted him to be played as an assassin with risk, why wouldn't you just increase the AD scalings  and lower the bases as an incentive for damage builds. This would make it so he's still dependent on damage, but isn't reliant on lethality. You can just as easily make phantom undertow's stun and ghostwater dive mms scale based off AD. \r\n\r\nLethality is such a BAD stat for Pyke as a support. The stat is literally **level** scaling armor pen. LEVEL. The support role is almost always the lowest level in the game. People didn't like going lethality on Pyke because it is by its nature one of the worst stats for the support position. This change removes the distinction of Pyke as an assassin support. He'll likely just be played in other roles or not at all. As a support, he'll only be feast or famine. \r\n\r\nThis makes me really sad as both a Pyke main and a player. The champion that I found to be interesting and very rewarding to play, albeit he was overpowered and did deserve nerfs of some kind, is now gutted in his distinct role. What's even worse is that this gives me even more distrust of the balance team since they are willing to force players to abide by how they want the game to be played. What if we see mages that are forced to build magic pen or marksmen be forced to build only attack speed. \r\n\r\nI really want to love this game since I've played it for so long and have met so many friends through it, but this is seriously a heart dropper. \r\n \r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critical Role","date":"2018-11-07T14:00:19.075+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"My game has completely crashed so many times ever since the implementation of 8.21, and it's happening to a number of other individuals as well but not a single peep from Riot about it.
