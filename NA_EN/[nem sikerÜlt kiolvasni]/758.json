I give first blood, then proceed to 20th minute with score 1-3 because I got ganked once and underestimated the enemy and got killed. I also got a gank once where my ignite killed the opponent. I have same CS as my lane opponent\r\n4. At the same minute twentieth, Lux is 0-0 with 30 less CS than their mid {{champion:238}} who was the one to gank me at top to get his kill before ganking bot lane after that getting another kill and assist there.\r\n5. So we have a 2-1-1 top laner, and a 2-0-1 mid laner on the enemy team, I am top 1-3-0, and our mid is 0-0-0 with -30 CS.\r\n6. Their top laner goes mid while I take top tower. My team fights them for some reason and they all die.\r\n7. Bla - bla - bla and we proceed on to lose the game.\r\n\r\nSo, in this situation, they harass me several times before I cannot stay calm anymore. These situations are:\r\n1. I give first blood:\r\n- ...\r\n- RLY?\r\n- idiot\r\n2. I got killed because I failed to kill my laner and he escaped with 50 HP:\r\n- ...\r\n- GG\r\n- are you ***ing kidding?\r\n3.

I am a ranked player with quite literally thousands of games. I have seen the best of players and the worst of players. This system is flawed beyond belief. Why? Because the very essence of the reports themselves and peoples' attitudes in general. There are MANY times that if you report a player for his or her crappy behavior, you will get reported right back. It is so easy to abuse the reporting system it's not even funny. We do not have an \"Unsportsmanlike Conduct\" report either...which would be VERY helpful. Do you ever get that enemy that gets really fed by your [insert negative descriptive adjective here] teammate and then said enemy player decides to badger the fact that they are fed and act like they are \"it\" when really...they are probably no better than anyone else. This also does not address the EXTREME problem there is with people who \"smurf\" and literally RUIN games unless you happen to be lucky enough to have someone on your team of equal or greater skill. It is hard to \"stay positive\" whenever an enemy is CLEARLY in a place where they do not belong. You report this? Big whoop...it's not [yet] a technical \"offense\". This system is sort of like communism (PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A SIMILE, NOT A DIRECT COMPARISON)...that is, it is perfect in theory, but in reality, it is a dismal failure. In real life, what normally happens to people who are being annoying, arrogant, and/or mindless pricks? They normally are not spoken to softly and happily...especially when they ruin things. The very heart of the problem, I have found in my years of playing is that there are two types of player...1) those that CARE about ranking and treat League as a \"sport\" not a \"game\" [I heard a very good definition that the difference between a \"sport\" and a \"game\" is that in its very core, a \"sport\" is not all about having \"fun\"...it is about winning and avoiding losing; whereas, a \"game\" is all about having fun...win or lose] and 2) those that do not give two cares whether they win or lose...or cause other people misery based on their dumb decisions. I have found SO MANY PEOPLE in the \"ranked\" system that aren't even there to win...which is really pathetic...this goes against the very core design values of what the ranked system is! Players like this should at first be ASKED by the system after a certain number of \"Assisting Enemy Team\", \"Intentionally Feeding\", and \"Negative Attitude\" reports as well as \"Unskilled\" whether or not they even take League somewhat seriously. If they answer \"no\", they should be asked to consider NOT PLAYING RANKED and if the problem persists, ranked should be disabled for a very long time on their account until they complete a large number of \"Draft Pick\" games...because let's be honest...the *vast* majority of players that do \"Draft Mode\" do so in order to prepare/practice for RANKED GAME-PLAY. This is a major problem and in at least 50% of the cases I see, this is the main issue with players. They are the ones who are like, \"it's just a game\". Actually, no it is NOT \"just a game\" when you get to higher levels and RANKED play. Go tell that to the professionals who make a LIVING of this program. Note that it is called \"eSports\" not \"eGames\". Until THIS problem gets fixed, Riot will CONTINUE to have a very at-odds community--it's just simple logic. No one at Riot listen though...they think they have it all worked out and need no help. They do not listen to the player base telling them clearly what the problems are...choosing instead to rely on MORE PEOPLE FROM RIOT! This is like having a medical problem and instead of going to the doctor, you go to your best friend [who is not a doctor].
