There was less stuff to do preshow. No team was doing a signing, like TIP did before, and the signs they gave out to write on, they were censoring what you could write, which seems unfair (e.g. They wouldn't let you write boosted on it while other people already wrote it on the sign). Also, it was a bummer that the players didn't do meet and greets after. Please work a little harder on the preshow activities next time. :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diode","date":"2016-10-18T22:54:10.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I live in NYC but i have school :(","replies":[{"poster":"TDC Demon King","date":"2016-10-22T04:32:48.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will hang out with you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mike17032","date":"2016-10-22T00:17:51.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The staff you have working the Riftwalk is amazing.
