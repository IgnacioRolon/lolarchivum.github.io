Many NFL and NBA players previously played at a college level, where they were then noticed. LCS is not only unnoticed in a majority of colleges, but also taken at a more opportune time for the player. 17-21 years old (the average LCS player) is a VERY big part of life where they're laying down the basis of their college education. An interview with Montecristo (I think at Katowice, not sure), said that the players making 6+ figures in China are actually getting their due, not only because of the moderate popularity and prestige that people give esports regardless of how invalid it is, but because they need that support if they want to give up their time that would normally be used to build their careers. Real sports don't have players as young as LCS for that reason, and the risks are not even close.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Orshabaal","date":"2015-06-11T01:04:51.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"From what I have read most teams don't have formal practice 8-14 hours a day every day. Does that mean people cant do 8-14 hours a day? No, it just means they do not have to do 8-14 hours a day.  Job security is not really applicable for \"sports\". This is because teams want to win to get more fame/money/wins. Unless a teams plan is to sit in the middle of the LCS and never change a roster. \r\n\r\nJust because they do not pay them a million dollars a year to play for them and then putting 500k into their retirement fund does not mean they are not paying them their proper dues","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cynikul","date":"2015-06-11T01:46:18.076+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have literally in my 5 years of playing league ever commented on any of these, but I had to log in to say something, even if its a bit toxic, but; you're a complete moron.  No team has dedicated 8-14 hours of play, or even 7 days a week.  Most players do even get off days.  Sure, they play solo que, and sure they practice as a team and scrim, but not even anywhere close to the amount you're **ASS**uming.\r\n\r\nI don't even know where to begin after that, but just about everything you said is off base with global standards of the sporting and e-sport industry that its just grossly disgusting, and had you not sounded like a genuinely mentally deficient human being, I would have guessed you were a troll.  If the players were at all unhappy with there play, or their lifestyle, they would simply retire and leave the league, just as MANY, MANY players have before them.  Maybe that's someone's reason, but it certainly isn't about pay or overtime or retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: I have spoken to, and discussed to some LCS players this exact topic, and I have friends in the challenger scene.

If the player performs really well and wants a better contract he/she can get one after the current one is over. After all, the organization only took the chance on the player when no other organization did, gave them a roof over their head, food, transportation, any and all electronic equipment, probably their phone bill and a whole lot of other things.

I think this is necessary, and I'm glad they're taking care of it, but dang it tell me if Yusui really did buy level 30 accounts.\r\n\r\nOn the topic on hand, I feel like since esports are becoming more and more popular contracts signed by players need to be released to the public, like in major sports. That way they can compare their worth and get their appropriate value. Right now, there's really no way to know unless a player becomes a free agent and that's a risky proposition because the org. the he/she is with might think you're only worth so much and if you disagree they'll just sign someone new since there's a giant pool to choose from (although not all of it is LCS quality). Also I think Riot needs to transition into a new Free Agent period similar to professional sports. Give teams a month of \"Restricted Free Agency\" to sign their own players (and if the player is rated highly then if a competitive team signs him then the team that loses him can be fairly compensated like in professional sports. In this case, something like 1/2-1/3 of the buyout clause in his contract.) \r\n\r\nThe main difference in professional sports and esports in the comparison of player compensation is that there's no player's association. IF the player's unionized and formed one (though it would be the first international union that I would have heard of - though you guys will probably correct me and tell me a list of like 17 of them.) Also, League has just started really hitting it's stride. It's getting more and more acclaim with Faker even getting an interview with ESPN the magazine. The more and more publicity it gets the more freedom player's will accrue in terms of contracts. But, right now, outside of the case with Quas being like the 12th highest paid top laner in NA (LCS and CS teams), I would say the players are fairly compensated. The organizations took a HUGE initial risk when they started out with investing in esports. No one knew esports would blow up the way it has. Fortunately, their investment has paid off and I think player's will be rewarded down the line.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Tell me what happened to Yusui.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrollFan01","date":"2015-06-11T02:24:37.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"There we go.
