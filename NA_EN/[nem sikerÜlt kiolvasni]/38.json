I play league to have fun and got chat banned for being admittedly toxic, months later and I haven't moved at all because snowflakes like you make riot think that toxicity is the biggest plague in this game.

However, I do not sympathize with those who are actually toxic and say that playing with friends shouldn't involve their behaviours outside of clash mode. However, the comment above isn't all too far from the truth at all. The problem was that going from the status of dishonorable to honor level 1 took an EXTREMELY long time (for me it was about 3-4 months), which led them to patch it in order to make it easier. I do not know how much easier it is now. Other than that, getting from Honor level 1 to 2 should only take a month or so if you play a decent bit and refrain from being toxic. Therefore depending on how much someone plays, someone could have been banned many many months ago for a slip-up and they are now locked from an exciting new game mode.
