Support tanks have been struggling up until recently and its still only a select few who are good; their item paths are severely limited, and certain items are seen as \"essential\" to ALL supports, so nerfing one of their few decent choices may hurt them more than the junglers abusing the item.

She's not supposed to be interested in killing people she just likes to destroy things and sometimes people get hurt in the process, but never intentionally, but her kit is focused on killing people and doesn't have anything to do with destruction.\r\nI'd love to see her focus on damage to structures (turrets), because the only real demolisher champ in the game is Ziggs and Jinx really should be a demolisher style of champ as well. The ADC is supposed to be all about destroying them towers after all. \r\nI'd like if Fishbones dealt additional damage to turrets but dealt slightly reduced damage to champs, or maybe her crit rate could amplify her tower damage with Fishbones. Also her ult is nothing special and feels like just another bland long range marksman execute, and it certainly doesn't match her concept; what about letting her ult hit towers, executing them if they're below a certain health threshold and damaging nearby enemies, if the tower is above the health threshold when it hit's it just deals a decentish chunk of damage.\r\nI'm not a Jinx main, I don't like her simplicity and lack of a unique identity compared to some of the other marksmen so as much as I want to like her I just can't. I actually main support but I'm getting so very tired of how bland ADC's are, from a support standpoint they're mostly the same, except they all either have mobility or CC other than that, they pretty much all do the same thing, click for damage; so I'd like to see more variety between the ADC's so they actually feel significantly different to play with as opposed to just variations of Ashe or Ezreal.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2017-07-25T20:09:14.421+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:222}}  champion select quote.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"N3dO","date":"2017-07-25T18:28:57.511+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"Still waiting on that brawlers rotation riot.
