I have to say that I preferred Nikasaur's presentation simply because her episodes seemed to focus more on art. After checking back a few episodes, I think it may be because the old episodes were longer and better paced for letting us admire the art. Also, there wasn't music in the background to provide any distraction. \r\n\r\nOverall, I will say that I enjoyed All Chat at its high points more than Summoner Showcase, especially the early All Chat episodes. However, a big reason why I started not liking All Chat as much was because of the host switchups that kept occurring.\r\n\r\nThese are just my opinions and I know some people might disagree. Feel free to prove me wrong and help Rito make better content.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLoki","date":"2017-07-22T10:13:06.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea, Nikasaur was the best, was so sad when I saw she was gone from the Summoner Showcase D: {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenTang","date":"2017-07-21T23:59:58.348+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your a little over the top with how your presenting it, I mean, it kind of makes sense cause the episode has a lot of abs in it, but, its the same joke throughout the entire thing. I think honestly it kind of feels like your talking to kids, how yeah we get it abs, wow yeah you worked out nice, all very obvious. Also the jokes are pretty dry, like puns and pretending to muscular is just kind of repetitive. Something I realllly didn't like however, is the fact that all of the art was almost always zoomed in. I honestly don't really care about lee or braum's abs, what I do care is actually being able to look at the entire art and not just the small bits you zoomed in on. Like the lee sin art was cool because it was a speed draw, not because of his abs...yet it barely showed any of the drawing process. \r\n\r\nI would recommend watching what the old show used to do with their jokes and process, and try to model this one after it as people liked it for a reason. It just seems very forced which is why it's a little cringe.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot swimbananas","date":"2017-07-22T00:28:38.385+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Green,\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to share what you think we can improve!

Make longer, less common videos. That is a personal opinion and should be taken with a grain of salt. On the other hand, please, just please stop trying to incorporate the presenter with the artwork. Personally I don't even care if the host is on screen at all. Just give me an introduction to the piece, who made it, what it took for them to do it, give a wee bit of personal insight, and finally have the host read comments, if any, by the creator. We are here to be amazed by art, not laugh, unless the artwork is funny.

It was Riot swimbananas cosplaying as Riot Tryndamere, after cosplaying as the character Tryndamere during the episode proper. An impressive piece of meta-humor to be sure, but because I had to actually think about the joke there it came of as less 'haha, clever' and more 'man, that's awkward.'\r\n\r\nAnd 'man, that's awkward' was the tone for the whole episode, hence the comments on the 'include this in a compilation of Rioters inducing moments of cringe.'\r\n\r\nIf 'cringe' was your goal, then you have done well. If not, please go through some of the Riot Nikasaur tapes to see how format and pacing can let the artwork speak for itself, and have the 'cringe' speak a little less.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SonicFlyht","date":"2017-07-22T13:46:11.449+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are overreacting, it's really not that cringey.

The oration was also pretty good; enthusiastic, yet not as over-the-top as previous episodes. Excellent growth as a caster!\r\n\r\nMy personal preference is for longer episodes, with a little more focus on more obscure data -- data diver at your service! So that little cameo with Spotlight is a great inclusion. A common stereotype of gamers is the overweight chair-warmer, or the skin-baring diva; this helps promote both fitness and a wider audience reality. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion; would you have tips on fitness for gamers? One reason some gamers get into gaming is because of injuries, whether back or leg, so anything in that area would help.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alcaponefan1","date":"2017-07-22T05:05:26.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill be honest.

You may want to make the episodes a little longer, and try to give them a unique flair that's enjoyable.

Often you are blinking in dashing around, fading back and forth, but it does not help your video quality to present all these types of movements. \r\n\r\nI know you are trying to make something eye catchy, but think holistically: you are presenting SUMMONERS not RIOTERS.

The music definitely fits the pace/feel of the video, but this just isn't how the video is supposed to feel. Precise, not accurate. \r\n\r\nJust IMO, bring back the slower and more detailed Showcase where each piece is at least taken into moderate consideration noting some of the crazy work put into them. \r\n\r\nI know it's not as simple as just getting a room to host in and get a larger crew, but even simply sitting in a chair while talking about the creations is an improvement. Standing makes it seem like you're trying to go somewhere or move on quickly, while sitting makes you seem more involved and, thus, makes us more involved. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be anything major, just a few tweeks here and there and we can make Summoner's Showcase great again!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moowy","date":"2017-07-22T03:53:35.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda Found This Summoner Show case boring I know the theme was abs but maybe you could have changed it up a bit to suit it but something different, the jokes were understandable and pretty good.
