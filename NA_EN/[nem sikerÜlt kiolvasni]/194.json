The blade lands behind the target. Mark all enemies it passes through them.\r\nQ (second press) : SNAP the blade back towards you. If an enemy champion is hit by the returning blade, apply the Q stuff you posted here. IF the enemy CHAMPION was marked when hit by the blade, then apply the second part of the Q stuff you mentioned in this post AND allies gain X health on hit on marked enemies for Y seconds. (similar to the live shen's Q).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy? Because shen needs sustain at least early game. You can apply part of the things i mentioned to his underwhelming passive instead of his Q btw. \r\nBut I'm pointing this out after talking to some people who mastered shen.\r\n\r\nAnother thought would be to make the W move the blade to target location before applying dodge, but that would be very confusing for ori players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2016-01-13T19:01:31.262+0000","up_votes":119,"down_votes":13,"body":"I did not see this coming.

I feel like Shen's core mechanic was a tanky bruiser with a lot of sustain early game. The kit synergized really well--your passive cooled down faster by attacking things (doubly so with your shield up), you could trade when you used Q to harass, but you had the ability to farm minions as well.\r\n\r\nThe new Shen isn't going to have any of that. You're going to have a blade you need to keep track of which has a very long range. Your sustain is baked into your new passive--a shield that triggers on abilities. So that's nearly entirely pointless with your W (since you'll be immune to auto-attacks anyway). You are going to get more damage with the new Q, but if you were taking Shen on your team it's because you needed a brick with a taunt, not a damage threat. None of these abilities are going to give Shen any real staying power in lane.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I liked Shen because he had great sustain in top-lane. I could out-last virtually any opponent and wear them down. Mid-game, I have the ability to make an engage or turn a skirmish around into a kill. Late-game, I'm a front-line force that's making engages or peeling effectively for my ADC.
