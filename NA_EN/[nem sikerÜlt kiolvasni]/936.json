If you are not returning to base every 4th minute on the dot, at least, Yellow upgrade gives far more vision power.  The only advantage SS has is that it lets you also stack up with a Sweeper to boot.  And as a jungle main, I honestly tend to prefer the vision power from wards to grabbing a Sweep, just because I tend to need to get that vision control out, and can use Rapts as a short term oracle, or one of the several pinks I buy per game. (I often get 2-3 pinks, specially if they are clearing them fairly often.).  Sadly enough, I've outwarded supports fairly often with my trinket, which tends to stay on CD for most of the game.  About the only time it isn't on CD is when I already have 3 wards out and don't need to move one of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf210310095","date":"2015-11-04T21:28:05.353+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant stress how true this is tho.
