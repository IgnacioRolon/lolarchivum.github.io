The most solo kill was PawN's insane outplay when Faker was playing Zilean vs PawN's Yasuo. PawN had gone extremely aggressive and Faker was trying to kite backwards with bombs and it gets to the point where they both have extremely low HP, Faker tries an ignite flash bomb combo, but the moment he flashes towards PawN who was running away, PawN flashes into faker and Q's him, knowing the bomb wouldn't kill him. PawN lives with only a few hit points.\r\n\r\nI already regard PawN as, if not the best mid, at least the most perfect mid laner. In games where it counts, PawN doesn't die in lane. He doesn't even die to ganks. If PawN is able to win worlds again, he will be the best mid laner ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-01-22T18:37:53.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fluorenide,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=LpEHgfhA,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-01-21T23:02:18.093+0000)\n>\n> It wasn't Dandy's pressure that got the best of Faker...\n\nAll other information invalid.  When you openly disregard the actions of another player on the team for the single play of another you invalidate everything you say. This is a team game, which is why often Faker gets praised for 1v9-ing because his team (in term of skills) seems to be lacking.\n\nPawN was only able to play aggressive because of the pressure Dandy was able to exert on the jungle and the vision that was provided. You also openly ignore the fact that 1v1s that PawN did were the results of leads he had pulled in games. Also the result of counter-ganks, bad pick/ban, and overall sub-par play from Faker. Everyone has a bad game. Which is no excuse or exercise to call either player bad or good.\n\nPawN also, has a number of games that he gets pushed out of middle, out farmed, or completely ignored. To call him the Perfect Mid, is ignorant (though i do not agree Faker is a God Mid either) of the flow of the game and overall spectrum of competitive League. There is no such thing as a perfect player. A player can only practice, project and in the end attempt to assist their team overcome the opponent.\n\nI will say this. The number of plays PawN has had in competitive vs the number that Faker has had is heavily in Faker's corner. That is the only reason the overall consensus on Faker is God Middle/Best Player in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2015-01-23T08:01:28.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm, I've never seen PawN really lose a lane... \r\nAll he was saying, is PawN is incredibly consistent, almost never succumbs to ganks, and lets his opponents play over-aggressive so he doesn't have to. His opponents end themselves.\r\nI've seen Faker make misplays, feed, get out farmed etc. on multiple very different occasions- not just a bad game here or there. This all regardless of any support from team.\r\nHe is good, but overrated. PawN is better.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-01-23T15:02:21.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way PawN was able to stay safe is because the support of his team. Dandy's pressure on the jungle and overall team vision allows PawN to stay safe. Because of Dandy's pressure this prevents the opposing jungle from affecting that lane. This lack of presence from a jungle causes players that have to carry their team hard, to over-play aggression.\n\nI am not denying that PawN is a consistent player. He is extremely consistent but the reasons for that consistency are not solely PawN's playing. He had the support of his team that had such crisp gameplay and more threats than the average team (Jungle, ADC in addition to him). Also, that team was in essence controlled almost entirely by Overlord Mata (shot-caller and in-game strategist).\n\nDuring Season 4, Piglet/Poohmandu/Bengi were subpar. Which lead to, more than once, casters saying Faker was the only redeeming player on the team. This likely being contributed to complacency from winning Worlds.\n\nI also, stated that as this is a team game. Solo Laners successes are largely based on the way jungle and other lanes are handled. If we were to take PawN and Faker. Into a 1v1 custom game (Molten Chamber where riot?). Faker, would likely win. Saying that PawN or Faker are a better player is unreliable when working with competitive play.  Both of them have different strengthens and provide different roles to their teams.\n\nPawN is the stay back and counter-play style. That because of his mechanics can counter a ton of most over-aggressive play styles. Added to SSW team as a whole it was a huge asset.\n\nFaker is an assassin, regardless of his champion, he wants to get in there and kill something. This because of his mechanics makes for more play making, but also can cause issues when/if his team fails to handle their roles.\n\nThis entire conversation is moot because the only way we will see more PawN v Faker (which is soo much fun to watch) is if Edward Gaming and SK Telecom make it to Worlds, or some other international Event.  \n\nKappa","replies":[{"poster":"Nageeh","date":"2015-05-13T14:15:38.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had fun reading your comments, if only the other ignorant YouTubers can read this, will share it with everyone I know.\r\nYou're going by statistics, strategy, and facts of a \"Team\" game-play, while still being a fan of both, yet most people here disregard that and think you're a hardcore fan of Faker.

Oh wait...  I mean, I am not personally offended, and I know it is referencing the common catch phrase of Faker as being a \"god\" of mid lane,  but I would expect more professionalism from a multinational organization such as Riot. It's just a poor marketing decision considering the majority of north Americans have some type of religious affiliation. They could have just as easily titled it something else like, \"The Legend Lives On: Faker\", \"Faker: Back On Top\" or even \"The \"God\" of Midlane Returns: Faker\", using quotation marks to indicate their acknowledgement that it is a euphemism. It's just not the smartest choice to potentially offend a large portion of your fans when there is no need. Anyways, that's just my 2 cents as a player who reads almost every LCS article.
