The enthusiasm is undeniable, and comes through quite well. Being able to speak/perform with minimal self-consciousness is an excellent attribute, especially for a show like this.\r\n\r\nA suggestion; one of the strengths of the previous series was the interaction between individuals and guest stars. This episode appeared to develop in that direction with the eagle inclusion, but would it be possible to bring back some of the older stars as well? I understand this is a new approach to the show, but some of us still enjoyed the old format as well.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion; could some of the updates be referenced? Riven vs Yasuo was an interesting update -- could this show be used as a launch base for heralding future similar actions? Just curiosity on this one, probably make the show longer than the requisite parameters.\r\n\r\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kermadac","date":"2017-07-08T21:02:27.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you using a dead platform like facebook?
