She was extremely squishy to begin with and hanging back during laning phase kept her safe, while allowing her to stand in the back and empower her allies. Now she has to pretty much piggyback on her team-mates to take advantage of the shield/buffs. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow it seems she has to play like a Braum or a Leona in terms of positioning, but now it'll be extremely \r\neasy to burst her down unless her base HP / HP gains per level and resistances are buffed as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nSona isn't very mobile - never has been, even with Swifty/Mobis. Unless there's been a massive increase to her mobility (say on the level of pre-nerf Janna), she's just going to be relegated into a role of dying very, very quickly in team fights if she gets bogged down for even half a second. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe shield does make Ardent Censer a good item for her though, so I'm wondering if that was part of integrating the item into gameplay, along with Soraka/Karma/Janna shields and heals. I like the idea of AP healer/caster supports being more viable, but due to the influx of the current bruiser meta, I'm still thinking Sona's going to have a hard time staying viable. \r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Hope you buffed her health/resistances as well movement speed because the new positioning demands she be in the middle of everything at all times, giving the enemy an excuse to burst her down very quickly. \r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"MooseChangerPat","date":"2014-07-29T20:58:47.943+0000","up_votes":238,"down_votes":10,"body":"This was one of my biggest concerns with Sona.

Also it looks to me a lot like Sona's moves no longer have any form of passive whatsoever, which in my opinion looks a *lot* more like a nerf than a boost.

Riot says Sona will now be more focused around \"moments of power\", but there are plenty of champions who do this already, and much more effectively (Looking at you Thresh, Leona, Braum). The so called \"war of attrition\" was what made sona in my opinion, a niche support. Sure there are other champions with shields and heals, but comparatively, sona's heal is much lower than any of them, in addition to lower scaling. the constant, small heal was what made her so effective vs poke lanes, something we're seeing more of, even at higher elos. her kit now requires more positioning and coordination with your allies, but from what I've seen in the videos you have to be nearly hugging your lane partner to get any extra benefit out of her skills. any decent player will be able to land a some hard cc on either Sona or her carry while they're trying to get the extra buffs, and easily snowball the lane, since Sona and marksmen (happy riot?) in general are so squishy. from what I'm seeing now with the kit change and increased cooldowns, there is no reason to play Sona, since she's basically a very bad Nami. Hard cc ult? Nami has that with longer range. Healing for teammates? Nami has that, with the added bonus of damage or healing herself. Magic buff to auto attacks? Nami has that, and it slows. Speeding up teammates? Hey! That's Nami's Passive! Not to mention damage and cc with her Q. I know one voice won't make a difference, but this kit change won't help Sona, it will just put her into the pool of champs that only a few players will bother to pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Honeybadger2198","date":"2014-07-29T20:41:01.340+0000","up_votes":182,"down_votes":12,"body":"RIP Sona players \"opens up room for counterplay\" meaning any support with any sort of AoE now can hit both the ADC and Sona!

In the video of the teamfight, Sona isn't hit once, which she obviously would be if the Gragas they were playing against wasn't staging the teamfight to highlight Sona. They won't show us Sona being melted in a second because she now has to stay on top of her team. They won't show us the times in which Sona's new q bonus is completely wasted on minions and wards (Yes, it procs on wards.) They don't even show us the pathetically small amount of damage she does for an even higher risk now that she has to stick to her adc and get a combo off.\r\n\r\nIn general, this rework is terrible. The reason Sona had no high moments of gameplay was because she was too squishy to make plays, and the amount of risk outweighed the reward. Now the risk is even higher, and the reward feels lower. She needs higher ratios, especially on her q, and diminishing her power chords value in exchange for an additional 20-30 damage with her q feels pathetic. I'm not going to go into what they did to her cooldowns either, but it's  suffice to say I disagree. \r\n\r\nAfter the rework, I expect there to be a high rise in Sona popularity for a few days, until people realize she's less fun and less rewarding than before, after which we will wait months for her to be brought back out of the deadpool zone. If the changes in their current form make it to live, I'd be very disapointed, as this is making an already fairly weak champion completely unviable. I wish Riot would read these comments and see the general dissent towards these new changes, and realize she needed stronger ratios (Nami anyone?) and a better e (similar to Karma's, which is infinitely better, offering both a targetable shield and a movement boost.)\r\n\r\nIn the end, I hope Riot is able to react to our disapproval and either rework the rework, or just leave a fairly fun champion alone .","replies":[]}]}
