Not to mention it wouldn't be surprising to me if Froggen retired either as he's talked about it on his stream several times.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to be rude at all, but this season NA is where the news has been, not EU, that's why on a shared site the articles favor NA.

In my opinion, the only reason why the Taiwnese top teams aren't better then the NA/EU top teams is because they used to play in the GPL prior to this season, where they really didn't have much competition, so they only play like 2/3 games where they really had to prepare. That's why they did so poorly internationally, where every game you play is hard. Now I can expect that in the future the LMS teams will be closer to the LPL/LCK level, first because they are close to those regions and can regulary play against teams like EDG and SKT (unlike teams from EU and NA), and secondly because of the LMS itself, where the teams competing are way better then the teams in the GPL.\r\nI am not saying that Taiwan is better than NA/EU right now, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if AHQ wins games against Fnatic or TSM during MSI.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bardatzard","date":"2015-04-29T21:32:38.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"With Albis moving from the jungle spot down to support, and Mountain coming in as the new jungler right before playoffs, AHQ has two players who haven't necessarily .
