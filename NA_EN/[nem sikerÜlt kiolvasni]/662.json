And take the most renown players, with usernames removed, and randomly spectate them 24/7 (which might actually be better time-wise considering one person would be on at all times, and you could keep the stream up night and day without waiting on a player to get online, which could be odd hours in Korea).

It accomplished this through League of Legend's spectator data. You also state that Faker, according to RIOT's ToS, has no right or claim on the gameplay content from that data. \r\n\r\nIf Faker has no right to the gameplay content, he is incapable of suffering material harm if someone else takes or copies that gameplay content. Additionally, Azubu cannot contract with Faker for the exclusivity of that gameplay content.  (Azubu can, however, contract for the exclusivity of what Faker does and says on his stream. That material belongs to Faker, and he can do with it as he pleases.)\r\n\r\nWhile Faker cannot suffer material harm if someone takes or copies the gameplay content, he can be harmed if his stream loses value (e.g. by losing ratings, views, etc.). In this case, it appears that you are upset because SpectateFaker caused Faker material harm by causing his stream to lose value; and it lost value because some viewers preferred to watch the raw gameplay content over his stream. \r\n\r\nI understand why this would upset you. A high profile gamer (and his sponsor) lost money and value. High profile gamers and sponsors are large pillars for your company, and are essential to obtain RIOT's goals. \r\n\r\nOn a fundamental level, however, I do not feel that it is RIOT's job to step in and resolve this conflict. It's Faker's job (not RIOT's) to provide value in his stream. If players are preferring to watch the raw gameplay content rather than his stream, it is because it does not adequately fulfill the needs of those players. I think Faker's contracts and agreements (with Azubu or whoever else) should reflect this. I also think that the onus should be on Faker to maintain the value of his stream; he shouldn't rely on RIOT to grant a pseudo-monopoly/license.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, by shutting down player's access to certain gameplay content, you are indirectly subsidizing and sponsoring particular players and companies. This, on it's own, I don't particularly have an issue with, but I do take issue with the fact that it appears that you will only apply this to a certain echelon of players. This appears unfair and arbitrary to a lot of your playerbase. It also creates a large grey area for people who want to use that content for commentary and entertainment purposes. \r\n\r\nAll that said, I agree with you that harassment is a legitimate concern. If someone uses data under the API to shame, harass, or embarrass specific players, I'm fine with that content being removed. However, I feel that harassment is more than merely watching a stream, raw gameplay content, or even simple commentary.\r\n\r\nIf I'm misunderstanding the situation or this article, please let me know, but what I'm seeing here is not encouraging or exciting as a League of Legends player.","replies":[{"poster":"Pelladion","date":"2015-02-28T14:35:52.429+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"*slow claps*","replies":[]},{"poster":"sinZsoul","date":"2015-02-28T21:25:34.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"My comment pertains to the \" but I do take issue with the fact that it appears that you will only apply this to a certain echelon of players\" part of your post. Although I see the logic of almost everything in your post, I must disagree with that statement. Riot has already established a fair judging rule on which cases will require action. In the post, they mention that they will only take action if a single person is being targeted. They even gave example saying they would take action if a bronze elo player was being singled out. \"*This is a precedent that doesn’t just apply to pro players - or to monetary or brand loss*\" You can control-f that to read the actual part in the post. \r\n\r\nAlso, even if they didn't say that, Riot usually takes the path that has the player's best interest. It is in fact a great part of their commercial success because they are interested in benefiting the player. Why would they risk that by doing as you said - making this exclusive to pro players. I would definitely give them the benefit of the doubt.\r\n\r\nThis is another thought that comes to mind, but remember when Riot brought out the new harsher punishment for leaving games system? How, we all thought it would screw up playing because our connections were unstable sometimes? It actually hasn't. They found a way to make it work so that it is an improvement over the previous system.\r\n\r\nSorry for ranting so long, but next time please read and understand the full post. Also, I do believe that you're correct and it is not Riot's job to step in and shut down a stream. I don't think this is a bad policy to take though overall.

Some of the policy I agree with, some of it I do not. For example, if someone uses RIOT's information under the API to engage in cyberbullying (resulting in emotional harm), I'm fine with RIOT taking action. However, I feel that RIOT **should not** take action if the use of that information simply resulted in **material harm. ** \n\nThe quote you pulled from my post is talking about that material harm. Material harm, by its very nature, **can only be experienced by a certain echelon of players.** You don't necessarily need to be a pro player, either; all you need to do is make money or have something of value. \n\nWhile RIOT often acts in the interests of its players, it has made many mistakes.

So, the decision on whether to protect Faker's, or anyone else's, ability to continue monetizing that content ultimately lies with RIOT. Basically, no matter the reason for shutting down a stream, at the end of the day, RIOT (and I suppose the streaming service itself) are the only ones with the legal authority to actually shut down the stream. So, if RIOT were to say that they will not attempt to shut down streams that cause a player monetary or material harm, then they would effectively be saying that there is no protection at all for the monetization of League of Legends content. This is a problem because it means that exclusivity contracts like Faker's have no actual value. Even your ability to generate ad revenue off of a personal Twitch stream would be compromised because someone else could just stream you in spectator mode and there would be no precedent that said this is not allowed.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** If RIOT doesn't cover material/monetary harm under this policy, then there cannot legally be coverage for those kinds of harm.\r\n\r\nI suppose I should also include the caveat that I am no expert, just judging based on past experience and the explanations given.","replies":[{"poster":"Dfenestrator","date":"2015-03-01T21:53:36.914+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MacSquizzy,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=JdItt0zV,comment-id=0053000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-01T19:42:24.732+0000)\n>\n>. . . .

Oversimplifying things, this means that he generally cannot take that raw gameplay content and make money off of it without RIOT's consent. This also means that he generally cannot be materially harmed if someone takes that gameplay content. However, if he takes that gameplay content and adds his own material to it, it may become \"transformative,\" and he can claim/sell it as your own under Fair Use.\n\nYou can make the argument that Faker's stream is \"transformative.\" If Faker's stream is \"transformative,\" it has an inherent value of its own, and Faker can sell or license it as he pleases. This means that Faker has his own legal remedies if someone breaks the protections surrounding his stream and materially harms him. This also means that Faker's exclusivity contract for that stream has value, regardless of whether RIOT chooses to display or use the gameplay content elsewhere or whether someone else makes a different \"transformative\" work based on the same gameplay content.\n\nThe issue in this particular situation is that a number of players have deemed the value of Faker's stream to be lower than the value of the original gameplay content. Azubu doesn't like this, so RIOT decided to step in and artificially boost the value of Faker's stream by limiting the way in which the gameplay content is used. I don't agree with this because I think Faker should be responsible for maintaining the value of his stream; he shouldn't rely on RIOT to subsidize his stream because he cannot make his stream appealing enough to others.\n\nOf course, when all is said and done, it's RIOT's decision to do what they want with the company and gameplay content. I just feel that this is not the most appropriate solution to this particular problem, and may also result in additional problems (community, legal, etc.) down the road.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shimmers","date":"2015-02-27T22:04:48.547+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":7,"body":"Can I opt out of being spectated and streamed?

The contract should simply be FAKER PERSONALLY will only stream on Azubu. I think it's messed up that they get to keep control over who is streaming him. I realize it can hurt the pro players ways of making money, since Faker gets funds from Azubu for only streaming through them, and not Twitch, but I don't think it's fair to remove Twitch streams. I see WHY Riot did what they did... however, I feel like it's giving Azubu a \"monopoly\" in a sense. \r\n\r\nOddly enough, my brother (Challenger Tier) and I used to watch Voyboy a lot. However, when he made a contract with Azubu and moved over there, we quit watching, because we really don't like Azubu. I think a lot of fans quit watching, also. Azubu is \"buying\" players in a sense, and that's all fine and dandy, but what about the fans? I specially stop watching my favorite streamers because of behavior from Azubu like this. I feel like they're buying a monopoly, and in this situation they completely won out. I get it's their business, and all, but their contract should be that specifically the pro player is only allowed to stream via Azubu. THAT is the agreement, and THAT is how they get paid. Whether or not fans stream to watch via Twitch should be allowed, IMO. We should not have to be forced to use Azubu and allow them to basically \"copyright\" all Faker streamed content. Neither party owns ANY of his gameplay, even Faker himself. \r\n\r\nIf the streamer on Twitch was making a profit, or stalking/bad-mouthing/bullying Faker, it would be an entirely different story. The examples used, such as the female gamer or bronze player, were about bullying. Faker wasn't being bullied. He was simply saying he didn't like it, and I'm sure it was because Azubu was getting angry about him being streamed on Twitch. This wasn't bullying or harassment at all. It was simply people wanting to watch Faker via Twitch, instead of Azubu. Why should Azubu be allowed to control that? Monopolies are not a good thing.

If I wanted to take the video down because obviously I have strict rights to my own game play and it is my brand that got me like 2 subscribers on youtube I could file a report and get the video taken down? What tryn is saying sounds like the biggest mistake riot has made in PR in forever. I see people showing up in youtube videos of popular people, saying post facto that they don't want to be put online, and causing many youtubers, twitch streamers and etc to lose a major chunk of their revenue. it sounds like riot has just tipped the nice resting point by taking down a stream And will create a cascade of hell that will ruin a lot of peoples time and effort, and turn the happy part of the community into victims of trolls who DMCA every video they appear in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GUARDXDOG","date":"2015-02-28T02:55:25.690+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":6,"body":"Great, shut down competitive and legal streaming and allow monopolies to exist.

First off, Faker knew he was a role model for many players, and when you're as good and famous as he is, that's understandable. But having thousands of pairs of eyes watching you in EVERY solo queue game is ridiculous, regardless it's his choice who watches his games and who doesn't, and he has the right to control that. Meanwhile, while Azubu technically doesn't own the gameplay, Faker signed a contract with them to stream EXCLUSIVELY on Azubu, and having someone off to the side creating more content than this \"exclusive\" site pretty much nullifies that contract. I think Riot did the right thing here. While the term \"e-stalking\" is way too much to describe this situation, with someone so closely tied to LoL, it definitely is invading his privacy and if Riot messes this one up, a few months later \"SpectateSneaky\"'s gonna come up and Riot is gonna take a whole TON if the don't do precisely what they did right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeolynx","date":"2015-02-28T03:05:21.699+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you understand that if anybody else (that isnt Faker) from the Korean scene was spectate-streamed.
