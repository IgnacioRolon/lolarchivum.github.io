There are players who literally play the game to ruin it for others. It's not fair that people who are trolling other players can not be penalized because this is technically not a re-portable option. Then when we have players who have quite the mastery of the game and they troll, standing clear of the actual lists of re-portable behaviors, they ruin it for other people. This is why things like \"I hope my team doesn't troll me,\" \"win a game, lose a game, win a game, lose game,\" \"I hope we don't have an AFK,\" etc... and then these are the same players that respond with \"Go ahead, report, Riot isn't gonna do s**t!\" It needs to stop. I have been enjoying this game for over 5 years, and it has NEVER been as bad as it is now. Please Riot... connect with your Community and actually respond to this issue/concern. You currently have a strong player base that still enjoys the game, but this issue is making it challenging and for many as DrunkGunz mentioned, nearly impossible to continue enjoying the game with how the matchmaking system currently is, the lack of more harsh and serious consequences for trolling. I really hope other players see this post.... share it.... or a Riot employee sees this post and really takes it somewhere. Help the Community please.

It makes the skin a little more worth it every time I go into a match and get a compliment on having it, it reinforces my purchase. I don't feel this will have the same impact on me personally.
