Possible game-ending distraction:  They can be herded by players.  \r\n\r\nI would pay all of my money to be able to herd Poros around.  This could even be enabled on Summoner's Rift as a Featured Game Mode...  \r\n**-=In order to make this possible=-  **\r\n\r\nInstead of becoming mobile on a Poro-ward's destruction, a Poro is spawned at the time of its placement.  \r\n**=Objective=**  \r\nGet as many Ward-Poros as possible from your side of the map to the enemy's.  First team to herd X number into the enemy base wins.  \r\n**=What makes it hard=**  \r\n1.) Poros do not want to be herded.  They will initially be faster than the ones on Howling Abyss though they slow down to that speed over time, and they will move erratically away from your champion.  They will always move away from an approaching champion, never back towards one.  \r\n2.) There will also be an enemy team trying to herd their own Poros into your base.  Stop them and steal their Poros for your own team.  \r\n3.) Towers will deal reduced damage to champions, but will still cause trouble for a champion attempting to charge straight down a lane.  \r\n4.) Using biscuit-potions produced by the 'Biscuiteer' mastery point will cause Poros to temporarily be attracted to the champion with the biscuit's effect.  Attracted Poros will not run from the affected champion, instead they will follow it for a short time.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI just made a game mode for something that doesn't even exist.
