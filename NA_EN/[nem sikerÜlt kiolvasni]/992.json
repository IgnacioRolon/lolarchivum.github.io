Minor increase to base stats, sure. Passive is weaker. Innate attack speed is nice but you dropped the cleave from 80% to 40% so that is a major drop in her damage and no more mana restoration from the cleave.\r\n\r\nPale Cascade has a longer cooldown at early levels when she is most vulnerable and you dropped the numbers on her shield and dmg amount. As well as how much she got in terms of ability power to stats. So all together nerf to w. (The .1 bonus health does not make up for it.\r\n\r\nLunar Rush of course can't have the same scaling since it is no longer an R, but you still kept the cooldown similar and nerfed the damage. Base of 220 at full ranks vs 120 at full ranks, lower ratio (.6 vs .4). I am literally spending 40 mana at early game to deal 40 dmg and Diana has no escape tools unlike say Kat. Why would I risk dueling then? I can't even burst. So not only is the passive dropped in damage but the shield and rush has dropped in damage.\r\n\r\nFinally the ultimate... We switched a 20 seconds cooldown on Diana's old R for 100 seconds. Sure, 400 dmg + .6 in a small circle around her (with bonus damage for more enemies) is pretty nice. Small issue, I still got a tacked on 80 seconds from the old combo. On top of that, as an assassin... I don't really wanna nosedive into the enemy. Sure you could say:L TANK DIANA, but my ratios are lower now, so I need even more AP to be able to deal similar damage as before.\r\n\r\nTL;DR You've nerfed Diana in what was supposed to be a buff rework... congrats Riot.","replies":[]}]}
