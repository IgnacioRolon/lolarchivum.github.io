It's kinda vague, but how I see it is that if you get two items from a minion round: it will randomly drop it combined instead of broken apart. So if you get a Giant's Belt and a Tear but had a bf sword and nlr on the bench... Even though you probably want the components so you could make morello and shojin or zekes and ludens, it could randomly just give you redemption. It's added rng that can ONLY be negative. Because if you wanted to combine the items, you will.\r\n\r\nNow if it's just a rare chance to drop a combined item period, not \"auto combined the items you got\" it'd be kinda nice.

What I mean by that is if you were to combine the item, you'd do it. It takes away the decision to combine it or not. That's negative, no matter if you think items are a problem or not. (item diversity is actually really good right now. It's just that some items are a lot worse than others. It's not that some are better.)\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind, items are built to counter certain comps and empower your own. If you're playing gunslingers and are against a healing heavy comp, you neeeeeeeed Red Buff or you lose. So what if you have a chain vest on your bench but it drops a completed redemption? Even though you needed that giants belt and could have made use of the tear later on, you LOSE now because the game decided to combine the items for you. Now say it it drops that Red Buff instead. What do you gain from it? You were going to build it anyways. There is no situation where the item dropping pre-made actually is positive. It's only negative.
