D K / K K / M M / S S / V V All the names have a first letter that have a pair. But the D K and that is the name of a monkey. Which means the next champion is a monkey type. Maybe a friend of Wukong. Also there are 4 Void champs and 4 primary Mages. 2 of those are Void champions so you cancel them out. Kass and kha are both assassins so then you look at the secondarys which is fighter and mage. So the new champion is a fighter mage. But then the t from Kha is missing in fighter. So that means any secondary that starts with t means something. But from before the void creatures take up the    V V and the mages take up M M and one of the secondary tanks are (SK)arner Which takes up the S S and the K K. So then the only secondary tank left is Mundo. So if you take away the t from the tank you get ank. Then you add a H and get Hank. So all of this means that the new champion is a Fighter Mage, Monkey whos friend is Wukong and his name is Hank. Also one more thing there are 3 K's which mean something. If you take monkey and take the K out you get money. Which means Rito wants all are money.
