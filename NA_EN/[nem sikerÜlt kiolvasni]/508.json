At the same time, I predicted that this indirect R buff would lead to R nerfs, and that Riot would continue backing themselves into a corner on this issue until she's nothing more than another burst champ/veigar wannabe. At which point she'll be reworked because a champion centered around nothing but a point-click R isn't much fun to play as or against and that niche is already filled anyway.\r\n\r\nLooks like we're right on schedule.\r\n\r\nSyndra is looking less and less like the champion people originally fell in love with. Riot has done nothing to this champion but continue to nerf the parts of this champion that actually made her fun for the sake of preserving what is probably the least-loved aspect of the champion.\r\n\r\nSpamming Q and throwing damage in every direction and manipulating that was what made her kit unique. Her R is not only the most gameplay-toxic part of her kit, it's also the least interesting part to use! Spamming Q and the trade-centric gameplay that makes is fun. Repositioning spheres with W to be threatening from multiple angles is fun. The positioning game between players that E creates is fun. And not only is it fun for the Syndra, all of these are full of counterplay and can be fun for her opponents, too.\r\n\r\nCounting spheres and point-clicking? Not very interesting. Not very engaging. Is it a necessary tool on her kit? In our world of assassin/mobility creep, sure, that reliable burst plays an important role. But is the ult the part of her kit that makes her fun? No.\r\n\r\nSo why are we focusing her kit more and more onto the part with the least counterplay? Why are we focusing her kit more and more onto the part that's the least fun, both playing with and against it? The only answer I can come up with is that Riot doesn't understand this champion at even the most basic of levels. That no one on the gameplay team plays this champion, and no one bothered to even try to ask anyone that does play her what actually makes her a fun and unique champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Rivini","date":"2017-08-08T23:50:54.156+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":28,"body":"At least Syndra continues to maintain viability as an intolerable lane bully and isn't hard countered by a single mid-tier item.\r\n\r\nBoo hoo, she lost .1 on her Q's ratio and **gained** .1 on E. The world is certainly crumbling down on you.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Malzahar mains have had to put up with Riot's BS \"balancing\" patch after patch after patch. Literally nothing but nerfs for a dozen straight patches, both small and massive, until at long last, he received a compensation buff alongside a nerf. Was shocking to be sure. Now that more people have realized they can buy QSS and shut him out from playing the game, he's not viable anymore and Riot rejoiced.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, Syndra, one of Riot's rare AP golden children, must remain strong and viable at all times.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonism","date":"2017-08-09T08:06:17.033+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sense the presence of salt in this comment...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2017-08-09T08:21:46.199+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly im fine with them reverting her to her season 5 form if it means lb gets the same treatment.
