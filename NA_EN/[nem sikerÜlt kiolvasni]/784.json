The stuff in the shop is basically worthless and not worth how much prestige points are worth. Previous event skins should have come back because those are what people actually want. I grinded, spent more time on that than school/work, hoping prestige skins would be available once again. Downvote me, but it's just not fair to the majority of us who were either not on at the time or taking a break. I previously heard rumors that they were going to bring back the skins. I'm curious as to what changed your mind. Garena keeps rereleasing prestige skins over there so why not here? Run by different people, I know, but what makes it any different? They promised it was an event exclusive over here? I could easily just switch to Garena servers but I am not making a second account after all I've spent already.","replies":[{"poster":"Th3zig","date":"2019-12-14T08:40:07.974+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not only that brother/sister, But I would also like to purchase old event chromas to which would be pretty neat.

I missed out on Prestige Lux due to not knowing how prestige worked and while I did get the Yuumi bundle at the time, I was not able to get her formal chroma because at the time had no idea about the formal chromas being exclusive (along with prestige lux).\n\nAnd like it's been stated in the past about them wanting to \"respect our investments\" I literally do not care if prestige Qiyana comes back.
