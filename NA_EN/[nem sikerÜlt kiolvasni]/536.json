I'd argue that the mistake was nerfing it to a point where it isn't viable in competitive play.  Oh so much fun another Elise/Lee Sin/Vi/Kha game.  What a joy.  At least FF made a TON of junglers viable who were not.  It didn't take any viability away from the Elder Lizard junglers.  It just made a vast array of others in their league.  And because people in low elos can't ward the enemy jungle to set up kills on the afk farmers, it was a mistake?  \r\n\r\nFor someone who talks about wanting to give different strategy, you basically say that farming jungle is not one.  \"There's no counterplay!\"  Of course there's counterplay ward his jungle, go in there, get a free kill, profit.  While old Yi is farming his jungle for 20 minutes, I've snowballing my lanes to the point where he is irrelevant anyway.  That's a tradeoff.  That's making a choice.  FF is a risk item.  You risk all of your lanes losing while you farm and then being the only decent one and not being able to carry.  \r\n\r\nBut no...it was a mistake to make Xin, Jax, Yi, Shyv, Udyr, Noc, and others viable in the current meta.  We'd much rather see the same four over and over again.  \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, I guess Riot has shown that they have a strong desire to make people like Nautilus(since he's the one the devs always bring up) and Maokai viable junglers.

Those champions are mostly played by well-known players. However those are either picks made by their preferences or due to their feeling of the current Meta. Sadly, those champions will be played by the majority of the playerbase.   \nIn addition to this there are some \"pubstompers\". Those aren't really meta or FotM but those are hard to play against, especially when they gain some money/feed. And those champions can execute their combo without much Counterplay. The old {{champion:38}}  was one of those offenders. Sadly, the rework needed some time and playing against those champions is fairly annoying and most of the time these champions have more than 80% pick/ban rate.  \nThus my question: Would it be healthy to the game if those champions receive 5 point hotfix nerfs? By \"5 point hotfix nerf\" I mean a sudden change to a certain skill of that champion by 5 points. Then Riot have to see into the metrics and look into the differences. Funnily enough, most people will stop playing that champion because they overreact to the nerf. It would be an interesting experiment.  \n*Edit: This experiment would be best for a preseason.*\n\n\nThe Clarity paragraph will be a little bit shorter.  \nAside the fact that I want to advertise my [Death Recap 2.0](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/E0oY8MNH-death-recap-20-suggestion-including-example-layouts) to improve the clarity of death I want to address the clarity of remaining random abilities, especially {{champion:9}} 'Dark Wind'. Other abilities like Katarinas 'Bouncing Blades', Mastery Yis 'Alpha Strike' and the fear abilities were changed to remove the randomness. However there are still some entities which inherit the random factor and I really like to remove them from League of Legends, because it doesn't belong into a competetive game. In addition the designers can balance champions without a random mechanic better.  \n\nZanryu\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2014-05-28T22:15:38.928+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"Those are good points, and we do intend to follow up this general feature with dev blogs going into more detail on each value.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe don't think randomness necessarily violates the clarity value. Randomness is just one of those challenges you need to overcome and can help ensure that players are actually reacting to current situations at that moment. When randomness gets out of control is when it gets to the point of randomly winning or losing, which was the problem we were trying to fix with fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of counterplay, having a single powerful ability or even a combo that is tough to counter isn't necessarily a violation of that value. As the opponent, you can time your own abilities to try and go in when your opponent's cooldown is down for example. It's when you feel like you literally have no options that counterplay is really being violated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific tactic you suggest of making frequent small changes is a viable one and we have done that on occasion. There is also value to ripping the band-aid off quickly or making larger changes to make sure we're actually moving the needle. It's tactically simpler sometimes to overshoot the target and then correct back than it is to incrementally buff or nerf something that is going to end up taking dozens of increments to reach its target (if that makes sense).\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of you got this intuitively, but it is worth restating that these values are aspirational -- they are what we want the game to be.
