I don't know the exact formula, though I'm sure Riot does, but if they give new skins to unplayed champions then it's inefficient, costly, and wasting income whereas if they wait until a champ is more popular then the skin pays for itself on release as there will be enough sales in the beginning to pay for the skin which is the sweet spot for a business like Riot that relies on that sales interaction, they have to make money to survive after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Capt Archon","date":"2017-08-10T00:26:12.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so the obvious answer here is to play the dickens out of w/e champ you want a skin for! and bring all your friends to play him/her/it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hungry Cancer","date":"2017-08-10T01:52:37.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL Yes but if the champ still needs a rework or is on the radar for one then they will not receive the skin until rework time, even if they hit a 20-50% playrate, such as Swain and Morde who have no hope of receiving a skin before rework and are on the radar for said rework. Once a champ is slated for a rework you can kiss the hopes of getting a new skin goodbye. \nAlso it's unlikely that you have ten million friends as so far the sweet spot for champs getting reworks appears to be a regular monthly player base of 10% and in a game of more than ~100 million players with many games on them each month, its very difficult to pump up the numbers enough to skew the data significantly. It also would require keeping the numbers pumped up for 3-6 months or more and hopefully the Morde rework will happen before then. To be honest though I'm not getting my hopes up.
