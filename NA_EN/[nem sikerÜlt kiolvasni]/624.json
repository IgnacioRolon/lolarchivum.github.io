I will say that playoff synergy will always go to TSM. C9 has shown up in worlds, but TSM has stood out in NA since the beginning. you call TSM 4 rocks and bjerg, but you can ask bjerg what he thinks being that he is the shot caller on his team. Yes, if bjerg gets focused out, TSM will lose a good amount of games that way, but I have watched Dyrus turn around and carry. Last of all, TSM has consistently been the no. 1 team in the NA LCS since the game came out. History dictates that TSM is the top for a reason, because no matter what players they promote from play or get rid of, they consistently stay the strongest team in America. Again, no disrespect to c9. They are a great team for a reason. I would love it if they beat out TSM competitively and consistently, but that hasn't been a factor yet. Anyone who can beat out the top dog will amuse me.

The problem with trying to gauge his relative power is the fall of assassin mids and the popularity of control mages; individual outplays are rare in the current league structure and the top tier mids in NA have significantly improved. \r\n\r\nThe team-based play that Hai favored is dominant now, and it significantly degraded the number of outplay opportunities that Bjerg used to dominate with.
