After tonight the name Draven (487 RP) will be... esteemed across the globe.”\r\n“Patience, dear Draven, nothing good ever comes from rushing a magic trick.”\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, down by the pond, the local pandas were up and about eating some bamboo, but the “hunter” was interested in something a bit rarer than your average Panda, and a heck of a load more dangerous.\r\nHe was hunting a Yordle.\r\nHours of patient waiting were about to pay off, because I’m sure you all want to see a trick.\r\nAs Panda Teemo (487 RP) went to go sit down and eat bamboo, the trickster set off to do his work.\r\nFive minutes later, he was done, and the Panda was none the wiser.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n“I know what you are here to ask,” said the Totem.\r\n“And your answer is?”\r\n“Look to the pond,” replied Totem Maoki (260 RP), “but doubt your eyes at all moments. The eyes are privy to deception.”\r\n“Will you come to assist me?”\r\n“You know I cannot leave, I have been chosen to be the diviner. The visions swarm me with uncontrollable force, and this temple is the only place other than the institute which is both safe and has primal energy. I, of all people, cannot disrupt the natural order of being.”\r\n“Then I will make sure to keep this place as your safe haven, and hope that you return to peace.”\r\n“Thank you. Oh, and one more thing Grandmaster.”\r\n“Yes?”\r\n“Carry your old identity like a turtle carries his shell, it is part of your strength. Do not forget who you once were, Jax (375 RP).”\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n“Time to get this show on the road.”\r\n“Then I guess it’s time to make an appearance,” LeBlanc (395 RP) said ironically as she disappeared into the shadows.\r\n“Subtle? Ha, I don’t do subtle,” he said while he rushed into the dark.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n“Nice try little fishy, but you can’t fool me that easily,” said Panda Teemo, “We’re more than just cute and adorable.”\r\nAs he said this, he began secretly correcting the damage that had been done. The trickster had replaced some of the poison in the dart with salt water which would implode the dart when Teemo inhaled, squirting it into his mouth.\r\nInstead, the Panda insulated the dart with bamboo, and then filled the salt water with his signature poison. Now it would blast poison straight at Fizz (440 RP) but it would look like salt water.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nThere he was, standing above the forest, ready to initiate mayhem.\r\nOn his way Temple Jax saw the entire axe activated traps and magic sigils; the plan was now clear.\r\nThey were going to destroy the southern ecosystems.\r\nWith the natural order of the Plague Jungles, The Fyrone Flats, The Voodoo Lands and Kumungu disturbed, magical creatures would seep out searching for vengeance on civilization; and the nearest ones would be Azir’s under construction Shurima, the Yordles beloved Bandle City, and Noxus’s arch rival, Demacia.\r\nThat could not be allowed to happen.\r\nIn one deft movement, he leaped to where Draven was standing and began to fight.\r\n\r\n…","replies":[{"poster":"AmrTheGreat","date":"2014-10-24T01:19:31.361+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ready to put his trick into action, Fizz playfully leaped in front of Panda Teemo and yelled:\r\n“Come get it you boring little shorty.”\r\nActing as if enraged by the attack, Panda Teemo dashed forwards and fired a dart at a laughing Fizz who expected Teemo to receive a mouthful of salt water.\r\nIt was only just in time that he dodged the oncoming blast, because the tree trunk hit by the water instantly shriveled to the poison’s effect.\r\n“Nice try their Fizz, but you should never underestimate the power of the Scout's code.”\r\nSuddenly, they heard the sound of a spinning axe followed by the thud of a felled tree branch.\r\nElsewhere, pops were heard as sigils were activated.\r\nWith a silent nod, they knew what they had to do.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nEven though Draven had been intercepted, they had each set up enough traps that one of them alone could carry out their plan; and that is exactly what LeBlanc intended.\r\nHalfway through, she felt something was wrong, so she looked back.\r\nThere was nothing there.\r\nAs fast as her magic let her, she distorted reality to travel as fast as she could towards Draven; but the Panda was already waiting.\r\nThe moment she appeared he fired a blinding dart at her, which she dodged by distorting back to where she started, right into Fizz’s Dragon-Shark.\r\n“One jump ahead of you,” taunted Fizz.\r\n“And whoever thought we could deceive the deceiver with some basic misdirection,” said Teemo.\r\nMeanwhile, the fight between Draven and the Temple Warrior seemed even. While Draven kept chucking axes, Temple Jax kept batting them back.\r\nHowever, Jax started moving forward, so Draven took a step back.\r\nAnd then another.\r\nAnd then another.\r\nAnd then…\r\nPOOF.\r\nTeemo had snuck behind and placed a shroom behind Draven, which unsteadied him and allowed Temple Jax to come in for the stun.\r\n“I’ve still got it,” said Temple Jax, “and know it’s time for you to pay.”\r\n“I don’t think so,” said Draven, “DRAVEN OUT.”\r\nAnd he disappeared in a glittery haze of Black Rose magic.\r\n“Then the deed is done,” said the Temple Guardian, “Maoki will be pleased.”\r\nFizz and Teemo exchanged a satisfied nod.\r\n“See you tomorrow,” said the clever Panda, “not that it will end well for you”.\r\n“I won’t be so easy on you next time,” retorted the trickster with a chuckle. For next time was now. He had already hidden his Dragon-Shark in one of Teemo’s shrooms.\r\n\r\nSorry it's a long one but the combinations of characters (The dramatic Draven and LB, the temple themed Jax and Maoki and the two Satans fizz and Teemo) begged for an infinite amount of stories.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed reading it.\r\nPlease post feedback, even if you didn't like it that much,I'll take the positive criticism, just as long as it doesn't sound like a flame war starter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GetToTheLantern","date":"2014-10-23T17:43:18.007+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Heh riot pulled a {{champion:7}} and went poof this week.
