If soccer was so popular, then ABC would probably have made bids against ESPN to broadcasting rights during weekdays, but guess what, it didn't. Consequently, the Olympics are more popular in the US than the World Cup, let alone your average year-round soccer match, which again you can find on Univision.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be fair to say that soccer is a growing sport. It's just a baby. Did you know that the MLS has only been around since 1993 (21 years)? In contrast, the NBA was founded in 1946 (68 years), the NFL in 1920 (94 years) and the MLB was in 1869 (145 years).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brazzercise","date":"2014-07-03T21:54:25.026+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"@Fewnomial I would hate to assume that everyone on the internet is dumb, but you might want to look up what company owns ESPN.

She waited patiently a couple of seconds to get the perfect shot.\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand in front of her, put her fingers like spiderman, and fired a web. It landed perfectly on Pantheon, who was frozen in place.\r\n\r\nShe tossed an exploding spiderling and a blast of neurotoxin, then she went into spider form.\r\n\r\nIrelia began firing her blades at the now helpless Pantheon. As he saw the spider coming down on her to finish him off with her venomous bite, a single manly tear ran down his cheek. If he had only been a baker... This wouldn't have happened.\r\n\r\nElise looked down on the corpse of her enemy. She smiled.\r\n\r\nIt was time to gank bot lane now. [Bandit Sivir (375 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx3OPx7a2E4) was pushing the turret, so it should be quite easy to catch her unaware.\r\n\r\nShe walked towards the bottom lane, ignoring the nearby jungle camps just to get there faster.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she saw how the enemy team's midlaner, [Dynasty Ahri (487 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWDPpoiNB74), went down to help Sivir bring down the turret.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" whispered Elise as she ran towards her enemies, \"2 birds with one sto...\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped in her tracks.

Did I disconnect?\"\r\n\r\nBut no, a normal disconnect wouldn't have brought down her health so much.\r\n\r\n\"Who is your summoner?\" Asked a voice behind her, \"and what does he do?\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't recognize this voice. As soon as she was able to move, she turned around to face her attacker.\r\n\r\nThere stood a blue dude with an axe (292 RP), facing her.\r\n\r\n\"Uhmmm... Who are you? Your model and textures look so outdated, are you sure you shouldn't be in DOTA2?\"\r\n\r\nThe blue guy sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Sion!
