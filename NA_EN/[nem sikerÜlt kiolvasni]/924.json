Are there not plenty of characters that would fit that role that could be used instead of forcing one that could not be farther from it into it? I dunno, it's just weird.

I'm Risu the artist of this comic and I'm glad you brought this up. A few of you have been wondering why this version of Zyra is so dopey and unlike the character that she is portrayed in the game. For me, they're the same person! \r\n\r\nMany years ago, I got super into Zyra as a character and studied what could be her personality and behaviours from her lore. She is absolutely the survival of the fittest kind of character, that much I gathered. But I another thought occured to me: wouldn't her being a plant woman make her super awkward in the human world? She wouldn't exactly have a great grasp of how society works as she would appear to have. She's a plant!\r\nThis led to many comical stories being created about Zyra and what it means to be a plant in a human body. \r\n\r\nThis AU comic is an adaptation from this interpretation. If you'd like a better understanding of this kind of Zyra, my old art blog can be found here: ask-zyra-thecuriousflower.tumblr.com \r\nI guarantee you'll enjoy another side to  Zyra that hasn't been explored before!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sandwich Sage","date":"2017-10-03T19:31:55.274+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"TOO INNOCENT INDEED","replies":[]},{"poster":"Achory","date":"2017-08-16T00:28:12.956+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"but wait, graves has a mafio skin as well as a riot skin... does that mean he's a leak within the force? :thinking:","replies":[]}]}
