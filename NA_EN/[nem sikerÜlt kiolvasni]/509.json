If tank supports want roughly the same amount of gold they are forced to take cannon minions which puts them in prime poke territory. This just gets harder as the game goes on when you have to compete with the ADC and mages.

Fighting over cannons is how the game is forcing interaction between laners that might otherwise not interact at all. More interaction leads to better expression of skill. \r\n\r\nYes, they can save skill shots to hit you while you walk up to a cannon, but if you bait the skill shot and dodge it, miss the cannon and then all-in on them while the abilities are on CD, then you win the trade or outright kill that Lux. It is worth.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, relic shield users can use their passive almost all game. Frostfang users can’t as the game passes from persistent laning interaction to dancing around engages.\r\n\r\nThere are some explanations that might alliviate your concerns. Also, you should try asking your team to let you execute. If they don’t, keep asking. If they still don’t, then that’s the way things are. Not everything is perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"Agimus","date":"2018-04-04T04:02:52.983+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":6,"body":"Sir, you're a top laner. I checked. It doesn't work the same way. One cool down doesn't mean the enemy is vulnerable like it does in top lane, especially when there is a ranged ADC who doesn't need to cast anything to destroy you for trying to get the tank minion and you can't plan a juke that will allow a tank to dive two enemies like that. Also, why wouldn't the other support items remain relevant throughout the game and did you not read that it gets harder to execute siege minions later on? It's true, especially when people can lose the gold if your execute rewards some other player who got closer to you when you execute it. They want more fun for them, and telling us that it's just too bad is not a valid argument. Riot introduced support and jungle items to ensure that these roles didn't feel so sacrificial and frustrating so that our team could win. You should have a little sympathy rather than debate over roles that you don't play with people who do.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-04-04T11:41:13.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think they're just trying to force out tank supports.
