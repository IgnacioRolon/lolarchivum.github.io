Plus, URF is meant to just be spell-spammy fun. I've never gotten mad in URF just because the enemy team drafted a better team than me.

Especially since this week we are seeing Nemesis Draft).\r\n\r\nI know transparency isn't the best, because posts like L4T3NCY's post about the state of RGM and its likely direction, especially around the fact that nemesis probably wouldn't be seen, as this week shows, will be wrong. But could we please get an idea on why some game modes are showing up so often and others so rarely? Is URF really that unpopular when its out? Is Poroking / Ascension / Hexakill the best thing since summoners rift?\r\n\r\nBut it is really disheartening to look and see that most of the game modes have come out 2x as often as URF. (Counting DND Siege and Nemesis as 'new' game modes) And I know next week its going to most likely show that One for all will be there again. But where is URF? I like that game mode the most (being a support main, being able to actually do damage, make plays and all that is really a breath of fresh air and quite fun! You know, what RGM was supposed to be all about), and have seen it the least.","replies":[{"poster":"Tonkuhz","date":"2016-08-21T19:07:48.850+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid post!\r\nJust wanted to add one thing URF didn't come out 4/1/16 like it normally does.
