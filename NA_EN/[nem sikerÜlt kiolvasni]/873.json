That is Copenhagen Wolves business, and Riot has no rules in place to not outright lie to your players to encourage them. If there was really no evidence about such allegations, why did Riot mention it? The original investigation yielded nothing and should not be used to damage peoples' good name. In fact, the worst part of this was not the stretching of the definition of affiliate, but the suggestion of another investigation that went nowhere. From there, this false allegation was also used in deciding a punishment for Dentist? So, he is found innocent yet still his punishment is influenced by it?

Since this has happened a ridiculous number of times in such a short time span, clarity from Riot I feel is necessary.

Nothing found in the investigation of him sharing strategies was used in his punishment. It was the tampering that was found in the course of that investigation that is the cause of this ruling. Your outrage is unwarranted as he broke the rules that are put in place and enforced by the company he works for!\n\nAs to your final statement, Riot ruleset only involves the discussion of team changes, hiring of, and acquisition of any contracted individuals with other organizations while they are under contract.
