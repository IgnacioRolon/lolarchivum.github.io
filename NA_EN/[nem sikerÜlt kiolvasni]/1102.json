I played old Malz a lot and before the rework AD Malz was the most common build on him outside of bronze, I played it often myself as it was quite fun, so I'd say his voidlings were a significant part of his kit, they did deal 50% of his TOTAL AD at that point and if you knew your casting rhythm well enough you should've had a voidling out almost constantly even on AP Malzahar and they actually did respectable damage and had decent health at that point and made a hell of a lot more of a difference in fights than the current pathetic voidlings do.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkale","date":"2017-06-01T06:13:34.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they did 100% of his AD pre-rework and that was the basis for his ad being so good, and after the rework yes, they did focus around him being a minion-mancer but pre-rework I only ever saw myself play him AD in my matches. \n\nWhile the voidlings are great for adding a jungling/voidling based playstyle that is completely different from other mages, they are impossible to balance around while keeping any other playstyles viable so I personally prefer having versatile spells that can be used for zoning, peel, and damage than focusing on voidlings that they've only had work in a way that was fair/balanceable as his passive.\n\nAnd just to clarify, while the reworked malz is definitely pet focused, I was just saying that besides the niche jungle malz gameplay he wasn't _**focused**_ around it as much as his other spells and overall anti-diver/ burst mage playstyle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2017-05-31T19:23:03.396+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":9,"body":"I am not a fan of the Malzahar changes. By making voidlings less durable and shifting damage to his other skills he becomes less unique. I don't know if I'm in the minority here but I enjoyed the update (the original one from last midseason) that made his gameplay significantly revolve around his voidlings. It made him play and feel different from every other champion in the game. It additionally introduced mastery in the building and control of voidling swarms and windowed power around the timing of voidling cooldowns as well as learnable counterplay for opponents. The less Malzahar's voidling matter and the easier they are to kill the more he becomes about his combo, at which point he's no different than any other burst mage.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, easily answered but not telegraphed mechanics traditionally have lead to champions being strong at low levels of play where players don't know how to answer them but weak at higher levels of play (E.G. Teemo's Mushrooms). If Malzahar is balanced around opponents killing his voidlings he will be unbeatable at low leves, if he is balanced around his voidling damage he will be unplayable at high levels.\r\n\r\nTLDR: the Malzahar changes make him less fun, less unique, and harder to balance","replies":[{"poster":"Arkale","date":"2017-05-31T20:37:51.640+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"There has been a very noticeable group of people who have been asking for them to move away from the voidlings since 6.9.\n\nReasons being that they don't like the unreliability of the post-rework voidlings, and that the original malz's theme and playstyle was never really about voidlings with the exception of ad malz which is more effort than it's worth nowadays.

Such a fucking stupid change for THE pet mage, so many better ways to have fixed him like changing his retarded passive that resulted in most of his abuses, or making the voidlings more dependent on AD for damage so AP Malzahar can't shred you with his voidlings even with absurd AP and AD Malzahar could shred you with voidlings but doesn't deal much magic damage.

Most aoe is just going to 1 shot them with their health, as would a lot of other mid laner spells (played a few games and I've seen it happen constantly). Funneling the damage from his minions into the r also leaves it open for someone to just rush qss and then your r just does no damage as it cuts off the damaging beam.
