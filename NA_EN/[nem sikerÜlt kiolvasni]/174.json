If you like him, play him; if not, there are another 120+ champs to chose from.\r\n\r\nI am an avid Taric player, and I don't want to see my main changed needlessly.

His kit as it is now is functional, no doubt, but it's also not cohesive. Some parts of his kit say 'support', his heal, his armor aura, and his ult steroid for allies. \n\nBut then if you look at these things, a lot of their power is tied up in things that aren't for a support, his heal is more effective when used soley on himself, his armor aura gives HIM bonus armor, of which only 12% goes to allies and it goes away when he uses its active which reduces an enemy's armor, his passive gives him damage base on his armor, his ult has more stats for him and only gives half to his allies. \n\nFurther, his kit is all over the place, his armor reduction, ult, and passive seem to indicate an all in support but the only tool he has for that is his stun which doesn't even last that long even if you rank it up first. Meanwhile his heal and armor aura say safety/passive support but Taric doesn't scale well into the late game as a support mostly because, again, he has only one source of cc that is single target and doesn't last long.\n\nKeep in mind, this is me looking at Taric as a support, if you were to take him solo lane top then he functions more as a tank that deals damage and can make up for falling behind with his utility and tankiness but I'm a support main so I can't really theorycraft on that use of him all that well.\n\nThe main problem he has is just, kit cohesion, what is it about Taric that makes people pick him over someone else?

I don't see what's wrong with that. While Riot's current kit design philosophy might say that's bad because he doesn't have a strategic niche, I would say that the fact that he can do just about everything **is** unique--especially in light of Riot's recent trend of designing champions' kits as uber-specialized strategic caricatures.\n\nAs far as Shatter's bonus armor goes: activating shatter only gets rid of the flat armor bonus that he gives to himself, not the aura. Yes, reducing his armor reduces the strength of his aura, but only by 3-4 armor, even at max rank, which is a healthy type of tactical decision to incorporate into a kit.\n\nRegarding the non-supportish elements of his kit, there's a reason that his secondary type is Fighter (NOT Tank). As long as he hasn't been starved of gold or experience, he has very good dueling power. That's simply a (vastly under-utilized) part of who he is.\n\nWhile I would agree that his kit lacks mechanical cohesion, I think it has absolutely beautiful thematic cohesion as a gem-wielding paladin, and to me, that's what matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2015-11-14T03:50:34.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with Taric, and keep in mind I am speaking as a Taric main here (well I have more games on naut but I am a Taric main at heart) Taric is like Viktor, he just does everything.  The difference here is that first of all, Vik does everything at about 70-90% efficiency, Taric on the other hand hovers from 30-60% efficiency.  On top of that the role of the sup should really be clear.  A mid who does everything works with most teamcomps, but a sup who does a bit of everything does nothing to help the teamcomp.  Taric is just too weak and too spread out in a position in which you really want a champ that does 1 or 2 things really well.

That being said, there are a couple of points in your comment that I disagree with.\r\n\r\nFirst is the competence with which Taric does his little bit of everything. I interpret your statement to mean that he is underpowered (correct me if I'm wrong, but if so, please try to be a bit more precise in future comments). Taric has been hovering above a 50% win rate for a while now (and has just spiked up to fifth highest winrate in the game as of 5.22), so there's good empirical evidence that he's a viable champion.\r\n\r\nSecond is the point about him lacking a strategic niche. As I've said before, I don't see this as a bad thing. Plus, you literally can't get more universally helpful than by giving a 35 AD, AP, and Armor buff to your entire team--for any reasonable team comp, it's a guarantee that all three of those stats will be utilized to some degree. If anything, I'd say that it's mid-laner, not the support, who needs to be proficient at one or two specific things.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2015-11-15T03:45:54.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree with a couple points you made.  First of all your last point. Supports almost always earn the least gold in the game.  They also have a couple items that they HAVE to build (Starting sup item, Sightstone, and boots before anything else)  This means that the vast majority of games supports only get to build 1-2 items to benefit the team.  These are usually things like Zekes, Frozen Heart, Locket, Banner, and Mikaels.  This means that a support has to focus on doing as much as possible at 1-2 things because they don't have the gold or inventory room to build to do damage and tank and weaken the enemy team.  A support has to buy items that match their scaling and boost what they already do to make an impact on the game.  A mid laner on the other hand can build to waveclear, poke, all in, and kite because they have more inventory room and all those items work together well.  Hence why Viktor is really powerful right now and why Taric is relatively unplayed.  \n\nAs for your point about Taric's win rate I have an example that fits this very well.  Skarner had both the 3rd highest win rate while being the 3rd least played champion in league at the same time for a while.  (Might be off by 1 or 2 places, my point still stands)  No one really played Skarner so a lot of players didn't know his exact CD's or by how much his q got reduced on autos.  However most of the people who did play Skarner didn't just play Skarner, for most of them Skarner was one of their top 3 played champions.  They knew the champ inside and out which is why he had an amazing win rate. It is the same with Heimer, most Heimer players are Heimer mains so Heim has a higher win rate than champions that everyone plays.  \n\nI do agree to an extent with most of what you said in your 3rd paragraph though.  But I will go back to my point of supports not having many build options outside of their first 3 items.  The armor buff on Taric is pretty small until you at least have a frozen heart.  But unless they have a 4 AD team or 3 Ad and 2 weak AP then you really have to get a locket which only gives you more on your heal, not on your aura.  So the armor passive is no reason to pick him unless they are almost completely AD and your ult is super useful if you have a team with champs who like both AD and AP (Corki, Eve, Akali, etc)  Taric really is only an asset to his team if both team comps fit and he gets to his Frozen Heart.  Otherwise the only thing he has to offer is a buff that buffs himself more than others and a bunch of super long low impact CD's in the early game.  I still love him and put in plenty of games on him because I am so comfortable on him but I can completely understand why Riot feels the need to change him.  And don't tell me that they can just buff his numbers because then the Top lane unkillable Taric will just come back and go back to 1v4ing people with 0 skill required, it was a thing, and it isn't needed again.","replies":[{"poster":"mvmlego","date":"2015-11-15T07:20:48.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Part of the miscommunication with the mids/supports subject may have been that we were both using the term \"things\" ambiguously.

So, you're addressing the validity of my conclusion that Taric's 52%(-55%) winrate is indicative that the champion is viable. But, despite my request, you didn't clarify whether the \"30%-60%\" line was an argument that Taric is not viable (and your other comments haven't been conclusive on this specific subject, either), so I'm still not sure if we're arguing over a non-issue here.\n\n3.

Sure, it's not a skillshot, but it does require reflexes and an understanding of opportunity cost, and it does have counterplay.\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, several assassins can get their full burst off in less than a second, which means that if you're sluggish with your stun, there are negative consequences. The fact that it's single-target and has a medium-long cooldown outside of an extended duel means that using it carelessly during a teamfight or an enemy gank makes your ADC vulnerable. The range is perfect. It's long-enough to prevent Taric from being hopelessly kiteable, and unlike Tahm Kench, he's not stuck on a 200-unit leash to his ADC. On the other hand, it's not long enough that he can stun targets that he's completely unable to chase down, and the fact that it's damage falls off with distance means that it can't be used as an obnoxious harass tool.\n\nThe ability also has a reasonable amount of counterplay. It can be countered by:\n\n* champions with a spellshield\n* champions who can block projectiles\n* champions who can go untargetable\n* items that block or remove CC\n* champions who are invulnerable to CC\n\n\nAltogether, that adds up to about ten champions and three items that have mechanics that can outright negate the ability. Plus, even if it can't be blocked or negated entirely, the duration can be reduced by the various sources of tenacity.\n\nAlso, as a side note, remember that there are some distinct disadvantages to point-and-click abilities--the primary one being that it can't hit targets that the user doesn't have vision of.\n\nMaybe I didn't address your specific concern with the ability.
