The data is sent via EM waves, basically light, and that light has to physically travel to a point, be read, and travel back, with the travel time being your ping, and latency being the time difference between when the information is sent and when the bounce back is recieved. Lag results from high latency, usually a result of poorly optimized routing such that instead of going from point A to point B, it travels to points C, D, E, and F first, in either direction or in some cases both. This poor optimization is what Riot is currently fixing by structuring a dedicated, customizable network.
