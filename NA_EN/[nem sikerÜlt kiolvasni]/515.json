Just be warned.\r\nWhen I first saw the emotes system coming out everyone I knew was against it. \"Why is riot trying to make the game more toxic?\" Nevertheless I wanted to study the actual impact of emotes in a game, so I watched one, and something blew my mind: empty all chat. There's such a grey area in trash talk. You can't draw any real lines when something goes from friendly banter to personal. This was different. Nothing for the other eight players to read, just a momentary troll picture and probably an eye roll. That's it. That's fine. Actually.... that's great. So i told everyone you guys were genius. Now that they're out... If you went through with this system it's because you found it to be a genuine improvement on all chat. In other words: the game needed it; not wanted it, needed it.Even if I shelled out $20 for a set instead of buying a whole other game with free online capabilities(I have quite a few at this price, so don't pretend there aren't any) it would provide me with zero reassurance to an actual game improvement because my teammates wouldn't have it; my enemies wouldn't have it, and this whole thing could have been an overpriced mute button rework. There are plenty of games that include emotes to improve environment. On top of that champions already have emotes. You could have at least included a base set of emotes and charged for exclusive ones so we can all \"Stop dying while typing\" if you really believe that's important.
