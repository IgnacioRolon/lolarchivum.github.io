Can you understand the definition of strong and weak? How EDG made into semifinals? And secondly, how EDG lost the match of their first time vs SKT on msi? Pawn and Deft can not carry clearlove, korol and meiko? Or, deft makes too much mistakes in that match? Thirdly, can you find any top laner stronger than korol in the whole msi, and any jungle stronger than clearlove? benji? huni? mountain? marine? sorry, they all lost their lane vs EDG. according to your logic, the one who deal the more damage, get the more kills, is more strong? 5 players of in EDG express very well as their own role, and, the point you mentioned EDG is weak in early game, let me tell you, that is, as one of the best teams in the world, both skt and edg will not give their the opportunity to comeback if they get advantage in the early game.(i do not expect you understand this point) Last, even  the official editor like you have such a poor understand on this game, i think that's one of the reason the team in Europe just stop at the S2.
