I'm also  currently sitting on 18 gemstones right now. However, even with this amount stockpiled I really see no reason to spend any of them on skins that have no value to them other than to be collectible. Plus I loved that tidbit from awhile back about the SKT skins where you wanted them to be so much better and you blew away my expectations for them, which is why I own 3/6 of them currently. Sadly, now that you spent so much effort on a set of skins I guess you gave up on making other skins worth their prices now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ęros","date":"2017-08-17T17:18:08.725+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"But why isn't this just a legendary Hecarim skin?
