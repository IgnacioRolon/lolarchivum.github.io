He didn't have a buff between his rework and his Lcs debut, but people didn't start playing him that much until then.\r\n\r\n Nunu is strong in a tank meta because he has two sources of % hp with cinderhulk and his consume passive, and despite not having any hard cc his ult is so strong that people will often burn summoners to get out of it, it does massive aoe damage, and  it removes a ton of stats to anyone in the aoe,  but he isn't meta because the pros don't play him in Lcs.\r\n\r\n Nasus is strong in a tank meta because his wither makes the enemy marksman significantly less effective , he has a spell that can do large damage even when he builds full tank, and he has aoe armor shred, PLUS he has aoe % max hp damage, but he isn't meta because pros don't play him in the LCS.\r\n\r\n The thing is what is meta isn't always what is strong, it's what's popular, and lots of people will blindly follow what the pros do, making it meta.
