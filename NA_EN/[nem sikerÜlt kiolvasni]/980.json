The problem of depression isn't like the problem of homelessness or other problems related to lack of resources, so it's not like you can build a house for one person and just give it to them.\n\nIt would cost a lot of money to set up a scholarship(one that won't just run out in a few years), and it would only benefit the recipient. Also, competing for said scholarship is probably difficult for depressed LGBTQ youth, and having a panel choose a recipient would be fairly difficult. Consider that you could change someone's life by giving them $2000, or they could have a good talk about their feelings and how to deal with their situation that would help them much more.\n\nI think that, if we're talking about capital expenditures, what would be more effective would be setting up more programs like Trevorspace. Essentially, rather than investing large amounts of capital into a relatively small number of people, invest a large lump sum into something that benefits the community. However, supporting said investment requires human resources expenditures, for development and support.\n\nSo, the fact that they're spending on human resources doesn't mean they're a bad charity.

So, I don't see with their criteria what the problem of their choice of charity is. The fact that Riot is donating this to charity at all should be celebrated, but instead people complain about the choice. My advice would be if you aren't happy with it, go donate to a charity you would prefer, and let Riot donate as they see fit.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-06-14T02:42:24.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nariil,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=AB15XyG1,comment-id=002b00000000,timestamp=2015-06-14T02:40:06.487+0000)\n>\n> The fact that Riot is donating this to charity at all should be celebrated, but instead people complain about the choice.

Fine LCS players lots in 1 month fundraising effort\n2.  Give to \"Charity\":  Take credit for all the \"Epicness\" you are doing\n\n\nWhy was there no corrective actions in spring but yet now all in summer?....\n\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"Nariil","date":"2015-06-14T02:47:03.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is money from last year, actually, as it says above. They took extra time, as they say, to try to pick the right charity to donate to. And it is a charity, I don't know why you're putting it in quotes. Even if they are donating for PR reasons, they're still donating to charity. Whatever the intent, it's helping people. Donating in general could be said to not be a 'serious effort' when one could say, go out in person to volunteer for a cause, but money helps too. I personally know people who have had their lives saved by this organization, and I'm glad they're getting this support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Swaggbeans","date":"2015-06-13T02:40:29.074+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"I feel like the fact that they are donating the money in general is great. They could've easily kept the money to themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd being a gay player, I'm happy they're focusing on the LGBTQ community. Children growing up have it so hard and sometimes have no one to go to.\r\n\r\nKudos Riot. ","replies":[]}]}
