I played Pokemon on the gameboy almost everyday in school. I was always bullied by the cool kids at my school. I decided that i would go on strike. So i became a professional gamer in my moms basement. In 1986 I bought my first computer. I still use this computer to this day. In 2009 I beta tested League of Legends. League of Legends was a game that reminded me of my experiences with Pokemon. Ups and downs almost every game, and by downs I mean people telling me I have down syndrome. I however am not a victim of this disease I was tested on July 23rd 2009. The doctor told me that I am unique, not down syndromed. I spent years in my moms basement striving to be the best gamer around. When ranked finally came I played it immediately and was very pleased to be ranked in Bronze 5. When you think about the Olympics bronze means 3rd. So therefore i was 3rd best in the whole wide world. That day that i became Bronze 5 I began my long treck up the ladder. And by ladder i mean the ladder from the basement to the living room. The sunlight almost killed me, but i knew my mother would be proud of me, and so i marched on. I slowly and slowly climbed my way up the ladder but suddenly i slipped and fell all the way back down to the bottom. I almost killed myself the, pain and suffering that i felt while lying at the very bottom of this ladder was unexplainable. I began my trek back up the ladder and slowly climbed out of the darkness. As i was taking my last few steps up the ladder it seemed as if the darkness was grabbing me and holding me in place. I would not let this phase me now I was so close to my goals. I pushed on and climbed all the way out of the darkness. I stood at the top of the ladder and was blinded by a golden light. This light seemed almost unreachable, yet i reached it. It only took me 4 years of my life to achieve this wonderful feeling and be in the position of which i am now.\r\n\r\n> \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\" -Martin Luther King Jr.\r\n\r\nTake these words into consideration as you fight for the rank you desire. Don't let the darkness destroy the brightness that lives within you.\r\n\r\n> \"Life's not about how hard of a hit you can give... it's about how many you can take, and still keep moving forward.\" -Rocky Balboa\r\n\r\nI have achieved Gold V this season and wish all of you luck on getting the rank you deserve and desire.\r\n\r\n                              -Thanks For Reading","replies":[{"poster":"gdogwillis","date":"2014-11-07T00:56:08.688+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Post of the Season!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Central Incisor","date":"2014-11-07T12:21:29.717+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm pretty sure this guy has down syndrome, which only makes this story more compelling.

That's what happened to me in season 3. I got placed s4, then I went on a losing streak and dropped to s5. Then, I found myself struggling to win. It took me a while to realize that I wasn't winning not because of bad teammates or smurfs, or even trolls. I was losing because I sucked, and the fate of unskilled players is loss.\r\n\r\nSo, I proceeded to read a ton of guides, watch videos, streams, and practice with friends who I knew were good. I soon gained the game knowledge and mechanical ability I needed to carry myself throughout the ladder this season, and carried myself from bronze 2 to gold 3. I highly recommend getting good before trying to tackle the ladder, because the ladder is supposed to be reflective of your skill, not the other way around.\r\n\r\nTry watching a bunch of people like foxdrop, gbay99, and the leaguecraft lecture series. If you haven't already, memorize every champion's skillset and what roles/builds they can do effectively. Also, try to be mature about things that go sour in games. Don't flame your teammates for making mistakes, and try to recognize what you could've done better, because most of the time bad things happen when multiple people make mistakes. And last but not least, enjoy the climb! If you're getting stressed out, then take a break.
