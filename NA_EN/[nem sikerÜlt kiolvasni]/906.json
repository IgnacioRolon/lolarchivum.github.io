But don't quake in fear: rather than being a stone-cold killer, she's a down-to-earth teen with budding potential who's not afraid to get her hands dirty.  She probably likes rock bands with gravelly vocalists, or the kind with a light tremor in their voice.  She's a diamond in the rough, and you sure won't find her living in any glass houses.  She _could_ kill two birds, but she has a heart of gold.  She may not be the most experienced in her field, but she's boulder than you think and can still rock the house when played in toph lane.  But if there's a fight mid she's only a stone's throw away thanks to her ult.\r\nUm, I'd imagine she gets along with Galio and Malphite pretty well...\r\n\r\nI think that's all I got for now; I might unearth more later.","replies":[{"poster":"Colorful Dream","date":"2016-05-06T22:46:34.081+0000","up_votes":91,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could dig up a couple more.\r\n\r\nIt's not her fault that you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
