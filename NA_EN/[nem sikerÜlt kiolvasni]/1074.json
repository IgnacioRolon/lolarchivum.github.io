Specifically, I disagree with the fact that Meteos is a better jungler than Bengi. You can bring out the KDA factor, but you gotta keep in mind that NA as a region is still subpar compared to Korea. The top teams may be general close in skill level (Not saying they are even because worlds hasn't happened yet), but the weaker teams of NA are definitely not as strong as the weaker teams of Korea. Couple that with the fact Meteos liked to build full tank farm jungler (Higher surviveabiliy), I wouldn't say KDA would be good indication of better jungler. \n\nSo clearly I don't think Meteos is a good enough reason to say C9 will win over SKT. However, I think that C9 can definitely beat SKT, but if they win, it would be through Impact vs Duke. Though I am a TSM fanboy, I will admit playoff Impact is a better top laner than playoff Hauntzer. I will also admit to watching the SKT vs TSM scrims and tell you that Hauntzer was consistently better than Duke. I think the swing will come from the top lane which will allow C9 to win at least one game because I do agree the rest of the lanes are largely even. \n\nEDIT Sorry Blank* not Bengi ","replies":[{"poster":"Reliable","date":"2016-09-22T00:47:52.418+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see why you'd get trashed for disagreeing with this article at all.

Hauntzer struggled against Impact once the meta shifted back to solo lanes. Anyway back to the C9 vs SKT, as for rest of lanes being largely even I think that's a bit off.

Plus that's assuming that other teams manage to dominate in the laning phase (which TSM is generally pretty good at), otherwise TSM can just straight win lane and there's no chance at all.  If you can't beat TSM's macro-game, you're gonna struggle to find ways to win and Meteos was definitely feeling some desperation in Game 3.

I also think it is a mistake to discount them based on scrims, as everyone knows that scrims aren't the same as real games. I think the NA hype is real, and that C9 has a real chance to make it out of groups, but I do think it will be as the 2nd place team. Breaking them down by lanes, you see a clear advantage in ALMOST every position for SKT.\r\n\r\nTop Lane:\r\n\r\nImpact vs Duke: Heavyweight Title Fight\r\n\r\nAdvantage: SKT (contingent)\r\n\r\nImpact has been at times, and certainly at the end of the summer split, the best top laner in NA. However, as has been said elsewhere, Impact plays against Hauntzer and Darshan. Duke plays against Smeb and Ssumday. Duke is, when in proper form, the second best top laner in the world. He doesn't lose lane, he has amazing 1v1 potential, and is arguably one of the strongest split pushers. The way C9 wins this Group is if Duke fails to play to his talent level, and Impact continues his bonkers play from the end of NA Summer. Duke is the better player, but which Duke will show up to World's is the real test. Will it be the 2015 Spring Split MVP? Or reckless and slow to TP Duke from Groups of MSI?\r\n\r\nJungle:\r\n\r\nMeteos vs Blank/Bengi: Passive or Non-existent\r\n\r\nAdvantage: C9 (non-conditional)\r\n\r\nMeteos is the better jungler in the current META. Not really a question or even a reckless statement. Blank has at times been one of the world's best junglers, but his staggering inconsistency is his downfall. Blank from IEM, latter half of 16' Spring, or MSI brackets is better than Meteos. However, that Blank seems long gone in the recent months, and Meteos is as reliable as ever. Neither jungler exerts the type of relentless pressure of Peanut or Karsa, but even amongst the passives, Meteos is the more active player. Blank is as non-existent in recent games as Faker's smile. Meteos has the ability to affect the close matchups of the side lanes and could easily turn a supposed SKT advantage of Duke into a crushing powerhouse for Impact with well timed pressure and ganks. \r\n\r\nMid:\r\n\r\nJensen vs Faker: Bowl Cut vs Godly Bowl Cut\r\n\r\nAdvantage: SKT (non-conditional)\r\n\r\nFaker is the best player in the world, and anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand the Impact (hehehe) he has made on League of Legends or the eSports world as a whole. Many point to the loss of SKT to KT as proof that SKT won't be the dominant team that dropped only a single game at World's. Where Duke, Blank, and even Wolf seemed to sag and bow under the length of the series, Faker played like a man with nothing to lose. His complete destruction of Fly was demoralizing, and only Score having the best series of his life saved that series. It exploited the huge weakness of SKT, the jungle, but also highlighted how Faker seems immune to even team wide slumps. Faker rose above in what was likely the most heartbreaking series of his career and triumphed, even as his team fell. Jensen is a good player, mechanically as well as the macro game. He is likely the second best Mid-Laner that NA has, with the potential to go even against even Faker. However, barring Score-like pressure, I can't imagine him winning lane. If Faker gets even a little support for Blank/Bengi, it could easily see a rout of even one of NA's finest midlaners. However, I do not think that Jensen is so outmatched that he shouldn't even play, and he will certainly perform to the best of his ability, keeping Faker from single-handidly rolling his team.\r\n\r\nBot Lane:\r\n\r\nSneaky and Smoothy vs Wolf and Bang. Are 2 heads better than one combined?\r\n\r\nAdvantage: SKT (non-conditional)\r\n\r\nSneaky and Smoothy are the weakest part of a strong team, and even calling them weak implies a lower level of play then have been showing. They are a good duo, and present a decent lane. However, Bang and Wolf are, in tournament play, the best bot lane in the world. Hyperbole? Maybe, but if so, not by much. The constant comment from casters and enemy players alike is that BOLF move as one, think as one, and perform as one. Their synergy is crazy, and with Bang being perhaps the most mechanically and instinctively skilled player in the world, they present one of the strongest oppositions to C9 clenching groups. Sneaky and Smioothy are a solid duo that perform well, but they never carry the game on their shoulders, and it is hard to imagine them performing without the constant care and attention from Meteos, who may be needed Top to provide a vital edge in the thriller that is Impact vs Duke. Without supportive ganks and roams, it is hard to imagine BOLF losing lane. If Bang gets ahead, and he will, eventually, get ahead, he can carry the game. Wolf seems to instinctively know the play needed to get Bang ahead, and the two combined provide a formidable wall. However, they aren't immune to slumps, and overly farm heavy play, as MSI and the finals vs KT Rolster showed. Constant pressure can put them behind and allow for strong roams from Sneaky and Smoothy to slow Faker and possibly put Jensen ahead. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think SKT has the advantage, contingent upon them playing like the championship team they have shown they can be. \r\n\r\nSKT over C9, with the caveat of possibly dropping a game to C9 before hitting their stride. Slumps are for everyone, but only one team has two giant Summoner's Cups in their case. Hard to bet against a record like that. \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2016-09-22T12:15:34.058+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing you just looked at his rankings and didn't read the post.\r\n\r\nHe basically said that he expects SKT to prove stronger than C9, but to drop a few games early like they did at MSI and end up in second during groups.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinzaren","date":"2016-09-22T16:05:29.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I read it, I just disagreed with some parts :] I don't think they'll drop games in Groups though.

They will need a serious Worlds buff to become a first place team.  Last year, they reverse swept themselves, and I have to wonder if it'll be the same this year - they start strong, but then the other teams figure them out and they grasp at straws and burn out at 3rd in group.  Impact has been great lately, and Meteos has been slightly off, but that will be ancient history by the time the games start.\r\n\r\nI'm not confident that anyone can really predict anything in this group, and I want C9 to do well.  But I'm guessing 3rd place, which is maybe even more likely than 1st.  I might change them to 2nd for Worlds Pick'em just to send some energy, though.  It's such a toss-up.","replies":[]}]}
