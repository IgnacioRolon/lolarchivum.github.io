Why would Riot want to move to a different system than Pando P2P to provide P2P downloads?  First off, Pando P2P shut down a while ago which means that all of your LoL patches and installs have been using traditional download methods (like straight from a central server).  \r\n \r\nWe think that having a method to get patches from players near you is important because of two things: First, the latency between players on your local network or subnet can be faster than connections to a more centralized distribution system.  Second, having many ways to download updates makes the system overall much more resilient against network errors and minor hiccups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2014-08-13T21:39:50.880+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pando has been Defunt for a while and as of now causes too many problems. The point of having the p2p system in place was to roll out patches with higher speeds.
