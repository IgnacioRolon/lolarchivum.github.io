Some champions, like Sion for instance, were so far behind and their kits were so underwhelming, that Riot remade the entire champion. Riot prides themselves on their balance levers, which is their ability to make small adjustments to champions when they start to get too weak or too strong.

He spent a lot of time wandering around behind his carries, that's part of why they lost the second game, he was wandering behind Corki (partially Corki's fault) the team. Corki got hooked and blown up stranding Naut. This led to him dying as well.\r\n\r\nEven in the laning phase he basically never roamed even though the Naut pick power is potentially really high. And, even though he stayed in lane, he didn't really go for any 'Thresh-esque' plays for the vast majority of the time (even the casters were talking up the 'kill-lane' potential).\r\n\r\nHonestly, it felt like he was, for the most part, playing Nautilus like he would play Annie, and, honestly, at that point I feel like Annie would have just been better as he wasn't fully capitalizing on Naut's kit.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I like Lemon's play overall, and he is obviously more skilled than me, but in LCS or out I haven't been a big fan of his Naut play.
