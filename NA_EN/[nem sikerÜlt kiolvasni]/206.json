However, it's far more likely to look at your local hardware to see if your WiFi is good or not. \n\nAre you on a USB dongle that barely has any power to the antenna, and thereby needs to be within 15 feet for a good, stable connection? Do you have a laptop with a pretty strong build in antenna? Do you have a PCI-e wifi card with multiple antennas?\n\nHow about the router? Is it the generic router your ISP provided? Those usually have low range and low power and low number of bands for your WiFi to connect and operate on. Or did you spend some money on a new router? Multiple antennas? Is it SUPERCHARGED™!? **ULTRACHARGED**™!!!? \n\nHow many other devices are connected to it? Is there another piece of equipment that can cause interference nearby, like a cordless phone, a microwave, etc? \n\nWiFi is great for convenience. Watch TV, download a game from the couch, check your email or FB from wherever, since most internet requests don't really care about lost packets or delayed packets, it'll just get sent again. Buffering is awesome for tasks like that. However, games really need packet 1 to come before packet 2, which comes before packet 3, etc. WiFi makes it somewhat often that your game has to be put on a very brief hold while you get one singular packet again, and then super-speed chugs through the other packets it was waiting to process to get back up to proper time again.\n\nUsing an ethernet connection prevents most sources of interference and loss from your environment. At that point, you will only lose packets and have ping spikes if your router/modem, ISP, or Riot has issues, not because your cat plays with your WiFI dongle and causes a ping spike. (Of course, he could play with the cord and gnaw through it, but that's another story).  \n\nIf your WiFi works perfectly fine, awesome! No need to do any changes, enjoy it :) But if you're seeing some spikes, possible disconnections every now and then, you may want to look at improving your WiFi connection at home, or possibly testing out an Ethernet cable and seeing if that's any better.

WiFi is radio for data, and just like radio sometimes there is interference that makes it hard to hear what is being said or broadcast.  \r\n\r\nImagine two people in a large empty room having a conversation.  It probably does not matter where they are standing in the room, but if there is no other source of sound, the two people can easily have a clear conversation without any issues.\r\n\r\nNow add 100 more people into the room and all trying to have conversations at the same time.  Things get really noisy, really fast.  How close two people are to each other and how loud everyone else is, will impact how successful the original two people can carry on their conversation.  They may even have to repeat what they say several times.\r\n\r\nPacket loss works the same way.  If a computer sends a packet to another computer, but the other computer never receives it, then the packet ends up getting re-transmitted.  And taking longer to get there, which adds to the latency.\r\n\r\nBecause radio waves are being used to transmit the data back and forth, and since there are a limited number of different radio frequencies (channels) that can be used, there are lots of opportunities for interference and congestion which can lead to packets not getting delivered the first time they are sent.\r\n\r\nEthernet cables are like traditional telephone land lines, you generally only have two people on the call.  So as long as you have a good cable, you should have no trouble hearing what is being said.  There can be hundreds of other phone conversations taking place on cables right next to yours, but they will not impact your conversation.  But even on cables sometimes things need to be repeated, just not as often.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about WiFi, is many of the older WiFi adapters use the 2.4GHz radio band which has a limited number of channels.  There is also a 5GHz band with more channels and is generally less congested, which can deliver a better WiFi experience.  But both the router and the computer's WiFi adapter need to be capable and configured to use the 5GHz band to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other factors involved in how packet loss happens on WiFi, but hopefully this gives you some understanding to what is happening.\r\n\r\nGreat question!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flewb","date":"2016-08-12T17:19:08.249+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started off with WiFi, which was causing constant spikes due to my computer being upstairs and my router being downstairs.
