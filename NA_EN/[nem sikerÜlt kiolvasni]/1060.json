It's very obvious a lot of people would get rp for Christmas and use it pretty quickly after getting it, and people would also spend money they may have gotten during Christmas on rp. I think it's really unfair that riot delayed this bonus or at least the announcement for the bonus so much. In my opinion, it's really stupid they are doing this and they really should have told us sooner. It's even more annoying that they said people wouldn't be refunded for rp purchases made earlier. It's just ridiculous. They should have put at least a little bit of thought into this before doing it. It seems like someone at riot just thought of this like the day before this announcement and they agreed it was a decent idea. Come on riot.

The same could be said that it was unfair for riot to have sales in July, and not in Decemeber when people usually get gifts. **The truth is probably that riot has a huge spike in profits in Decemeber from Christmas and then a HUGE low in Jan, cause no one is buying so they need to have incentives to keep people buying.** I'm not mad about this. You got your full amounts worth at Christmas, this might be incentive to buy again, or not. Either way its only a skin or two difference. And the thing is, these Riot employees are great.

You choose to buy RP for skins for most people but some just like to do it to support the makers and they are content.

With money people chose to pay them. If you don't like it, deal with it. The reason I don't play ranked too often are the toxic members of the community who ruin it by just feeding ON PURPOSE (not to be mistaked with just getting beat in lane), the trolls who refuse to cooperate and then flame the team claiming to be a D1 smurf who expect wins and ranks to fall into their laps. I can bet that most of the angry people here are those guys. You chose to spend your money on something that helps this game and community stay alive and a better deal came along and your mad. If you want to take advantage of this deal go buy RP then. If not, oh well.

When that company does things they don't appreciate, they complain, as per their right to complain (about anything, but especially things they give money to). If their complaints aren't heard and their grievances get worse... well they might stop spending money.\r\nThis is how customer service works. Everywhere\r\n\r\nAxle the Beast- It's both a free game and a business, it's truth no excuse.\r\n\r\nRiot is a business, most games are a business. they are just smart enough to offer a game for free so people will be interested in it. \r\nThe problems is people think they deserve everything and have a say in things when this is just a free service. The offers they give are perks to show off, like the many other games out there. If you don't want to spend the money, then don't complain. Most people will shut me off now, since they don't like to be blamed or shown the truth. But for those who still are reading this, they used the holiday for some more income, just like Halloween and the summer skins. It is a business on the side that people like so be happy this game is free to play not pay to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Axle the Beast","date":"2014-12-31T22:02:16.780+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":19,"body":"The fact that some people play the game for free has absolutely no bearing on this discussion: This is an event that affects people who pay money, and no one else; the only people complaining are paying customers. Bringing up that *other* people might play the game for free is completely irrelevant, so I don't see why it would be brought up at all unless it was being used as some kind of excuse.\n\nIt's NOT a free service. This is a business which is funded by transactions. The fact that the payment model allows lower-level free service (even if that low level happens to be rather high in this case) doesn't change that. A paying customer has every right to complain about services involving payment. The free content has no bearing on that.\n\nOf course if people don't want to spend the money, they shouldn't complain, but that's exactly the problem: EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO SPEND MONEY. We all love the game, we all love the free and the paid content, and we want to play it more and buy more content. Customer service complaints are never matters of people who don't want to be customers; they're matters of people who DO want to be customers, but don't feel they're being treated well.\n\nAnd I wouldn't even care if it WAS pay to play. I bought Awesomenauts -- another MOBA -- which requires money to play, and I bought the expansion, AND I bought tons of skins that weren't even free with a paid copy. And had I known about the kickstarter for the expansion when it was up, I probably would have helped fund it too, because I wanted to play the game.\n\nDifference between Awesomenauts (via Steam) and what's going on here with League, is that Steam does its savings events DURING Christmas, not after. I bought tons of Awesomenauts skin for lower prices during that event (since Steam doesn't use a points system, just direct money transactions, the pricing is the best parallel) with no issue and no complaint, and I know DotA 2, one of League's biggest competitors, did the same thing though I didn't buy anything from that game.\n\nThat's an example of two of League's competitors doing better customer service, so Riot should take notice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tarots","date":"2014-12-29T22:41:09.023+0000","up_votes":106,"down_votes":56,"body":"Except you choose to spend money, Riot is a business and they don't try to \"piss of their fans\" they try to make money to keep their business strong for themselves AND the players.\r\nPeople trying to make Riot the enemy when they let you play their free game.\r\nJust another normal day among the LoL player community.","replies":[{"poster":"Axle the Beast","date":"2014-12-29T23:45:33.271+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":38,"body":"I don't understand why you specifically cited Riot as a business out to make money while still trying to use the \"it's a free game\" excuse.

Even in cases of legitimately free content (not just better-value content like this is), the goal is to make money, not to be Santa Klaus.\r\n\r\nIf someone does something good but does it in inelegant or manipulative ways, of course someone's going to complain.

What Riot is doing is the exact same thing nearly all retail companies do every year.  It is a sound business practice to provide incentives during low/off seasons to boost sales.  Riot made a ton of money during xmas that is for sure but since everyone bought everything they wanted this month that means Riots gross revenue is going to suffer for Q1 of 2015.  They did absolutely nothing wrong by posting this when they did, in fact, as a business man and professional I applaud Riot for this tactic.  They are going to maintain a stable income/growth rate well into the new year with this promotion and as someone who didn't even get any RP for Xmas I will be the first to take advantage of it.  Refusing to refund people for purchases made prior to this is also a sound and smart idea on their part because essentially what a vast majority of you players (children) are saying is you feel you are entitled to return your product just to buy it again at a lower price because of a promotion...  I'm sorry but that is actually considered fraud in some states.  It will cause Riot to be in a very bad spot come Q1 if they allowed it as they would lose a huge amount of their income for the previous year and would be completely counter productive from its intended purpose.\r\n\r\nPut it this way:\r\n\r\n1. They allow you to play the game, unlock every champion/rune/rune page for free.\r\n2. They maintain a very high level of customer service and quality by keeping server downtime to a bare minimum if any.\r\n3. They don't harass you with advertisements (like most FTP games) or make you wait in between matches or even have any limit on how much you can play at all.\r\n4. It costs them a large amount of money to provide this service to you (FOR FREE).\r\n5. The ONLY thing you cant get without spending real money is skins, period. \r\n\r\nSo with everything they give us (FOR FREE) who the hell are you to demand more for less?  \r\n\r\nYou aren't forced to buy RP.\r\nYou aren't harassed to buy RP.\r\nYou don't need RP to win.\r\nRP gives no in game advantage.\r\n\r\nSo complaining because a company that gives you a FREE game to play all you want for FREE for as long as you want simply because they are offering a discount on their RP after Xmas AND YOU didn't get to take advantage of it is so beyond immature I can't believe this argument is happening.\r\n\r\nGood Job Riot.  \r\n-A happy customer","replies":[]},{"poster":"El Exterminador","date":"2014-12-29T22:04:44.808+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":10,"body":"yeah i just used 3 cards that i got from a raffle on a stream i was watching last night. good timing eh?","replies":[]},{"poster":"flamingdice88","date":"2014-12-30T15:27:37.906+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, as a business, I assume they are doing this promotion at the beginning of January to up RP sales during a slow time.
