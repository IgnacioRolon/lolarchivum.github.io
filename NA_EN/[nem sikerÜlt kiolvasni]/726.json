The more and more esports becomes a legitimate competition, the less regional ties have to do with anything other than where the market is. NBA, NFL, MLB all have a ton of players who didn't grow up in the US, but they are the dominant leagues because the US is where the money is at. If there are enough fans and a big revenue difference between leagues then the one with the biggest audience and thus biggest investment from teams/owners will end up being the strongest (look at the shift between Korea and China scenes this year) so it isn't super interesting to talk about which region has the most fans who pay for stuff and motivate teams to invest in players. Teams in the same region will always be striving to compete and the top teams are usually on similar levels though, so team rivalries>region rivalries imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vega Hartmann","date":"2015-05-19T15:01:42.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aaaaaaand you failed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blind Minion","date":"2015-04-30T21:43:24.905+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope the west shows up.
