In SKT's rematch against Samsung Galaxy in Week 5 of the 2017 LCK spring Split, without initiation, SKT still closed out the game -- thanks to their ability to pressure the map, create plays off of map movements, and force fights around objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Archäen","date":"2017-02-27T18:28:08.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably the weakest Breakdown yet... usually love these, but this one was pretty poor. If this game is used as the ideal, then the way to win without reliable initiation is to get the enemy team to make a poor initiation attempt. Though SKT played out the result well, the win had much more to do with SKT capitalizing on SSGs poor decisions than playing a low-engage comp correctly. If you're telling me that winning on a low-initiation comp requires the other team to make mistakes, then you should never play said comp.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree with many of your points about low-initiation comps, I think this game was a poor example of how to play one effectively (meaning relying on your own pro-active play rather than the enemy team making mistakes).","replies":[]}]}
