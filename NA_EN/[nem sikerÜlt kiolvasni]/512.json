For example, I think of Sejuani, who has an ultimate designed for picks or team fights and is overall a strong ult for pro games as it gives guaranteed kills if landed. Pro players know a lot of what they’re doing and many of their champs have ults that can change the tide of a team fight or just getting picks for early leads, and for that reason Sylas is pretty much guaranteed to get decent ultimate options. Pretty much every viable pro champ has great ultimates, save for possibly Jayce, although his ranged form still seems to offer a decent amount for Sylas and will never be unavailable for Sylas to take, making it not half bad regardless.

When the old Conqueror was born, it finally felt like they had a very good rune to play with. \r\n\r\nIn 9.5 however, the rune will be giving half the AD it used to give before the rework, along with 10% less true damage and tiny stacks + healing mechanics to compensate for it. The thing is, most ranged champions and mages already had other runes that suited them really well, but for AD bruisers, Conqueror was practically it (yes, there were other keystones, but Conqueror was at the top). \r\n\r\nIn other words, AD bruisers seem to have lost their beloved keystone since it has become too powerful on mages and ranged champions, even though these champions probably won't be using Conqueror that much anyway (since its been nerfed into the grave).","replies":[{"poster":"DomTheDomo","date":"2019-03-06T07:19:20.273+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is, the rune is being pushed towards turning some of the damage one deals into true damage and getting healing off of that.
