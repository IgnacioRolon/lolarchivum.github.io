What do they do ... ignore the majorty (assuming majorty because comments on reddit and boards) They chose to keep the mobility and remove range which fixed nothing about him at all ... just made him a dumbed down version of what i liked ... no longer feels like an emperor commanding to me .. more like basic solider....

Considering that that ability was his best chance at staying useful in a team fight and taking that from him after a mere 3 seconds is just so confusing.

I do enjoy the pro's associated with the patch like greater movement speed in all areas and how early game you can pretty much fly bot and be there in 5 seconds but at the cost of his dps when he actually gets there is a huge con...not sure that was a good idea. \r\n\r\nIf you're just trying to make him more vulnerable in the early game, increase mana cost in his W so that Sol's cant just sit near a bush, cast W to clear waves instantly then gank a lane. I can see why that is OP in higher elo games but an increase in cost can hopefully assure a Sol to stay in lane till they can get a ROA to begin looking elsewhere. Also, as a mini buff, let his stars do microdamage to towers. Sols don't stay in lane too because of how miserable of a kit he has for sieging objectives and is FORCED to help other lanes. A small damage amount can give some peace of mind to Sol players that if they dominate their lane, then it's okay to stay in lane and not look to gank losing lanes and jeopardize their lead since they can focus on finishing their tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ubercoletron","date":"2019-08-27T23:33:57.337+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"So is no one gonna mention the fact that elderwood veigar looks almost identical to skull kid from majoras mask?
