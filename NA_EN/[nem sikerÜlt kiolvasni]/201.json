I was initially very skeptical, because I was dismayed by the idea of replacing a whimsical, derpy Champion with a super-serious grimdark one. (I think League thrives on a little silliness, and we've already got one angry axe-man with a growly voice.) The quality of the rework won me over.\n\nThat said, I would go from \"pretty happy\" to \"delighted\" if you could add in a Traditional Sion skin. I'm really just thinking about the VO here: a green or gray recolor with the Ahnuld voicework would be absolutely fine.\n\nWhy a Traditional Skin, even if it's just a recolor with the old VO? Because while the new Sion is an amazing creation, I think it's important that LoL maintain a little of its sense of humor. It would be nice to have Traditional Sion as an option for when we want to be derpy.","replies":[{"poster":"KingNesto","date":"2014-09-25T21:05:48.037+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":1,"body":"100% agree with this guy.
