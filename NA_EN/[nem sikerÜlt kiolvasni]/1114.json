He looked around wildly and then abruptly closed his eyes tightly and stood still, hoping to proc his passive in time. The thick brush pricked his furry sides as he stood in his puddle of sweat, holding his breath so that the approaching Jinx won’t hear him. \r\n\r\nJinx entered the bush, her eyes full of malice and glee, “where are you little rat,” she mocked a devilish grin spreading across her face. Knowing Teemo was still in the bush she zapped towards the center, just narrowly missing his nose, but close enough that he felt the heat of it whizzing by. \r\n\r\nTeemo glanced at his mana bar to see that he was completely out of mana, but so was Jinx, he hoped that he could get enough mana for his blind by the time Jinx got enough for her ‘Zap’. \r\n\r\nJinx tried to zap the bush again but all that came out was a tiny red glow from her gun, she threw it down in frustration and plopped down in the bush thinking of what to do next.\r\n\r\nTeemo stared at the crazy blue haired marksman sitting within touching distance of him, his heart beating as quickly as a tick of ignite at the thought of possibly dying. He looked at her pony tails swish back and forth in the cool breeze, passing over the maze of bright blue cloud tattoos that plagued her body. She was hunched over with her elbow on her knee propping up her chin, he could hear her murmuring continuously to herself in alternate voices, which strangely enough made him feel a little sad for her. Maybe she was misunderstood like he was, he was cursed  and hated by everyone on the Rift, even his own mother. The other yordles left him for that dumb brick of prehistoric pile of brown raptor shit Gnar. He didn’t understand what about him  made people dislike him, not just dislike him but hate him religiously, with a passion never seen before.  Teemo continued staring at the back of the crazy blue haired girl, then suddenly reached out and placed his paw on her shoulder. He froze, paw on shoulder, eyes on her back, soul leaving his body.\r\n\r\nJinx bolted upright at the touch of the small paw on her shoulder, she turned around slowly to find herself nose to nose with a small furry creature with...” WHAT THE ! “ ..SHE GOT TO HER FEET, SCREAMING. “ WHAT THE FRIG, FRUCK , WHAT THE HELL IS THAT. TEEMO STARED AT THE DISTRESSED MARKSMAN CONFUSED AND TERRIFIED.  He then noticed that yes, he had his eyes open. He quickly closed them, smiled, then went invisible. \r\n\r\n“Oh no you don’t, get back here…” ‘ Zaaaaaap!’\r\n\r\n“ Owwwwww wtf, that burns, why the fu….” Teemo looked up to see bright glowing red eyes staring down at him.  “ Hi?.” No response. “ I’m sorry that you have to see this, ummm. I didn’t realize, I’m so sorry. Feel free to kill me now if you want to, I won’t blame you, no one should have to see such a thing.” Teemo closed his eyes tightly awaiting his demise, but after 4 seconds of eye and butt clenching, he peeked to see the ADC sitting in a crossed leg position across from him. Opening his eyes fully and straightening his stance, he stared at the eyes staring at him stare at them staring at him. \r\n\r\nSitting cross legged, Jinx stared into the never before seen depths of Teemo’s eyes. At first it was scary, but now it was just fascinating. He was adorable, small and so cute, his eyes only made him more enchanting. He was so small in fact, that she was sitting down and yet she was still taller than him at his full height.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeemo stood there, staring at the what looked like a dazed ADC, her eyes were glued to his like an Akali to squishies. Seeing her like this made him feel strange, she looked really.Really. Really.\r\n\r\nContinued in the R version.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"SODReaper","date":"2015-01-26T22:56:33.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"where is the r version","replies":[]},{"poster":"HighH1","date":"2015-01-27T06:04:01.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"dumb brick of prehistoric pile of brown raptor shit Gnar{{champion:150}} \" dying of laughing right now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sinneli","date":"2015-01-26T19:52:29.308+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"And in today's rotation, we have Kalista and everyone else who will be dangerous when thrown at the enemies.
