He could feel the heat as another much smaller arrow pierced his side. He turned to see Varus (487RP)  charging up another arrow getting it to the farthest range it could be. He heard the twang of the bow string and thought this was the end. As the arrow hit his body he felt he had a little life left but how? The little yordle heard a voice yelling to him “RUN!” he flashed out of Varus’ ult just before he was killed from the impact. As she saw the little yordle get away,  Dryad Soraka (260RP) had the problem of having herself escape. “No matter” she thought “I’ll just spam starcall” and that she did. With a few rapid clicks of her q she had taken Varus down before she was at half health. “Nerf Soraka pls” was all that anyone saw Varus say for the rest of the game. Leona(440RP) and Northern Storm Volibear(375RP)  had just seen the horror of Soraka killing Varus they knew that she needed to be shut down before she was impossible to kill. So they decided to try and come up behind The Goat and kill her while she was farming at top. The plan was perfect!  Leona would come out of river bush and act like she would 1v1 the Soraka. Once she had led her to the bush Volibear would rush out and start tearing her limb from limb and then they could push mid and win the game!  They knew that if they didn’t end the game soon they would have to go AFK and all hope would be lost. As Leona baited Soraka into the bush she quickly used her Shield of Daybreak and Solar flare and then the fight commenced. Volibear and Leona knew they were going to kill Soraka but they also knew it was going to be quite a fight to do it. Volibear using his w passive had his three hits off and was about to use his Bite whenever the silence came through and he was unable to use his spells for the rest of the fight. Soraka tried to get off as many Starcalls and Infuses as she could. With one last basic attack Soraka fell with a mighty thud  the fight was over the carry had died. The chat was filled with excitement as the two heroes started to recall in the river bush whenever a beam of light came and killed both the champions with one blow. Quickly after the double kill Imperial Lux(487RP) exclaimed “Get Wreked!” That was all  Leona and Volibear Could bear and they immediately left the game. (Based on a real game)    P.S – Sorry if the story is not better than the other’s I have made. The characters for this story were hard to put together into one story. But I hope you still enjoyed it!","replies":[{"poster":"ddrfr33k","date":"2014-05-22T15:14:57.724+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":12,"body":"You are doing The Lord's work, Panda.
