It says that it's not realistic to wait until one week before Worlds to find out where ALL SIXTEEN teams will be playing during the Group Stage. With a live draw, they will do a drawing of the Groups live and then have about a week to arrange visas and travel plans for all sixteen teams to go to one of the two Group Stage locations. Instead, they did a private draw ahead of time so that as (for example) teams like Samsung Blue clinch the #1 seed, they Riot can start preparing the travel visas, since they will know which location Blue will be going to for Group Stage.","replies":[{"poster":"finallylupus","date":"2014-08-13T05:28:53.995+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"The only downside would be the possibility of teams throwing games to get placed into a specific group. ***I wouldn't expect teams to do this, but it is a possibility***.\"\r\n\r\nObviously you don't have any experience with any competitive event at all. If teams have advanced information that can tell them which brackets are easier, of course they will take advantage of it. Doing a live draw and thus giving teams an incentive to fix their ending seed pretty much throws the legitimacy of the World Championships out the window. You don't even have to look that far to see match fixing. LMQ potentially threw their last LCS match to drop their position down to 2nd place where they would be in an arguably easier bracket than they would be if they had secured 1st place. Riot can't afford to risk the legitimacy of the entire tournament by hosting a little side show like a live group draw. Wait until the 2015 season when they synchronize all of the regional tournaments for your live group draw.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tantallous","date":"2014-08-13T01:47:06.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"but none of the reasons they gave make sense. you don't need to know your seeding/bracket to start getting visa stuff going. the only thing that i can see is the issue of knowing how the seeding is arranged and trying to \"fix\" a match.. but.. if both teams are trying to do that then its obvious, and you just DQ them. and you can avoid that entirely by just waiting until after quals are over. again the visa thing is a non-issue, all the teams that even MIGHT go, should have already started the visa process by now.","replies":[{"poster":"Bad W01f","date":"2014-08-13T05:49:24.057+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Isn't it held in multiple countries?  Getting visas started  and booking flights for every possible seeding doesn't seem nontrivial to me.  Match fixing is also really nonobvious; to take a relatively recent example, Shiphtur may very well have thrown Coast's relegation match (no, I don't actually believe this, but it's an undeniable possibility).  He sure played poorly, and he was likely aware he'd end up on a better team if they got relegated.  The only way we'd ever find out is if he was really stupid and actually said something about intending to play sub-optimally.  Both teams have an incentive to play poorly in the situation Riot fears, just not so poorly that Riot has solid evidence; given the number of throws in  LCS, that leaves a lot of wiggle room.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PsycloneJoker","date":"2014-08-13T01:19:13.160+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":49,"body":"Rigged.","replies":[{"poster":"tokie","date":"2014-08-13T02:18:54.094+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot do not want a Samsung Blue vs Samsung White grand finals, or for that matter 3 Korean teams in top 4.","replies":[{"poster":"deborahcliff","date":"2014-08-13T13:01:45.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"now i see why they decided to put group stage in different countries instead of just holding the entire thing in korea...so they could use the visa thing as an excuse.  ggwp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darude SpltStorm","date":"2014-08-13T02:05:22.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"LOL You're that leaker that leaked the {{champion:157}} yasuo skin.
