Yorick is the only \"reworked\" champion who did not see a major increase in playrate. In fact, I see him even less nowadays. If he was as fun as you say, people would actually care about him, but they don't. Look at the comments. Look at how everyone still sees him.\n\nAlso, for you to try and compare Rengar to Yorick is absolutely ridiculous, and only proves to me that the only part of a champion you can and will ever enjoy is their kit. Their playstyle, voice, lore, and visuals mean absolutely nothing to you. I suppose it's only natural that you wouldn't be able to understand Old Yorick. Perhaps my expectations were just too high, after being away from the boards for so long. Thank you for bringing me back into reality.\n\nAnd who the fuck are you to try and tell me who is and isn't fun to play? As for weaknesses, Yorick suffered from the same strengths and weaknesses every other single Juggernaut did. Oh, but you didn't even know that he was a Juggernaut, did you? You probably never will, either, since you'll stay in denial even after reading this response, just like everyone else. You people all act the same- It's so predictable. It's almost as if you're just a bunch of robots created by some guy who wants to watch the world burn. Whatever. I'm done with you. Grieving for the loss of Yorick is a hundred times more productive than writing a message to dirt like you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hungry Cancer","date":"2017-10-04T04:48:25.925+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Yorick was simple as fuck in game and his lore really was not that special, Janna's recent lore/identity change was WAY more significant and fucked up than Yorick's who at least kept his depth.\nYou're freaking out over something that has happened to a lot of other champs and is just part of the nature of the game. Yorick did not fit the game and had to be modernized, since he wasn't played by anyone they decided to change his kit and identity in the process to try to help him, because that is what they need to do as a business. \nDo you really think that they should just leave a champion in a poor state and allow it to stagnate and place a drain on the game and the company's potential earnings just so an insignificant number of players can continue playing that champion instead of bringing it up to par with the rest of the roster and making it more appealing to a larger percentage of players?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadowpants18","date":"2017-10-03T22:02:07.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah but it makes everyone else feel a whole lot better, yorick was a cancer top laner{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Hungry Cancer","date":"2017-10-04T05:00:29.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never saw him top, but I have been chased down by the undead gorilla running out of the jungle at ridiculous speeds more than a few times. lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hungry Cancer","date":"2017-10-03T22:09:52.839+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"three hundred out of 110+ million is still nothing. lol","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2017-10-04T01:19:37.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Hungry Cancer","date":"2017-10-04T04:17:12.902+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty pathetic man, and no matter how pathetic your love of Yorick is that doesn't make it comparable to people who died in 911or in service to this country and making that comparison is disgusting and offensive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cardg0lem","date":"2017-10-04T03:00:49.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what about the people who came in after the rework and enjoy playing Yorick as he is now?
