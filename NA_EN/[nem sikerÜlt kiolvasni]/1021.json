I'm sure at one point Riot mentioned that we would be able to purchase icons with IP or earn them.\r\n\r\nFair enough team icons should be bought with RP seeing as you're actively supporting that singular team, but for stuff like this we should be able to get them with IP or get them if you meet certain conditions.\r\n\r\nFor instance if you purchase Kindred within the first week of release you should get the icons free, or if you buy the project skins first strike, you should of got the icon with those as well. Even if its something as simple as play the champion within the first week to unlock the potential to buy the icons with IP, it would make a load of people happier.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Let us purchase icons with IP!","replies":[{"poster":"MeesterMoo","date":"2015-10-14T13:48:24.992+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":41,"body":"It's not like they're making much...
