Older skins have already made the money back by the hundreds of thousands of times it took for Riot staff to make them\r\n\r\nBest example is Piltover Customs Blitzkrank, this skin came along Season 1 and I'm pretty sure within a few months, they made the money they spent paying the artists, modelers and coders to do this, so now they can afford to put it on sale at 99% off and they still make money because the skin has long payed for itself\r\n\r\nthis is also why they don't make sales of more recent skins too often after release. here's why.\r\n\r\nUpon release of a new skin, Riot puts it on sale for a short time to press players into buying it within a short time, so this makes players think this way: \"Buy it now, or wait a couple of months to see if its going to come back cheaper\". This reaction, is of course, completely how marketing works.\r\n\r\nRiot knows its customer base. They could make a Draven and TF skin called Rainmaker where all their particles are replaced by coins and money bills, put it up for 975RP at 28% off (but really, its 27.77% off, rounding numbers folks, it makes money!) and people would call Riot gods of business andx thank them for being generous devs, while in the background, riot staff are laughing their arses off, drinking Crystal because the real message behind the skin is representative of how much goddamn money they make off of us.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HappyHappyChaos","date":"2015-08-19T23:54:58.432+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know!
