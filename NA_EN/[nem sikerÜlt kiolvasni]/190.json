Not sure if this will get lost in the comments on this thread but i have one quality of life bit that i think could be helpful. I noticed while cs'ing that at first it was hard to distinguish which caster minion was attacking which other minion..basically just that the red balls that were leaving casters were kind of hard to see/track and were kind of just blending in to the environment because they were the same shade/texture. I just thought that if they were slightly darker or more defined/outlined or something to that effect that it would just be an improvement on the whole clarity theme that the update was focusing on. The map is absolutely beautiful though, and I love you. \r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nBacon","replies":[{"poster":"0WoQGQXGNp","date":"2014-11-13T08:50:22.263+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":4,"body":"I only read bacon","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tycol","date":"2014-11-13T06:15:45.939+0000","up_votes":196,"down_votes":13,"body":"I understand some people are having issues with connection, or FPS problems, but let me a few things without acknowledging the bit of bugs and problems that exist in something that was released as a Beta: 1: HOLY $@%*/#*%{{+%|>**&&\"&$ RIOT! IT IS A MASTERPIECE! YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE! The map design, Giving both sides their own design and structure, Both Jungles having atmospheres- IT RAINS AT BLUE BUFF! IT FREAKING RAINS!!! (Could be my salty tears from my teammate taking blue buff without asking if I needed it as the jungle 12:00 minutes) NEVERTHELESS, WEATHER HAPPENS!!! The Objectives look so sexy that I get upset when they are destroyed because how dare you ruin something so beautiful, right? And then I saw the super minions... I quickly realized the beauty that once embodied that crystal forged from the heavens was given to the enemy canon minion and thus made them into Demi-gods of Justice. Minions look like actual soldiers now. Baron Nashor is now the more dangerous looking than Liam Neeson holding any military assault rifle. Luckily, Baron can't find you, but he can still kill you. Dragon looks like he is just waiting for someone step into his area, because once they do, it's game time. Ding Ding. You're literally in a ring. A stonewall cage match with the Skyrim Dragon version of Muhammad Ali. I'd also advise to not going top lane. Both you and your lane partner will come to an agreement not to push because you want to keep looking to the North at the greatest view in League of Legends. Closely tied with Leblanc's Chest. But Summoner's Rift isn't just smoke and mirrors, it truly feels like a whole new map and a whole new game. Instead of color teams, you are now fighting for a majestic animal. The Owl or Stag. Both are equally filled with swag and awesome looking shop keepers. THE WHOLE BASE LOOKS SO FREAKING GOOD! The gold trim tops everything off and fits perfectly with both the red and light blue. The towers like crazy as hell, and the destructibility from Howling Abyss was an excellent touch. Finally towers don't look like an electrical malfunction when they are destroyed. They look realistically collapsed and look fantastic standing and destroyed. I know for a fact I am leaving some things off, because there is so many positive things to say. I honestly believe Riot is always looking out for the community and always is listening and improving to make the game better for us, and I've thought this way before the update, but I don't think the whole entire Riot staff gets enough credit. Sure, they needed Irelia at of nowhere, but that's be honest, she needed it and she is still a great champion choice, and sure, Poro-Snax were a bit of a let down because you only get one. But in the end, Riot has always been so open, friendly, and even hilarious at times. Their support team is THE greatest support team of all time. When players can create stories of their RP being stolen by Blitzcrank disguised as Teemo, and they go along asking for a drawing, you can't help but say, \"Riot... Yes.\" Beep Boop Scouts Code. Riot even shows us the behind the scenes of  almost everything they make- like champions, maps, cinematics, etc. They don't even hide the fact that they love humor. They had pro teams come and play URF, then commentated it like it was LCS. Not to mention every patch note has some funny titles for buffs and nerfs on different champions. But I have gone on for WAY to long, and I doubt anyone is reading all of this, but it is something that I believe should be said. But Thank You Riot. For everything I have mentioned, and everything I forgot to mention. I would like for you all to know that we do see all the small things, and that we appreciate them. You always find a way to dazzle us, and you are truly, truly, outrageous. So here is to you, Riot Games. \r\n\r\nWith Great Respects,\r\nCheesynamehere","replies":[{"poster":"Zidaryn","date":"2014-11-13T14:07:05.307+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"I read the whole thing.
