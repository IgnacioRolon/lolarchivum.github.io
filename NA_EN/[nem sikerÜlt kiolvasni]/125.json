It sucks you're getting stuck here, but I'd like to help and get you in-game!  If you're only getting up to 8% before receiving the error, then something with your PC might be blocking the patcher from scanning your game files.  You'll want to run through the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to fix that up.
