The \"menu\" as you called it will be accessible by clicking NEWS (now ALPHA) next to the LOBBY button and will be the default screen players will see when they login to the client. You will also be able to change the game mode by pressing the ^ arrow below the LOBBY.

That functionality will be much loved!\n\nBut even though the visuals of the pre-game screens have been smoothed and made cooler, the post-game screen feels flat. The numbers disappear into the background a bit, and it actually feels harder to find information since the gaps between numbers are uniform (clumping attracts the eye). Also, a person's eye is usually attracted to just below the top of the page, just about in the center, right? That's where the old exp, ip, mastery information was, but now that space is how much gold your team earned overall which is... not the most exciting thing.\n\nMight consider flipping the name/champion and the build sections so that the stats are more easily associated with the player and not their build, and also easier to find. The gold circle seems a little heavy and too much - maybe thinning that and making the champion icon a little larger so your eyes snap to it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nunah","date":"2016-05-03T19:38:08.466+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"i need this client in my life","replies":[]},{"poster":"N1ghtmarez","date":"2016-05-04T01:47:16.984+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat windows seem awkward.

If you could change your runes and such during loading, it would have to not only reload that data, but the system would constantly have to respond to your input for changes and check for those changes, which would drastically slow things down. Haven't you noticed that pretty much no game in history lets you do anything while loading? There's a reason for that.\n\nAnd seriously, you have TONS of time to pick your runes and masteries. Even if you are last pick, you STILL have 30 seconds to confirm them, not to mention the fact that you usually have a fair idea of who you're going to play before you actually lock in.
