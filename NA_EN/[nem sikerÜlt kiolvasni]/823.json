SKT Zed is not meant for the special effects or anything of the sort; honestly it doesn't count as a new skin for Zed.   Rather, it is made to celebrate SKT pride.  \n2. Zed was released in November 13th, 2011.  As of today, it is July 3rd, 2015; 3 and a half years since Zed has received a new skin.  \n3. Yet here we are, Lee Sin (with already plenty of skins) gets a new one.  So does Rek'Sai who came out not too long ago.  Again, the same is with yasuo and his project skin.  This also includes Draven.  \n4. However, thanks Riot for releasing the Zac skin!\n\nWant to ignore wall of text?
