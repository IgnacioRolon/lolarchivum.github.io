Riot's reasoning is that a high competitive standard is necessary for high Mastery levels, yet they exclude ranked Treeline and include blind normal SR. That sends a terrible message to Treeline players when Riot is publicly claiming that a ranked queue is somehow innately less competitive than a normal queue. The claim might be true in a practical sense due to playerbase size and dev support differences, but enforcing it as a natural truth is completely ridiculous and harmful.","replies":[{"poster":"leaguewut","date":"2016-06-15T18:28:23.084+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that Treeline is less competitive, it's that it's less rigorously balanced.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm a little sad that Treeline isn't considered worth balancing, or that we're not being surveyed or anything over our interest levels.\r\n\r\nI don't play Treeline hardly ever. When I get three people that will, I have a good time. But if I know someone who mains a champion who is weak on Treeline, I usually don't bother asking.
