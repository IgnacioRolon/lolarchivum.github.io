To some it is just a game, but to others it is a passion that people are willing to try their damnedest to achieve high goals and expectations. I am one of the summoners that does enjoy this game and am tired of the toxic players and players with the negative attitudes that can make the game a bad experience for players like me. I have been a consistent player of league of legends for the past 6 years and I will play league for the rest of my life. I would have been so honored to have an experience like this happen to me. League Of Legends is my passion and I continue to try my best even through the negative experience. My updated name is Dark Lunacy and I am a serious dedicated league player. If you want a serious player that loves the game and community look me up and test me for a team that wants to go professional. I am willing to take a chance to prove myself.
