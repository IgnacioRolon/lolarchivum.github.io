It doesn't HAVE to be on April 1st as it steals creativity from what Riot CAN do. April 1st is supposed to be fun, trolly and there to give a good laugh. Clearly, not everyone liked Draven Day. But those who did had a blast (including me, although I'm sad I couldn't see the Draven Heads on all the champs cause I was out of town that day) and most of those who didn't whined about it because they had to wait on a game mode (or didn't even know it was coming.) This forced Riot to literally cancel the joke completely. I'm sure ou guys forced Riot into a state where they don't want to try anything else on April Fools day, or even ruin an employee's confidence over this. I'm sure the board that came up with this is seeing the backlash from the minority (which looks like a majority because you all were too vocal, while everyone was enjoying themselves) and seriously re-evaluating what April Fools means to the company.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2016-04-02T17:05:10.532+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy birthday Amumu {{champion:32}} <3 \r\nI still love you :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"PsychoDiesel48","date":"2016-04-01T19:47:13.978+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"HODOR HODOR HODOR HODOR!!!!{{champion:79}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirCatStalker","date":"2016-04-01T05:13:11.310+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":22,"body":"RITO URF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mad Dragon","date":"2016-04-02T14:27:56.483+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"This joke just really isn't even funny.","replies":[]}]}
