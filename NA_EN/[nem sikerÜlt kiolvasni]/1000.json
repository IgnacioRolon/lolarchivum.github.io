It would be really great so you can see what your least potential damage and your most potential damage is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Another great feature that would be nice to have is to be able to change mastery's and runes during the game, and have access to all runes during practice mode so we can check out maybe what works for us and then buy it for real games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Another great feature would be to have the ability to add a little more practice dummy's, as long as it wouldn't crash or anything. ( A great addition to this would be if we could change the armor and magic resist levels of the dummy.)\n\nThis would be great so you can freeze all the waves so you can farm things with for example Sion w, Nasus q, Veigar, ect. so you can get stacks and see how much damage you deal ect. although this probably isn't healthy for the client with all the minions being in lane, So an other alternative would be to have a stacks button where you can add/max out the cap on stacks to a champion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all for now although i thought up other ideas that's all i can remember for now, i think the practice tool is great and riot really did well one this one so, THANKS RIOT! but yeah, reply to this if you have any ideas and up-vote/like this if you agree with any of my ideas, thanks again, sincearly TommyBoyFTW.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"CheshireGame","date":"2017-02-14T23:25:51.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't used the Practice Tool yet, but I think (if it doesn't already have this) it should allow you to decide a build for the bot and be able to give it gold and tell it where to go, like if you want to learn how to counter an off meta build on ezreal for example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ronald McDona1d","date":"2017-02-14T16:49:02.978+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wish Riot would have let it able to invight friends fun mode to play around with with friends and stuff :/{{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2017-02-14T21:07:40.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> invight","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mlgmage935","date":"2017-02-14T18:59:00.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS IS AWSOME {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2017-02-14T15:31:20.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"who needs a valentines card when we have the practice tool to do \"practice\" since lets face it everybody is going to go flash crazy and play ali pinball most likely :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"BelowZero16","date":"2017-02-14T15:14:50.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3640}} \r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sherrl","date":"2017-02-14T14:58:55.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time i try updating to the new client it crashes and makes me reinstall ","replies":[]}]}
