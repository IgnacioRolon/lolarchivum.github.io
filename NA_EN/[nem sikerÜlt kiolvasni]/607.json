It seemed Leona had found out slightly before it was time. Ashe sighed and replied calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's true. I planned on telling you but...\"\r\n\r\n\"A new support? From the Freljord?\" Interrupted Leona, waving the piece of paper with the news and eventually crushing it with her hand in anger.\r\n\r\n\"Leona... He won't be here for a while, try to relax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Relax? You're asking me to relax?!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look... We're going to have a match in a couple of hours. Let's do this: if your performance is outstanding, we'll keep you in the team. Deal?\"\r\n\r\nLeona and Ashe shook hands and then walked into the fields of justice.\r\n\r\nSome hours passed, and eventually, the match began.\r\n\r\nOne champion was chosen from each team to be a judge for Leona's performance. [Viscero Xin Zhao (487 RP)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W4Ox6dq2kI), the Seneschal of Demacia, would represent the blue team, while Nasus (292 RP), the dawg, would represent the purple team.\r\n\r\nThe match then began.\r\n\r\nEach judge grabbed a notepad and a pen, and began writing down their observations.\r\n\r\nLeona and Ashe headed to the bottom lane as per usual. It didn't take long for them to encounter their lane opponents.\r\n\r\nKog'Maw (440 RP) and some mysterious champion she had never seen before (487 RP) stood near their own turret.\r\n\r\n\"Duo ADC lane?\" Asked Leona.\r\n\r\nKog'Maw started dancing around in response.\r\n\r\nThe first minutes of the match went on normally. One team got first blood but it didn't even matter since the bonus gold it now gives is almost negligible.\r\n\r\n\"We must take the turret now,\" whispered Leona, \"otherwise they'll just keep pushing us.\"\r\n\r\nAshe nodded. It was true, this was their chance to take it.\r\n\r\nThe minion wave arrived, and Leona threw her Zenith blade at Quinn. She dashed at her and slammed her face with her shield, stunning her, at the same time as she called her solar flare down upon her enemies.\r\n\r\nQuinn tried using her bird form to escape, but Ashe cast her enchanted arrow and froze her in place. With a combination of arrows and slashes, Quinn went down.\r\n\r\nKog'Maw was alone now. The enemies had both user their ultimates, so he had that in his favor.\r\n\r\nHe began spitting his living artillery at them, Leona and Ashe tried running around, evading the powerful projectiles.\r\n\r\nLeona got worried. If the new minion wave arrived, Kog'Maw would be able to survive the push until Quinn revived.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of desperation, Leona used her Zenith blade again.\r\n\r\n\"NO!\" Yelled Ashe.\r\n\r\nLeona dashed at her enemy and began striking him. However, she was now under turret range, so the turret began firing at her, each projectile hurting more and more.\r\n\r\nAshe fired as many arrows at Kog'Maw as she could, and eventually, the Mouth of the Abyss was no more.\r\n\r\nLeona rolled away from the turret, surviving with just a sliver of health.\r\n\r\n\"We did it!\" Exclaimed Ashe, as the minions finished bringing down the turret, \"we took the turret!\"\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, however, she saw some sort of corpse standing up, spewing purple liquid out of every orifice he had.\r\n\r\n\"LOOK OUT!\" Yelled Leona and pushed Ashe out of the way. Ashe flew for a second and fell into the river, splashing water all around.\r\n\r\nKog'Maw's corpse exploded, removing the little health Leona had left.\r\n\r\nAshe was left alone in the lane, three corpses around her: two enemies and her brave support.\r\n\r\nThe judges took note of Leona's sacrifice, as Ashe shed a single icy tear from her left eye. She then realized that, no matter how many new supports arrive, Leona will always be her favourite.","replies":[{"poster":"9oh7","date":"2014-05-08T15:14:44.586+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":3,"body":"So if I may ask Lord Moriuz what do you do for a living?
