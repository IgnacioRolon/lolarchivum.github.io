I realized most of the western regions voted for rare/underused champions, but even if NA, LAN, LAS, BR and EUW together vote for Poppy and Yorick, when the millions of Chinese players vote for their favourite champions (Thresh and Lucian), the other regions' votes are negligible.\r\n\r\nThey should've done something similar to what they do in the American indirect voting system for presidential elections: the top 10 or top 20 votes from each region get some points. In the end, you add up all the points from all the regions and you choose the winners (instead of using an absolute majority).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, by sheer numbers, whatever China chooses will win.","replies":[{"poster":"Kilajuk","date":"2014-05-10T17:26:47.841+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":3,"body":"Moriuz made a normal post?

While each 'exotic' champion might have gotten more approval than each 'normal' champion, the people who wanted 'normal' champions voted for a smaller pool than the 'exotic' ones.  In the American indirect voting, this is equivalent to not having a party system--the platform with fewer candidates tends to win because they split the vote less.  Instead, we should do it by approval voting: each person votes 'yes' or 'no' (or no vote, I suppose) on each champion.  Thus, 'normal' champions would get downvoted more if the community actively didn't want to see them.  Similar to this, but with the ability to +1/-1/no vote so people don't have to vote yes or no on each of over a hundred champions. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting  ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WhiteFurry","date":"2014-05-10T12:31:07.448+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":9,"body":"I'm Chinese and I voted for Bjergsen.{{item:3151}} ","replies":[{"poster":"SebyGai","date":"2014-05-10T14:17:06.859+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":8,"body":"i cri everytim{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rift lol COOLX ","date":"2014-05-10T15:09:55.007+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is little point in picking Bjergsen unless we could also pick faker :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crafthor","date":"2014-05-10T14:18:22.033+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":4,"body":"GIMME{{champion:201}} !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"elementalravage","date":"2014-05-10T19:38:27.681+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR!
