It looks like that kind of behavior (if intentional) is also caught by this system.\r\n\r\nI am guilty of calling people out, and I have been reported. More than once I was on a whole team that was set on trolling. \r\n\r\nI have learned to try and say \"Hey can you try not to do ___ anymore?

Some players hold other players hostage by either demanding a position regardless of their pick order or going with a troll pick and threaten to afk/feed to force others to dodge if they don't get what they want. Since the LP cost of dodging is lower than a loss, often people do dodge and those toxic players get away with it free.\r\n\r\nIt's really hard to understand how you guys are putting all this effort into addressing toxic behavior when that loophole still exists and is just as much of a problem as in game toxic behavior.

I rarely (1 in maybe 100 games) dodge a game because of these types of players because I consider it the right thing to do to play it out and report them later for their behavior, but also because it prevents this person from possibly ruining the experience of the next group of people that they would have gotten into a lobby with anyways. I'll take the hit in LP to save 9 other people from having to deal with those people most of the time, and I know other some people do the same thing.\r\n\r\nI do agree though; while Riot has access to the pre- and post-game chat logs, it's very frustrating to not be able to do something about the champ select trolls going \"mid or feed smurfing\" who will autolock the only champion they know how to play and ruin the experience for everyone else on the team. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's not really a good system to put in place that couldn't be abused by players who just didn't like someone's pick. Any type of vote kick system could be easily abused, and having a report button in pre-game chat just ends up with players being angry before the game has even started. \r\n\r\nI think the only good option would be a \"Leave Queue\" button (with the traditional dodge penalties) that would give you a \"Why did you leave the queue?\" pop-up in the client to ask you why you left, with a dropdown box offering options such as \"Did not have time to play\", but most importantly a \"Player Toxicity\" option that would bring up the names of the other 4 players in your lobby and allow you to select and report that player(s) for their pre-game chat behavior.

But if you're already dodging and taking the LP loss, and you're doing it because someone is trolling and you don't want to go through a whole game with that behavior, you should be able to report them.

Then they changed it, and people with honor ribbons were almost nonexistent.

WRONG! Someone who's basically first pick as well as a solo player not only doesn't say which role he's going to play, but also refuses to either listen, say anything or generally admit to not being entitled for his personnal preference pick because he has priority over me in the draft. Last game I played ranked, this very scenario happened to me again, there was a draven(forgot his summoner name), he's not only insta lock, but he hasn't said anything before having his pick and he's not answering any of the other 4 people asking him why he did what he did when we were all talking about how to build our team comp.
