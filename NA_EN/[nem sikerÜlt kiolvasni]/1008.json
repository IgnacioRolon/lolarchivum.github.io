He clearly said \"So the modes were meant to last that long, but they changed it to 3 days each changing each weekend.\" Meaning he, HIMSELF; said that they 'were' going to last a full 1.5 months, but later changed it to only lasting 3 days.\n\nHe didn't say that they'd be on the weekends AND last 1.5 months, he said originally they were GOING to last 1.5 months, and they later CHANGED that to 3 days. Which is simply not the case.\n\nAnd heck, for the sake of argument let's pretend he 'did' mean that (Which the way all of his collective posts are written, he's clearly not saying that), it would still be wrong. And it would still be ignoring what I said.\n\nAnd because I'm tired of blatantly wrong people ignoring what I'm saying:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/JzQkg9BJ-rotating-game-mode-queue-update\nHow often will we see modes repeat?\nThis will depend on how many modes fall into the stable rotation. Modes will likely repeat every 1.5~2 months. Again, once we get started and see what modes come and go from the rotation, this could shift a little bit.\n\nSo let's say this one last time, as clearly as possible. They said, AFTER stating that URF would show up \"at least twice\" that modes were expected to show up every 1.5~2 months.  There's no argument to be had there. They said that. Period.","replies":[{"poster":"SailorPsycho","date":"2016-06-26T14:34:18.166+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"No.  It's quite easy to understand what was said but you obviously just don't get it.  Say the game mode was Ascension, it would last for a month and a half, only available on weekends, and then when the 1.5 was over it would then change to URF, ect. However, Riot changed that idea to have each game mode rotate every weekend instead of having them all last for 1.5 months on weekends.","replies":[{"poster":"Sakaru","date":"2016-06-28T10:33:03.504+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is just blatantly untrue. They never once said that each mode would last 1.5 months. They said they would REPEAT every 1.5 months. Which is why how often you'd see them (1.5~2 months) depended on how many modes there were.\n\nThey stated on the announcement that it would be weekends. This has never changed. They stated after that announcement that it'd 'repeat' every 1.5 months.\n\nSeriously, provide literally ANY evidence to support your claims. I've already provided you with the red post that says exactly what I'm saying. The announcement for the rotating queue clearly states the other half of what I'm saying. What you're saying, was simply never true.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"memiux","date":"2016-06-17T20:24:36.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"More time yay, our prayers have been heard.","replies":[{"poster":"nightshock","date":"2016-06-18T14:52:35.623+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"no no. we still get more hexkill then urf, no prayer has been answered.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominus Invicta","date":"2016-06-21T21:16:08.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like for Real Why is Hexakill in the rotation like 3 times a rotation URF is what pretty much everyone looks forward too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"your barista","date":"2016-06-18T20:33:10.112+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot please, i beg, bring back doom bots and more U.R.F.{{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2016-06-19T01:38:39.104+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Didn't really care for _playing_ Doom Bots (lost its novelty pretty quickly, gameplay-wise), but it was definitely an awesome _spectacle_. \r\n\r\nURF, as usual, I'd love to see more of.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whap Goblin","date":"2016-06-18T00:56:17.454+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"URF pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Guy 3000","date":"2016-06-18T18:39:50.929+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"If only this started when URF was out {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuspachoMC","date":"2016-06-17T21:38:04.960+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"How about a mixture of One for All, U.R.F, an d Howling Abyss","replies":[]},{"poster":"I BOONK GANG I","date":"2016-06-19T00:41:20.939+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"WHEN IS URF AGAIN?!?!?!?
