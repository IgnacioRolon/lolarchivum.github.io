Many, many players already have the Santa Baron (myself included) so to spend RP on something that we basically already have (if not a little bit sillier) is just a plain bad idea. It makes no sense from a business standpoint. While the Baron Nashor may be one of the most iconic beasts of the game, unless you make this icon do more than look cool--which, in your defense, it does--you probably won't see too much of your user-base spending RP to get it.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: I love you guys, RIOT.
