Otherwise, it will kill us and find someone else. But since I don't like killing innocent women and children.\"\n\n{{champion:412}} \"I still can't believe you of all people became our leader. The one person who turns into a blood demon and doesn't turn evil. You are going to destroy us all.\"\n\n{{champion:26}} \"Hold on, I have a solution to our problem. A hunt, like an easter egg hunt. But instead of eggs, you hunt lost souls and each other. And at the end, whoever has collected the most tributes will win the grand prize. A lifetime supply of chili cheese fries.\"\n\n{{champion:4}} \"Sounds like a piece of cake. No one will stand a chance against me.\"\n\n{{champion:64}} \"Yeah um, about that.\"\n\n{{champion:26}} Oh, it slipped my mind. But I worked with Corporate Lee Sin to make this an official game mode.\"\n\n{{champion:64}} \"And since players are making me nerf the best item I ever designed, Edge Of Night. I mean, the big plays potential on this thing. I am giving it one last hurrah by only letting assassins in. Here's a list.\"\n\n{{champion:4}} \"Really, this is the blood moon game mode and half of us can't even compete.\"\n\n{{champion:202}} \"I must make beautiful art with these demons. You cannot hold me back.\"\n\n{{champion:4}} \"And besides, why is Kennen allowed. He doesn't use Edge Of Night, and I'm more of an assassin than he will ever be.\"\n\n{{champion:26}} \"Frankly, he scares the hell out of me. I mean, it seemed like a good idea at the time, normal Kennan is so cute. But this thing keeps me up at night. I just don't want him to take that mask off.\"\n\n{{champion:429}} \"Eclipse Lord, I got her. We can finally make a Blood Moon Diana!\"\n\n{{champion:131}} **\"I WILL NEVER BETRAY THE MOON LIKE THAT!\"**\n\n{{champion:26}} \"Blood Moon Kalista, you remember my new policy. No Blood Mooning without consent.\"\n\n{{champion:429}} \"_Yes, I remember because you are the worst leader ever and I would literally take anyone else._ Don't worry, she is going to do it willingly.\"\n\n{{champion:131}} \"I would rather watch a marathon of all the divergent movies, twice. Then become a blood moon.\"\n\n{{champion:26}} \"She seems to disagree with you, Blood Moon Kalista.\"\n\n{{champion:98}} \"That's enough, I have had enough of the direction you are taking this group. Time for me to do something about it. I will be organizing a protest on any day that has remotely anything to do with the moon. We will make a difference. **NOT MY ECLIPSE LORD!**\"\n\n{{champion:157}} \"Really, what difference do you think it's going to make.\"\n\n{{champion:98}} \"Well, I was kinda hoping he would get upset at all the yelling and quit.\"\n\n{{champion:157}} \"Dude, he's so old, he probably ain't got too many years left. You really think he would quit rather than die a blood moon. Yorick has a better chance at getting a new skin.\"\n\n{{champion:429}} \"Back to what I was saying. Diana will willingly become a blood moon. Because if she doesn't I will have Blood Moon Elise kill Leona.\"\n\n{{champion:60}} \"Alright, I can uncover your face now. See, it's really her.\"\n\n{{champion:89}} \"Ohh, you guys are the ones that stole me. Normal moon, blood moon, when will any form of moon stop causing me trouble.\"\n\n{{champion:131}} \"Why would I care what happens to Leona. I should thank you for killing her.\"\n\n{{champion:89}}** \"YEAH, WHY WOULD ME AND THIS HERETIC HAVE FEELING FOR EACHOTHER! I ONLY WANT HER DEAD!\"**\n_\"Cries slightly.\"_\n\n{{champion:429}} \"Oh, alright. I guess you won't mind if I just put this spear right through her throat.\"\n\n{{champion:131}} \"**WAIT!** Okay, I'll become a blood moon. Just don't hurt her.\"\n\n{{champion:429}} \"I knew it, right over there please.\"\n\n{{champion:131}} \"Wait, Blood Moon Zilean, this isn't consented. I don't want to do this.\"\n\n{{champion:26}} \"Eh, as long as you are walking onto the dais by your own will, it's allowed. Quite a loophole I know, but I never put anything in the rules about blackmail.\"\n\n{{champion:131}} \"Just so you know Leona, I am only doing this so I can kill you myself.\"\n\n{{champion:89}} \"Not if I get you first.\"\n\n{{champion:131}} **\"HAUHWRHAUAHUHR!!!!\"**\n_\"Turns into Blood Moon Diana.\"_\n\n{{champion:26}} \"Alright, if you would just let Leona go, the games can begin.\"\n\n_**Over in the hunt of the blood moon:**_\n\n{{champion:84}} \"Alright, this game mode favors those who can hunt down single targets and rekt them before they get a chance to do anything.\"\n\n{{champion:80}} \"Hahehahe! I have but two weakness's, late game and tanks. Neither of which are an issue here. So, good luck.\"\n\n{{champion:91}} \"You're not so strong. I can just outplay you an-\"\n_\"Dies.\"_\n\n{{champion:80}} \"Try outplaying my point and clicks son.\"\n\n{{champion:245}} \"Heads up!\"\n\n{{champion:80}} \"Stun, stabby stab, throw spear, guaranteed crit, and dead. Try rewinding that, coward.\"\n_\"Turns super spooky.\"_\n\n{{champion:84}} \"Where did he go, I lost him, I-\"\n_\"Dies.\"_\n\n{{champion:80}} \"Gotta love that invisibility and bonus damage.\"\n\n{{champion:64}} \"Ah, this is how League was meant to be played. So many big plays, so much action. I should make normal league much more like t-\"\n_\"Dies.\"_\n\n{{champion:80}} \"All hail the blood god, me!\"\n\n**_Two weeks of death, salt, death, overpowered Pantheon and Rengar, and death later:_**\n\n{{champion:26}} \"That was so much fun. I mean, I enjoyed watching it. Not sure how it was to play. Anyway, our winner is Pantheon. Seriously, that guy is good.
