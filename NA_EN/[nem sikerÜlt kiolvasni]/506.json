It mentions just an option to mute pings, and gives it as an example as muting chat which mutes all chat. If that is true, and its meant to block all pings, why is Riot doing this type of \"marketing tactic\"? Rather than fix the issue right away (for this case, allow us to block a specific person from pinging us), you start from the bottom and just make it block everyone first then later on in patches you work on towards that lol.

You click a green button in the middle of the ping and that spawns a going here ping nearest to that ping.\r\n\r\nOr you could just add a new texture layer to the original \"on my way\" ping that shows the outline of a range indicator (let's say somewhere between 5-10 teemos) and then have a line of code (which I guess already exists according to the video above) that checks for whether or not the team pings is in \"harmony\" with the original ping. You could even make it so that repeated \"on my way\" pings from the first shotcaller or overeager teammates do not contribute to the melody by adding exceptions. I guess the odd part in that case will be checking for edge case scenarios (such as opposite sides of walls) which could be misconstrued. Smaller range might be the way to go to avoid that and then relying on common sense of players to figure out the rest.\r\n\r\nAnother thing worth considering is how do you prevent a shotcalled from pinging multiple locations and teammates pinging those locations afterwards? The ping limit only does so much.
