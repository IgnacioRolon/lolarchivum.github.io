When I opened them up, it keeps telling me to log in(which I already am, clearly) and when I click on that it just refreshes the page. Then I tried to edit my boards profile and it's saying that there is an error and that it doesn't exist. So yeah, not sure what to do here..\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T18:11:09.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I can't see the account you're posting from.  In general, I believe the roleplaying boards have a minimum level requirement before being able to post there.  If you are posting from the intended account, the summoner name and level should update by posting here.  My assumption here is that you might currently be logged into an account that hasn't had a summoner name created yet.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
