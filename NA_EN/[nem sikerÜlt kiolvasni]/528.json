Champions will be considered cancer in every meta, there doesn't seem to be an escape from that. Feral flare abusers, the super tanks with on release cinderhaulk, tank fizz, tank ekko, tank yasuo (honestly building champions tanky seems to be far more of a prevailing issue as perpetrators of cancerous gameplay than assassins ever were), basically there will always be the annoying champions of the patch. However at the very least the assassin meta brought activity. Games would accelerate to the pace of an assassin snowballing out of control instead of the metas since then mostly favoring tanks in a 'scale to late game teamfighting' play style. The fights are more fun to play, and far less boring. Also, while being able to get instantly deleted can cause a lot of frustration if you are a carry, it is by far better than  the tank meta. Nowadays when top gets super fed and starts split pushing (much like assassins did) you can't stop them because their stats are just too far ahead, they can stick to you and split without a great deal of danger. At least when an assassin got super fed they were still squishy and killable, now they just replaced that with tanks and super high base damage.\nSo tell me, why is it you prefer a zac at 4k hp being able to 100-0 you as a carry, than an assassin doing it who has to actually outplay your team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gimlo7","date":"2016-10-04T19:15:19.442+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"better than cass vik every game","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArtiKam","date":"2016-10-04T21:53:26.008+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope they dont make them too weak as well cuz I usually play assassins.
