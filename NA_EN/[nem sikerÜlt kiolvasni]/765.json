Then if a team's region earns a #1 seed in the region, by placing 1-4 at MSI, they don't have to worry about play-in at the following MSI? How is this in any way favoring anybody. If anything its the same concept as the two bottom teams potentially getting relegated. The only difference is the MSI play-in Region teams are relegated  based on the the worst performing MSI region teams of the previous year.Each region still gets 1 team and that team is presumed the best in the region, so if anything it favors noone.\n\nWhy should an IWC team that earned a #1 seed the previous year (assuming it happens) have to play in the following year. (They've already shown their stuff so to speak). The region proved itself the previous split by earning that spot and beating up on the bigger regions. So it makes sense that if the bigger regions want it back, they should have to earn that spot. More teams go to worlds out of the bigger regions, why should the IWC or other regions be punished because their small and have less statistical oppornity(notice i said opportunity...not likilihood) of placing high. It's a fact, more teams in a tourney the higher chance of you placing better. If anything the current 2-yr span does nothing but protect the big regions wayyyy too much. (Why baby the big regions if a smaller region took there spot.  The reason they did is the big region team stunk it up at MSI, boo hoo!!!){{item:3070}} \n\nNo 'extra' teams make it into MSI and nooone's getting favored. So what if SKT splits, the korean team would still get to defend the MSI #1 seed and the world #1 seed. If they perform well, no problem to Korea.  If your good enough to earn it in a tourney where 1 team 1 region, then you ought to have a chance to defend it.

The point of reading a post sir is using context clues, and clearly nothing in my post called out that we should invite 'a specific' team back. Nothing in the article called that out, so why the hell would I suggest picking a specific team, over basing it on which team represents that region. Doesn't that seem just a little bit random to you? Context clues!\n\n If you know anything about the current rules of  MSI, which teams get invited, and how that affects worlds seating you should know those regions that have or 'still have/had' their 1st round seed at worlds are based on a region's team that places 1-4 at MSI.
