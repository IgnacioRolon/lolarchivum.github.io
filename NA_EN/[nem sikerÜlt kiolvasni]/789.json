It was great meeting you at PAX East! The 3rd person was Jess F, the leader of the CSP team. She was wearing my Teemo hat, if that helps remind you. \r\n\r\nEvery year we take some time to figure out what we want to do events wise. In 2016, we chose to go hard at PAX East with the reveal of the RiftWalk and Thresh. This year we chose PAX West. For 2018 and beyond, we're still exploring and figuring out what we may want to do. If we do choose to attend future PAX events, we'll be sure to announce it on our regular channels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you also for doing the survey!","replies":[{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2017-08-08T20:32:28.209+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it jogs your memory, I was the guy in the dark cloak (Never did figure out what I wanted to cosplay though...)

I went to the first PAX South and one of the biggest reasons is that Riot was supposed to have a large presence there.  I was hoping for some cool swag like a cool button or even a chance at a skin, but that would have been extra.  Mainly I was looking forward to an actual panel with possible reveals or real insight into the game/upcoming changes, and there were two big panels planned.  What I got was basically a drawn out summoners showcase talk.  And to make matters worse, Riot cancelled the other scheduled panel.  No swag at all.  Was highly disappointed. The rest of PAX was fun, but it was a major bummer that the biggest draw of PAX South for me was a complete dud.
