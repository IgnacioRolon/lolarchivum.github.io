That wouldn't make them better players, though, and is possibly the most ridiculously arbitrary qualifier for power rankings ever. Like, \"Oh yeah, that guy's pretty good, probably #15 or so. But if his teammates were shit, he'd be way higher.\"\n\nAlso, Dade is the only person on Blue who's potentially more important than Deft.

I have no particular emotional investment in any Korean teams (that are attending this tournament, anyways).\n\nHowever, I'm unconvinced that western players and teams are currently able to rival them, and I get the impression that these power rankings are primarily motivated by a desire to push a specific narrative (that the West is secretly just as good as Korea, and it's only nebulous concepts like 'teamwork' that separate the regions), rather than by a desire to accurately represent the scene. \n\nIf somebody who's only just getting into League of Legends esports reads these articles and actually believes that Rekkles, as an individual player, is superior to the best that Korea has to offer - I see that as an issue.
