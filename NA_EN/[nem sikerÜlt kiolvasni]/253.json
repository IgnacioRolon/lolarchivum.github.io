We've actually \"grouped\" the jungle information intentionally however. Jungle paths is a pretty specific play pattern for junglers, and if you have a uniquely identifiable jungle path you take on, say Jarvan when starting Blue team, then your opponents might be able to look that up and use it against you. Since this isn't the kind of information that would be available in the game through other methods, we would prefer to not make it available via the API either since it could provide an unfair advantage in knowledge.\n\nAs to champion positions, to the best of my knowledge 60 seconds is the rate at which we capture the data to the match stats database by design, so I'm not sure it's something we can easily increase.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackTecno","date":"2015-11-13T00:04:51.394+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to give junglers something like \"Krugs are your least cleared camp so you can try and give it to your top laner\" I can see how it would affect you if an enemy were to look it up, but if it's a post game request (just showing you how many times you cleared the camp) then I don't see how that would show jungle pathing at all, since Gromp and Krugs are the usual starting camps, but are also one of the least cleared camps.\r\n\r\nAnd if that's not possible I would at the very least like to see how much gold is earned from those neutral monster clears. I know it's a bit much to ask, but I want to see how much information I can relay to people to improve their gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadManApocalypse","date":"2015-11-13T10:43:37.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"The argument that \"unfair advantage in knowledge\" is absolutely invalid in every way shape and form. You represent LoL as a competitive esport. Want to know what people do in other sports? They STUDY the enemy. To know what possible paths people take is actually fair. But if you do some simple thinking you'll realize this.\r\n\r\nIf Party A (Jungler) looks up his common paths, where junglers tend to die most, where fights break out. Then you will try to avoid it. \r\n\r\nIf Party B (Ganker) Looks up his enemies common paths, death locations and where fights break out, then you will try to go to it.\r\n\r\nNow if parties A and B both have this information it does nothing but skew data more, creating an ever shifting change. What you're essentially saying is \"Jungle path knowledge would be unfair.\" But the truth of the matter it would be such useless information because of how frequently it changes.\r\n\r\nThe only way this knowledge would be unfair is if only ONE party had the knowledge.\r\n\r\nRant over.\r\n\r\nTL:DR The argument of unfair knowledge is invalid. There is intelligence, then counterintelligence. To not use the available knowledge is ignorance, and ignorance is **death.**\r\n\r\n\r\n(Edit due to a very poor and misleading sentence in beginning)","replies":[{"poster":"BlackTecno","date":"2015-11-13T17:34:07.742+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually agree with Riot Sargonas in the information of what camps are cleared and when would give a great amount of advantage. I personally don't enjoy the level 1 or 2 invade from a Lee Sin, and if they know my jungle path to say, \"he always starts blue, let's take his red or kill their bot lane\" would end up being more unfair than not. However what I was actually asking for was a little different. I wanted to be able to tally what camps you clear and how often you do so. I don't think it would show a path, but would give insight to what camps teammates can take without worrying if their actions would upset their jungler.\r\n\r\nAlthough since position of every champ on the map is given every minute, I could easily figure out jungle pathing as well as first gank and clear speed. I don't know any jungler who can clear in less than 30 seconds. But oh well, I'll work with what they give me. It's their game after all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2015-11-12T21:36:47.464+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all!
