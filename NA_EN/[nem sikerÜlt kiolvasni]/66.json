I'm glad to see it's being put into a framework that's a bit more timeless :).\r\n\r\nBut I thought Riot was going to wait until more issues were resolved before forcibly rolling out the new client.  I'm using it for the most part (because of how damned beautiful it is), but it is super buggy sometimes.\r\n\r\nI would have hoped the dev teams would have done the following things at least before forcing us into the new client:\r\n\r\n1. Reduce game start glitches and bugs.  I still get lots of issues with it not showing the champions when it should, though I've only dropped from probably 2 load screens, that's still 2 load screens too many imo.  Nobody would call mine a 'low spec' computer, so I didn't even put a second thought to changing to low spec mode when I saw the option... perhaps you should think about putting a different label on it (\"Simple Graphics\" for example).\r\n\r\n2. Re-Create the item sets section.  I use them constantly, and this is the main reason I switch back to the old client sometimes... I did see in another post that there are some 3rd party sites that help make them via the API.  Might be a good enough work-around for now but I really wish it would be integrated into the client again.\r\n\r\n3. Please, for the love of god-fist, fix the store.  The store should never 'time out' it's been like that for literally years, but it's worse in the new client.  I have to actually close and restart the client to get the store to come up most of the time now.  Same with the loot section.  I have to reboot to get into it sometimes.\r\n\r\n4. Oh man, you have to do something about those notices going in front of the store/loot button and not having a close on them.  I'm talking about those little pop-up messages that say that a summoner dodged or something that go over your loot and store buttons on the home page.  If you are planning on keeping them there, I need to be able to close them faster so I can get into the store and loot buttons.  They are very annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"T1DECALLER","date":"2017-04-14T18:43:27.076+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I REALLY WANT THE BUILDING PAGE RIOT PLZ MAKE IT BACK{{champion:55}} {{item:3146}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-04-14T18:54:40.034+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"> MONDAY, APRIL 10 IN OCEANIA: Phase 2 - All players in Oceania were automatically upgraded to the updated client, with the legacy client turned off.
