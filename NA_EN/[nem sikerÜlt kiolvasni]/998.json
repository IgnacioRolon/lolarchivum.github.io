The point of her Oathsworn, Sentinel passive and Fate's Call is so that she will be more reliant on her support than other ADC's.  Kalista was designed to be weaker than other ADC's without her Oathsworn, but very strong with her Oathsworn.  By emphasizing her solo capabilities and downplaying her interactions with her Oathsworn, Riot is undermining the most unique parts of her, as well as undermining her thematically.","replies":[{"poster":"Roland K Jones","date":"2015-09-01T21:46:44.561+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I already wrote my own comment on this, but I agree.
