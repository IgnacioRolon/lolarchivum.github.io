The concept that NA has improved heavily is not very far-fetched considering the diversity of the game-play styles among the teams.\r\n\r\nSo there was the \r\nClassic EU stall game Curse(Push aggression only with a clear lead)\r\nChinese aggression LMQ(Fight everything)\r\nKorean rotational aggression game CLG(Attack every opening)\r\nKorean objective strangulation C9(Snowball objectives through better trades)\r\nUnformed EG, Complexity\r\nClassic NA lane to teamfight dominance DIG, TSM(win lane, win game)\r\n\r\nAnd that was a brutal pool to play in because the same tactics would not work against all the teams. This resulted in a large amount of parity between the teams as one team's style could catch another unprepared.\r\n\r\nMost of the Na teams had very distinct game styles and although the styles did converge more near the end there was a huge amount of diversity that were not present in EU and China. And diversity is in this case is good, because it is a hell of a way to wrack up experience as it constantly forced a large number of adaptions.\r\n\r\nRemember that in the Qualifiers TSM went 3-2 vs both LMQ and C9 which is ridiculously close, as soon as TSM took a game off of SHRC it put out a large possibility that the other NA teams would be able to take games off of Chinese teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nothingness","date":"2014-09-25T18:05:05.418+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"wtf fnatic didn t win ?","replies":[{"poster":"Some ADC","date":"2014-09-25T18:39:09.451+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":6,"body":"NA > EU and China","replies":[{"poster":"MG Logic","date":"2014-09-25T21:25:42.963+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":18,"body":"kids please just cause lmq won doesnt mean NA>EU and china, the rankings are still korea>china>>>EU&EU","replies":[{"poster":"v CaBooSe v","date":"2014-09-26T00:07:30.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"If NA teams continue to beat chinese teams then its Korea #1 NA #2 and while lmq is a Chinese team the fact that they finished 3rd in NA shows how strong NA has gotten, not to mention LMQ has learnt alot from playing in NA LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"Chris the human","date":"2014-09-26T04:30:36.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just because they're from china and speak chinese (and may or may not still have their chinese citizenship [haven't looked into it]) doesn't mean they're notl a NA team. why? because NA is who they're representing. they pull off the world's biggest miracle and win it all? a chinese team won.

I consider them to be the strongest team in NA despite their third place coming to worlds. They may even be the reason why C9 and TSM have done better than the EU teams... I think, they brought some serious competition (that relentless Chinese aggression) to the NA LCS, thus forcing the other NA teams to improve to keep up... It's something the EU teams didn't have to face. They need to wake up and learn to play less passively, learn to switch on the aggression more decisively here at Worlds... and they need to do so quickly, otherwise their chances are slim.\r\n\r\nMost of the Asian teams know, that a good offense makes for a good defense... whereas a good defense will not get you much of anything, unless your opponents make a mistake. At Worlds, victory will not be handed to you on a silver platter. You need to take a risk and seize it, if an opportunity presents itself. With only a few exceptions, every team at Worlds is a powerhouse of precision, coordination and skill. If you don't force your opponents to make mistakes, they're just not very likely to make them.

If you look at SK, the one game where freddy wasn't turned into a \"superstar\" for SK was the one game they looked strong vs. TSM despite imo having a worse team comp. OMG is obviously slumping watch the SSB vs OMG game you can see Cool miss spells constantly (#2 player in worlds? My ass what a horrible article that was as a side note). Anyways back to my point --> LMQ, C9, SSB, White Shield. These teams don't make one person their \"super star\" they try to have an overall good team (Arguably SSB have all godlike players but still). Do you hear people call out Vasili the same way they call out Uzi as being an amazing ADC? No. Do you see C9 call out Meteos as being an amazing jungler like alliance call out Shook? No. How about Hai vs Froggen? That Alliance vs C9 game was a perfect example that it is a team game. You can't 1v9 in League of Legends anymore. Froggen and Alliance will never beat the team-oriented teams if they keep trying to make Froggen their \"superstar\". Same for FNC, I will enjoy watching FNC crumble as they constantly try to make Reckless their \"Superstar\". Again. Its a TEAM GAME. 1v9ing doesn't work anymore. Sorry FNC, Sorry EU. Sorry China. <Namei got shit on by AHQ because he thought he could 1v9. He couldn't. Enjoy that black mark of NEARLY losing to AHQ, the 3rd seed.
