As a heads up, the error you had usually happens to new PCs or outdated versions of windows that don't have [required products ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387)to install.  It looks like you also updated your install to the Open Beta version, which is currently in testing.  There seems to be an issue at the moment where you'll get that message even if a name is not available.  You'll have to find another summoner name, or use the legacy client to create your name:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps, and let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"z0x","date":"2017-01-06T08:38:59.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did this.
