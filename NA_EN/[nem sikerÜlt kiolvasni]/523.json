Riot has a hard-on for getting rid of this champion from pro play because it is the only thing that counters assassins. In solo queue, the champion is pretty bad. Riot's attempt was to probably push him into top lane more but they didn't compensate him at all and instead just gutted his support capabilities while not addressing his lack of tankiness in the duo lane.\n\nThe problem is, all anyone is going to see is that top lane Kench is going to become abusive because he can get into melee range regularly and eat you every few seconds. There will be no practical use for his W 'buff' in bot lane and all tongue lash cd reduction will do is make him go OOM faster. Yet, the pros will still choose him for his ability in organized play to save someone who gets caught out. Basically unless they delete the champion's ability to save allies, he will still get picked in a meta where you can go from 100-0% health in the matter of 0.5 seconds. All this does is make him feel like absolute shit for us players who stuck with the champ.\n\nThe champion is dead without any further changes.
