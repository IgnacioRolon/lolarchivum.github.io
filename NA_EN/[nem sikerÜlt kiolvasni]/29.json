It was commonly used to indicate structures that had been cleared previously, what direction troops were headed, etc.  It is a rich part of our history abroad and a testament to American ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThere is one story that I like even better from WWII - as Nazi German soldiers were notorious for having nit-picky perfectionist personalities, many GIs would rig explosives to paintings in homes and structures, and then cock the painting to the side.  The German soldiers, unable to control their better instincts, would straighten the painting, and KABLAMMO!  If you go into the home of many WWII vets you are very likely to still find crooked paintings in their homes, a subtle reminder of their former battlefield aptitude.\r\n\r\nAnd that concludes today's history lesson lol","replies":[{"poster":"Jinxsy","date":"2016-08-03T18:55:10.524+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"logged in to up vote this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2016-08-03T18:15:02.453+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":1,"body":"The narrative writer, WAAARGHbobo, was inspired by it while writing Kled's lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Lockbox","date":"2016-08-03T18:49:42.685+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember reading something that the Kilroy image and the name were actually two separate memes.
