We actually tried really different quadrants.  The problem we ran into is that when quadrants are drastically more different, it becomes really tricky to blend them so the midlane wouldn't look funny with each side belonging to a completely different climate/atmosphere.  We tried \"fading out\" from the center of each quadrant, but the map simply isn't large enough for the gradual blending we'd like to co-exist with maintaining a consistency within the quadrant.  Hope my bad description is making sense :)  Thanks again for the comment!","replies":[{"poster":"vandrissen","date":"2015-03-13T06:30:17.207+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"Personally I don't see what the problem would be with having midlane look completely different on each side.

Sometimes we make an awesome mind blowing concept, but it does not work in the game. Examples:  The design is hard to click on. Or it does not fit the environment, Or it does not look like tanky enough? or look weak enough? The creatures have to look, in relation to each other, at the correct power level or defensive power level. An environment piece has to be cool but not distracting to champions or effects. All the concept work here is about trying to answer those questions. Does it work with gameplay? Does it fit the big picture? Art serves gameplay. \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question.

The North Side (Red) looks very mystical, even sporting owls and using more Magicky-looking minions, whereas the South Side (Blue) features a more typical stout knight-like look, including a stag motif. Even picture 15 in this concept art references these various looks, naming them as Paladins and Mages. These names very much sound like they could be alt names for Protectorate and Magelords.
