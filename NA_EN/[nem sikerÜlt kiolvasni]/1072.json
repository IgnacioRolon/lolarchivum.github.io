So to me, it would seem really odd for Pantheon to choose Artrius if he found him that pathetic, especially if you consider that he didn't even need to choose him even if he did reach as it has been shown with Kayle father, and even in the Targon Bio page that even if they reach the top no award is actually mandated, so there must have been a reason, and I think it was cause Pantheon, the aspect, knew he would not win vs Aatrox but instead wanted a soldier that could fight him and all other dangers Runeterra might face, someone that would know the struggle from Mans view and would fight to protect them from even the celestials if must, and that figure perfectly describes Artrius, yet Panth needed to ignite the fire to do so, burying Artrius in his own mind to open his eyes to the danger of celestials and allowing himself to dye to Aatrox, in order for Atrius to pick up the role, in such making it so war didn't really die that fight but evolve and change, Atrius succesfully becoming the new Aspect of War. This also is the main reason I think we still call him Pantheon rather than Atrius, and though this is just a personal theory the more I thought on it the more it made sense, and it is all more likely with the short story.\r\n\r\nPhew sorry for that long divert but now with Pantheons short story, I can say that it illustrated to me once again how Atrius fits with the role of man a warrior ready to protect and fight alongside them from an unspeakable ascended type of being, and through the sacrifice of another manages to stand again, the fallen warrior now part of the Pantheon constellation as their fellow warriors manage to stand up again, alongside Panth in order to fight, one can't help but rally along with them, from the screen, I screamed her name, imagining the soldiers to my right and left ready to fight an impossible godlike being as mortals ready to show that we won't give up to any being, that our pain and effort is not for their amusement and that we are more than what they find us and made me pumped at its end. And yet it also showed to me how the Pantheon constellation is made of the many soldiers from before that died protecting something, something they most definitely valued, it illustrated to me that the OG Aspect of Pantheon could not have hated Man for war is fought cause we all value something, something we would die to protect something we love and care, that we also struggled and met our own challenges, if Pantheon truly hated the weak, his constellation would not be open to those that died for it, he would not remember them like soldiers remembering their friends after a battle or families that lost their loved ones, Pantheon chose to remember those willing to protect no matter the cost, and to me that's why Pantheon chose Artrius, cause he would stand up, willing to fight anyone, to protect that idea.\r\n\r\n... OK if you read all that, sorry for it, I just really love the lore, and wish to share it here, hoping that the RIOTers working on it know how much I value their work, while also kind of wanting to share my thoughts on it, but yeah... might have gone overboard, hehe, but let me say I can't wait for the next lore patch, going to try to control myself though.","replies":[{"poster":"WeAreDuo","date":"2019-12-01T23:57:31.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read it... it took 4 months but I finally got to the end... and it was worth it!
