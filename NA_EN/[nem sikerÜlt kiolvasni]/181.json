As someone who played Gnar for a little bit I love the idea of windows of power.  They are very useful tools to create counter-play.  His new passive allows him to be counter-played, while annihilating his opponent if they do not pay attention to his stacks (a skill any player needs, paying attention to his enemy), which is also why he is going to be a very powerful assassin when played correctly, and not so much when he fails to utilize the passive.  Learning curves are also very important to game health (Garen).\r\n\r\nRyze's new Q is not going to kill him.  Everyone is saying Veigar died to his Q change.  That's not true, what killed him was the change to his E.  I personally am very interested to see where his top lane matches end up early game because he can't pressure melee champs until level 3 or 4 (whenever he decides to scale both his W and E).\r\n\r\nRyze's W looks the same, so there is no need to comment on this.\r\n\r\nRyze's new E is a very interesting change, and I know a few ways that people can take advantage of it.  First off, Ryze was always meant to be a teamfighter who steamrolled clumped groups in the late game.  This actually buffed his late potential by giving him a targeted nuke that damages the target TWICE if other units are hit in the aoe.  Hello, Luden's Echo (for a mid lane Ryze).\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, Ryze's ult.  It's the same, but the cdr from old Q went to new ult.  Nothing much to say here, although the idea of an aoe snare would be interesting, but I doubt Rito would buff his 1v5 THAT much.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think new Ryze is going to be a very powerful top and mid pick, with maybe slightly less focus on tankiness and more sheer power to delete two squishies at once.  I am very excited to see the fast paced teamfights his passive and ult will bring, along with the QQ spam (laced between other abilities, of course), and laning phase without reliable level 1 and 2 poke.\r\n\r\nTL;DR, THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD BOYS","replies":[{"poster":"acrid56","date":"2015-04-09T20:28:09.717+0000","up_votes":388,"down_votes":11,"body":"Your bronze.

It only seems that way because of what the pros do. The pros actively seek out imbalanced champs and items to try and exploit them for as long as possible until it gets hit with the nerfbat. I am not trying to portray them negatively though. It is simply the competitive mindset. If something can give you an edge over your opponents and is completely legal, why wouldn't you want to use it.\r\n\r\nThat means the pros end up revealing the problem cases that Riot has to address in order to keep the game as balanced as possible. What further complicates the issue is that the game has become so intricately intertwined that the instant a facet of power is reduced a new problem case makes its way to the surface. Once the pros hone in on that imbalance that no longer has a check, they use it until it gets addressed. then the cycle resets and continues.\r\n\r\nThat is why it seems like Riot only caters to the pros. Because the pros are the ones keeping them on their toes... (yup I just went there)\r\n\r\nThere are problem cases however that are not so easily dealt with. three such issues have been Ryze, Kassadin, and Lee Sin. These three champs have seen some of the most play over the years because of their incredible versatility and capability. They have also seen more changes done to them than most of the other champions in the game because of this. The options are tweak and hope it is enough to shift the power enough but not to much, Retune/rework the champion so it can be better balanced compared to its current state, or completly gut the champion so it will never be a problem in the future. One of these options is the easiest to implement but seems kneejerky (totally a word and delicious) because of the amount of back and forth that occurs. One of them requires an incredible amount of time and resources to finish and can only be viewed and addressed in the long term. The last one will never be done again because of how poorly it addresses the issue and reflects on Riot as a company. it should be rather self explanatory which is which.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Fellow SunBro","date":"2015-04-10T17:56:55.370+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally, someone who understands how this works.

W is a time based damage over time spell that deals more damage depending on how much health the opponent is missing. In short, if you are not rooted, you can easily dodge this ability. (Most people think that the majority of Morgana's damage comes from q, however in fact, W does more damage based on its % of missing health factor).\r\nReason 2). In order for Morgana's kit to be successful, she has to not only hit Q, but a consecutive W and R as well. Even if Morgana hits Q, being unable to land both halves of her ult, will lead to an injured enemy running away safely from Morgana. The reason Q is 3 seconds at max rank is to literally keep the target in place for the entire duration of her ult, Soul Shackles. The channel time from start to stun is 3 seconds, and a master Morgana will only Q after she has initially started her ult. Ergo, The target will be forced to endure her ult and cannot escape.\r\nReason 3). If you add up the time of Morgana's cc. she only has a 4.5 second window to deal all of her damage, which plays into tormented soil's 5 second duration. Even if morgana Lands Q and R, chances are, if she did not lay down W between the first half of her ult and Q, she will not do enough damage to kill her target.\r\n\r\nSimply put, Morgana's Q is to enable her to kill at least one target of her choosing in the late game. If her snare's duration was shorter, they would also have to alter the channel time for R to match the duration of the snare. So all in all, Riot is doing you a favor by making her Q's duration 3 seconds, rather than 1.5.\r\nIf Morgana's snare was only 1.5 seconds long, they would decrease R's channel time by half, and amp up the total damage that W does by 100% in order to compensate for a shorter window of opportunity to keep targets on top of tormented soil.\r\nAll in all, if you don't like to play against Morgana, here are some tips: 1. Buy merc treads (and use tenacity mastery in defensive mastery tree)\r\n2. Buy a Zhonya's hourglass if you are a mage, and a Banshee's Veil if you are playing anyone who is not a mage.\r\n3.

I remember when Ezreal came out he was special because he was all skill shots. Now that's basically the order of the day. I appreciate that skill shots are better for controlling counterplay, but it's very frustrating to me that now I'd absolutely be willing to bet that for any given champion rework, reliability is going to be the first thing out the door. The trouble is that that's an awful lot of reworks to do.\r\n\r\nNobody likes to be on the receiving end of a lane tax, and I understand that even though I'm glad at least Ryze's entire kit isn't turning into skill shots. When you have manaless champs like Katarina still in the game (with a targeted poke no less), along with all of the ninjas, and plenty of other champs with targeted poke (Sona comes to mind), it's hard for me to believe that these kinds of changes are being done systematically.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to try to globally reduce reliability, then say so. Make a policy statement, and I can get behind that, confident that Kat's and Akali's days are numbered--not that I want them nerfed, but rather that if targeted skills are a problem, they need to be dealt with consistently.\r\n\r\nInstead, what I'm seeing is piecemeal. The result is that the game is better because there's one less champion with a solid, repeatable lane tax ability, and so you have less champs to worry about banning. That's a pretty bad rubric for determining whether things are improving.\r\n\r\nIf performance consistency is going to be a target for the chopping block, that's a totally legitimate stance, and I support it. But actually put it on the block, and be up front about it, because that's exactly the kind of commitment players need to be able to hold someone to, and without it it just makes some of us less confident that high-view design goals mean anything.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's very easy for us to judge based on appearances, and by all appearances champion balance and design has no overarching method whatsoever. This means that right now I'm scared to death that Malzahar or Brand will get a rework (even though Brand could definitely use some work), because I expect that would mean mechanics I associate with them will likely be replaced because they're consistent. So at least give me some peace of mind about whether that fear is well-founded, because if it is, I should absolutely have the same fear for every single champ that has targeted damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Master Clapp God","date":"2015-04-09T20:55:42.684+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"This IMO bodes well.
