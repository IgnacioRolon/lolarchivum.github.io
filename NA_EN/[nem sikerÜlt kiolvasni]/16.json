That said, our first priority is getting the gameplay as good as we can, and Jhin and Zilean were warping enough (...and generally poor enough of a \"Playing As\" experience in this mode) that we decided to keep them out of the pool.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you want more details on what I mean by Warping: Marksman in general (Very much including Jhin) lean pretty heavily on \"Normal\" teamfight structure to have interesting play: they want a tank line to protect them from... well, basically every champion in this mode, hahah. Without those lines for combat, or a normal laning phase to do laning things, they don't really have room to do the things they're best at. Beyond that, they rely pretty heavily on clumping to not die (Stay near allies for protection/ scouting), which we wanted to avoid in this mode as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWith Zilean, basically we just wanted to minimize Hard CC as much as possible, and the rest of his kit is about empowering, which led to the clumping I mentioned above. Double Bomb from stealth felt super degenerate and was incredibly hard to hit outside of that, we didn't really want him escorting other people and, at least for this iteration, were trying to keep AoE CC to a low (Ekko is the one real exception here, and his is less core to his pattern).","replies":[{"poster":"H4N S0L0","date":"2017-02-10T18:43:47.368+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the limited pool idea would help you guys push a narrative ark a little better for instance, if you had butcher bay with only the people from bildgewater, or the targonians when you were working that story, it would be more grounded. like back in the day when you guys did the noxis vs ionia games. It might even be a way for us the community to be part of the story, you have all these statistic trackers, it would be nice if you included some of actual gameplay into the lore of league. An example I could make here is something like having a limited champion pool for a piltover zaun game, and you do a look at how many times xchampion was killed by xchampion, then the team releases a narrative about them becoming bitter enemies and rivals because of those events.

It's similar to Ascension, with the addition of wards.\r\n\r\nPros: something different, different feel, music, etc.\r\nCons: limited champ roster, limited team engagement\r\n\r\nWhat I'm experiencing from this mode is a lot of people just running around doing their own thing, or hiding in the bushes waiting to ambush.  Even when people are not hiding and you randomly run into them (bc there are so many walls and bushes on the rift), that either you kill them or they kill you in a millisecond.  There's not much back and forth, engaging/disengaging, making plays.\r\n\r\nIn Ascension, at least you and your teammates can compete for the relics or team fight for ascension. With this mode, not seeing much of anyone competing for anything.  Just mainly buying wards and running into people randomly.  The limited roster also deflates this mode.  Yes, it's assassin-theme, but that cuts out a good amount of players who like to play other styles (range, tanks, melee, etc).  \r\n\r\nHaving a limited roster makes game play repetitious and boring (similar to what happened with Nemesis Draft). In ND, for the whole weekend, people would pick the same champs over and over.  I don't know how many times I had to play Urgot {{summoner:3}}. It's like going to a buffet and being told you can only eat the salad.  After a while, you just feel suffocated and ya leave.\r\n\r\nNice idea on this mode, but gonna have to pass until it improves.
