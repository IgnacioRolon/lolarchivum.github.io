I think that is a responsible, player-first organization.  Glad to see them with a strong start and I hope that they continue to play well.\r\n\r\nI wonder why C9 stepped away from how they were using their two top laners.  I expected to see Ray on carry and split push match ups that looked to get ahead in lane and impact on the tank and team fight style top lane champs.  Not calling for Ray's head or anything, but it seemed like a deviation from their strategy with the two tops last split.","replies":[{"poster":"PainlessFiend","date":"2017-06-06T18:46:29.683+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"c9 impact had just gotten back home from korea that weekend, c9 gave him the weekend to rest up for next week.

Only time will tell if they can keep this up or if other teams will catch on to their strategies and stall out early aggression and make better mid/late game shotcalls. So far, it is looking good - with xmithie proving he has the ability to win early leads for multiple lanes - not just camp mid or something. Also hope it works out well for clg - huhi has improved a ton and I think dardoch can be a positive force and model for how a player can improve their behavior and the perception the community has of them.\r\nTSM - best spring split team. Doublelift - joins relegated team and singlehandedly carries team to victory over spring split champs. TSM + doublelift = mid tier summer split team? Clearly some stuff needs to be ironed out.\r\nC9 - good to see ray playing stuff other than just carry toplaners even if the games didn't go so well. He can learn and improve. Once he becomes flexible to play both roles effectively, he can truly be top tier NA toplaner.\r\n100% winrate in pro play with 3 or more games? Ban the bard, bench the kench lol.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentSkies","date":"2017-06-07T22:21:55.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think TSM is being coached effectively for whatever reason. Bjergsen is too good to run \"protect the ADC\" team comps. He should always be playing a mage/assassin, not like the two games vs IMT where he played Galio.","replies":[{"poster":"Archäen","date":"2017-06-08T03:15:57.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the goal was simply winning this past weekend then you'd be right. However, for international competition they have to be able to run other comps including protect the ADC to be competitive. As hard as the loss for TSM fans is, it is the best thing for them (and by extension it is good coaching).","replies":[]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-06-07T22:32:35.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe their coaching isn't the best; however the comp could have worked and the players definitely have the skill to make it work with the champs they were given. It is a team synergy and practice issue. Bjerg has played supportive mids before - like lulu - and won games. So the draft was hardly the problem. It lies in the execution and not being on the same page and not pressuring intelligently. You don't play agro when the enemy can 3v2 or 3v1 or 2v1 you - you play agro when you can do that to them. You don't force fights or POSITION where the ENEMY can FORCE engages on you when you are behind. You coordinate engages rather than have 3 separate mis-timed engages; the point of a tank with cc is to make it difficult for the enemy team to focus their damage on your carries - giving your carries maximum time to get off their dps while soaking up a ton of burst and dps. When teams don't commit to their tanks' engages, they are missing dps and burst time and essentially trading away whatever hp the tank loses for nothing until they actually start fighting. It's week 1, who knows what will happen by the end of the split. Hardly time for tsm to panic - they will get their stuff in order, but perhaps perhaps perhaps they will have a challenge for first place besides just c9 this split.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-06-06T02:17:41.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many 40+ min games, I love it","replies":[]},{"poster":"SciFi Scrivener","date":"2017-06-06T12:38:33.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Interesting Fact: Riot will kick C9 while they are down :(","replies":[]}]}
