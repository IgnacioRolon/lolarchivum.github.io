I love how his aesthetics change with his passive, too. I love how his abilities also have adjustments to them with his passive, and I _absolutely ADORE_ that he has a scythe. I imagine that his dialoge will have him speaking to the scythe and vice-versa, and that his voice changes a bit perhaps depending on the form. I love absolutely everything about this champion. I don't care how hard he is, I will probably main him until I master him and get some good plays.

In the case of Zed and Rek'Sai, they leave the map entirely, similarly to how Kayn does.
