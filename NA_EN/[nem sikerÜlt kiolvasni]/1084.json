Yes you made her abilities come SLIGHTLY more quickly. But she didn't need that. Her abilities were already on pretty low cool downs. I could easily continue the fight and not just simply stand there. What I don't like is the reduction in Damage on ALL of her abilities. Reduction on q, on shield and on ult. all for what?? A slightly longer root duration. Which is useless because the e q combo stuns before the root was up. So a pointless change that did nothing. But the reduction in damage reallllly hurts her. For example look at my last 2 games leona. 6-2  and 6-2. I did tons of damage and was tanky. but now my reduction in damage will make me useless in return for slightly reduced cool downs. As a leona main with a 65% win rate in ranked I am pissed. Ohhhhhh the ult is slightly better but does 100 less damage. Good god!!!! No these changes made Leona even worse. A fail choice that will do nothing for her.
