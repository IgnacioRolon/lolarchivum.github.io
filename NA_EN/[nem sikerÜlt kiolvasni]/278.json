I liked your appearance on this video, but as others have said, try to fit your tone to the piece of art that you're describing. I love seeing energetic people and sometimes extra energy can really make the description of something interesting, but other times it isn't appropriate. I don't mean this to hurt you, you're still doing a great job, I just think you can be even better in the future. Don't do a complete heel-point turn either and go monotone; we still want to see your bubbly personality. Lastly, I think [SyncShips' comment ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/AfpI1PyV-the-summoner-showcase-is-back?comment=0006)is spot on.\n\nFeedback on this aside, I also wanted to compliment you on your Lulu cosplay and your Teemo cosplay all the way back. I wasn't at the events, but they both looked great in the videos I watched and the pictures I saw.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SyncShips","date":"2017-03-31T21:04:00.226+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Swimbananas!  I've done a lot of theatre/acting, so just some pointers.\r\n\r\nThe Showcase, in my opinion, is meant as a description tool for the amazing work the Summoner or Summoners put in.  The Ahri commentary was perfectly fine, but slow down, take a breathe.  Capture the viewers by describing and making the Showcase come to life.  What I recommend looking at is when Phreak does a Champion Spotlight, notice his tone, his pace, and how each word is easily discernable from the last.  Your enthusiasm is great, but the words then start to blur together.  Another material would be when Jessica Nigri or Lighthammer were describing pictures/fanart on /ALL CHAT.  Listen to how they describe and open up the actual showcased item/display.  \r\n\r\nDefinitely happy that Showcase is back, and can be better than before!
