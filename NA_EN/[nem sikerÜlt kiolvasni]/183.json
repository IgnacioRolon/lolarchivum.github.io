I'm really excited about consistency in the new client, so having several wildly different screens that all represent Champion Select doesn't feel good.  In developing the Blind Pick screen, we consulted with teams who make features like Ranked Team Builder or Rotating Game Modes to develop one flexible layout for all of the different Champion Select experiences (adding bans, adding role assignment, adding an extra person, etc.)  Blind Pick gives the basis, or the bones, of the screen, and we can build up from there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Star Cho","date":"2016-05-17T23:08:40.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate the fact that future additions to the client is one of the factors surrounding the new client, an evolving client is a great asset,","replies":[]},{"poster":"HAHA KILL ME XD","date":"2016-05-17T22:11:32.524+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"sexy af","replies":[]},{"poster":"ADCarryy","date":"2016-07-06T05:44:10.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is off topic.

I think that Riot should maintain a color theme throughout many of the visual elements to maintain visual consistency, less to seem like some UI's are abrupt in their environment change. My only argument against having a theme palette/visuals is that riot appears to maintain visual consistency through their artistic IP and signatures. One cannot argue against the importance of Riot's artistic stylization and how complex that whole ecosystem is. So I think the question is how to unite the visual styles whilst maintaining artistic freedom? Its hard to create guidelines and make things look amazing. Great visual styling comes from nuances that might not be obtainable through restriction. So the danger is in the banality that guidelines could create. I think they should worry less about what things should look like before, piece them together and mend the pieces together through editing. This requires a system that supports such editing, which is what this new system is. That is one of the reasons why to me it looks amazing, I can see the seems and as long as those seems are neat, the visual styling won't cheapen the UI.","replies":[{"poster":"SixBlades","date":"2016-05-27T00:32:11.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Latte Matcha,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=zE9z4pbL,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-05-20T22:09:37.356+0000)\n>\n> This is one of the things I was thinking about touching on in my feedback.

It's sometimes easy for us gamers to forget about the behind-the-scenes challenges like the tension between artistic freedom and the importance of a consistent brand. With the client update, we've taken the time to really think about a scalable, flexible visual language that (hopefully) will grow with League for the years to come. Don't be surprised the LoL ecosystem starts gradually looking a lot more hextech :D.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot OwleyCat","date":"2016-05-26T22:39:25.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Newb!  I'm a Visual Designer on the client update, and this is totally something we talk about, not just on our team but with lots of designers and artists across Riot.  The client is actually part of the ecosystem team here - we sit close by, we share work and talk very often, and there have already been some cool things made by our ecosystem teammates in the client update, as well as some of the more recent website upgrades, the new mobile app, etc. - as an aside, the new client style even got to help influence the in-game like Hextech Annie's particles and look. (OMG, that makes me so happy)\n\nPractically, it means we are making lots and lots of Style Guides and templates, teaching and getting feedback from our teammates (we have to make sure this style is actually flexible enough), keeping up with our shared Asset Library, etc.  Its alot of work to get more cohesive, we have to do it together. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-05-17T22:36:40.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im expecting Piltover concept art now after that sneaky teaser image in the post.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot OwleyCat","date":"2016-05-26T22:55:18.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always want more art. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-05-26T23:28:54.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh oh.
