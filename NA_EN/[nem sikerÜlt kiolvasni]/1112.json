That being said, its really the only way they can keep the tournaments going, as soon as there becomes too much regulation, no one will want to go through the trouble to host or play in one unless its a riot sanctioned event, they can't monitor EVERY small 5v5 match that gets acknowledged as a tournament, itd be foolish to even try. you should be glad they're this free with just trusting randoms and handing out actual prizes without even knowing whether or not the tournament will take place.","replies":[{"poster":"Mac Tíre","date":"2015-05-27T20:19:41.846+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":15,"body":"this is not accurate.\r\nAs a gaming community leader for my clan.

To say that I am in fact that I am being bias toward Riot, what makes you assume I have this said bias. I am just telling Riot what one of their communities has done and am informing them that stuff goes down that they don't know about that they sponsor. \n\nIf you sponsor someone, you have to make sure that they treat your brand and represent your name.

But a community that botched up so bad they deleted a TS server and made a whole new server and re-branded, this is the facts I am giving. I am leaving my bias out because I hate bias.\n\nAs a community leader you should be careful what you say and do because everyone depends to keep that community afloat and be accountable and fair. Just being rude and getting \"butt hurt\" over what someone posted about another community is not targeting your community. No names of any community but Riot has been mentioned and your comment was blind aimed and unnecessary.
