Tundra Fizz (375 RP) stood there, facing his opponent. Another tiny creature, perhaps they were related?\r\n\r\n\"We could be allies, you know?\" Asked Rocket Girl Tristana (487 RP), she had already been injured by one of Fizz's attacks. She had to be careful, the only way to beat him would be to burst him down and hope he didn't troll pole on time.\r\n\r\n\"No thank you,\" replied Fizz.\r\n\r\nTristana jumped at him, hoping to catch him off guard, but the quasi-yordle jumped away from her attack, tossing a small seal towards her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh sh...\" Tristana managed to whisper right before a giant killer whale chomped her down.\r\n\r\n\"Next two!\" Yelled Twisted Fate (292 RP) from afar. The fact that Vayne (440 RP) had never managed to connect in this ARAM match meant they had to do this small tournament to entertain themselves before the team could surrender at 20.\r\n\r\nSejuani (487 RP) stood forward, swinging her flail, ready to fight her next opponent.\r\n\r\n\"You belong in a museum!\" she was able to hear, followed by flashes of light that hit her in the face. She couldn't see her opponent, or the map in general.\r\n\r\n\"Dammit,\" she yelled, as she felt more of those mystic shots hitting her.\r\n\r\nShe had to trust her pig now, it was her only way to win.\r\n\r\n\"Bristle,\" she whispered, \"aim at him\"\r\n\r\nThe boar moved left and right, but their opponent kept jumping and flashing around, it was difficult to point his nose at him for more than half a second.\r\n\r\nSejuani could feel blood coming down her forehead, her armour pieces falling to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Bristle...\"\r\n\r\nBristle got an idea. He would aim where he'd think the enemy would appear next. Hopefully he'd get it right.\r\n\r\nHe turned to his right and roared, Sejuani sent her flail flying directly in front of her.\r\n\r\nEzreal was hit. He screamed in pain as he fell backwards. The magical flail had hit him right in the head, and his hair started turning white (260 RP).\r\n\r\n\"This... reminds me... of a movie...\" He said, as his life force escaped his body.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the two finalists, step forward!\"\r\n\r\nFizz and Sejuani walked towards the center of the map. They both looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Ready? Fi...\"\r\n\r\nTwisted Fate was unable to finish his phrase, as the announcer's voice was heard throghout the map.\r\n\r\n\"A summoner has reconnected!\"\r\n\r\nThey all stopped in their tracks. Could this mean...\r\n\r\nThey couldn't see anything yet, but suddenly, Fizz was hit with a bolt that stuck him against the wall. He was then hit by a blade of the ruined king active and two more shots. Fizz was no more.\r\n\r\nSejuani charged at the newcomer, but she tumbled away and struck Sejuani quickly with several silver bolts. The enemy was too fast for Sejuani's attacks, and she was already too injured from her battle with Ezreal. She succumbed after three more shots.\r\n\r\nVayne looked at Twisted Fate, who just laughed at her. a circle of cards appeared around him, and suddenly he wasn't there anymore. Vayne looked all over, but he couldn't see him.\r\n\r\n\"Over here, noob!\" Yelled TF. She looked down the bridge and was able to see him, standing on an iceberg, moving slowly away with the water current.\r\n\r\nTF sat on his icy vehicle and looked at the sky. Where would the water take him? Only time would tell. Right now, all he could do was wait.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im spark","date":"2014-09-04T17:32:32.703+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"**!!Rito if your listening!!** Look at how many *creative* minds we have here that have to do with literature!

The day that I challenge lissandras once thought rule and reign over the freijhlord. I had gathered a group of mine to invade her right at the heart of her frozen wasteland.

Us three have banned together to strike her when she least expected it. \r\n\"So where is this ice witch that you think of?\" Screamed ezreal, clenching his hands together for warmth.\r\n\"I do not know, ezreal, but I do know that she can be anywhere, keep your eyes open!\" I yelled\r\nRight as I finished talking, an unpredictable wave of frost surrounded the feet of grousell (if I spelled that right.) she let out a howling yell as she screamed in agony. I quickly hoped off her and lifted my head up to see her, lissandra.\r\n\"That is her! Get her!\" I quickly yelled, raising my bola as it gathered the frost from around me. I looked up to see a claw of pure ice screeching towards me. I quickly threw my bola, watching it fly past the claw and exploding on impact. I had too much hope, that was when she appeared right in front of me. With a wave of her hand I was thrown back by a wave of pure frost.\r\n\"Fizz I need help?\" I quickly screamed.\r\nFizz quickly dove at lissandra and quickly jabbed his trident into her cold skin. Nothing came out of her mouth. Fizz then felt a wave of pure ice overwhelm him as he was instantly frozen in a toumb of ice, which she then shattered with the wave of her hand. Ezreal shot a bolt as lissandra was finished his ally and it quickly hit her in the back. She yelled in agony and turned around to hurl a shard of pure ice into him. Ezreal quickly phased away and appeared behind lissandra. He fired another bolt along with a wave of energy, but she was gone. She had teleported right by my side with her frost abilities. \r\n\"What have you become?\" I quietly whispered to her.\r\n\"I have become, Ice born!!!\" She yelled.\r\nRight then, my beast smashed into her back, shattering her upon impact.\r\n\"Grousell!\" I yelled with excitement!\r\nWe have finished this battle where it began, but at the price of a friend...
