I also like that they made the correct counterplay to his Q (just stand in your minions, my guy) cleaner, and in general are encouraging him to get the quick W and then end the trade, which feels a lot better and has more counterplay than \"Oh I can just chase you from my turret to yours now I guess.\" Still playable top, still good, hopefully seen more as a counterpick now than a faceroll champ.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mk DILLY","date":"2019-07-16T20:48:21.473+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"Riot, where is Varus' increase to healing reduction?
