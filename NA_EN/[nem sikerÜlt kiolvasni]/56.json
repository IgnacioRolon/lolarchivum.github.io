The introduction to Missions and how they've continued to evolve as well has been really interesting; the pathways easily let for all players to do them while giving an option for a more difficult path if you choose. The rewards are definitely enjoyable at the end of the day. (Although the Hextech Crafting system overall still could use some changes imo.)\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to this event and the fun things that should come with it. Patch 8.11 is gonna be an interesting one with the changes to both SR and ARAM. Looking forward to seeing the Bilgewater ARAM map again too.\r\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enrovy","date":"2018-05-29T18:20:27.635+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm pretty sure the mission table is missing either a mission or the rewards just doesn't give masterwork chest","replies":[{"poster":"TheReaperXIII","date":"2018-05-29T18:57:34.269+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"Nice catch!

This gives players opportunity to 'earn' 1090RP of content, and 225RP of fractional* content.\r\n\r\n- Cursed Capsules seem to be good compared to other capsules I have seen, but the only thing you can be sure of for your 750RP is\r\n-- 225 Orange Essence\r\n-- 3 fractional* pieces of content, that you could either combine into 1 random mystery skin, or crush into about 600 or so more Orange Essence.\r\n-- If you happen to luck out and get a nice shard, or a Medallion/Kraken worth more shards, you could probably crush everything else into OE and *maybe* unlock your best shard.\r\n\r\n- The Golden Kraken looks like a very nice item, but there are issues, just like there are with the *entire* loot system.\r\n-- It gives three total pieces of fractional* content\r\n-- It gives a \"Legenadary Skin Permanent\"\r\n*However*\r\n-- It cannot be bought directly without spending 7500RP, otherwise only available as a 2% chance (approx. 1 in 50) per Cursed Capsule\r\n-- It is possible to earn a Legendary Skin you ALREADY OWN, making it only worth a nice chunk of Orange Essence to help you unlock other shards.\r\n\r\n* The overall problem with fractional content, and why I keep calling shards fractions, is simply because you are not really earning usable content with 1 shard, or fraction. You either need 3 shards to make 1 random skin, or OE from crushing even more shards to earn enough OE to unlock one shard.\r\n\r\n*Skin Sales and Mystery Skins are much more RP efficient on average than buying any kind of Loot content.\r\n\r\n* Possible solutions would be to\r\n-- Allow players more control over what categories they are spinning the roulette for (i.e. More Hextech Chests categorized by Lane, Role, Theme, etc.) \r\n-- Allow players to somehow earn limited amounts of OE without spending RP\r\n-- Lower the RP cost of Loot content\r\n\r\n- **TL;DR** \r\n\r\nMore Chromas are a good thing! - DW Vlad HYPE! - Love the FREE earn-able swag from this event - However, The Loot system needs to be overhauled. Buying Loot is basically gambling, with a few 'fail-safes' to ensure you earn at least SOMETHING after spending way too much RP on a chance of earning something. - We're basically better off spending RP on Skin Sales and Mystery Skins.","replies":[{"poster":"ÐethrıeŁ","date":"2018-05-29T21:29:26.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm not sure you understand what skin permanent is lmao.
