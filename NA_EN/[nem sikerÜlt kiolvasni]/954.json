For example, finding the average Adjusted Damage per Minute between minutes 20 and 30 and then calculating Damage Rating only for that period of time. You could then use this stat for multiple situations. Who's best at dealing damage in lane? Look at the stats between 0-10 minutes. Late game teamfights? Look at the stats between 30-40 minutes. You could also use it to break down a player's Damage Rating and focus in on what they are best at. Maybe Doublelift has a crazy high damage rating in lane, but is only average when it comes to later game teamfights, resulting in the high number we get for his overall Damage Rating. Unfortunately this doesn't solve the issue of including game time into an overall Damage Rating, but used properly I think it could provide a lot of information and context.","replies":[{"poster":"Count Buffon","date":"2017-08-04T19:12:18.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could average the ten-minute damage ratings to get a game damage rating.  It may be somewhat crude, as global averages tend to be.  It might also be more fair to average against gold sums, or some model's expected performance based on the two teams and their gold differences.  The trouble is that there are hundreds of variables, and not enough games to tease out the noise.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot more data on the ranked public server, but the circumstances of pro play likely invalidate much of the trends.  I think you could cook up some nice metrics for solo queue, but LCS will never be solved.  And if we did solve it, the players would adapt and the solution woulld evaporate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heldenherz","date":"2017-08-05T08:10:19.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My initial thoughts went to something like this as well, as there already exists a context wherein the data could be broken down, (early, mid, late or lane/team fight). However from a mathematical point of view it seems quite clunky as you're forced to work with arbitrary terms (what separates early game from mid game?). A more elegant solution might be to introduce another adjustment variable into the original equation. This would allow for a calculation that would be estimatably equal regardless of what is happening in the game.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the graph, you'll see that with the exception of the first five minutes DMG/Min over Time grows linearly at a rate of about 100 DMG/MIN per 20 MIN (in the graph it's actually about 105 DMG/MIN per 19 Min but this is all hypothetical so I'm rounding). This means that DMG/MIN grows at a Constant Rate of Change of about 5. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the required result (ie, \"the above graph wouldn’t increase over time\"), one would simply need to calculate the constant rate of growth in relation to time (We'll call this CRGxMIN) and subtract it from the DMG/Min Totals.  Please forgive my shotty Formula making skills, but if the Original Formula was X=(DMG/MIN), then the new formula would be something like X=(DMG/MIN)-(CGRxMIN).\r\n\r\nWith this new adjusted formula we would get the following data points: At 7 Minutes we'd have the following: (150)-(5x7)=115, At 18 Minutes: (200)-(5x18)=110. At 26 Minutes: (250)-(26x5)=120. This new formula seems to effectively achieve the goal of equalizing DMG/MIN over Time, and the minor variance that is there could be used to identify each champion/player's potential damage spikes and lulls (It also should fit into an acceptable margin of error, if I'd bothered to calculate one).\r\n\r\nIn theory this formula should also allow for a greater amount of flexibility and accuracy across the ever shifting meta where average game times can shift from -30 to 50+ quite easily, and it removes arbitrary terms such as early/late. Obviously this isn't a perfect solution, as not all champions will scale linearly, and late game champions/play styles could be biased against as their late game damage spikes would be hidden by the CGR adjustment. \r\n\r\nI'd like to see how this works over a variety of champions. Any possibility of seeing the graphs for other players/champions? Also, my math skills a very rudimentary, as you can see I'm basically just calculating the slope of an imaginary line and subtracting the difference. Any actual mathematicians out there who could expand on this concept with a more accurate formula?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Logaid","date":"2017-08-04T20:38:07.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea, it would be good for information for casters in game or in pre-game to discuss specific matchups. I think another option is to do % of enemies health instead of raw dmg numbers. Obviously the amount of raw dmg will go up over time, but the amount a character does in % would be more closer to the same. But I don't think it gives the same feel that these new dmg ratings give and probably why they didn't go down that route.

First off every champion in the game is gated from \"spamming\" by some type of in-game metric that requires them to properly utilize their abilities or they would be unable to fight properly. Second, anyone that has actually spent time playing would know full well that a \"well-timed\" combo of abilities tends to deal vastly more damage in a shorter period of time, often leaving no chance for retaliation.Third, they already account for champion variance so complaining that x player was on Renekton, one of the champions who could to some degree get away with spam, or that they were on Kennen vs a melee champ where they could then auto more freely is invalidated. \r\nJust an example.\r\nPlayer A is using Jarvan IV toplane and spams abilities for poke and lane clearing. This of course would quickly drain Jarvan's limited mana pool and send him back frequently, his opponent simply pushes the wave out and gets free turret damage every time he backs for mana, or calls for a gank when Jarvan is low mana or on CD. Both of these would quickly put the Jarvan player behind thus as noted in the above statement he would have less GOLD/EXP than his opponent and then do less damage.\r\nPlayer B plays the same champion but only uses abilities in lane as needed to manage the wave, lands good E-Q combos to get the opponent low if the opportunity presents itself and plays smartly around his vision to not be overextended. This would keep him in lane longer and provide an increased chance to kill his opponent with a gank due to effective play rather than spam.\r\nThis said, I do agree that no statistic is ever perfect, and statistics are just that. They never include context. As a whole though this stat does seem to be accurate as the players you would expect to see at the top of their roles are mostly all in the top 3, Save possibly Jensen, although this stat does argue well for those who think he does far too little with the leads he gets and thus explains C9's lack of a certain super important stat, Winning.\r\nAs for the game time issue, perhaps doing some more math and figuring the average increase in Dmg/M for each minute of the game and perhaps capping the stat at a certain time to exclude those clown-fiesta type games would be helpful in reducing the variance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"13 Snakes","date":"2017-08-04T20:33:34.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And anyone who does that on the pro scene would be torn to shreds by anyone and everyone.

The 2000 unit metric seems very arbitrary. \"Could this player be doing damage?\" is not nearly as useful a question as \"Should this player be doing damage?\" The latter can only be answered using subjective analysis, but that would be time and money-intensive. For example, if a player's lane opponent has backed, but the enemy jungler is hovering in FoW looking for an over-extension, the player will be penalized for not dealing damage, or if a player is sieging a a turret an opponent is hanging around to thin out the minion wave, the player will be penalized for damaging the turret instead of the opponent. These are just a few examples, but there are many more times when being in range of a champion doesn't mean you should be damaging them. It also doesn't consider opposing champion. A player should be doing very different damage depending on weather they out range their opponent, what their opponent's resistances are, and the current health of both champions. Damage/M is very flawed, but at least it is flawed in very obvious ways. The danger of this stat in my mind is that it is still very flawed, but because of its complexity, and because it's calculations aren't obvious, people won't be as smart about how they interpret this stat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King of TroIIs","date":"2017-08-06T04:52:15.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you please calculate this rating for each player for each division then attach that rating to a player's champion hover in champion select for Draft Queues so that we can better assist with everyone champion selection?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimWNG","date":"2017-08-05T23:17:18.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the adjusted DMG/M was calculated using a weighted time measurement?

And say we wanted to calculate what was the equivalent \"normalized\" DMG/M @ 18 minutes (looks like ~200), then we would use a weight of 0.75 (200*0.75 = 150DMG/M). Another example, say we wanted to calculate weight @ minute 30 (looks like ~275), we would use a weight of 0.54 (275*0.54 = 150 DMG/M). Now lets say we want to compare Doublelift's single game where he had an adjusted DMG/M of 1000DMG/M @ 30 minutes around opponents, his actual score is 540DMG/M. This way, everyone is compared against the same standard. Longer games receive less weight, shorter games receive more weight, and everyone is equal.

In order to better linearize the data, use a logarithm based scale. It's a method used in many scientific studies for extrapolating data in the long run and determining certain constants that describe physical phenomena. Take the natural log of your data to give you a new data set and use this number for your adjusted DMG/M and DMG rating metric. Your percentage margin between players will decrease and thus better reflect the true DMG rating disparities between players mitigating the time factor in those percentage differences. It may also be worth removing minutes 1-3 from your calculations as this is the lowest DMG output in the game and can be statistically classified as outliers in data sets for most champions.\r\n\r\nEven as is, I really like this metric as a way to truly measure the value of a players influence on a game win or lose.

Obviously do math to make it more realistic though and example might be. A player bullies early in lane hey does 500 damage or so. the value of 500 damage at 5 minutes is valued at 20% more than when he does 500 damage later in a team fight that this player was unable to do damage in.

Side note damage per minute per minute seems to normalize around 5 to 7 minutes where you can make a line of best fit to more easily make the percentages to value damage.(might have to just drop 5-7 minutes for late game and keep up to 10 minutes to show lane dominance or something).
