Enjoy, it's one of my first! Any criticism is accepted.\r\n\r\nZed (487 RP) moved around in lane, trying to CS, but Xerath (440 RP) with his superior range was poking him, whittling down his health. Soon Zed would have to return to base, which would lose him both gold and quite possibly the turret. In return, he started throwing shurikens, trying to get his enemy low enough for his ult combo. Eventually, Xerath's health fell below half, and Zed ulted in, spawning another shadow as he traveled to his location. He quickly shadowslashed, regaining some energy and proceeded to spawn a third shadow, but as the shadow left his arm, a large red circle surrounded him, followed by Pantheon's (395 RP) shout of \"MAN DROP!\" As Pantheon landed upon him, Zed was bashed by a shield stunned, then was defeated as Xerath ended him with a couple of blasts of energy. As they proceeded to take the turret, Mercenary Katarina (260 RP) received a call from Runeguard Volibear (487 RP). \r\n\"We need help, they're taking our turret and advancing to our base.\" \r\nKatarina responded, \"Mind if I bring some friends?\" \r\n\"No, in fact, the more the merrier, we need all the help we can get.\"\r\n\"Don't worry, he won't screw anything up, he's just an awesome guitarist to play us background music: Pentakill Mordehueser (487 RP).\"\r\nKatarina arrived on the scene to find the smoking ruins of the turret. Without hesitation, she and Volibear charged in. Volibear let out a \"Majestic Roar [E]\" (ha, get it?), and lightning struck his claws. He furiously attacked Xerath and Pantheon, dealing massive AOE damage while Katarina Shunpo'd in and spun, becoming a lotus of death. As the enemy's health bars rapidly dropped, the announcer spoke, \"Double kill!\"","replies":[{"poster":"vladtet909","date":"2014-06-30T23:36:48.955+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty good, your no Moriuz but cudos to you.","replies":[]}]}]}
