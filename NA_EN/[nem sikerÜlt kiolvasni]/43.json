I think you were a little too generous in your assessment of Samsung and Splyce though. Playing impressively in the gaunlet against the 2nd tier of their region should not be given as much praise as Samsung got, even with a KT win. And Splyce is just not at the level of play of the other teams at World's as the stats you quoted clearly show. Not even middle of the pack, but bottom of the barrel in some cases. \r\n\r\nThis group will not be as deadly as it sounds. It is for TSM and RNG to fumble away in my opinion.

CLG though...yeah no...they are dunzo..sorry CLG fans the only other NA team that stood a chance would have been Immortals..but they choke when it comes to playoffs..they did spring and of course summer split, even though they had back to back regular split performances. regardless of the team name and the hype surrounding them TSM is the better team is D fallowed by SS based on how complete the team is and their lane production as well. why else would people hype up SKT that korean hype and nobody says SKT fanboys? or how about G2? how about any other team that wins their region, i would say dominates but only a couple of teams actually did that.  so TSM fans rejoice in the fact they hipster NA traitors would rather support any korean team, chinese team and hell maybe even a EU team because they would never root for TSM. risk being called a TSM fanboy who gives a shit, jump on the SKT, jump on G2, jump on EDG, jump on FW..hell maybe even RNG but just not TSM. lol {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"PKThunder247","date":"2016-09-22T01:51:50.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I theoretically would fall in line with your NA traitor. I don't care for TSM and never did. I do not like reginald and do not like the fanbase either. TSM is full of bandwagoners and I refuse to be one of the sheep. Being from NA it's disappointing how poor the talent pool is and that most of the best players in NA are from either EU or Korea. Personally I am not rooting for any of the NA squads, but I am not rooting for one of the power house squads just for the sake of hoping they win. I am rooting for H2K, who has a lot of potential as a squad despite it being unlikely that they will win. When choosing a team in league to cheer for, I gravitate towards a specific player or personality with the team. I liked CLG when Hotshot played. I still like Fnatic, but liked them more when xPeke, Soaz, and Cyanide were on the squad and now with H2K I like the roster and I like Pr0lly. Judge me if you want as an NA traitor, but I will not cheer for a team just because it's the popular thing to do.

Everyone has the right to like a team  or dislike a team regaurdless of origin and for whatever reason no matter how silly, I was a bit hasty in my term NA traitor and to that apologize. I just want a western team to win worlds and TSM regardless of problems and history are in line to do so a long with G2 which also has had an amazing split. Thats why I have them atop in their groups. \"Popular\" for what? Fans spew nonsense most times and in fact the majority of players in league are toxic and tilt their team. But uts like that with any team whether its esports, physical sports or anything really.weather it because you the feel, the taste, the sound..because its from where you or holds some sort of value to you. It doesnt mater how popular it is or who's or whats ruining it for you. I know every team, every division has shitty fans that only want to talk shit about teams and other fans. Im not trying to do that or insinuate that I am. I just believe that the performance of teams need to be recognized not from only last year at worlds but this year aswell. Specially a whole new line up for TSM, you cant say they will be like last year, not the same players, not the same state of mind...and not even close to the productivity from their splits. Same with any EU team LPL team and ao forth..I mean like how SKT did but they are poised to win yet again.. this year is surprising to say the least. There will be upsets and there will be what we expected and only until they play on that stage will we actually know how it'll end. Im not counting any team out specially because of or popularity or because they are underdogs, every team has a chance no matter how futile it may seem. I more so wanted the NA community to rally for what would seem to be their only \"hope\" to win worlds.. which is wishful thinking of course, plus most arguments made for disliking TSM has been the whole repeating last year, performance against other countries and other things for performance but yours is a straight up dislike cause you just dont like them and I respect that. Its not some daft argument or reason. So thanks for being respectful and sharing your views and thoughts. Youre a good fan of the game and again I apologize for my previous post about being a traitor to NA I didnt mean to make you feel like I was targeting you or was trying to offend you in anyway.

The last few worlds if I recall correctly there was always an NA team advertised as \"the best in NA history\" and every year that happens, NA never even made it to semis.

I really enjoy watching NA and have been watching many NA LCS since season 2 but to place TSM first in the group is pretty ridiculous.

Judge MSI as you want, but it's not really a great indicator in judging how well a team will perform at worlds. Also how is the NA squad any better than what C9 was supposed to be in Season 3.
