There's no hint of magic, no prestige. The font is uninteresting, but somehow uncomfortably busy for a logo with no background, like a design student's first PowerPoint presentation. \r\n The lack of a background takes away any feeling of being self-contained. The old one you could put on a badge, or a bag, or a statue; it feels solid. The new one is literally full of holes; it takes on the quality of whatever's behind it and thus feels weak. It feels like a movie's logo, not a game's; it feels like it should be slowly expanding on a moving background, not static. \r\n\r\nThere were clearly design principles behind the new logo; after all, it all uses the same font and you wanted the \"of\" to be larger, so it is. But you've lost the original feel of it, the one that says \"this is a game about ancient magic and epic battles,\" and replaced it with a logo that says \"this is an e-sport logo,\" or \"I am an ancient block of inexplicably decorative gold.\"\r\n\r\nHere's the real issue, I think: It's hard to tell that the new logo is special. I had to long and hard to tell that there were grooves in the gold letters. The lighting gradient is unclear, and it's impossible to tell if it's coming from a torch, or a magic light, or a cloudy sky, or the gold itself is glowing unevenly. It's bland, and for a game that prides itself on the variety and diversity of its characters and (?gameplay?), that is a cardinal sin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RainbowPanda11","date":"2019-09-17T15:47:14.116+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why change the logo when you could just improve the old one.
