It would be cool to have something like maybe a set of items that get extra passives or stats when used together. This would be similar to sets in RPGs or we could just have some items that combine into power items like triforce and give you that extra boost to all of it's components.  The way I see this is you could build maybe a few armor sets, so you could build a tank set that gives you the chest for some armor/health the pants for some mr/health and the gloves for some sustain or health then build it into the set and gain a passive such as some cdr or maybe a slow or thorns or something or just increases to the stats. Then there could be the bruiser style set or mid tank set where it would give some sticking opportunity and some resists, hp, and ap or ad. Lastly there could be something like an agile set that would boost move speed maybe some ap or ad and some sustain. I know this would be just another item on the character to build but maybe the passives of the combined sets would make the mid tank set useful on say Malphite or Mao if it gave enough resists still. On the other hand maybe an adc could pick up the mid tank set for something that would provide sustain and resists while still being viable. Come to think of it they could add some sort of selection where you can select a stat on the item to make it more diverse say like Viktor's hexcore.

The community, the 120+ tournaments that have been run nearly non-stop for those years, the fast-paced environment with a PvP focus, not a PvE focus, as SR is, all these things combined to make Dominion one of the most fun things I have ever experienced in online gaming. \r\n\r\nRepeatedly destroying diamond/challenger teams who came in expecting to roll people because of the common misconception that Dominion requires little-to-no skill was a major highlight, I'll admit. Watching a team of full bronzies completely outplay a team of full diamond/challenger during a DD tourney because they knew the map and how to play it better was awesome.\r\n\r\nThe DD community can read between the lines quite easily here. \"For example, having a deep, unified competitive scene on Summoner's Rift - rather than a fragmented one split over multiple maps/modes - better supports our goals of making League of Legends a long-lasting, competitive game with deep potential for skill development. That’s not to say other maps or game modes don’t have interesting things to offer, but there are many benefits (and tradeoffs) for choosing to focus on one.\" Translation: Riot has zero intention of ever making a competitive scene for anything other than SR, despite your repeated promises to support Dominion and turn on ranked soon (TM) when the map came out. \r\n\r\nI cannot recall another online game that has given me as much enjoyment as Dominion. I also cannot recall an online game that has been so poorly supported to the point of actually trying to kill the mode. Morello is one of the most hated Rioters among the Dominion community for a reason and apparently his design philosophy regarding alternate modes- which he formed from his experience with Guild Wars 1, from which he drew a completely erroneous conclusion- has permeated Riot to affect their design philosophy as a whole.\r\n\r\nI long since gave up on Dominion getting ranked. Riot was never going to follow through on their many, many, broken promises regarding ranked Dominion and supporting the mode.\r\n\r\nIt still is a slap in the face to see it in such black and white terms. \r\n\r\nI'm not going to be all \"Rawr rage quit.\" This doesn't really make me mad.

The 3v3 map offers such a different perspective on the game and the way it's played, and it's refreshing that only LoL seems to have such a mode. I'm fairly certain that if TT didn't exist, I'd have stopped playing well over a year ago.

For example, BT's niche as a very high AD item did not get filled, leading to ratio-based ADC's (Graves, MF, Varus) lacking a competitive itemization choice. This in turn allowed late scaling ADC's relatively free reign (because the lane bully marksmen couldn't build differently to beat them).\r\n\r\nThat said, it did open up some build diversity (namely that there are now three viable builds instead of one, the hypercarry marksman ( {{item:3031}} +{{item:3046}} /{{item:3087}} ), the assassin marksman ( {{item:3153}} +{{item:3142}} ), and the caster marksman ( {{item:3078}} start).\r\n\r\nYou can see how they intended to open up the caster marksman role even more (IE, make someone other than corki and Lucian viable) with items like {{item:3508}}  and the {{item:3042}}  buffs that went out at the same time but the champions that build these tend to have their power spikes delayed and therefore aren't fully powered until they reach the two or three item point, at which point they're outclassed by the raw power of the carry marksmen anyways.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring ratio base ADC's back, I think they should add an item that rewards building very high AD early (something like an AD deathcap or just something with 100 AD and some arpen with a brutalizer + BF sword build path) but without a late game scaling stat so that these lane bully's can shine but the hypercarries won't just build it themselves (old BT without lifesteal for example would have been much less attractive to tristana and jinx).\r\n\r\nTLDR: Riot has some good ideas about meaningful itemization choices and they're working to make it better, but nobody's perfect, let's hope Graves and MF get some love next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"cpt capslock","date":"2014-09-06T18:49:11.270+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest issue with bringing back ratio-based ADCs is making it so that the item isn't broken on other champions.
