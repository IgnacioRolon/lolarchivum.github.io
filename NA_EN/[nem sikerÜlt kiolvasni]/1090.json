If a short-ranged enemy that relies on their gapcloser gets in range of you and manages to get more than 2 auto attacks on you when you have +25% MS and they have -47% MS (stacking Rylai's and W), you're playing Cass wrong. Cassiopeia is one of the best kiters in the game, becoming pretty much impossible to catch without blowing many ultimates and summoners after she gets Rylai's. \r\n\r\nAlso... you gave yourself a reason why she doesn't have hard CC (on a basic ability) - she has a ton of DPS. There has to be some kind of tradeoff - imagine if Karthus had a Kassadin ult, or if Kog'Maw had as much mobility as Ezreal. \r\n\r\nBesides, in the 2 seconds an enemy is stunned from her ult she puts out about as much damage as an AP assassin does in their full combo. She can literally turn onto an enemy team, kill a squishy, and keep kiting. \r\n\r\nCassiopeia is plenty strong as she is. You'll begin to realize this when you start playing champions who legitimately have NO mobility or CC like mordekaiser. You don't think much of that 25% MS buff or that 35% AOE slow when you have it, but when you don't have it life becomes very, very hard.","replies":[]}]}]}
