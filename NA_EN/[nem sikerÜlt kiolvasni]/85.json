Rek'Sai is the ultimate jungler: closes the gap with burrow and pops people up when emerging from the ground. Kalista can kite like no ones business and her ult is just ridiculous- it saves your support or is a great engage for champs like Morg, Blitz, and Thresh. Now this support is just given roaming capabilities, putting him ahead of everyone else because he gets experience while doing it... Maybe it'll be balanced- I don't know, but there surely is a trend of heavily specialized champions lately and I feel like that might make the meta one-dimensional.
