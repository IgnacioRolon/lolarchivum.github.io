Even this past weekend I had a full house because family members stopped by for a funeral, a funeral that I had to attend as well, my birthday will be during URF weekend so I expect I'll be occupied then as well. Best solution? Unlock all game modes (or the most popular ones) permanently, let people play what they want when they want, or at least run them for 2 weeks at a time. Sometimes regular summoner's rift or aram is just boring af and I'm not a fan of ttl, lots of times I just elect not to play at all, maybe if urf was available I'd hop on for a couple matches.

Additionally they want to maintain a good ratio of available/unavailable for each mode--even URF started losing some appeal near the end and Riot needs to make sure there is plenty of time for each mode to be a bit forgotten and then build up hype again before it come back around. Additionally, modes like URF and Doom Bots need extra time for Riot to tune and balance them as the game and champs are always evolving.\r\n\r\nStill though, I feel weekends only is a bad call. Instead, I think it would be better to have each mode last a little over a week; it starts on Friday, is active through the weekend, the following week, the next weekend, and the ends early morning on that FOLLOWING Monday. Then there is a work week with no Rotating Queue active until the Friday, when the next mode goes live.\r\n\r\nThis system would give us more time with each mode--and give us some non-weekend time with it. It would also ensure there was a break as long as the current one between each new queue. Lastly it would put modes on a 2 week rotation (a weekend, a week, and another weekend on; followed by a week off) which helps ensure that there is still plenty of time between each mode coming around again, allowing any meta that had begun to assert itself time to fade (from memories and through champion and item updates/releases). This would ensure that once we get through a cycle of all the available modes and ones start coming up again, they remain fresh.\r\n\r\ntl:dr - please Rito, make rotating queue a week on/week off cycle instead of weekends!\r\n\r\nThanks anyone who bothered to read all that and thanks Riot for a great game (even when there is always room for improvement)!","replies":[{"poster":"Asherenyx","date":"2016-04-17T00:26:43.940+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in agreement here - a lot of people can't play on weekends and also you need more than a weekend to really enjoy a game mode and find your favorite strategies etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Light Sovereign","date":"2016-04-15T20:20:11.098+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am really against using Poro's as weapons, but Throwing Teemo's would be nice tho","replies":[{"poster":"Gamebird8","date":"2016-04-15T20:53:34.099+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"QUICK SOMEONE CALL PETA.","replies":[{"poster":"Soireal","date":"2016-04-15T21:20:53.711+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"if peta asks the poros are fake {{champion:77}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Jason Sepht","date":"2016-04-15T23:46:19.159+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Peta really doesn't give a shit if they are fake they will still be mad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trashkuun","date":"2016-04-16T02:12:34.889+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always love these comments when PETA is involved and someone brings up Udyr","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stexe","date":"2016-04-15T20:20:17.213+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't you just leave them up all week and rotate them on a weekly basis?
