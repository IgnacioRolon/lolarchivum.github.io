If your cheese fails you fall flat because you simply never had to learn the game, and if that single strategy you were running gets figured out in week 2 you go 0-10.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PBJFSandwich","date":"2017-10-04T12:57:35.095+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Who watch pro play not just to be entertained, but to learn.  And who despite taking the game too seriously, will never be a pro player.  Those kinds of fans and players deserve to be catered to as well.  And I think we all should like that idea of the \"perfect team\" from one region going against the \"perfect team\" from another region in a serious atmosphere.
