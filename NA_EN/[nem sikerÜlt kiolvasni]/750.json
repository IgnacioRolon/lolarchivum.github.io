This scale back means that the heartless full AP Kayle is becoming less and less viable, which in and of itself was as much a gimmick as AP Yi.\r\n\r\nSince people have been building attack speed and AP on top of her already brutally high AP ratios (considering these are basic attacks, she was doing close to 3 nashor's teeth with her masteries) and high scaling attack speed, this is just meant to slow the oppressive curve she had before. Now building a Nashor's Tooth (and a certain somewhat weak mastery) will result in 75 + 40% AP with her e on at max rank, instead of the old 75 + 60% AP. She was doing 60% of her AP with every basic attack. That's an average ratio on a lot of mages' skills, and she had it for every attack. This is just knocking her from god tier to tier 1 or maybe tier 2. It's exactly what it should be, balancing a broken and abusable aspect of a champion who originated as a support and hybrid fighter.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheGroof","date":"2014-07-01T21:22:37.777+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":5,"body":"I am very excited to see a meta shift in jungle.
