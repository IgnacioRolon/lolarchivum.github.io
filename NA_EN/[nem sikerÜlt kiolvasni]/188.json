They're giving players a bonus if you purchase 6-12-18-etc mystery gifts. They never offered a bonus before this, it's just an extra that you can get. It's anything *but* a cash grab. Riot is being more generous then ever before with this event. This is a very kind bonus if you do give that much to friends or yourself, and if you don't gift 6+ then whatever, you still get what you purchased anyways. This is a good way to give back to those who gift a lot or are planning on gifting soon.
