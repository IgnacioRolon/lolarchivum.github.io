Not considering his sustain nerfs, high early mana costs, and snowbally nature of his ultimate - a Cho'Gath without 6 stacks is less strong and useful as another with all 6 feast stacks - I think all Cho'Gath players would appreciate if Riot could fine tune his inconsistencies with his heavily skill shot reliant abilities and honestly unsatisfactory movement.\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion, maybe increase the cast range on his q and/or w as he gains more feast stacks? This would synergize with the bonus attack range he gets on vorpal spikes. If I'm being too crazy, which is legitimately possible, I'd love if Riot could please just take a look at refining how he moves and the animations of his skills.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n ","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pantaloon","date":"2014-05-21T21:31:57.308+0000","up_votes":253,"down_votes":7,"body":"\"Fixed a bug where Arctic Assault would stop on collision with, but fail to knock up, really large enemy champions (Cho'Gath with 6 Feast stacks, Zac with a lot of bonus HP, large champions that were Wild Growth'd by Lulu, **champions who weren't watching their diet, etc**)\" Very funny Rito.
