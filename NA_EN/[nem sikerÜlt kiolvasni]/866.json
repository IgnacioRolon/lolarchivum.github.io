It is just they have visible shortcomings for a long time, and there is no improvement. ( Sorry if you don't like it, but I will provide my honest opinion).\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, LOL professional plays are made up with two things: 1) players mechanics 2) strategy (how they operate as a team). The visible shortcomings I was referring to is player mechanics. \r\nI will provide 2 examples on international level.\r\nFirst, top lane. Darius is not a world class top laner ever since season 3. On season 3 world final, Darius lost most top lane match ups pretty badly. Especially in their defeat to OMG, he lost to Gogoing so freaking badly. Moreover, gogoing did not prove to be a world class top laner after season 4. With the increase of age, players mechanical skills are getting bad. It works the same for everyone. So we know, Darius is not going to get any better than S3, but in his S3 days, he did not prove to be world class. You can see more and more teams are using this to against TSM, even domestically. \r\nSecond, bot lane. It is in fact the same story. Wild turtle is not good at mechanical adcs such us vayne. The proof is you almost never see him picking this champion. But vayne is the pride of ADC in the Eastern LOL world. If you want to play LOL professional league, vayne is the first champion you should master. Anyway, back to turtle, his pocket pick is Corki. But again, it never prove to be a relevant factor on international stage. Two years passed, and turtle still pick Corki on MSI when it matters. It did not work before, it was not gonna back then.\r\n\r\nSo What TSM was doing is actually using their strategic advantage to compensate their lane weakness. It worked sometimes when enemy team don't expect it. But it is certain that it won't lead you anywhere further when players mechanic is so far behind. \r\n\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"sKz Aaron D","date":"2015-06-04T02:49:45.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"I'm not trying to say that TSM is the best team in the world, in fact, MSI proved they aren't. I'm pointing out a fact, not an opinion, that NA is not treated seriously by the analysts that do power rankings. I'm pointing to the FACTS that NA teams did just as well as (and better in some areas) than EU and LMS teams for the past year and a half, but everyone seems to just discount them despite that. As I said before, notice the way they say China, Korea, and Taiwan are deep, but the instant a top NA team loses to a middle of the pack or lower tier team, the analysts say that the region as a whole isn't very good. I think that the Spring Split and Playoffs served to illustrate that NA is fairly deep. Liquid got 3rd place despite barely qualifying for the playoffs. CLG got swept in the first round by a team they were favored to beat. Something very similar happened in EU, and the analysts decided that EU was a bit deeper than they realized, stating that the teams making the upsets were improving, and that SK had been kinda shaky since IEM, not that the region as a whole simply wasn't as good as it should be - which is what they're saying about NA.","replies":[{"poster":"EdMySuffering","date":"2015-06-04T09:23:31.922+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think its wrong to say what you're saying is a fact.

When a team finds it so easy to dominate their region (and lets face it they were night on untouchable last split) then goes on to lose to almost everybody except the \"clown car\" team in the international tournament it' a massive sign of weakness in the region, whereas regionally SKT had to grapple with GE Tigers all split, Fnatic lost the regular split to SK then barely squeaked through the playoffs. \r\n\r\nBut honestly from NA who do you think could have put out a better performance than TSM at MSI? The only team that ever even gives them a little trouble in the region is C9 and they've not been looking good last split.

The Power Rankings are an approximate list of where specific teams line up against each other at this moment in time based partly on past performance, but mainly on recent results.\r\n\r\nIn terms of NA teams, if we first consider the teams that went to Worlds, there was TSM, C9 and LMQ. As we know LMQ basically doesn't exist anymore with the only remaining member (XiaoWeiXiao) now playing for TIP, who we can currently only judge based on their spring split and start to the summer split. They finished 4th in the in the regular season of the spring split and were then beaten by 6th place team, Team Liquid, to make them remain in 4th during the playoffs. In week 1 of the summer split they beat Team 8, a team that most would agree to be somewhat average in terms of NA teams, and lost to CLG. This can only leave us to conclude that they are only currently a mid-table NA team at this point in time.\r\n\r\nLet's move on to C9. At Worlds last year, sure they made it to the top 8, however they also had one of the easiest groups and the team that should have really dominated the group, Alliance, ended up putting up a pretty poor showing when they could have quite easily won 5 or maybe even all 6 games if they'd brought their A game. Regardless, C9 did actually make it to the QFs and therefore deserved some claim to being a Top 8 team in the world. However, that was at the end of worlds. Since then they won IEM San Jose, beating UoL who themselves had previously beaten TSM. Both of these teams rank in the top 20 when C9 doesn't, but at the time UoL was still a rookie team, yet to even play in the LCS and I'll get to TSM later.\r\n\r\nAt IEM Katowice C9 lost both their games eliminating them from the tournament making them finish in joint last place in a tournament that most people agree was generally filled with very watered down competition. Despite a few struggles at the start of the 2015 spring season they still managed to pull their way up to another second place finish in the split. In week 1 of the summer split they have again performed shaky, with a new mid laner who we can't really tell much about yet and losing a game to Dignitas, a team who have basically only just been managing to keep themselves in the LCS these past few splits. The fact that this C9 team can still beat TSM, who up to the end of the spring split were clearly the best team in NA is an obvious reason to doubt the capability of any of the NA teams at this point in time in terms of international competitiveness.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last NA team that went to worlds, TSM. Again they managed to make it the QFs, however TSM too had a somewhat lucky break when SK's Svenskeren was banned from playing in their first 3 games. At the time, despite finishing third in the EU playoffs, SK were considered the second best team in EU and had only come third as their semifinal match was reasonably close encounter with Alliance. Fnatic somewhat struggling their way to the final over a full five games against ROCCAT. Svenskeren probably was (and still is) SK's best player and their's no doubt that his ban heavily impacted SK's performance as they managed to beat both TSM and Taipei Assassins when he returned to the team. If Svenskeren had played in the first game against TSM and SK had won, both teams would have finished 3 for 3 and SK would have gone through from winning both their games against TSM. We'll never know, but TSM was potentially that one game away from not getting out of groups. However, as with C9, they did in fact make it to the top 8, again staking a claim for an equal position in terms of world ranking.\r\n\r\nMoving on, as already mentioned TSM lost to rookie wildcard team, UoL in IEM San Jose, but later went on to win IEM Katowice. From the teams that competed in the latter, three of them are placed above TSM in these Power Rankings. The yoe Flash Wolves, CJ Entus and GE Tigers (now KOO Tigers). There was some controversy about Korean teams not taking the tournament seriously and not preparing which led to their loss. True or not, TSM did personally beat the Flash Wolves and CJ Entus. They didn't get to play against TIgers. TSM then managed to win the NA spring split for the second time in a row qualifying them for MSI. However at MSI they would only win one of their 5 games against wildcard team, Beşiktaş e-Sports. In week 1 of the summer split in NA they then lost to C9 a team who is currently themselves on shaky ground in terms of relevance to the international scene, leaving it uncertain as to where NA currently sits on the Power Ranking list as the writer of the article says.\r\n\r\nThe yoe Flash Wolves finished 2nd in their region in the spring split, losing out to ahq e-Sports who performed pretty well when put against the World's best teams at MSI and a decent start to the summer season by the Flash Wolves spells good things for them placing them 9th on the power rankings. Likewise, the KOO Tigers and CJ Entus finished 2nd and 3rd in Korea, bested by SKT. A somewhat underwhelming start to their summer split then ends up leaving the Tigers 14th (4 places above TSM), with CJ Entus looking on top form leaving them a high flying 4th.\r\n\r\nBased on all these facts the Power Rankings are actually quite reasonable, when bearing in mind that they rank specific teams at specific points in time. I don't watch a huge amount of league outside of the NA and EU LCS and internationals, so I can't say for all the other teams regions, but as far the NA and EU teams go it seems entirely fair to me. The only two EU teams above TSM are Fnatic, a team that only seems to get stronger the more they play and who also beat TSM at MSI, and Oregen, a team that's already looked highly competitive with a roster of players who collectively have a large amount of international experience. Alliance (Elements) and SK (the other EU teams that went to worlds) don't even feature in the top 20, which is entirely fair because their recent performance doesn't warrant it.\r\n\r\nAs of week one it seems that CLG has potential to take over as the best team in NA, but since they have an even worse track record when it comes to international competition in recent times (ie. it doesn't even exist) that puts NA in an even tougher spot to rank them any higher than they currently are in these rankings. As soon as we get some more clear results for NA I'm sure a couple of their teams will start climbing back up the ladder again, but as of right now these Power Rankings are pretty much as accurate as it can get.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Power Rankings only try to relate the ability of specific teams at specific times, not regions as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheryl Cole","date":"2015-06-08T01:47:17.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So much wisdom in one comment.
