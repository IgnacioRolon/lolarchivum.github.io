You should really focus on fixing the following REAL problem in the game. At least 5 or 6 of the following champions are played/banned in EVERY SINGLE GAME: Braum Irelia Jax Kassadin Kayle Le Blanc Lee Sin Lucian Lulu Nidalee Twich Yasuo ..The same champions are banned EVERY SINGLE GAME (usually Kass,Kayle,Jax,Braum,lb,Yasuo,Nid,) League really feels like there are 20 champions in it instead of 120... Why is this so? Because these champions are better than other champions in almost every way (aka Tier 1 champions) There are about 20 more champions after them that are just below tier 1 (Kha,Elise,Rengar,Evelyn, etc) You can see this for yourself really...Open league, go to the home-screen, and look at the 5 spectating matches that are going on...again same champions... look at LCS and pro matches...same champions... When I see a Cho Gath,Sion,Olaf,etc all of the sudden I get so happy to see something new in my game... my games are usually very dull; I want to see this dealt with...I have a dream that the fact that champions are divided into T1,T2,T3 champions will be no more. I want to see myself playing are game and having no idea what the enemy team and my team are going to pick. I want players to pick champions based on their very own style of gameplay and not based on how strong and useful a champion is. I wish to see this game really shine and this issue stands in the game over all Sincerely, a fan.

They are going to pick champions that are stronger and more useful, over champions that are \"fun\" or \"stylish\".\r\nIf you nerf the strengths of some champs and buff the weaknesses of others, you're going to have 120 reskins of the same 6 base champion classes/roles.  And you would be whining about how every champion plays the same.\r\nThe pressure is not on Riot to equalize the field.  The pressure is on you to discover new ways to utilize character abilities and item builds to create new counters.  You don't like the meta?  Break it.  And if you can figure out a way to break the meta in a way that gets your team to win, awesome.  But the meta has been established because it's proven to win and that's what Ranked is supposed to be all about, so I as a shitty Coop-vs-AI bitch player don't want to hear your \"#Diamond1WorldProblems\".","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2014-06-19T03:48:15.446+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":1,"body":"I approve of the \"You don't like the meta?

This is about addressing underlying systems, overloaded champions (Champion Updates team and Live Gameplay are focusing big on this) and where too few tradeoffs exist. In fact, our clarification on our design values was a bit of a result of us determining what tradeoffs we'll be willing to make to fix these things. Change can be painful, so we need to be smart about how we deliver it.\r\n\r\nThe problem with many short-term nerfs is it just creates a new class of OP - the \"just below tier 1\" you speak to. While we'll still need to do some reactive balance, I really want to get to a point to where champions have meaningful strengths AND weaknesses - and all the champions on the top of the pile are safe and have low tradeoffs. A pile of power.\r\n\r\nDoes this help explain a bit of our direction, and why we're being aggressive on things like Nidalee rework?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"thomson","date":"2014-06-17T21:55:05.708+0000","up_votes":566,"down_votes":35,"body":"\"No More Silence.
