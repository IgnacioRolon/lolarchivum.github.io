Not just writing stories, but playing League itself. So it is with a bit of a heavy heart to say that I will be taking a break from League. I might be back during Pre-season, but until then this will probably be my last story I write for quite a while. Again sorry to say this, but I don't want to burn myself out. \r\n\r\nSo here the last piece of this Urgot story: \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} If only there was a way to show you how much your life impacted others. \r\n\r\n{{champion:53}} **I can accomplish that with my 'what if?' machine right here.**\r\n\r\n{{champion:6}} 'what if?' machine? \r\n\r\n{{champion:53}} **Affirmative. This machine will show us possible outcomes to question. **\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} Ooo. Let try it.

I understand my purpose now. I live so that the world doesn't become like...that. I need to work harder, improve myself. I need to upgrade. _leaves._\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} Umm...what is going to happen now? \r\n\r\n{{champion:53}} **Let see. 'what if?\" machine.
