For people that enjoy a select few of play styles, this ruins the game. I realise that it would only seem fair for everyone to have a say in the banning but getting rid of 20 champions is annoying. They say in ranked (which I don't play because I like having fun) you should have 3 champions for every role. so at least 15 champions, and 20 can potentially be banned. Currently I like playing top lane, and most top laners are disliked and banned by default but usually I would have at least 2 ready to go. Now with 20 bans means its even harder to play the champions I like. In the old system each team had 3, it made choosing a ban more meaningful rather then \"everyone pick your most hated champion\". You would have to consider the current meta, your champion, teammates champions, and counters. Also majority of the time you wouldn't ban 3 in 1 lane, then enemy mid could have someone like {{champion:103}}  and your mid laner picked {{champion:99}}  (immobile and skill shot oriented) someone who can do very poorly against an {{champion:103}} . And since {{champion:103}}  doesn't have much of a reputation she is still very strong but {{champion:99}}  didn't think about that because \"someone is bound to ban her shes so strong someone has to, I hate {{champion:134}}  even though I know how to fight her, she just annoys me. So I'll ban her.\" Even though most people hate top laners, you woudln't ban 3 top laners if your mid would struggle against someone who is very mobile, you would spread them out so 3 our of 5 roles could do better off than fighing their counters. Now there is less reason to think about your ban because someone else would probably ban them if they have a bad reputation like {{champion:92}}  and {{champion:157}}  (btw great timing for the skins) I realise this was still a possibility in the old system but with only 6 bans there was more thought required. Also for anyone who says \"just play blind pick\" I hate fighting to be the first one to copy&paste my role and get stuck with jungle or support because everyone loaded in faster than be and I should try again next game.
