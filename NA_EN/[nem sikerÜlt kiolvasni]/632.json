In the last week he has averaged between a 45-48% win rate which means that you have a better chance of winning with him on the other team than yours. Additionally his win rate gets worse as rank increases to the point of him having a 39% win rate in masters+ which means the is very viable counter play to him if you take the time to learn it. People are so quick to call champions op instead of educating themselves on how to play against it. He was op before his nerf, i will agree with that, but i don't think he is even close to ban worthy anymore, and the numbers back up my claim.","replies":[{"poster":"olordshawk","date":"2015-10-29T17:19:17.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem being is knowing how to out play him cause right now its really hard.

In draft pick, it allows you to trade more often. It's also worth pointing out that, if no one on your team owns the champion, it can't be banned. If no one on your team owns Yorick (just an example don't kill me), then they don't have to worry about banning him. Since you own every champion, it means that every champion can be banned, so it's more likely they'll ban something you weren't going to play anyway (unless you main Darius).","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanomos","date":"2015-10-23T18:46:54.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I lol'd at ban {{champion:83}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Summoner Penta","date":"2015-10-23T02:47:04.665+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, i bought most of my champs with IP, but I did buy a few with RP - reason? A) i do play ranked, and the ones i bought were primarily when i started to playing ranked to help round out my champion pool, and B) when im playing normals, i like having options to try different things. There are so many champs i own that I rarely play, but i like having them for the few times I do choose to. and C) every now and then i play ranked 5s with friends, and since some of my friends have some really out there champ pools, it pays to have every champ so we can trade around if need be.\r\n\r\nOwning every champ isnt a need by any means, but its convenient and fun for multiple different queues. Personally I never really had the pokemon mentality (been playing pokemon for years and have never once caught them all or even really tried that hard to), so i cant explain that, but I can explain at least why people might choose to purchase champs on RP on occasion.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fack you Jared","date":"2015-10-22T19:17:16.226+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":6,"body":"{{item:1027}}  Gems {{item:1028}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Lazy Support","date":"2015-10-22T23:11:41.029+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Whatever did {{champion:44}} do to deserve only 3 skins :(","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Paladin","date":"2015-10-23T01:43:45.006+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you count ezreal, he has 4skins","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanomos","date":"2015-10-23T18:43:16.305+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:44}}  knows all about {{champion:81}} 's 4Skin","replies":[{"poster":"CIickTheLantern","date":"2015-10-29T18:49:18.150+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"was already logged in just to upvote\r\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Big B1rd 47","date":"2015-10-23T01:52:13.663+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I assume (ok let's face it, I'm just hoping) he'll get a skin whenever they get around to his simply fabulous visual update.
