It is illogical because if you can edit them in the pregame lobby you only need one. It's just like mastery pages; I use only one mastery page and edit it when play ADC vs midlane vs support. People spent real money to support league and to buy these pages which were necessary if you wanted anything more than 2 standard pages. To say that \"they transfer\" seems like a very, very blatant attempt to put in no effort towards compensation for making their money obsolete. Yes they were \"free\" to obtain, but they were so expensive that unless you were okay with not buying any champions or runes, it was difficult to get them. It doesn't seem like too much to ask for some form of simple compensation beyond an icon. \r\n\r\nI also worry about the stat changes that will be implemented since specific runes will be gone. If magic penetration is not made easily available I worry about mages being too weak early and midgame, forcing most to rush a haunting guise just to apply any kind of good damage. It becomes much easier to build against AP while harder to build against MR when you can't have 8 or more penetration going into the game. An early hexdrinker or mercury treads will become stronger than flat AP can override them, especially since an AD champ will buy mercs and a hexdrinker early anyways.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that Riot will listen to feedback and accept these criticisms before they cause an issue like dynamic queue and then reverse what they did several months later.

What worries me is the individual stat boosting of the champions. When you tailor every champion to their most noted strengths that leaves little room for going off meta. My example for this is Cho'gath. He is a champion that is most generally played as a tank warden, However I love to play him as a Burst Mage. What I envision Cho'gath's specified tailoring is his defensive capabilities being buffed (Health,MR,Armor) but leaving little to no AP for starting out. To me this makes mid lane Cho'gath not as potent as meta mid picks. My only thought around this problem is by making a way where we can choose the most reasonable start as in cho'gath's case A defensive start or offensive start.and I believe this can apply to most if not all champions not just in the terms of offensive or defensive but in the case of adc's it could be an Attack Damage Start or an Attack speed start.

For example, If i played AD tristana with the base stats under the Runes Reforged update, I'm sure I would start the game with high base AD and AS tailored for an ADC playstyle and build. But what if instead I wanted to play AP Tristana? Currently I'd be able to get into a game with Hybrid AP/AS runes, In the new system you proposed, would i be forced to start off with 0 AP and Magic Pen and only have base stats for an adc? I feel like this system can really hurt players who don't precisely follow the meta or just want to play something fun in a normals. What if I wanted to play AP Ezreal and I have no use for the AD and AS base stats, assuming these are the base stats you'd give to Ezreal under the new system? I think a neat solution would be if players have a 7th Rune/Rune Page where they choose between 4 Rune Pages/Base Stat \"Packages\": Hybrid AD/Lethality, Hybrid AD/AS, Hybrid AP/Magic Pen, Hybrid AS/AP. Still I'd like to hear how you guys will go about this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.How will the change in base stats affect champions who normally build Trinity Force/Sheen? Will Trinity Force only be viable on champions that have higher Base AD, Will you guys give Champions that normally build Tri-Force (Olaf,Nasus,Ezreal,Gangplank) higher Base AD to accommodate that build, or will the increase in AD not even be considered as a \"Base Stat\" to not disrupt the meta around Trinity Force?","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXDrHealsXx","date":"2017-07-20T18:33:14.582+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think its neat I wouldn't mind a cute little pet to do extra dmg or shields.
