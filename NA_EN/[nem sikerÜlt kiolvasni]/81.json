The goal of the two part name is to infuse him with a certain folksiness. There's a lot of internal contradiction in him: he's wearing nice clothes, but they're kinda tattered. He's dressed like a city man with his vest and his tophat, but he speaks like a country bumpkin. The name reinforces the country aspect, and at the same time it has some really cool etymological implications (like the antiquated English verb \"to kench\", to laugh out loud, and the old Welsh last name Kench which derives from a bin used for salting and preserving fish).","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-06-25T20:30:18.607+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":18,"body":"Ah, I get it. You wanted to give him the classy southern charm. Someone like Atticus from * To Kill a Mockingbird* character but in a more monstrous appearance. He has poetic wording but has a hint of southwestern in his voice. Almost Cajun, if I may say it. Dang, this support fits me better than I thought, since we live in close related areas. And I'm a support main. Also, I see the hint of catfish (look it up) in his look. We love catfish.\n\nI must say it. THANKS! I love this smooth talking, Cajun support. He's my kind of support.\n\n**Edit**\n\nSorry about the misspell. I was so excited, I just tried to get it out there before I had to go somewhere. I should had spell checked, but I'm glad to see it wasn't too big of a mistake as I almost spelled him Adackas, but changed my mind. I also kept having the quote from Scout in my head saying her father would always say something about \"how to kill a mocking bird\" but it may just be the 1960s movie line.
