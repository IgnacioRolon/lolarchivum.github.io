Basically though it was a sentinel made from stone, and look kinda like a knight made out of rock who was covered in blue runes. With each ability basic ability used he would forcibly swap between a tankier, hard hitting version of himself, and a faster, quicker striking version. When using a spell in tanky form the effects would be shorter in range, have less damage but be heavy aoe while a fighter form spell would often be longer range and more precise, dealing more damage.

I know as a whole the idea sounds kinda similar but their both strictly melee and the transform is controlled. The idea was to create some interesting set ups for combinations or push certain costs like using a tanky aoe ability to push a wave in order to let you poke or trade with a more precise ability. It was all fuzzy concepts though, and Gnar's release actually gave me a really perfect champion for me to play.
