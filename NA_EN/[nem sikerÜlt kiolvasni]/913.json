","replies":[]},{"poster":"Etherdeath","date":"2015-09-30T03:09:54.696+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Runes have always felt like an unnecessary layer of complexity.\r\n\r\nLet's look at it from multiple angles.\r\n\r\nAngle 1 : Game Dynamics\r\nThe functionality of runes could have been bundled into Masteries. There is barely even a thematic reason not to.\r\n\r\nAngle 2 : Art\r\nYou've spent just about zero time on the art for Runes. Please don't take this as criticism, whether you should have or not is another matter and I honestly have almost no opinion on it. But clearly they are not serving much as far as the artistry of the game.\r\n\r\nI can think of dozens of ways to make runes more fun and would occupy a few graphic design / computer art interns time for a month or two and they'd probably leave and talk about how much fun it is to work at Riot.\r\n\r\nAngle 3 : IP\r\nThe whole IP system is kind of silly. I mean for starters they're inflated; you can divide it all by 10 and no one would care.\r\n\r\nAdd betting. Bet on observable games with IP. People would love it.\r\n\r\nI digress.\r\n\r\nSo back to Runes. They cost IP, which actually isn't half as annoying as the freaking interface for runes. It's designed like a 1996 web page when everyone thought checkboxes and select boxes were cool. It has the design and layout pizzaz of someone who just decided \"that's it, I'm leaving this boring ass job where I design trading software that is used only by the most soulless of individuals so that I can go make games!!\". I know because I used to be one of those guys. Seriously I think I have ordered esoteric plumbing parts from a distributor using an interface that was more fun than the Runes one.\r\n\r\nI actually need to buy more Runes but I never really look into (I'm an on-again-off-again type player btw) because I rather make do with the half set I bought than have to go through that frustrating interface.\r\n\r\nAngle 4 : What the &!#% are Runes?\r\nAre we collecting little seals? In the confines of the reality of the fiction of the game, do they exist? Are they in summoner's minds? Why do they look like either dry brittle barely flavorful biscuits OR a set of crappy commemorative plates that will eventually gather dust.\r\n\r\nNo offense but the whole Lore system feels like the jankyness of _actual_ religions (pieced together from rituals that were likely developed by brilliant yet mentally deranged minds). It's cool how you've managed to piece together Anime-like worlds with Lord of the Rings-like worlds with HP Lovecraft-like worlds plus probably half a dozen others. By \"managed to piece together\" I mean by using several dozen boxes of oversize packing tape. It sort of like when my 6 year old cousin says \"OMG WHAT IF SAILOR MOON WAS IN GAME OF THRONES?!\" That's a lie by the way. No one says that. I mean I just did, but that's not the point.\r\n\r\nPS I love this game. Any criticism I've made is just like about that remaining 2% of work to bring it to the next level.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason the other","date":"2015-10-05T21:22:29.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If beting were possible then there would be about 1,000,000 bets on every game in worlds.

Runes turn me off because I don't want to spend the money on rune pages (if i spend money i rather buy skins, right??) or the time of constantly remaking pages. I take long hiatuses to League cause of school and I'm reluctant to come back because of having to make sure my runes are up to date with current changes and meta. I was never good at them in the first place and it only establishes a baseline in for other players, not really giving anyone any advantages.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vecxion","date":"2015-09-29T23:32:54.128+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what about the runes pages ?!
