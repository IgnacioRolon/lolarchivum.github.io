ARAM needs to have all champs unlocked and possibly 3 rerolls. I almost exclusively play ARAM and am currently in the top .05% of ARAM players according to whatismymrr. ARAM only accounts destroy the whole point of ARAM.\r\n\r\nARAM is about playing what you're dealt (minus rolls) and forming a team strategy to win with your comp. ARAM only accounts heavily skew winning in their favor, since they only have a champ pool of ~30 (or however many champs you want to say) when I have all but 3 champs. This means they have a much higher chance to get the champs they want (we'll say 1/40 /w 10 free), and on top of that it REDUCES my chances of getting those same champions (because they can ONLY play one of those 40 champs). This means my chance of getting one of those 40 champs is actually LESS than my chance to get the ones they do not have. Not so random now is it? Especially if there are multiple players in the game that have a small champion pool. \r\n\r\nAm I pretty bad with some champs? You bet, but it challenges me to itemize for my team if I know I can't directly carry with a champion. \r\n\r\nIt's a much more rewarding experience.","replies":[{"poster":"ATastyDessert","date":"2017-04-19T22:41:49.050+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"I'm sorry dude but as another person who only plays ARAM, I don't care about ARAM only accounts.

As a statistician that's what has forced me to come comment here because it's sickening. A binomial(1,0.9999) (AKA Bernoulli(0.9999) ) distribution is STILL RANDOM. It has a 1 in 10000 chance of being 0, and otherwise will be 1. That's still random. It's not uniformly random, but it IS RANDOM. Likewise, as in this case, the series of slightly-more-complicated-than-hypergeometric distributions that result from multiple players all being assigned a champion out of their limited (of different sizes) and overlapping pools with duplicates not allowed is STILL RANDOM. Just because player X only owns 30 champions, one of which is on free week making a pool of 39 champions to be assigned from, he's still RANDOMLY assigned from those 39 champions. Even if those results were skewed one way or another (like because he can reroll the ones he doesn't want and keep the ones he does) it's STILL RANDOM. How does it become not random? If his pool consists on 1 champion only (or 2, and we assume you can't reroll your initial roll in to itself). However with 10 on free week that's not possible, so again - it's always random, just not uniformly so. Now, the game is called \"All Random All Mid\" - not \"All Uniformly Random All Mid\". \r\n\r\nThird, ARAM is also a game mode that Riot did not create but merely chose to support - the game mode was created BY PLAYERS who would make custom games and choose to only play down the mid lane of Summoner's Rift and would use the Random champion select functionality. One would think someone very in to ARAM would know this. And did that Random Champion functionality assign you any champion, owned or unowned? It DID NOT. So why should Riot mess with tradition? The game was designed as it is now - it should not be changed.\r\n\r\nFinally, to the point I opened with - a veteran player already has significant advantages over a newer player. They're not only more experienced on their own champion, but also better know what to expect from enemy champions, have better subconscious awareness of things in the game, have better experience on how to make decisions in certain game states, etc... If ARAM were to allow all unowned champions you would add to that the advantage that a veteran who owns all champions will certainly have at least limited experience on their pick, while a newer player will almost certainly have no clue what they're playing. They're already at a disadvantage, there's no reason to make that a larger disadvantage. People should get to play what they generally enjoy playing, it is meant to be a FUN game mode after all. There are plenty of people who would rather play a less stressful version of the game and try a champion they don't always play, while still playing something they're familiar with. When I was a newer player I played a lot of ARAM because if I went to summoner's rift I only ever played one of three or so champions. I enjoyed playing a dozen or so other champions, but when I got something from free week that was tough to play or didn't mesh well with me it wasn't as fun. Change that from around a 33% chance per roll to around a 90% chance per roll and the game mode is destroyed for that kind of player. \r\n\r\nIF ARAM HAD RANKED then I'd agree that this is an entirely different argument and there's an unfair advantage to ARAM-only accounts, but in it's current state they are not a problem. Sure - they can be in your games. You know what though? If an ARAM-only account is in your game the game is still even. They're still at that ARAM-MMR with the ARAM-only account, meaning they're equally worse at the game than you are to balance out their champion-advantage. Again, there's no ranked so there's no need to get to the very top place in the ARAM queue (it doesn't exist). Just because the 'highest MMR ARAM accounts' need to be ARAM-only to gain that advantage while being on the best players, it doesn't mean you can't have fun in the game mode.\r\n\r\nI know I won't change your mind because you're set on what type of mode would benefit you the most, so I'm not sure why I even bothered typing this. \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Things ","date":"2017-04-20T03:05:42.538+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">I know I won't change your mind because **you're set on what type of mode would benefit you the most**, so I'm not sure why I even bothered typing this.\n\nInaccurate, I read the entirety of your post and can't find many things to disagree with.
