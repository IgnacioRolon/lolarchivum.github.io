Riot owns the majority of the leagues though, with probably all of the casters/analysts working at them as employees. So they have more than enough people available with just the three English speaking regions to where they wouldn't need to offer more competitive pay to the Korean casters. \r\n\r\nSmithy is apparently the only one willing to take the gig, and if I recall correctly, that was the case at last Worlds or MSI as well. IEM is a different story altogether, though. Sadly, ESL's production quality has shown itself not to be up to Riot's and the LCK's standards. So sometimes you get really stupid things happening - like one of the casters watching a CS:GO highlight reel on their tablet in the middle of a match, with the sound being broadcast through the League stream. -_- ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crow2","date":"2017-04-27T07:53:56.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Papasmithy??","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScuffedYasuoMain","date":"2017-04-27T05:28:41.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quickshot is there :D im wet ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghaden","date":"2017-04-27T04:08:49.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope all the commentators have their dramatic quips ready for TSM getting dumpstered again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pyro19280","date":"2017-04-26T16:16:40.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moment when you realize the reason you watch Pro-Games because Jatt's voice helps put me to sleep at night.
