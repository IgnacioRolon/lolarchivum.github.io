I don't need to know specifics, but is it too late to call for a poll from the community? When I got into the lore in the first place, one of the biggest attractions to League of Legends was the idea that I, as a player, was on some level canon in Valoran in some way. Maybe others feel differently, but ripping the Institute, Fields of Justice, and Summoners by way of retcon feels like a very big betrayal.\r\n\r\nI feel that a story should be managed dynamically, within the universe. Not on a meta level, retconning things back and forth just to accommodate the whims of the lore writers. Seriously though, call for a popularity vote from the community on this one. If they say nay and you lot still want Summoners, the Institute, and the Fields of Justice to be out, write an in-universe excuse as to what happened.\r\n\r\nSidelining the Institute could be something you could do. Rather than being the all-powerful force of the land, the Institute becomes a force of arbitration or something. They observe, they mediate as requested, but they don't inherently need to be part of the immediate story you tell.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the community and ardent follower of lore, I feel it is the responsibility of the community to keep you, the narrative team, in check to some extent. It is our responsibility to make sure you don't destroy the thing you created.\r\n\r\nThe Freljord revamp? It was fine. You created a space within the lore to grow. Okay. Burning Trundle's old backstory to recreate him in Freljord? A bit painful but understandable. Trundle was an isolated character, by making him part of the Freljord lore you gave him the capacity to interact on a lore-level with other characters. The backstory shifts of various characters to fit them within Runeterra? That's actually a great thing. Now we don't have folks from anomalous sections of the universe.\r\n\r\nRetconning the Institute, Fields of Justice, and Summoners? Questionable at best. For starters, the Institute was a big, core, integral part of what made League of Legends, League of Legends. A lot of characters only exist in their current state, because of the Institute. The subsequent lore-fallout would be incredibly painful for the community, and for Riot, I would imagine.\r\n\r\nShort, key version of a long story? If you haven't gotten to the point of no return with your lore shifts, call a poll from the community. If they say they want to keep the Institute and Summoners, etc, find some way to shift them away from the focal point of your story without deleting them, please.","replies":[{"poster":"EelayInsay","date":"2014-09-04T23:27:41.646+0000","up_votes":194,"down_votes":16,"body":"I feel the exact same way.

I find that really weird, considering you guys have two gigantic examples to prove that that is *not* the case: the Ionia vs. Noxus rematch &amp; Dominion in its entirety, the former having influenced the lore of a handful of champions who came after it. I certainly wouldn't mind if the narrative team would like to use new lore/retcon old lore to *downplay* the involvement Summoners, The Insitute of War, Fields of Justice, etc. from now on, but **completely writing these elements out of LoL's history** is going too far.

Gameplay influences story in much the same way that story influences gameplay, but neither should be completely tied to one another. The two are closer linked in WoW because WoW is an RPG that is inherently part of a story. LoL is an arena style fighting match where story never really comes into play (in terms of gameplay).\n\nWill the \"Average Joe\" care about Lissandra and Sejuani fighting without an excuse plot?

I guess the best way to sum up our approach going forward is that we want to, in the words of my colleague Glorft, \"do no harm, and respect core themes.\" The key word in terms of what both you guys are saying is \"core.\" What falls into that category is somewhat subjective; you might think killing Superman and then reviving him as four different people for a while still stayed faithful to the core themes of the character, since each of the four was meant to personify an aspect of his character. I might disagree. There's no right or wrong. Some players may feel that getting rid of the Institute of War and Fields of Justice cuts too close to the bone as far as core themes of LoL; we've thought about it long and hard, though, and decided that, in our opinion as stewards of the game and its fictional world, the pluses of doing so outweigh the minuses (by quite a bit, frankly). We hope you ultimately agree, but we know not every single LoL player will agree with every choice we make. Doesn't mean we're not listening, though, and it certainly doesn't mean we make any such choices casually.

We tried to give a sense of what some of the benefits will be in the dev blog -- e.g. champions as puppets takes away their agency as characters, having all wars be fought by proxy between gladiators removes one of the main sources of conflict available to a fantasy universe, etc.  More of them will emerge over time.  Regarding the League itself, it certainly is the device in the game that justifies why these folks are fighting each other over and over on a square map with straight paths, but in anything like a real-world setting it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Garen probably wouldn't beat up on his sister; Ashe doesn't really die eight million times a day.  It's a game.  We want to start telling more stories outside the game context, and some of those game elements just don't work outside that context.  It's really not any more complicated than that.  (None of that invalidates the emotional importance those game elements have for you, me, or anyone else, though.  They'll all still be there in the game whenever you play it.)","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-09-04T21:45:16.235+0000","up_votes":176,"down_votes":5,"body":"First off, I maintain my stance regarding the 'champs as puppets' things. I don't think it affects them negatively if they're controlled by summoners, because they chose to be in that position, barring the occasional crazy. I suppose it might make more sense to just remove summoners from the equation, but you're doing more than that.\n\nSecondly, just because war is a main source of conflict doesn't mean you have to use it in your story. 'Battle by gladiator' is far more unique than 'and then the two armies fought each other.' Neither is necessarily better than the other, but removing the trial by gladiator thing is removing one of the things that made league lore more unique. I have loads of choices if I want to watch armies fight.\n\nI don't care about 'real-world' settings. I'm not here for realistic depictions of medieval combat, I'm here for the guy with swordboots and the giant armadillo that doesn't talk but can taunt you anyway. I don't mind if something is silly or illogical in the real world so long as it's internally consistent.\n\nIt is entirely possible to create stories outside of the game context and have that context still exist. Have Demacia debate other whether they would prefer to deal with a Noxian incursion through the official league channels or through their own army, possibly risking league sanctions. Have a hearing other whether the allegations of possible Zaunite tampering in the summoning process caused the bond between Ez and his summoner to be too weak to handle in the latest show match. \n\nThis is reminding me of why you guys decided to retcon Trundle's lore so heavily.

It's our job and our honor to listen to you guys and to do our best to create champions and stories that are worthy of your passion for LoL.

In my 2+ years of playing the game the supposed \"story\" was the one thing I never felt developed really at all. I've had hopes that as new champs came out new things would be revealed, and while it has happened in some small ways (Yasuo/Riven is a recent example) there's never seemed to be a real PUSH to move the story forward. As it's possible League is in it's prime right NOW, I'd really like to see some sort of exponential growth for the story in the near future. Fingers crossed this article is the start of something bigger.","replies":[{"poster":"Tommy Gnox","date":"2014-09-04T19:46:20.017+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":158,"body":"Thanks for that thoughtful post. We totally understand how frustrating it may have felt for a while for those LoL players who love lore, which is one reason we really wanted to kind of kickstart things by giving you guys some idea of what we've been thinking and talking about. We've actually been building up to this moment for a while, but League is a big place and it's taken a lot of people a lot of time thinking all the possibilities through to arrive at decisions that felt right for LoL and worthy of our players. This is the beginning of something, most definitely. Please do keep talking to us and letting us know what you think and what you'd like to see!","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-09-04T20:01:44.058+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":7,"body":"> Please do keep talking to us and letting us know what you think and what you'd like to see!\r\n\r\nAll due respect, but some of us have been doing this for the past 18 months and we've received *nothing* from the narrative team in response.  Will this change or will we have to wait another year and a half for the Zaun/Piltover saga before we hear from the team again?","replies":[{"poster":"Tommy Gnox","date":"2014-09-04T20:23:40.264+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":151,"body":"I hear you. The short answer is: we've been listening. We haven't been saying much. That's mostly been because we only want to say things that we know are true and going to happen; nobody is going to be happy if we tease something awesome that, for whatever reason, ends up not being the best way to go. That said, we want to do a better job moving forward of engaging in two-way conversation with you guys. That's the biggest reason for the dev blog you just read. That's what it's meant to kick off.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
