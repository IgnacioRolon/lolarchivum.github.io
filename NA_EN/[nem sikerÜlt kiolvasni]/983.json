The bots were ridiculously OP, and we knew that, but we still tried to defeat them. And when we did, it was just so satisfying.\r\n\r\nAlthough, I do agree with ChaosThief. It would be very laborious to update all of the bots, etc. However, I honestly think that DBoD was one of the best Featured Game Modes because it encouraged cooperation and teamwork. It was a kind of boss-level-style of game mode that we don't see much of in League.

They've since stated that gamemodes would be expected to return \"1.5~2 months\" the fact that URF came back after only 4 weeks is incredible. It's a very positive and hope-giving state.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way, if it came back every 4 weeks, that'd be more URF in a year than BOTH of the previous years combined (2.5 x 13 = 32.5. Previous years were about 13~14 days each). Even if it came back every 2 months that'd be 6x2.5 (15) days. And that's if they decide not to give more than just the weekend.
