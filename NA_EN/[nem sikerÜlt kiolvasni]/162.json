I just signed up to play the game but it keeps saying my login and pass are incorrect and I can't get into the game from client. I just had to login to write this so I know it's not me messing up my username/pass.\r\n\r\nI reset my browser,\r\nChanges the preferences for cookies,\r\nunlocked my time zone,\r\nrestart computer,\r\nchecked if server was online,\r\nchecked my region PBE> North America\r\n\r\nAll Checked out. It just won't let me log in.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T21:32:02.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The live client should not have an option for the PBE.  The PBE is a stand alone client, so you may actually be trying to login from the wrong patcher.  As a first step, make sure that you've downloaded the live client which can be found [here](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload).  Let me know if you still have any issues.","replies":[]}]}
