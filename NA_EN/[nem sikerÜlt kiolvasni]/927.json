Defense gets more nerfs and offense keeps getting more buffs and the trend is for more kills more plays and less and less ability to help a team with team functionality.\n\nJust for reference I will list 25 nerfs, reductions, and downgrades to champions, abilities, items, and summoners that reduce a players ability to help someone else on their team.  Though if I tried it could easily be a 100 or more.    Single player functionality has been greatly buffed and I defy anyone to name one major upgrade of a  skill, ability, item, summoner, or mastery that has been added to the game where a champion is actually better able to help a teammate compared with the champions ability to make a play himself.\n\nThis is becoming a 5 v 5 game rather than a team game.  And its sad to see.  Everyone wants to \"carry\" and it seems fewer and fewer players actually care more about helping a team to win than in doing the best on the map and \"carrying\".  And after the game the carries sneer at the others who had less impressive stats but actually did more to help them win.  Its getting sad.\n\nOk heres 25 ways team functionality has been reduced.  And I will give you all the global passives being eliminated for free.\n\nSupport Champions\n\n1. Sona - Heal nerfed hard\n2. Soraka - Mana replenish eiiminated - Healing other players kills her\n3. Gallio - Righteous Gust - Cooldown raised\n4. Janna - Tailwind nerfed Hard\n5. Thresh - Dark Passage only shields one ally\n6. Zilean - Time in the bottle is a nerf - Chronoshift is a hard nerf along with rewind due to longer cooldowns\n7. Nidalee - Primal Surge Healing nerfed hard\n8. Karma - Inspire Shield - Reduced\n9. Braum - Stand Behind Me - Bonus Armor reduced - Bonus Magic Res Reduced - Huge Massive Mana Increase\n10. Alistar - Triumphant Roar - Healing Reduced - Cooldown Increased - Mana Cost Increased - Now heals allies at 50% of heal\n\nOther Champions\n\n11. Sivir - Team Move Ult - On the Hunt - Massive speed nerfs for the team\n12. Gangplank - Raise Morale which boosted team speed and AD replaced by powder keg which is an individual skill\n13. Nunu - Blood Boil - nerfed so hard and in so many ways that hes considered a jungle champ rather than a support.  Hes rarely played in Jungle either.\n14. Jarvan IV - Passive team attack speed bonuses reduced - Passive Team Armor bonuses eliminated.\n15. Shen - Vorpal Blade Base heal reduced many times, cooldown raised health scaling nerf, Stand United increased channel time decreased shield time.\n\nItems\n\n16. Ardent Censer - Team attack speed buff nerfed 40%\n17. Aegis - Team Health Regen removed - Team Aura Magic Res nerfed 40% - removal of armor for wearer - Locket Shield nerfed from 5 secs to 2. Price raised.\n18. Zekes Herald - Team Life steal and Attack Damage - Removed from Game\n19. Will of the Ancients - Team AP buff and spell Vamp - Removed from the Item\n20. Righteous Glory - Team Active speed boost cooldown increased 50%\n\nSummoners \n\n21. Eleisas Miracle - Removed\n22. Heal - Cure for Grievous Wounds Removed - Speed boost nerfed hard - Actual health heal reduced\n23. Clarity - Soon to be removed\n\nWards\n\n24. Pink Ward isnt stealthed - when Killed its value skyrockets to 130 (100 against you to +30 enemy) or almost half a kill.  No item to buy provides them.\n\nDragon\n\n25.  No longer grants gold to the team.\n\nAnd do not even get me started on Solo / Duo Queue without any respect for 3 or 4 player Q.\n\n.............................\n\nHonestly, I could list dozens more nerfs to team play.  Its endless.  A jungler cant risk taking a dragon to push gold to a top laner losing lane.  The dragon becomes less important until you start approaching dragon 5.\n\nIt becomes more and more and more pointless to play to help others on your team.  If you want to enjoy this game now you better be able to show up and make plays and carry.  Nobody can do things for OTHER people to help their team.  Maybe there are a few hooks stuns and knockups to help people but there isnt a single item you can buy that honestly helps someone on your team.  If you buy pink wards you are giving the other team half a death.  Costs you 100 gold and when they kill it and they will they get back 30.  130 is pretty close to half a payout from  a 274 gold  kill.  You buy 6 pinks in a game and youve basically thrown 3 feeds to the other team.  Everyone wants the support to buy pinks with every recall but its ruinous.... Especially when you now need to make plays to win and you cant count on the others.\n\nI know that I will never have the finger twisting skill shot landing abilities of teenagers that can play this 12 hours a day.  But I enjoyed showing up, trying to out think my opponents with ward placements, item purchases,  quality dragon calls, and champions that helped other people play better.\n\nNow its land skill shots, get kills, carry the game or lose.\n\nThere is no respect for the player that can lead his team to victory by helping others become better.\n\nNowadays, when I play there is just so much filth, cursing, trash talking, and people pointing fingers at each other and blaming and reporting each other for crap that its really a sad game.  And riot encourages it more and more and more and more by refusing to reward team players, team abilities, and team items and limiting the game to skill shots, people that can \"carry\" and everyone pretty much thinking they are better than others and better than they really are and only playing to benefit themselves rather than engaging in a team concept game.\n\nThis includes stealing jungle, kill stealing, split pushing for farm, and on and on and on.\n\nHonestly, why should anyone care about lore or history or storyline when you are building a game that should only appeal to individual players.  If you completely discourage real world players from getting along playing as a team or helping each other in team friendly fashion.\n\nHonestly, why should we care if a fictional Taric is friends with a Fictional Sona.\n\nIve played LoL for 3 years and day after day after day this turns into a ruder game and ruder place to play.  And Riot constantly feeds us and gears us towards a game where insta kill is the meta.  Today, I got hit by a Sivir basic attack that did 1800 damage.  Riot thinks the only way to play the game and enjoy it is to play kill or be killed.  Helping others has no place, merit, or respect in this game.\n\nAnd if you get rid of the people that actually do want to help others.\n\nDo you honestly think the bloodthirsty crowd gives a care in the world to storylines and lore.\n\nSeriously, you are on the wrong track.\n\nIm going to buy fewer and fewer and fewer riot points in the future because I feel my team first play style just isnt welcomed or appreciated or desired in this game.\n\nAnd if I could find a game like how LoL used to be then Id leave in a heartbeat.\n\nLore doesn't matter to me when this is just a gore and bloodbath game with no strategy to be found, team co-operation needed, or team first attitude respected.\n\nI realize you cater to the teen market but my age group is the one buying riot points.\n\nI realize most people reading this would have the opinion of bye good riddance and I realize The Evil Dead made enough money to inspire a remake.\n\nBut you guys jobs depend on attracting and keeping players.  And the kind of game you are building doesnt seem that much different or really interesting to me to play over Call of Duty or Halo.\n\nIts rare Rare RARE ... that I meet a new player anymore that I want on my friends list.  And its obvious that you are catering to the immature and rude players.\n\nSure their might be Diamond and Challenger level players with a team first attitude.  But I have other things in my life to do besides devote my life to a game.\n\nI dont need lore.  I dont need Storylines.  I want a game where teamwork is valued as much as ability to land a skill shot.  And Riot, thats not you anymore.\n\nChat all you want about how great this game is but if you keep up with this path ... you will turn yourself into the next version of Mortal Kombat where people are tripping all over themselves to show more and more blood and gore rather than improving the quality of their game.  And the type of player base you are catering to is the least loyal you could ever hope to find.\n\nKind people stay more loyal than rude ones.  And you seem to be kicking the kinder gentler crowd out the door by saying fun lives in killing others.\n\nIts a mistake and you should really consider it.  You have psychologists and others and all kinds of people working for you.\n\nAnd you still work harder and harder and with great diligence to cater to the whims of the basest of personalities and crowds.\n\nYou can comment if you want but I know you wont.  And Im sure you are talented enough to find another job.\n\nYouve had need to do so before .... havent you ......  Did you learn from it ?\n\nGood Day","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-11-05T21:20:02.340+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Traverse768,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=5q0x7qiT,comment-id=0021,timestamp=2015-11-04T05:50:25.302+0000)\n>\n> I would like to comment on the disrespect riot gives players for approaching the game in team orientated fashion and would like you to comment on these factors...\n> \n<snip!>\n\n> ...You can comment if you want but I know you wont.

Did you learn from it ?\n> \n> Good Day\n\nHello, Traverse768\n\nI know you didn't post this in the 'Between Two Towers' thread, but I wanted to get back to you after it anyway.\n\nFirst, and most importantly - I don't work on League.  I work in R&D on something else that I can't say anything about - but I _do_ care deeply about how League players feel, and how the game treats them.\n\nSecondly, I am a support player - I really don't play any other lane at all.  Sona is my main, and reading your comments, I think you have an interest in her gameplay viability also.  (I also dabble in Thresh and Nautilus support, too.)\n\nThirdly - I am no spring chicken.  I'm not one of those young, early-20's developers that you seem to think you're addressing.  Your comments at the end of your post I found rather odd, and out of tone with the level headed and rational attitude of the rest of your post.  I suspect it was the frustration you're feeling doing the talking, however - and I know how that can feel.\n\nWith that all aside, I'd like to address what I feel is the main crux of your comment - that you believe that League of Legends is becoming a game that favors solo-queue carry behavior from low-reaction-speed young'uns, interested in personal glory only.  You've clearly outlined why you think that's the case, so I understand where you're coming from - however, I'd like to state that while I believe that that player type IS welcome, it is not the only player profile that League rewards and encourages.\n\nIn fact, I would say that players who exhibit the behavior you describe yourself having, being the rock upon which a successful League of Legends team is built!\n\nRiot is famous (infamous?) for its attempts to combat in-game toxicity - a very difficult problem that affects groups of humans in most anonymous situations.  The automated machine learning system is trying to catch toxic behavior and deal with it far faster than a mere human could do.  The new champ select methods (and team builder before it) is a fairly drastic change that is being introduced in order for players to have less conflict during the pre-game phase - so that players may get the role, and hopefully the champ, that they want to play.  Players will be able to queue up with 1, 2, 3 or 4 of their friends (hopefully leading to games with more co-operation) and be matched with people in similar groupings.  Heck, they're even making it so that if you leave the fountain without a trinket, you'll get the ward trinket by default!  Vision, and the coordination that it is supposed to lead to, is of supreme importance.  Lastly, I believe they've now made it so that kill bounties awards team gold?  So that might counteract the loss of the dragon gold.\n\nNow, obviously you called out many of the changes and nerfs to champions you consider that particularly support a cooperative playstyle, but while nerfs and extreme balance values aren't my specialty (you'd do well to ask in the gameplay board about this, rather than to me) I would caution against seeing these changes in a vacuum.  Success rate of these champions and their influence on the game is monitored super carefully, and if those guys on the balance/live team found the changes imbalanced, then they'd seek to change them, or make other changes to even things out.  \n\nPersonally, as a Sona player, I do not feel the heal nerf to be particularly crippling - my sustain is still fairly obnoxious for the enemy team, and I usually do well at keeping my ADC alive with careful use of the shield, and the haste, etc.  If anything, I am holding my breath to find out how much she will be affected by the upcoming removal of mana potions - because in the early game she is pretty mana locked!  However, I trust those guys not to make her unplayable for someone like me who mains her.\n\nI'd also like to state that I often run with an Abyssal Scepter and/or an Aegis of the Legion - bringing team-assisting auras to the rest of the champs on my side, and often turning the tide of a teamfight because of it.  So your statement that there are no team helping items confuses me a bit.  (Note - I've not memorized the Season 6 item changes, so if those items have been changed or removed, please go easy on my ignorance).\n\nNow I am not for a second dismissing your concerns - I feel them, and strongly understand them, being the sort of player you self identify as.  I'm older, a support player, and one who judges my success not by my own triumphs, but in how well I have empowered my team to excel.  I think this is still the game for us - but I encourage you to continue to keep us focused on this.  There are many younger devs at Riot, bright, brilliant, and driven - and it's super important for the voice of age and experience to be available when they seek help.\n\nWhat I hope, is that League will continue to support both the grandstanding glory hogs and the powers-behind-the-thrones, that we can make efforts to improve the teamwork of every game, win or lose, and that we can establish that toxic behavior isn't acceptable at any time and will only result in losses and worse games.  Alas, there's no magic button for that :(\n\nI do encourage you to ask about particular champ buffs/nerfs/changes over on the Gameplay board, where better minds than I can hopefully answer your questions!\n\nThank you again, Traverse768.","replies":[]},{"poster":"noodle15","date":"2015-11-04T06:24:24.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dead man's plate, steric's gauge, massive buff to railay's and several other changes to itemization make tanks extremely effective this patch. sure those items focus on individuality however that is the whole point of this game: five individuals using their unique and individual talents to work together and win the game. I agree that the loss of soraka's mana donation was sad and that a champion should come along soon to pick that skill up again as it was one of the most unique in the game however her new kit and all of those mentioned are still very good for team play. Try not to be mad at riot for making changes that force you to play different champions or builds. That is a part of why I love this game so much. It is a constant process it will never be finished and yet it is still more finished than EA's Battlefield 4. if you're an old dog who refuses to learn new tricks maybe it is time you set aside league and never looked back.
