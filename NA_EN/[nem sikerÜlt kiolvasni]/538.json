It had flaws of course, most game modes do, but I had good memories with it. Especially where I once stole the Ascension with Gnar's boomerang, had enough time to taunt the enemy team, and later proceeded to get a quadra (I think it was) while using the Ascended buff.\n\n---\n\nLeast favorite mode... One for All: Mirror Mode, the one where every player in the game had the same champion. 5v5 Amumu's was depressingly boring (No wordplay intended). Just huddle up to each other in an awkward pile of depression, and try to out-cry the other team to death.  \n\n---\n\nURF was great and all, but like most said, it kind of burnt out after people figured out the OP Pics.

I missed out on Perfect Ascension so many times and only managed to snag it on the last game of the last day.

You could group up for roaming kill squads.  You could be the giant glowing star of the zone or the star's bodyguard.  Add to that the gold mechanic so everybody always had the same amount at the same time.

This makes it much more permanent and flexable (Buff/Nerf), and still grants the fun of urf mode.\r\n\r\nTo rephrase, lets say your playing Ashe, the buff would look something like:\r\n\r\n**Passive:** *\"A true archer is always ready\"* \r\nAutomatically charges, even in combat.\r\n\r\n**Frost Shots:** *\"Mana for arrows?\"*\r\nThis Ability Cost No Mana.\r\n\r\n**Volly:** *\"More arrows, more slow\"*\r\nAplies Double the slow of your current level in frost shots and stacks with deminishing returns if Frost Shots is already applied.\r\n\r\n**Hawkshot:** *\"My bird came back!\"*\r\nHas half its cooldown returned if it spots an enemy. (Multiplies with how many enemies it spots)\r\n\r\n**Enchanted Crystal Arrow:** *\"Frozen, Solid.\"*\r\nThe stun from this ability is doubled VS champions who are already afflicted with frost shot/volly slow.\r\n\r\nThe buff defines who ashe is, a kite heavy marksman who thrives when she can kite effectivly and freeze the right target in their tracks.\r\n\r\nSomeone who's a little harder to buff without making them the clear winner is Kassadin. However the buffs dont necessarily have to be so overwhelmingly strong. In a champion like Kassadin it wouldnt be based on his ability to delete people it would be more utility based and define what it means to get to the void and back alive, and what it does to a person.\r\n\r\nPassive: \"Theres more than magic in the void\"\r\nDamage reduction also includes physical and true damage.\r\n\r\n**Q:** *\"Ready For Anything\"*\r\nMagic Sheild Becomes Regular Damage Shield (Blocking physical, magic, and true damage)\r\n\r\n**W:** *\"The more mana, the better\"*\r\nWhen activated, Kassadin gains (X%) attack speed and increased mana refunds per auto attack.\r\n\r\n**E:** *\"The void doesnt wait\"*\r\nAbility gains one extra charge per spell used.\r\n\r\n**R:** *\"Take what you can\"*\r\nThis abilitys cooldown is reset instantly on kill.\r\n\r\nThe above buff might not seem like much, but I think riot knows that in even unskilled hands this is a very dangerous picture i've created.\r\n\r\nThe buff would (Obvously) change depending on the champion you play, it would make that champion OP like in urf, but it would define who makes them who they are and defines what makes each champion OP in their own way.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like me to make a completed buff list Upvote this.\r\nRiot, I would be more than happy to give suggestions for champion buffs in this gamemode if you comment. Obviously your word is final.\r\n\r\nThis post was truely fun to make.","replies":[{"poster":"abeauferris","date":"2015-03-19T21:42:13.692+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that Hawkshot buff could actually be a good idea to have permanently. :P ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hell Taker","date":"2015-03-19T22:21:43.131+0000","up_votes":105,"down_votes":28,"body":"If you want to see U.R.F become a permanent game mode, and perhaps replace the Dominion map (which no one hardly goes on judging from long queue up time) UP VOTE THIS FOR RIOT TO SEE!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"mZPEpfGvpx","date":"2015-03-19T18:29:10.349+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":10,"body":"hey riot. i started playing leauge last april when urf came out. but i never got to play it because i started nearly the day after it ended. for those uf us who never got a chance to play itd be great if u guys could bring it back this april. u already own my wallet rito., now give us urf.
