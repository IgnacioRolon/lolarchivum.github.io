Unfortunately, it seems that I was wrong.  For those that are chiding others for being upset, I would urge you to see another point of view.  Waiting a year between opportunities to purchase a specific chroma for IP is quite frustrating.  Saying \"every other IP sale\" certainly sounds better than saying \"once per year.\"  IP chroma sales may be bi-annual but specific IP chromas are certainly annual sales.  Seems to be a waste.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the FAQ makes this more confusing and completely contradictory: \r\n\r\nHOW DO I BUY CHROMAS FOR IP?\r\nYou can purchase chromas for IP during special chroma IP sales that take place twice a year.
