When its finished, I click on the LOL shortcut to open that patcher to install the files, and all that appears is a black box behind the lebague of legends symbol that pops up on the screen. So I uninstalled the game cause I dont want something that doesnt work on my pc. Thanks for making a quality game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T22:34:44.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your patcher is completely black screened then you may actually have a network issue failing to connect to the server.  Reinstalling won't necessarily fix this as that would focus more on game files and not your connection.  Instead, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, and get this fixed up.
