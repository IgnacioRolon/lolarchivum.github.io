Great read.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the things I miss in how you describe Mastery as a design value is the long-term goals in a single game. Which overall strategy does a team follow? Or in other words, what approach does a team take for attaining victory? Do you play with a focus on objectives, early pressure, late-game hyperscaling, team fighting, ...?  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis sort of belongs to teamplay, but the way you describe it here, it refers more to player interaction on a different level (such as the Thresh lantern). In a way, this is also what one could call \"the meta\", but that then relates to adaptability: can players adapt to the regular changes, which may or may not push the dominant strategies into a different direction, and therefore change the meta?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of \"the meta\", in fact? Basically, the meta is a dominant strategy that teams (on a competitive level at least) prefer to use. This implies that alternative strategies are not optimal. Do you actively try to 'change' the meta? Is that your goal with balance changes? In an ideal world, many different strategies exist on a similar level in terms of success rate, but that seems so incredibly difficult to attain. But what if you could attain that perfect balance between different strategies? Then there is no more meta to change, no more need to evolve the game in that sense (apart from the alternative goal of making as many champions as possible viable). Would that even be possible?\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers again!","replies":[{"poster":"Nssheepster","date":"2014-07-26T03:26:14.326+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree. It seems as if A)Players don't appreciate changing the meta, and B) That the meta only changes when Riot patches something, and even then, only enough to incorporate the change, never further. Even TCGs have multiple strategies that are all equally effective, but League only has the one. It's not that there aren't perfectly viable strategic alternatives, or even that these can't be made easily, but that both Riot and the LCS teams make no effort towards a change. On the LCS team's part, I assume they're simply feeling skilled at the current style, and obviously wouldn't want to be the first to risk using a different style. But I cannot understand why Riot itself puts no effort into other, \"non-meta\" strategies. I would love a Dev Blog all about their opinion of the meta, what they feel it is currently, and what they feel can be done to change it.","replies":[{"poster":"FlakFlayster","date":"2014-07-26T16:55:46.674+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you 100%! When one champ gets skilled or better adapt at breaking the meta; riot always patches the game so that the champion gets restricted so that it cant break out of its meta. Examples: Every \"support\" characters. \"Support-champs\" are not allowed anywhere else but bot-lane. Nothing else can be played as a \"support\", even if they have enough crowd-control to change the tide of a battle.\r\n\r\nThe worst part is, Riot claims that they support plays ability to adapt and mix things up by being creative and different. But yet dont support the idea when plays avoid following the routine, when every game/match looks exactly the same (Or supposed to look exactly the same as some match viewed on LCS). It's annoying that this game cant be played to be fun, surprising, and a new experience every time. The moment a player senses something is different. It's nonstop whining, complaining, and avoidance. \r\n\r\nPlayers dodge even in normal matches, and are extremely ignorant to let a player skilled in their own play-design play a champ they feel is best for the given situation. There are many times when i get stuck with support role, and i pick someone different i get good results (element of surprise plays a lot to this; good results can happen for either team when played with or against). But instead i get forced into picking a lame champion and forced to play in a way that someone else thinks a game should be played, rather than how comfortable i would be as the player/gamer myself.\r\n\r\nWish everyone wasnt so closed-minded about this subject. It's ridiculous and annoying to have over 100 champions, and can only be allowed to play about 15% of them because of how ignorant everyone is.","replies":[{"poster":"StarWarp","date":"2014-07-26T20:22:53.237+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"That is why the meta is the way it is... You guy are complaining about how the meta isn't changed because certain champs with certain characteristics in their kit can't go in certain places \r\n**\"Examples: Every \"support\" characters. \"Support-champs\" are not allowed anywhere else but bot-lane.**\r\nThats enforcing the meta right there... \r\nSure Support champs can be played roles other than Support bot. \r\nWhy does Riot have to change it? You change it.\r\nThe meta is a set of rules that players obey, but disobeying it has no consequences. Disobey it all you want. No one is forcing you to use any sort of strategy. What you are asking, is that Riot or an LCS SHOW you another way so you can follow that. Everyone starts following that strategy would make those 2 strategies \"the meta\". Try duo jungle, or a jungle and a support.\r\nThe meta can be broken, whenever you want. \r\nYou saying it can't, is the reason why you haven't. \r\n\r\nI think the meta exists because it makes the game more strategically fun; like a game of Chess. Everyone starts remotely similar, and its how people play that changes the game to a win or a loss. Instead of one strategy plainly being better than the other. Say, you had this strategy, (the summoner spells, champions, runes and masteries that compliment this strategy) and you play against another strategy, both \"breaking\" the meta. All of a sudden, you notice during the loading screen, oh my god, they are using the counter to our strategy. Well then, you just wasted 30 minutes of you life, because its already weighed in their favour. Or you are playing a normal game of LoL, without your regular team, and you notice theres a support following the Jungle. You would most likely get mad, especially if you were ADC and the game would be thrown because of that one kid... Who was trying to break the meta. Maybe it would've worked? It's just the fact the rest of the team wasn't situated properly for this strategy to work? No one went and created an alternative strategy for playing chess, they just used the \"meta\" because it was recognizable, comfortable, and it makes it so the skill in the game is more critical. \r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion, you can complain about how LoL is all you want, and how you want others (Riot and LCS) to change the Meta for you, or you can try to try new strategies yourself. If not, then just embrace the game how it is. \r\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NetherDemon","date":"2014-07-25T23:55:59.314+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":1,"body":"*sigh*, i remember when the comment section was full of funny and overused jokes, and not this free RP rubbish.
