Just seems like a throw away reward, when it's such a low possibility of that many winners to begin with. \r\n With LCS/League/Riot going into this franchising in the near future, I'm really puzzled that they still haven't created \"LCS only skins\" for champions, that fans/players can only earn if they know their LCS/Competitive league.  It makes people watch the competitive product, to be able to get the skins that they would only get if they do so.  \r\n  It would make people on youtube/streams care about the competitive scene, in which would in ways, increase fans to the scene, if the popular streamers would create videos of maybe analysis/stats/theories etc of such pro games.  \r\n  ...........
