Also, and this one is something I would find fun, can we be able to gain extra IP for walking during the day if we turn on a feature on it to allow such a thing (toggles on for IP, toggles off for no need). This can then be transferred over to our accounts to help buy things with IP. We can gain like 1 IP per every 10 steps we take, so since on average I take about 3,560 steps a day, I'd only get about 356 IP per day.","replies":[{"poster":"AWWWW sh1t","date":"2016-02-24T20:45:08.390+0000","up_votes":463,"down_votes":6,"body":"we shall call it....the Riot diet ","replies":[{"poster":"100 Matt","date":"2016-02-25T02:43:08.272+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":7,"body":"I logged in just to upvote this.

Spectating through mobile device will be like loading up the actual league game, not a MP4 video file or any other video file because there isn't anything to render it as a video for mobile devices to run. It's not like youtube or twitch where you stream videos, it's more like loading the game to spectate... Idk if this makes sense to help you guys understand. Also, if they somehow do compress it into a video instantly, you wouldn't be able to spectate the person you want because again, it's a video, not the actual game itself for you to control the camera.

I love the fact that you can view yours or your friends' profile to see what ranking they are in along with their status (whether if they are online, away, or which kind of game they are in and how long they have been in game for). I enjoy the fact that there is a chat history in here and can copy and paste the text into the writing section. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one slight issue I have with the app at this time. When someone messages you while you are on the app, it is about a 2-3 minute delay until there is a notification shown on your phone that someone has messaged you on League. This doesn't happen always but it does happen frequently and there's the possibility that some other users might demand for a quicker response than this. \r\n\r\nOverall, I still believe that this is a very great app despite the little bug it has and I feel like that overtime, this app can even become better with other features such as spectating their friends' games  or the ability to enter into champion select in order to save some time and multitask a bit before they head back to their computer. Those are just some possible suggestions but if you believe that the purpose of this app is only for messaging friends, then that is understandable as well. Thank you again, Riot Games for making this app and I maybe (and hopefully) I'll be able to work with you guys in the future or help out in any other way. Best of luck to you all. ","replies":[]}]}
