When {{champion:68}} 's flamethrower got updated, It really bugged me alot that Riot did not update the the equalizer visul effects as well.  THANK GOD ALMIGHTY FOR THE {{champion:6}} BUFFS! Something that he has been needing for a very long time and how his basic attacks him be more faster like a ADC and also how his acid hunters restore mana on if you kill a unit (really good with{{item:3508}} , the cooldown and cost for \"HKPR\" is good and you get a slight shield from it is a nice touch. STILL waiting for them to make it so {{champion:101}} 's ult can be used to click somewhere on the map.  The {{champion:102}} splash is ok and the {{champion:67}} Splash is very nice but, Old champions that really need a new splash art is {{champion:19}} and {{champion:14}} , MAY I remind you of the one sided AXE!
