I don't even care about sandbox mode, but your argument makes no sense. If someone wants to practice fundamental skills to the game to get better, you should allow them to do that. No sport requires people to play full games in order to practice. 2 hours in a sandbox practicing a specific skill, combo, or whatever, will be worth 100 hours of game time in terms of getting it right. If you want to play casually, nobody's forcing you to practice these fundamentals. \r\n\r\nThink about soccer. If I want to play soccer with my buddies down the block, I'll go play a game. If I want to be a professional soccer player, I'm going to be in my back yard practicing ball control, passing, shooting, and other skills. Playing a game does not afford me enough chances to practice these skills, so I create an isolated environment in which to do it. Sure, it's not the same as playing a game, but it's a lot better way to improve the skills I need.\r\n\r\nIf I want to get better at early game last hitting, I'm going to need dozens of games to practice it. If \"playing a game is the unequivocal best way for me to improve,\" it's going to take me dozens of hours to practice just this skill, where I could do it in an hour or two in a sandbox.\r\n\r\nAs much as you want playing the game to be the best way to get better at the game, it's just simply not.","replies":[{"poster":"Insert quarters","date":"2015-08-05T22:37:25.674+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think the other thing is pressure.

The implementation of a sandbox WILL raise the standards in an already technically difficult game. People will expect each other to go into sandbox multiple times before even going into the game, and as such it will make people that just play the game casually, feel more pressured into the hours of practice to just play the game. I think there's probably a good middle ground somewhere, the trouble is just finding it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an idea would be to do specific simulators for certain things, some things like last hitting with a champion, or flashing over walls would be great for this. But others, such as learning new items, or spell rotations with champions, should be something you learn while in game, in a competitive environment.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying a sandbox is a bad idea, I'm saying that it might not be the solution you think it is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fenrisulfr","date":"2015-08-05T18:18:42.297+0000","up_votes":190,"down_votes":8,"body":"Honestly I just have to say - Thank you for this.\r\n\r\nThis provides a lot more clarity and a look in on everything and I could practically feel the struggles that you guys are going through every single day.

With sandbox and practicing comes a \"standard\" to meet for anyone who wants to become better at league of legends. While it is great to practice, there's two reasons they haven't introduced it.\n\nOne: You will get better by playing in actual games. Yes, you are going to lose a lot of them if you are learning new mechanics, roles, or champions, but you will learn each game. Every missed flash is going to make the next one better. You can only do so much in a sandbox game.\n\nTwo: League doesn't want to promote this cultural trait that you need to practice to become good at league of legends. It really alienates the game from casual players, and just creates another barrier (however empty it is) that players just don't want to jump over. They will feel a need to practice if they want to be good, and many just don't have that desire. It could possibly drive them away from the game entirely.\n\n\nPlease actually read the post before you say stuff like this in the comments.

You shouldn't have to practice to get better at something? \r\n\r\nOne: Yes, you get better at playing the game by playing the game. But there's a reason basketball players practice dribbling, free throws, passing, etc. individually to strengthen those specific skills. It makes no sense to say that the ability to practice individual mechanics is somehow limiting or a drawback. \r\n\r\nTwo: Like I said earlier, this makes literally no sense. In a game where you have to use third party programs to learn how to play the game at a basic level because of the out of date tutorial, look up champion numbers and ability scaling because they aren't in the client already, and the confusing rune system that involves putting in a lot of IP just to have a few standard sets, the ability to practice outside of actual games is the barrier to entry? What? Players hang out in Bronze V right now and don't leave the game, the only way for them to practice is to bash their heads against normal matches until they hopefully learn enough to start climbing. Being able to just focus on last hitting or learning a champion's mechanics better would drive them away from the game? \r\n\r\nHis exact issue was addressed, but he disagrees with the point made.

No practice necessary, play with your friends, don't be afraid to queue up, etc. I want that too. It's another to not be ABLE to practice certain skills with any consistency.\r\nIn my eyes, not allowing people to practice new champions, try out things they have not bought with their long-time-worked-for IP, or practice a skill that they are not good at yet makes a HUGE barrier for people trying to improve at the game, or spend their IP.\r\nI am a huge supporter of trying to make the game fun and removing barriers to entry.
