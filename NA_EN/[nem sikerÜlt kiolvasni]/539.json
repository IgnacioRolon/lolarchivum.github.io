This means that it is harder to begin the snowball. This is supposed to make it so that he cannot kill you easily with limited items early on. This means you have more time to shut him down and make him useless. When you have 500 health at the beginning of a game, 50 damage means a lot to me. Assuming that you were sarcastic, I actually think that they have done a good job nerfing Veig. I'm Silver 4 so I could be terribly wrong, but it's just my 2 cents on the nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Of Daventry","date":"2015-10-29T01:58:10.835+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"The fraction of damage they shaved off will mean nothing to good veigars. The early level numbers are barely changed, and 20/30 damage won't mean much when you are that level to have them maxed. Veigar's \"problem\" is that he has infinite scaling. If he doesn't get shut down early, he's going to be a pain in the ass, but just like vayne, if the game goes long enough, and he catches up, it won't matter. IMO to fix Veigar, change the Q passive so that there is diminishing returns, and the stun so it lasts longer if you actually land it right on, but if you run into it, it doesn't last as long.","replies":[{"poster":"Aych Pii","date":"2015-10-29T04:30:06.235+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"it will marginally decrease his impact in a mostly invisible way, allowing him to keep his current fantasy fulfillment but decrease his overall oppressiveness.
