For example this list will not have either pawn or cool. Both players who are equal or better than him mechanically and in knowledge of the game. Both players that their team sinks or swims with. You could argue that Cool has clearlove for some shotcalling. I probably should have said he should be 8-11. Everyone above him has support for the best in the world argument and he's iiiiiiiiincredibly consistent  arguably most consistent in the world but my issue is outplay potential and shotcalling. But at 6 he's being placed at arguably the best in the world which I have trouble with. His aggression negation is incredible but he loses than due to the fact he rarely roams which will be huge considering the hyper-aggressive teams will work around that and 4v2 their bot lanes or 3v1 their top lane.  My biggest issue is that they didn't think carefully about snubs. Bjergsen, despite being my favorite non-faker mid got an extra 2-3 points for hype factor, Loveling was waaay high--debatably on the list, sneaky shouldn't have made it, winds, pawn, fzzf, looper, and one of [westdoor, acorn and heart] should be here.

Really think about it for a second.... How important is Berg to TSM over Deft to SSGB? Deft  IS already on a team that doesnt need him to completely carry **why?? **because it isn't just a **one** player beast team. They are already superstars. Infact the top tier teams that even made the list are kinda shocking because each one of there players makes a difference. Lets say Korean Wins- SSGW or B w/e  \"Pawn\" is held at the number spot. That tells me his team needs him because they cant do. Tells me he is the better player and that if he loses his team loses and doesnt matter how good or how fed Imp is they will always lose without Pawn.... \r\n or SSGW isnt going to completely get wrecked without Imp preforming. Why? Because Pawn and Mata.\r\nSneaky making the list pisses people off. Using my \"understanding\" on how the guys are listing these people where they are I understand!.. C9 isnt going to Win or Lose because of Sneaky losing badly or being a fed monster. He is important for the reasons they had posted. He is SOLID. Now Alliance needs Froggen to preform honestly they would lose without him not because they are bad because what element he brings to the team. Berg gives much needed leadership to his  TSM team thats why he is so far on the list not because he is better then the ones listed before.\r\n\r\nIN SUMMARY I THINK ANY PEOPLE LISTED LOWER THEN 8 HAVE TO BE STANDOUT SUPERSTARS ON A TEAM. Its foolish to think Pawn is the only great player on the team and he carries them always and they need him so i don't expect him to be on the list if he wasn't listed already. \r\n\r\nThats just one way of looking at it. The other way is to take everything into account like the Riot people have been doing and leave it be. Let worlds decide whose the best teams and let the players show why they are the best. You don't like the list? Suck a di*k and get over it. \r\n\r\nLast thought, NA has to stop making excuses for w/e place we end up in. EU, you aren't better then NA right now\r\n at least according to the last international contest between these regions it goes KR>CN>NA>EU>GPL>Other.  EU: \"BUT THAT WAS SO LONG AGO!\" Yeah so was 2013 Worlds. Let it go.  EU: \"But our Scrims are so good because we are beating Korean teams!\" Ya from what i have heard you aren't positive vs NA in those either. EU: \"Scrims aren't offical\" Yeah so let these Worlds decide.... till the next international clash. Either way stop being pissed you are viewed as the lesser region and stay positive that your teams can make a mark.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendary Cheese","date":"2014-09-16T19:41:30.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post is clearly 100% objective :|","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grigôri","date":"2014-09-17T13:07:46.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both for Rekkles (on Lucian) and Froggen (on Ziggs) the same teamfight is used to display their skill.
