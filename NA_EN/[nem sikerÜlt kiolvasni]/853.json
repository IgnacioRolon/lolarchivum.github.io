We've been TOLD that Xerath's much more malicious actions and such are only from Azir's point of view and that he's supposedly still very true to the more outright neutral, ambition/knowledge-fueled arcane force people love. Yet currently that's nothing more than an informed attribute, and Xerath is so far a despot and traitor who cared nothing for the fact that he is apparently responsible for Shurima's destruction. And as for Renekton, we STILL don't know exactly how he went mad. What happened in that tomb for a virtuous defender of Shurima to become a mad butcher who believed his brother betrayed him?\r\nI sincerely hope that this event isn't going to end with numerous plotholes and unanswered questions, otherwise this does nothing to help your case in saying that the lore needs to be retconned and the Institute/Summoners removed in order to tell a better story.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Parrallax999","date":"2014-09-20T15:59:04.485+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"LEAVE SHURIMA AS A MAP AND KEEP GAMEMODE ASCENSION PLZ {{champion:107}} {{champion:107}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Have at ye","date":"2014-09-20T17:02:33.083+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, I'll miss this game mode, but not quite as much as URF. {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nRiot, all I ask for now is this: if you really aren't willing to give us any of the new game modes permanently, won't you at least ensure that there's less than a few days downtime between cycling the different ones?","replies":[]},{"poster":"owenmarquis01","date":"2014-09-20T16:44:31.383+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":11,"body":"EVERYONE WANT'S URF SO BRING IT BACK\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Anonymous","date":"2014-09-20T17:23:46.685+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"So demanditive :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Muffinbowl","date":"2014-09-20T16:53:55.473+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"You know Riot, With all these updates and events that have been going around, you're forgetting about someone you've forgotten to rework.\r\nI don't blame you guys though, He can really 'Camouflage' in with the other champions, But don't be so 'Blind' guys, you know he needs one so 'Move Quick' with his rework, he was one of the first after all, I'm just making a 'Shot' to ask you rework him even though he has made people 'Toxic' since he was released, But lets look past all of that and look towards the future for this champion.\r\nKnow that I'm trying my best to be honest, even though some people may make this post a 'Noxious Trap' my Opinion stands true, Riot I ask you with my deepest desire, Rework the champion I had inquired so.\r\nMy Deepest Respect - Muffinbowl","replies":[]},{"poster":"SamDaRuler","date":"2014-09-20T15:23:36.475+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"keep the shurima gamemode.....\r\n{{champion:101}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kowareta","date":"2014-09-20T16:42:12.494+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol U.R.F ALL THE WAY\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9BodyTheseFools","date":"2014-09-20T15:16:32.694+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:268}} approves this message","replies":[]},{"poster":"RikuisHOT","date":"2014-09-20T15:55:49.174+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"i want urf back\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"minerdude8","date":"2014-09-20T16:42:59.832+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"bring bak UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFF{{item:3078}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"SHG BongShark","date":"2014-09-20T15:16:59.603+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":12,"body":"this is honestly a much better game mode then urf it takes more skill imo and it is just as fun. i have only played 1 game of summoners since the release of this game mode. i wish for it to stay a game mode but i highly doubt it will. so i guess its back to the endless summoners grind to max level that is as boring as ever :(. if dominion wasnt filled with bots aswell as aram i feel those game modes would make up for the repetitiveness of SR. please riot try a lil harder to get rid of all the botters at the low levels i have invited friends and family to play and they are getting annoyed with bots being in every game mode except ascension and team builder. btw im talking about players using botting programs not people playing bot matches.","replies":[{"poster":"Dånkplank","date":"2014-09-20T15:29:46.922+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":9,"body":"/urf is more fun\\","replies":[]}]}]}
