At 12PM EST I went straight to the Bundle package and tried to get my tickets for section D or G, row 1 or LOGE 1 or 12, row 1...and as the package obviously states, it's for both Saturday and Sunday. Well...it seems MOST people...are only buying tickets for the finals. So while on my end, TicketMaster was trying to 'hold' the tickets for both days, and checking both days, caused a slight delay and those who just wanted the one day got their tickets before me. I can still get LOGE 1 or 12 on Saturday, but like row 7+ (which is fine, but I'd want it for both days) and on Sunday...for pre-sale anyway, literally all of the good tickets are gone. All floor (that are in a reasonable viewing section) and all LOGE 1,12 etc. All that's left are some random LOGE sections that are off center and in corners and balcony. So....that all sucks. My personal recommendation would be to first open the bundle packages in the future, for maybe 1 hour before the rest? That way those who are wanting to go both days...giving you more money...and trying to make the most of their trip to Boston (which for me is a fun 11 hour road trip - I don't mind driving, I think it'd be neat), instead of opening it all and essentially all bundle people got sort of screwed. The TM bundle feature is apparently an \"all or nothing\" type of system where if you want LOGE 1 Row 2 and it's not available, it'll try one other row, and then that's it. It won't help you book your Saturday tickets and then Sunday tickets. It's one shot or nothing. So I said...well...how about I book Saturday and then book Sunday? Well...you lose the 25% discount because you didn't bundle and the seats are so drastically different it's not even worth the trip. So...lesson learned on my end, lol. I hope others have a better experience and enjoy the show. I don't blame Riot at all for this and blame my own ignorance for buying tickets (my first time) and the terrible TicketMaster website.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Natural2020","date":"2017-06-26T17:09:26.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all.\r\n\r\nLooks like there was a bug that caused everyone to have a ticket limit of 2 regardless of where they wanted seats.
