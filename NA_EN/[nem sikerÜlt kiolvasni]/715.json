I have a little brother around the age of fifteen and he isn't new at all to PC games and in fact runs his own minecraft servers is an active member in the minecraft and steam community and has a gaming PC that very well rivals anything i've seen even at my age. What blows is when I introduced him to the game that his brother loves to play and would love to play with him as a form of 21st century bonding. He downloaded it, installed, waited hours for all the patches to finish, we loaded up, and the tutorial pretty much wrecked him. He's not one to give up so we continued, trying to figure it out but even once he got passed the basic controls, all the minor objective's goals and strategies we all know by instinct totally screwed him over because of the lack of context. I always say the best way to learn the game is to play it, but if you are playing it wrong and wrong time and time again that isn't helping anyone and only further reinforces the terrible playing habits. I'm hoping this could help my brother out and maybe we can get to playing together soon. Thank you Riot. :) ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Take Five","date":"2014-07-04T18:34:38.146+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":14,"body":"shrek {{champion:14}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Heracross","date":"2014-07-04T18:35:23.368+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":8,"body":"Draven{{champion:119}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Kegmaster 9000","date":"2014-07-04T18:37:07.096+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":9,"body":"BrainSlug{{champion:154}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Smanderson","date":"2014-07-04T18:46:51.804+0000","up_votes":168,"down_votes":9,"body":"My mom {{champion:6}} ","replies":[{"poster":"MooseChangerPat","date":"2014-07-04T21:50:26.929+0000","up_votes":159,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{champion:61}} My Mom, {{champion:74}} My Dad, {{champion:62}} My little bro, {{champion:117}} My sister, {{champion:254}} My other sister, {{champion:96}} My dog, {{champion:76}} My cat, {{champion:267}} My goldfish.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n......\r\n\r\n{{champion:32}} Me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nooben","date":"2014-07-05T00:37:55.981+0000","up_votes":168,"down_votes":17,"body":"My nigga {{champion:236}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Man Duck","date":"2014-07-04T20:06:53.217+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"DRAVEN {{champion:119}} ","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2014-07-04T18:50:02.496+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":4,"body":"Donkey {{champion:12}} ","replies":[{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2014-07-04T18:50:54.760+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":4,"body":"Prince Charming {{champion:59}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Tkharr","date":"2014-07-04T19:16:31.896+0000","up_votes":134,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:54}} rock.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Casually Cody","date":"2014-07-04T18:49:44.676+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":15,"body":"Shrek is love, shrek is life{{champion:14}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"MetalDeathBug","date":"2014-07-04T18:48:05.571+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":11,"body":"That comment was Shrekcellent!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegolasTheBLACK","date":"2014-07-04T19:37:12.204+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":7,"body":"They should let like a veteran player sign up for like training the people that just started the game and teach them tips and tricks.","replies":[{"poster":"Z46","date":"2014-07-04T19:51:13.868+0000","up_votes":135,"down_votes":11,"body":"\"I can finally teach these useless f*kers how to play!\r\n\r\n\"God you suck.
