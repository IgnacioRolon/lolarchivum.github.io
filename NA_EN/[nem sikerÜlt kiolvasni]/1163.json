Her passive is already one of the best in the game. ITS just NOBODY freaking uses it at ALL. I see so many of the people who claim to be a \"top\" cass player let the passive Drop and reset back to zero. If you CAST Q all the time at exactly 4.5sec EVEN IF YOU CANT HIT MINIONS OR CHAMPS with it. You can maintain her passive the entire time you're in lane or out of the base. AND you will also REGEN mana while Q'ing. at lvl 5 Q with a 5 stack of the current passive your mana cost is 17mp. However by lvl 8 with a flask set and then a tear at 700g which are your first two items you have more MP5 than 17mp its around 8mana a second AND you can max out the tear in 16-20mins. Also when you B back to buy stuff you can cast 3-4 spells in the base while buying stuff to build passive stacks and just Q back into lane with FULL mana and a FULL set of stacks so 50% less mana cost forever! This also ensures that when you do attack your lane opponent taht you can Bully them non stop with no fear of running out of mana and usually get the kill without the ult saving that for the jungle gank double kill. After that double kill you'll still have more than half your mana bar due to all those spells being at 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new passive Ruins Cass as far as I can tell. Unless her stacks help build massive MP5 becuase cass is a mana hungry beast unless you play her as I've mentioned above. I've even played Cass Support. You build a little slower but you start with the same two items and you can Bully the bot lane under the towers and free farm CS with NO fear of the jungle gank because as cass support you actually can put out a shit ton of damage.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digi7alTrauma","date":"2014-09-10T10:11:13.521+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long until the servers comeback up from the patch prep?        {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project 0","date":"2014-09-09T23:39:08.300+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Whatsup {{champion:14}} ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuldenDraak9000","date":"2014-09-17T01:41:36.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss old {{champion:69}}...\r\nShe's ruined now for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuro n Shiro","date":"2014-09-10T04:55:36.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol hypercarry Cass when she lost roughly 700 damage overall","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2014-09-09T23:59:14.933+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"can we see the different kits that where tossed around for azir? would love to see how he evolved through out his creation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SouledOne","date":"2014-09-18T04:39:07.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only problem I see with \"late game Cass,\" is MOST assassin mids can dominate early to mid, and still wreck late game.
