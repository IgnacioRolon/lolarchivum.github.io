(Note: Sorry this is a long post, just want to show evidence backing up everything I'm saying as these issues have been going on for 5+ years now and are only getting worse)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe problems with Player Support (PS) not being able to do anything or find someone who can help are a constantly reoccurring theme I see pop up all over the place. The story seems to go something like this: player tries to get help by contacting PS, next PS says they can't do anything, then player tries to get PS to escalate issue to someone who can do something, and finally PS says they can't escalate it or pass it on to anyone who can help. PS does nothing, player gets no help, everyone is left frustrated and sad. See: \"Agents told you eons ago wouldn't truly be wrong at the moment,\" where 'eons ago' is apparently less than 1 year ago (https://i.imgur.com/zEAwfCt.png / https://i.imgur.com/PALcRcq.png).\r\n\r\nSeriously, I see this continually. Like the recent Morgana chroma debacle where a PS person said, \"get used to it / hope u like it,\" when Morgana's chromas were mixed up (https://i.imgur.com/senpEvY.jpg). Or when you try to get clarification over something confusing, like what content is Limited Edition or Legacy or whatever (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8mphk9/why_is_jaximus_a_limited_availability_skin_when/), and get berated by PS saying, \"dude cmon i didnt sign up for this,\" over minor things (https://i.imgur.com/7Jc8UGk.png).\r\n\r\nLikewise, even when PS says they will refer the problem to someone, it is often unlikely you'll ever see it fixed. For example, I've been waiting on the Limited Edition (LE) borders for \"Happy Elf Teemo\" and \"Union Jack Fiddlesticks\" being added for over 2 years now (https://i.imgur.com/xYEG8LP.png / https://i.imgur.com/nU1FRgF.png).\r\n\r\nThen we have major debacles with PS/Rioters saying one thing and something completely different happening. Here are 3 different PS people telling me that a lot of the 2018 Lunar Revel content wouldn't be coming back (Wukong emote, Ruby chromas, Gold chromas / https://i.imgur.com/xpZDUiY.png), something I followed up with non-PS Rioters to clarify as well. Then when the content comes back after I spent over $100 on RP just for that content based on what I was told, I get a \"sadly there's really nothing I can do here\" (https://i.imgur.com/npgCdwp.png)\r\n\r\nYou know what happened the last time Riot said content would \"never come back\" and then it did? Players got an RP refund, an icon, and a special loading screen border (https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/plan-vintage-limited-edition-skins) or at the very least got a special version of the skin (Championship Riven: https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/M3soEg9r-an-update-on-championship-riven / PAX Sivir: https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/neo-pax-sivir-and-epic-capsules)\r\n\r\nIt wasn't like this in the beta. PS worked hand-in-hand with the rest of Riot. I know that can't happen due to the scale of LoL, but you'd think they would at least have a way to escalate key issues. Instead, you have to go to some social media platform, hope your story resonates with people, and get enough traction that some Rioter with influence takes notice and does something about it. Even then it is unlikely. Another example, it's been 5 years since Hippalus and Tryndamere promised to get back to original Limited Edition skin owners better compensation (\"Hip himself is working on additional (longer term) projects that should also help our most dedicated players feel appropriately recognized\" https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1u4317/tryndamere_w_context_on_riot/ceeqzj4/).\r\n\r\nI really want to support Riot Games! I've been following them since early, early closed beta. But the company has really changed from being \"Player Experience First\" to \"do whatever we can get away with\" it seems. From major fiascos within the company to sleazy marketing schemes (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/af8642/the_psychological_manipulation_of_prestige_aatrox/), they've really changed over the years into something I barely recognize... and it hurts when a company I loved keeps doing these things and continuing like they aren't even trying to get better.\r\n\r\nWhew. Okay, so really, who do we contact / what do we do? Why is there no team dedicated to handling escalation and things outside of the norm? We have Rioters whose sole job is about managing talking to Influencers / Affiliates / Partners (https://partners.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/), you'd think they could get someone to deal with the above issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Jasonxhx","date":"2019-05-01T18:02:00.538+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're absolutely correct.

I'm user 2352 and started right after Rammus / Anivia were released and before Veigar. Been around forever and have been playing about 1 game a day since then. I've seen it change over the years as I've been studying the rise of AoS / MOBA games since WC3: TFT came out. Been interviewing people from Riot and other companies for nearly a decade. It is really sad to see that they don't address so many fundamental issues and just keep going forward like nothing is wrong. =/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Artorias1","date":"2019-05-01T03:06:11.873+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":26,"body":"no one is going to read all that buddy","replies":[{"poster":"Stexe","date":"2019-05-01T05:23:33.386+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Artorias1,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=EKZEZzEf,comment-id=001b0001,timestamp=2019-05-01T03:06:11.873+0000)\n>\n> no one is going to read all that buddy\n\nYou speak for everyone?

He has a 46% win rate in all ELOs in support and with this it could only get worst. You're going to kill this champion faster than you've ever done to any other. Playing him support is the only fun I get while playing this game and now I can't even have that. Garbage.

If I'm starting with a {{item:2031}} anyways and I have the perfect amount of gold on my first back to buy {{item:3706}} and {{item:2032}} why would I not want infinite sustain in the jungle? And even if no other champ in the game wants that (I buy it on other junglers too though tbh) why remove it? The only reason I can think of is rito doesn't want junglers to have good extended sustain in the jungle but the commentary certainly doesn't reflect that...
