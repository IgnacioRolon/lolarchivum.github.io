I've go this right so far? Okay, good. So...you're complaining because YOU can't use something that literal MILLIONS of other people can use. Who the actual f*** do you think you are? The center of the universe? Why do you feel that Riot should change something that works for everyone else, just because it doesn't work for you? Riot is already GIVING you a chance to earn skins for free. \r\n\r\nRemoving the champ shards increases the amount of skins you get for free, which in turn forces them to lose more money. What makes you so damn important that you feel like they should ruin some of their profits, which in turn lowers the amount of money that they have for payroll?\r\n\r\nWhat makes you so special that you can't be bothered to deal with champ shards like the rest of us? Why the h*** do you feel so damn entitled to a reward of some kind? You remember what we had before hextech? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You remember how we got free skins? By way of Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, as well as the old reference system (which didn't really work out), end-of-season rewards for gold+ players, and a few other outliers. How many skins is that total? Let's see....3 for social media(and youtube), 2 for references, UFO Corki for making account prior to Jan 2010, Triumphant Ryze tournament skin, King Rammus (CBT), Judgement Kayle, PAX TF/Jax/Sivir, Riot squad Singed, and Championship Riven. I may have missed a couple, but I don't think so.\r\n\r\nThat's a whopping 14. Out of hundreds. And you could only get some of them under special circumstances, and would have to have an account from CBT in order to possibly have all of them. Fourteen skins given away for free pre-Hextech. And now they give away hundreds upon hundreds. Some expensive, some cheap, but all still free. And you're complaining about getting some bad luck. Talk about a selfish, self-entitled, whiny brat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2017-08-10T01:45:07.342+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"@Busty Demoness The point of the game isn't to give you free shit, it's to allow you to have fun. The free shit is just a side bonus. Yes, it is a little useless if you own every champion and obtain a champion shard. That's what you get for grinding the shit out of everything with an MMO mindset and blowing through all the extra benefits of playing the game for the purpose of having fun. There's no point in complaining about getting free stuff you can't use because it's not hurting you, you're just being egocentric and demanding that you, part of \"the 1%\", get special attention seperate from the rest of us. I have been playing League since the first ranked season (2011) around the time Nocturne was released. You're completely right by saying that we cheer on Riot because it's free. Because we have no reason to complain because it's free. It's fucking free so we don't complain. There is no downside. Shut up and have fun with the game like you're supposed to and stop bitching about the small things you don't like.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"seanizL","date":"2017-08-09T19:16:04.119+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think there's a difference between not liking what you got for FREE cause it's \"useless\", and then complaining what you got for FREE and wanting something else.

And also, you can spend freely earned IP on Champion Shards, they're in the shop for 1700, so go spend away. Not everyone in this game is as far along as you are. You've capped off for champs and what not. Using chests is a gamble in the first place. Why would Riot, a company that has employees that they have to pay and want to still make a profit afterwards, make something for cheap, or free because of your _unreasonable amount of IP_, that can easily get you skins that normally cost money? It just doesn't make sense in any regard. If you're gonna complain about it because it's useless, just don't do it.

But riot gave you a way to get all new champs for free on release through the chests.\r\n\r\nnot only that but a chance for some really nice skins. you are focusing only on the negative of a system that you cant take full advantage of. i have currently over 20 champion shards waiting for Ornn to release so i can reroll them to get him. otherwise i would have had to spend 7800 ip for him but now the worst case scenario is i have to spend 5800. so you have a ton of champ shards that are sitting waiting for you to use them on mastery ups or new champs. riot cares deeply about the customer base and is giving people everything they can afford to. this system is perfect for new players. for veterans of the game its just nice to get free stuff that wasnt free for many years","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AllTheOriginals","date":"2017-08-09T18:06:04.227+0000","up_votes":110,"down_votes":9,"body":"I love how almost all of the negative comments are like \"how dare this company based on micro transactions make me pay for awesome content that is purely aesthetics based and serves no true in-game function other than looking cool\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2017-08-09T18:14:56.248+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're gonna make us wait a whole extra daaaaaaaaaaaayy?
