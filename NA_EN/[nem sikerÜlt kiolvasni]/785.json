You could make {{item:2043}} {{item:2044}} {{item:2045}} {{item:2045}} worth a small amount of xp. You could make some areas worth more than others like tri-bush, barron, and drag. You could make everything inside the walls of the home base worth zero XP to discourage people from buying a {{item:2049}}  and just blowing over and over it in the base to gain xp. You could up the price a little to discourage other laners from buying a {{item:2049}}  over a {{item:1026}} or other dmg items. You could also make it so that only people with {{summoner:3}} /{{summoner:11}}  can purchase the {{item:2049}}.

The only really bad thing that can come of it is people all take {{summoner:3}}  and {{summoner:11}}  with {{item:2049}} , Oh NOooo's too much vision..... said nobody ever.....and then the support would actually have to use the damn scanner more regularly as well.

There's really no reason a smart midlaner would ever buy a Sightstone over an AP item (unless they are using a tank midlaner like Cho'gath). Support should always buy a Sightstone, Jungle should regularly buy a Sightstone, and Top should occasionally buy a Sightstone. Also, why are you basically forcing supports to bring Smite/Exhaust? Seems counterproductive to make a bunch of summoner spells, and then forcing one position to take two specific summoners. Especially since in the current meta, Toplaners pretty much only take Flash/Teleport (with very rare Smite/TP and Ignite/TP).

Right now turrets have been made virtually useless. There is so many items and champs that render them completely and utterly useless. They do no damage to champions after level 6 and entire teams can turret dive without any form of a consequence. This has been a continual problem that I and many of my friends on league have seen as a problem with EVERY game  not just a few. This goes for both our team getting dived and our team diving them. Though i do like knowing that I can do this with little to no consequence I also believe it is a completely unfair and unbalanced thing to have implemented.\n\nThe way I believe this can be fixed is by scaling the damage and armor that turrets have to the individual champions attacking it and the current level that they are at when doing so. Instead of have a fixed health of turret and armor of turret, have it be like a champion and level up as they do. That way, though making the game slightly longer, makes the game more skill based and allows people who had issues in the beginning to be able to safely catch up.\n\nThis was put in the game somewhat when you made the second tower give a shield at certain points in the game but was removed later on. I truthfully believe the shield was a bad idea but adding extra damage wouldn't be. It would discourage any of their team from just simply diving turrets to kill you and would give the tank on the team an actual place in team fights due to them also having been rendered useless with the new items and updates in the latest couple of patches.\n\nWhat does everyone else think about this? I think it would be a good idea to do something like this so that it makes the game more challenging and makes you think twice about making that risky move.","replies":[]},{"poster":"platman 101","date":"2015-08-20T17:49:26.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?\n{{champion:7}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"fatjuicypickles","date":"2015-07-02T05:04:24.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its 7/2 wheres le champ\r\n","replies":[]}]}
