Lira- Will once again have to 1v9, so the PTS might not be there. \nG2- #1 objective focus team from last split, like this team were so good at getting towers, dragons etc so taking G2 isn't a bad choice. \nRyu - Overall an ok mid roamer which in the end could lead to some deaths in river and some -PTS, his team goes down, I see him going down as far as PTS are concerned... DUH right. \nOverall B-\n\n\nCHOOPER \nBjergsen / Arrow - Not much to talk about here, expect Arrow's duo in lane Slim Shady, who could have a very \"Gate\" like performance this split. \nExileh - Very underrated player and great pickup. \nWunder/Sven/Olleh all are coming into Summer with HUGE ? as far as what players are we going to get\nAre we going to see the 1v5 Wunder, the counter jungle 24/7 and dying like a fool from Sven and Olleh needing to babysit Cody?  Huge risk \nOverall C- \n\n\nQUICKSHOT \nOverall a good lineup from QS, but I don't know about Ignar from MFS, I think he left the team?\nH2K - Good team/players/ORG etc but holy are they in a tough group, this team will need to be 2X better than what they were last split.  \nMaxlore - IDK, I want to say he will suck but IDK honestly. \nHai - Some games he goes 3 kills 0 deaths and other times he goes 0 kills and like 10 deaths.  \nWouldn't be surprised if Hauntzer and Smoothie are the only players that gives QS consistent PTS. \nZven is great but some games he does shit all, 10/10 on CS PTS tho. \nOverall A-\n\nDRAKOS \n This dude's team will be stacked as far as CS goes \nRekkles and Hjarnan both farmed like 350+ cs per game and Jensen was a little higher than that and Trick's was I think #1 as far as jungles' CS goes.  Doesn't hurt having also Expect/Darshan the EU Ssumday as far as farming goes and AFK splitpushers and the CS monster himself Froggen. \n  Rekkles is a safe player so the deaths won't be higher than 1.9 something per game, Jensen is the same, Hjarnan as well.  \nThis dude has the CS and lowest deaths imaginable. \nOverall A+\n\nMARTELL \nGOT anyone ?  grrrrrrrrr. Now that I have that Viper vs Mountain scene in my head! \nThis guy has a nice team also if I say so myself.  \nThe more Assists that Hylissang gets just means the more deaths.  Like Hylissang will give him like a steady 9 assists for 3-4 deaths so balancing that out is ? for me, his CS is good too for a support tho. \nVizi and Turtle will be 50/50 as far as production goes, similar to Hylissang.  \nPowerofEvil and Sneaky will both do their things getting PTS.  \nGreat top depth with Impact but will Impact falloff some ?  \nJankos pretty much had an all-Star performance last year so expecting much the same. \nOverall A\n\n\nVEDIUS \nhmmm, all over the place with this one I sense. \nKobbe is hmmm, Aphromoo and Alphari are decent pick ups nothing bad, but more upside than downside tho.  \nUOL - I mean runner up to G2 in Playoffs isn't a bad choice either. \nXerxe - Will most likely falloff a bit from his great split from before tho in my opinion and Febiven hasn't looked the same since leaving FNC so maybe a 27 PT average from him or doubled since EU doubles per players or something ?\nTrash was a ? pick up but what are you going to do not fill out your roster\nOverall C+\n\nIf he subs right I think Drakos has this one, if he doesn't win tho I do expect his FULL team to win the most PTS that he has.

Wildturtle early as Flex pick in 6th? ) somehow ended up with a team as good as Vedius one (I'd give Vedius the slicht edge because I think PerkZ+Kobbe > PoE+ Sneaky) given the steals he got here and there, especially on UOL duo and Jankos\n\nDrakos team is in between the top teams and the others, he had likely the best aggregated line-up after the first 3 rounds (Jensen-Rekkles-Trick), then kinda like got lost in the next rounds and wasted the advntage he had...Hjarnan has good value but everyone except Vedius had yet picked up a top tier ADC so it wasn't worth as 4th round pick to take a player away from any other guy as Flex, then picked up Expcet ahead of odoamne in round 5 which is headscratching, preferred Chei to Hylissang as support - I do not agree but is fine I guess - . went for very hit or miss player in CLG top/jgl duo in round 8 and 9 that give him no guarantee as subs before closing surprsingly well with a huge steal in Froggen on the last round\n\nThe other teams are on a lower level, the better team of the other is Quickshot's one, which had straight bad choices in some rounds (Hai 2nd round is bad, Ignar in 7th is bad given he hadn't finished his starter line-up yet with a jungler), but somehow made up for his weaknesses better than the others below (some people let Caps pass, and Broxah/Maxlore are a very good consolation prie at jungle)\n\nChopper come next, as he has a decent team, but went so hard for TSM core (Sven on 4th pick is not good, especially after picking a second midlaner in Exlieh on round 3 as back-up for Bjergsen which was his 1st round pick which he is not likely to sub and with only Quickshot/Phreak weak on midlane, TSM team on 5th round is good but the team was far from complete at that point) that he had to scrap the bottom of the barrel - related to good players/starters - in round 6 to get a top laner in Wunder and in round 7 Olleh - which is a good pick by value in itself - before commodities on known strong teams like Chei and Hylissang is a big act of faith towards IMT performing as a whole (not that I disagree, but no need to take the risk at that point, imho), and at that point he hadn't enough spots to cover himself for every role with subs, leaving jungle without a proper sub for Sven ups and downs and having a relatively weak top lane duo\n\nPhreak is dead last team, imho. Ryu in 2nd round is a bad choice, Contracts in 3rd was taken too high too, the move for G2 team in 4th round was indeed pretty good, but he wasted immediately the good thing he had just done with the very early selection of Biofrost on 5th round when he still had to pick up a top laner, and double it down with Stixxay selection on 6th round which is very good for value, but left him very weak on top laners, and he had to scrap the bottom of the barrel himself with Ssumday and sOAZ in round 7 and 8 which are huge gambles (Dignitas do not seem very good, soaz is known to not perform at his best on RS). Pirean at round 9 to cover for Ryu in mid lane is the worst pick overall in the enitre draft (seriously, Pirean? he won't even start probably and NV is poised to not be much better than what it was in Spring), and a steal like LirA in 10th round (which for example could have helped a ton someone like Chopper or Vedius) is not nearly enought o make up for the bad moves in the draft\n\n\nSurprised no one gambled on someone like Pridestalker or Hans Sama in EU and Reignover or Cody Sun in NA","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrollFan01","date":"2017-05-28T23:18:56.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DL, Bjerg, Sneaky, Jensen, Perks, and Sven, are always safe bets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The","date":"2017-05-31T12:25:34.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"where are krepos picks","replies":[]}]}
