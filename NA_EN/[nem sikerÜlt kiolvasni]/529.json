One of his strongest strengths was being able to block blitzcrank grabs with his W, as well as countering other displacement support/jungle champions (Alistar/Lee Sin/Nautilus). With this W change, drop in late game power with ult cooldown increase, and the removal of face of the mountain's active (an important item for support Ornn to protect ADC's from single target burst), I'm not sure it's worth playing Support Ornn anymore. \r\n\r\nOrnn's W ability to resist displacement was what gave him the ability to counter certain support champions to help his early game support weaknesses in lane. He just feels like a clunkier Nautilus, Alistar, or Leona in the early game bot lane now. It was hard enough to survive the lane phase as Ornn.

The passive item quests were a step in the right direction, it helped supports fulfill the role they were suppposed to do: Tanks had a bit more protection, poke supports were able to trade better, and healers could more easily help their teammates with the movespeed buff. I find these changes are going to hit tank supports worst of all, though. On top of gutting Resolve's health bonus (unless you take Inspiration as your second tree but it's not exactly fair to force every tank support to take Inspiration or get lost), you take away the shield passive AND sightstone (not to mention ruby sightstone). Meanwhile, you guys at Rito HQ think it's a good idea to tie vision to farming? Offensive supports are going to just nuke the tanks that no longer have the protection they used to have, which forces them out of lane. While lets the other team farm more, which gives _the snowballing lane_ a vision advantage? What are we supposed to do to that? When you're playing from behind now at least you could grab sightstone a bit earlier, get some defensive vision out. Now that option is completely gone. The losing lane also loses their ability to give vision to their team while the winning lane has every possible advantage and can snowball even harder than before. Which these changes I might just quit playing support altogether if botlanes are going to be nothing but \"Support\" Luxes and Brands etc. That only get the one support item and build full AP, and are then _rewarded_ with a vision advantage. Botlane is going to be a complete bloodbath, mark my words.\r\n\r\nI hope these changes get reverted ASAP or else Riot just lost a support player.

I don’t play Ornn, I agree fully he is too strong in his current state and that the R CD being raised is a good course of action. But changing his W in this way is encouraging a dps playstyle over a tankier route for Ornn players, and I’m not sure why that was the choice. He’ll lose a lot of survivability against other tops with CC, but still retain his damage potential? I believe Ornn is better served as a utility champ for his team, meaning I would rather see slick play of his W and ult, at the cost of his DPS. A fundamental part of his kit (unstoppable) could be retained for skilled play, and his damage lowered on either his fire spout or the damage done from his brittle passive or even both. \r\n\r\nIunno, maybe I’m alone in this opinion.

I understand that you're trying to make it cheaper and faster for supports to get SSs but completely taking out active items is not the answer, this coming from a support main. I am CONSTANTLY using my Talisman on Rakan or Nami to remove my teammates from bad situations or help them catch an escaping low health enemy. Constantly use Frost Queen's on Sona and Lulu to reveal nearby areas for safety  or to slow down low health champs for my team. I like the idea of making SS less of a hassle to get with other items early game but taking out the essential support items is a stupid idea unless you plan on replacing them quickly with similar items. A lot of supports use the active item procs like Talisman and get a Ruby SS for the vision side. Actually, most supports I know take the active item over the sight item and grab a Ruby SS to compensate for vision. PLUS, Ruby SS has a CDR stat that lets you use all of your active items (what true supports thrive on to sustain their team) much faster, so they're up by every team fight. It really feels like you're trying to push real supports farther out of the meta and bring in more largely damage based AP supports like Lux, Brand, Xerath, etc. (which really arent supports at all, just over glorified midlaners) Supports were fine as is, if you wanted to adjust the SS acquisition rate, you should have messed solely with sightstones or just reduced their gold price or something, what you SHOULDN'T have done was take out vital early items lol ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Admiral Banana","date":"2018-01-24T18:10:54.188+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removing support items is a huge issue.
