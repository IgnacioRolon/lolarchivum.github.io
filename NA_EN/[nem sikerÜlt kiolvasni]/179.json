I assumed it was a legendary skin since back then there weren't many of them and the pricing was higher than 975 and the idea sounded like a legendary. Alas, it was not. You may say 'But why didn't you get a refund then?' well refunds didn't exist back then young one so that rp is lost to the winds of time as is the beautiful particles which it could have been. ps. why can't you borrow the red particles from the thorn skin and just remove the effects of leaves/thorns - seems easy enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legendary Anubis","date":"2015-04-07T21:10:19.309+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed...this update is a little on the lazy side.
