Even though Thresh missed his hook in this fight, his strong zoning presence -- and the constant threat of a potential hook -- allowed him to force Lucian to run in a dangerous direction.\"\r\n\r\nSo I think they did mean to show the part where Thresh missed because they felt he and his missed hook attempt/potential to hook was a factor in that kill that was the start of the comeback.  I, like I think everyone else who watched that video, wish I had read that first and spared myself the time of looking for a mind-bogglingly precise hook that picks off the key player on the opposing team when they were just trying to point out the effect that the threat of such a hook has on the way someone plays.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Visiting","date":"2014-10-08T02:50:06.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This whole post was poorly made.
