On August 17, 2009, OCABR announced that it revised the regulations to emphasize a risk-based approach to security that takes into account an entity's size, scope, and type, available resources, the amount of stored data, and the need for security and confidentiality of consumer and employee information. The revisions also eliminate certain requirements, and clarify that the computer system security requirements, including encryption of personal information stored on laptops and other portable devices, need only be incorporated \"to the extent technically feasible.\" The intent of the revisions is help small businesses that do not handle large amounts of personal information to comply with the regulations. The effective date of the regulations was extended to March 1, 2010 (the effective date was previously extended from May 1, 2009 to January 1, 2010).\r\nIn the commercial e-mail context, the FTC has clarified that offering consumers extra chances to enter a sweepstakes in exchange for an providing an e-mail address for a friend constitutes consideration that brings an e-mail message that might not otherwise be deemed a \"commercial e-mail message\" within the confines of the CAN SPAM Act . Under the CAN SPAM Act, marketers must include in all commercial e-mail messages, among other things, a valid opt-out mechanism, and the sender of the e-mail must scrub the recipient(s) of a commercial e-mail message against its opt-out lists.\" I can only assume that this is just too much trouble for riot, and that Arizona and Quebec have similar policies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"supershooba","date":"2014-10-14T20:54:39.668+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"So ummm, i still have a chance even if i suck?","replies":[{"poster":"Megapurtle","date":"2014-10-14T21:16:56.600+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering an active base of around 10,000,000; and 35 prizes, you still have a chance, though you aren't entering for an easy win regardless.
