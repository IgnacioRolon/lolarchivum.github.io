This dark patience, this savage restraint has always been the core of Veigar's identity to me, being small and helpless but dripping with sadistic glee as the game turns from \"Target the squishy mage!\" to \"OH F*** RUN!!\" The satisfaction of turning a bleak game around, leaving both teams agape with awe at the sudden brutality with which Veigar blossoms, is my favorite thing about League.\r\n\r\nI've been playing Veigar since adc mids stopped being a thing in season 1-2. Not many people played Veigar; it was tough against the increasing number of mids with 2+ dashes and early-game power. You had to be _really good_ just to survive.. but you were rewarded in the end. But people aren't patient. People aren't willing to humbly take their bruises as the darkness grows within them. People want power, _now_. So Veigar sat in the back of the class, and Riot took notice. A buff here, a tweak there, subtle changes to most... but for Veigar players, the loyal ones, occasion to laugh maniacally. Those who took the time to hone their Veigar skill were already good enough, and with each pittance the entire curve shifted upward.\r\n\r\nNow, though...\r\n\r\nThe darkness has been brought to light. For the first time in years, Veigar's made it to the ban list. People fumble through games with the Tiny Master of Evil and accidentally unlock what was once a hidden potential. There is no patience, there is no sacrifice, there is no evil behind the glossy eyes of these porcelain children hopping, skipping, and jumping into what was once a real accomplishment... There is only power, free and accessible, with no trade-off or strategy.\r\n\r\nThe Tiny Master of Evil is now none of these things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Arctic Otter","date":"2016-08-23T18:28:31.803+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Fixed a bug where Leona’s E - Zenith Blade\"....\r\nGo on....\r\n{{champion:89}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePaw3","date":"2016-08-23T18:55:02.299+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:83}} \r\nIt's coming...","replies":[{"poster":"Colorful Dream","date":"2016-08-23T23:31:20.616+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:83}} \r\nCan you feel it?","replies":[{"poster":"Sean Torres","date":"2016-08-24T00:19:06.935+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Are you feeling it Mister Crabs?","replies":[{"poster":"supaguyboy","date":"2016-08-24T01:51:17.211+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:83}} \r\nDo you smell it?

I’d at least reduce his W mana cost to 75. 100 is kind of ridiculous for a champion with a poke pattern and no viable way to itemize mana while also having a level 18 base mana of 858. \n\n_**Malphite changes:**_\nI’m a bit worried that it’s a tiny bit much given that Gnar will be nerfed too. I think other champions like Singed (his late game isn’t good enough for how weak his laning is) and Mundo are in more need of help. Giving him 175 range like Sion, Kench, Garen or Nautilus is a good start. It’s a bit awkward right now considering he doesn’t have any gap closer. Malphite was at least picked in competitive at some point this year. \n\n_**Kog’Maw:**_\nHe’s becoming pretty scary as an ADC when he has a decent team comp. With Sivir and Jhin nerfed (and the fact that mid-game ADCs like Corki aren’t really good), Kog may be a tad too strong for competitive. The rework pretty much ruined him as a mid laner and that basically deleted the champion for 1/3 of Kog players even though he was played AP for every season before the rework. He used to be my favorite champion. This is a good opportunity to tone down his W bot ADC style while making his mid-lane more viable. People loved Kog before for his long range and spammable ult., that was his iconic skill and what was interesting. Attacking really fast isn’t interesting to me and I still miss my Kog mid even to this day. Xerath, Ziggs, Vel’Koz are all intersting in their own right but they can’t fullfill the AP Kog fantasy.\n\nHe was basically a glass cannon poke machine with extremely high DPS and range but even less CC than Ziggs. His DPS was also fantastic but heavily gated by mana. Right now, the only way to try and play him AP mid is as a burst champion with some mediocre poke. You basically have to land E to do anything and that makes him terrible.  There are just infinitely better combo champions who also have good CC and teamfight ults. (Vel’Koz for example) as well as way stronger laning. AP Kog isn’t even a hypercarry anymore imo. \n\n_**Mage changes:**_\nVery welcome buffs for Veigar and Orianna. I think it’s just enough to make them worth picking situationally. I expected some sort of Brand buff but I guess that was scrapped. It did seem a bit overkill on the PBE but that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t get a smaller buff. Ziggs is also on the cusp of being worth picking but still gets outclassed too much by Viktor, Anivia, Vel’Koz, LB, Taliyah, Aurelion Sol etc. in most team comps. The mana regen changes hurt all pure poke mages and Ziggs just doesn’t have enough reliable damage or CC to justify being picked. I know he can do more damage to structures than other champions but winning a teamfight with a Vel’Koz ult. or Anivia burst and control will get you that turret even more rapidly. His W AP ratio is pathetic for its CD and while his Q does have a low CD, it’s also going to miss almost every time. The safest buff is to the W AP ratio since even a large W ratio won’t suddenly make him OP due to it being his only escape and on a low CD. However, I’d rather have 5% more AP ratio on Q. I don’t think Ziggs’ late game is actually all that good. The only reason people thought so was because he used to farm side lanes with his ult. and also just sat mid waveclearing without roaming. Thus, he’d reliably get a lot more gold than his opponents and have better items. It was his farming and not his scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2016-08-23T22:04:10.398+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"So... I can haz...

Fine, I get that. But her tunnel CD at rank 1 was already 20 seconds. That is NOT a short time. Even post-nerf, Gragas's now Bodyslam CD is STILL shorter than Rek'Sai's tunnel pre-nerf. Furthermore, Vi's Vault Breaker ALSO already had a CD that was shorter than tunnel, and yet that's getting buffed. It's only getting buffed to be equal to Bodyslam's new CD, so I'm not complaining about the buff or the length of Vault Breaker's CD, but it seems disingenuous to claim that Rek'Sai tunnels too much early when even without the nerf she still had a longer CD on her mobility skill than everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Taint Misbehavin","date":"2016-08-23T21:22:31.245+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"her tunnels provide a ton more mobility than either Gragas or Vi.  not only can you cover more ground than the others', particularly passing under wider walls than the traditional dashes will let you.  they are also semi-permanent.  you can ult to them from anywhere on the map, as well as use them to gap-close or wall-pass without even having to press W again, giving her unparalleled mobility in the jungle.
