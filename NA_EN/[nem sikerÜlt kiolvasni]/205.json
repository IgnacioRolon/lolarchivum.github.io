The responses I have seen are pretty bad excuses too. One game in particular, 3 people ganged up on him and kept saying \"MIA's are no longer needed because they are only to be used in the laning phase\"... He showed me this and questioned them and I told him straight up that they are full of it. For instance, if 1 person is up top fighting 1 enemy up top, then the enemy runs off at full health and you don't call MIA, with the amount of time you look at the minimap compared to dealing with your own problems, you are not going to notice the enemy vanish. The sooner you know he vanished, the better! MIA's are still useful throughout the entire match. On another note, in pretty much all of his matches, there were literally no pings on the minimap, with the exception of a couple of matches.\r\n\r\nMy friend was trolled in a lot of the matches he was in and he decided that it wasn't worth another 15 minutes of his life to deal with them, so he closed League of Legends. Now, you might think that this is punishable, but if I recall, one of the rules of pardoning or punishing someone in the Tribunal is that if it is a reaction to a negative teammate, then they are to be pardoned, but since I have last used the Tribunal, it now has it as;\r\n\r\n\"Why doesn’t Riot post a list of rules for what you can be banned for?\"\r\n\r\nbut I have also found;\r\n\r\n\"There is never a reason for you to be negative or insult someone. It doesn't matter if you have 3 people leave your match. It doesn't matter if Teemo is 1/9001 in a 5 minute game. It doesn't matter if xyz champ did abc bad idea. It also doesn't matter if someone is insulting you for an entire match. YOU are responsible for YOUR behavior.\"\r\n\r\nbut this is what it used to say prior to that;\r\n\r\n\r\n\"4. When should I be voting to Pardon?\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of times where reported players should be pardoned.\r\n\r\nPlayers who are celebrating, but not intending to be offensive.\r\nPlayers who are playfully quipping at one another.\r\nSomeone who is reacting to another player’s repeated badgering or insulting behavior.\r\nPlayers who are not responding to other players or do not speak the language, but otherwise aren’t displaying any negative or strange behavior.\r\nPlayers who display poor performance, but do not appear to be intentionally feeding or otherwise disrupting gameplay.\r\nPlayers who cease their negative behaviors and/or apologize when another player informs them that they have taken things too far and asks them to stop. \"\r\n\r\nYou might also say \"Well, there is a mute button\", but the thing is, is that the mute button prevents you from communicating with your team and the Tribunal FAQ page even covers that the mute button should not be needed \"\r\nWhy is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?\".\r\n\r\nPeople queue up and troll together. Kind of sucks for players and Riot Games. If I come across these people, I will report them because they are Toxic to Riot themselves by possibly turning away potential customers and other reasonable players.\r\n\r\nPre-game chat would be nice to see in the logs...

That's true. But calling MIA is simple and effective so why the heck not? If \"good\" players don't need MIA pings, then what's the point?

You can just create another email, another account. So yeah, so far, the tribunal has done nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am glad Riot is stepping up to the plate here a bit, considering that they're also looking at the LB system. If someone gets dced because of internet trouble or a power outage, there's not much that that person can do. And on another note, if you're doing everything you can in a game and no one is listening and they're just feeding and trolling away and wasting your time, then it ought to be noted that that situation right there IS a legitimate reason for you to leave that game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to be able to be part of this where I can help get rid of more toxic players /permanently/. Perhaps after this update, more people will actually start caring and start stepping up to the plate of fighting these toxic players. I might be judging on Tribunal more often, who knows? Point is, all this trash about the toxic players isn't really Riot's fault, but more so the community's itself.
