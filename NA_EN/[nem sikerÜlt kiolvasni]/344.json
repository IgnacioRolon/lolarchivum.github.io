Of course no discredit to Jensen however I don't believe his KDA and amount of kills actually gauge his ability to perform better than Bjergsen. For example, Jensen beat every mid laner this split EXCEPT Bjergsen. Jensen puts his team on his back because there is no other potential carry that can carry as hard as him however Bjergsen shares his glory with both top and bot. If TSM feels top can snowball pretty hard they out Hauntzer on the carry and play through him forcing Bjergsen to play Galio. If bot has the upper hand they'll snowball Doublelift to become a late game fighting beast (example Game 2 vs CLG). In any case, I believe Bjergsen should be MVP of this split and he also has 4 more PoG awards over Jensen on a team that has both Hauntzer and Doublelift that could potentially fight Bjergsen for that award. Jensen is a monster, Bjergsen is on a different level.","replies":[{"poster":"Wootzitnator","date":"2017-08-08T13:15:53.527+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have valid points, I think though one could argue differently depending on school of thought. Because Jensen puts the team on his back, in a way that makes him more valuable. If Bjerg doesn't deliver in the mid-lane, they still have viable options to win a game. However the immense pressure Jensen exerts from his lane enables his team to win, if he doesn't deliver, C9 loses the game, in essence making his performance more valuable to the team. Jensen is able to do this without jungle assistance as well, freeing up his jungler to bail out another lane, or to gank for him and snowball him harder. As far as the head-to-head match up goes, the first TSM-C9 series they were relatively equal in lane, and the wins came down to map play/side-lanes losing. The second series though, largely swung on solo kills in the mid-lanes, which Jensen won twice to Bjergs 1.  Yes, Bjergs play and decision making is unparalleled, and he does so many things that are not quantified, but in my opinion Jensen's mechanics in lane and raw power outside of it are as well, coupled with the fact that C9 relies so heavily on him to pull out the victory, imo, that makes him MVP.

While there top laners have been poor this split and Sneaky has not been his normal self, Smoothi and Contractz have stepped up a ton and definently fight Jensen for those awards.

The fact that Jensen is never seen as the clear MVP, to me means he has not had a stand out season strong enough to make everyone see him as the clear MVP of the season. If he gets the MVP this season it would almost feel like a consolation prize. Im sure Jensen would much rather have a split where he is clearly THE MVP, now don't get me wrong Jensen is a phenomenal  player and I think he is only going to get better. The numbers he had this season were crazy, so his MVP is soon in the works but considering Arrow got MVP last season I guess Jensen can too.

Obviously that person is going to be Bjerg. He has made every single finals and is the best NA player over the last 3 seasons. However, this split Jensen had a better kda by 2, over 50 more kills, and had more solo kills on bjerg. In the NBA Westbrook won MVP, because he had an insane season and broke the triple double record. Everyone would still rather have Lebron on their team, but he didn't win, because Westbrook went out of his mind. If every MVP was chosen by who would you pick first on your team, Bjerg would win litterally everytime, because of his past record. However, the MVP of the summer split is supposed to only take into account the summer split, which is why for me Jensen clearly demonstrated he deserves this award.

While Jensen did solo kill Bjergsen in two games, Bjergsen got solo kills of his own, and still played better mid lane over the whole of the C9>TSM series.\r\nSo no, Jensen did NOT beat EVERY mid laner this season. He styled on and bodied many a lesser midlaner, but Bjergsen still stands a tier above them all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PossumElite","date":"2017-08-09T20:16:32.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me start this off by saying that I like Bjergsen and I don't like Jensen (Look into Jensen's League history before the LCS and you'll understand why I've never been a fan).\r\nWith you now knowing my bias, I'm still adamant that Bjergsen deserves this award. It's lame because he's won so many already, but it's true.\r\nKDA and Kills are a cool stat, but they really don't mean much in the long run if you aren't winning games. Kills can be over hyped, but skewed by the fact that you can get a toooon of kills in a single game (Only resulting in ONE game win) and KDA elevated by not getting killed in game losses (Which while it's cool, still results in a team loss).\r\nIn my opinion Player of the Game awards are a VERY good stat for deciding MVP. That's because you can only get an award if your team WINS, and it shows that you had the most to do with that win.\r\nSo Bjergsen's 12 vs Jensen's 8 says something. If you look at last split, there were multiple people close to eachother at the top of the list (Someone has 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9, etc..). This split Bjergsen has 4 more awards than any other player......\r\nTo those saying that Jensen is the only reason C9 is winning games, and throws the team on his back, while that happens sometimes, it's often the other way too.\r\nWhile Jensen does carry a lot, Sneaky and Contractz are instrumental in sooo many wins as well.\r\nLooking at POG awards: Jensen has 8, Sneaky has 7, Contractz has 5, while on TSM: Bjergsen has 12, followed by his whole team at 5, 5, 4, 4.\r\nWhile Sneaky has had some really shaky games this split, he's also hard carried a ton as well.\r\nAnd to answer those saying that Jensen crushed Bjergsen in their second series this split. You are wrong, and should look at PROPER stats before saying wrong stuff.\r\nHere's the CS differences at 20 which is a very telling stat to lane pressure/dominance: G1 (C9 up 500g): Bjerg +24, G2 (TSM up 3k): Jensen +6, G3 (C9 up 3k): Bjergsen +29. The fact that Bjergsen is up more than 20 cs @20 minutes, in two games that their team is behind in gold is actually just ridiculous.\r\nAs far as solo kills go, Bjergsen solo killed Jensen in game 1, had two successful roams before Jensen, took Jensen's turret solo while Jensen has his first successful roam, and ended up carrying the game (And receiving POG) while Jensen got caught out of position time after time.\r\nIn game 2 and 3, Jensen got an early solo kill on Bjergsen in both games (Good on him, they were pretty impressive kills). BUT Bjergsen still kept up in CS (Game 2), or dominated in CS (Game 3), he still roamed MUCH better than Jensen as a whole across the series, and even though C9 won game 2 and 3, the POG awards went to Sneaky and Contractz respectively who each played a much more definitive role in the win than Jensen. (In game 2 Sneaky's damage was off the charts and he carried teamfights pretty hard, while Jensen and Bjerg's damages were equal, and game 3 Jensen played pretty trash the entire game AFTER his solokill with Lucian and got caught out SO many times).\r\nAll in all, Jensen's play style is very much like his flub at the Championship Game 5 between C9 and TSM last split. He's usually a monster in lane and can play mechanically amazing, but his positioning in late game fights needs soooo much work, and his getting caught out has led to many a team loss. He's comparable to a mid lane version of Doublelift.\r\nALSO considering Bjergsen's shotcalling ability vs Jensen's just puts Bjerg in that whole other tier.\r\nThe only reason people were so hyped about those solo kills on Bjergsen is because that is a very rare and impressive feat! But watching the rest of the games showed Bjergsen as a far better player.\r\nAnd all this isn't even touching on the fact that Jensen tilts much harder when things aren't going well.\r\nI know Bjergsen has won so many MVP's and it would be dope for Jensen to finally get one (Even though he's regarded as one of the most toxic players of all time, used to DDoS people in Solo Queue, and was let into the LCS when facing 3 lifetime bans (Look up the youtube video Infamous League Players - C9 Jensen)), this isn't the split it should happen.\r\nBjergsen deserves MVP.\r\nRant = over.","replies":[{"poster":"Wizzer Saves","date":"2017-08-10T00:56:01.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"..don't mean much in the long run if you aren't winning games. \r\nYou say this then go on to spout how g2 and g3 c9 wins help prove that berj is better? You can say that wins matter, or you can say that stats matter, but you cannot say both are most important only when Ber-godsend has them.\r\nAlso I do not think your claim on Jen-sama beeing 'always out of position' is reflected in his stats (or observable game play, but that is subjective so i will stick with stats.) KDA is a huge indication of positioning, and Jensen's is statistically the best. That does not mean he is the best at positioning in the game but it is a strong indicator that his positioning in late game fights likely does not need soooo much work.\r\nI looked up who Incarnation was when he signed on to C9, I hated it because I though someone who was so disrespectful of competition would not be anyone that I could root for. I do now though, you know why? Because that happened 4 years ago, when he was an 18 year old kid back in season 3 and I am not sayingt hat time makes things better but he has been playing for c9 for two years now and just hasnt been that guy. Do you honestly think that C9jensen 2017 @ age 22 with no indicators of poor attitude or sportsmanship is the same as incarnation 2013 @ 18 years old ddosing people because he is frustrated at a game?  If you think thats who Jensen is still then I can defiantly see why you wouldn't like him for MVP. If not then bringing it up is not relevant.\r\n\r\nBerj shot calling is a definite point and he is a godly mid laner, but I dont think MVP is about wins, and I don't thing MVP should be about player of the games (that you can only get on a winning team)  I do not think that Jensen is necessarily going to win MVP and I will not think that he got robbed if Berj gets it. I think that if either of those two mid laners win it it will not be because Berj won more games and it will not be because Jensen had more kills, it will be because a considerable delegation decided that one or the other was more valuable as a player.

The community was pretty outraged when it happened, and I thought it spoke pretty badly on the Riot members making the call, considering they had chosen to perma-ban him many times, then giving him an opportunity that so many players crave for. Even if his skill put him above others, if he's permanently banned from a game, that should ban him from ever increasing his skill or showcasing it. Riot made a reasonable and fair decision (Permabanning for toxicity and DDoSing), then completely went back on it because they thought he was talented. I've never been DDoSed by someone before, but imagine if you were one of the targets of him, and then shortly after find out Riot is letting him be a celebrity?\nNow I will agree that Jensen's seemed to be really good these last few years, but I still think it sets a real bad precedent and shows Riot isn't fully committed to consequences.\n\nAnd in regards to your other stuff, fair. You make good points, and I am pretty biased.\n\nThough Riot did just release information on a new stat called adjusted DPM which takes into account a ton of factors more than regular DPM (Such as what champions players use, if they were winning and losing, how often they had opportunities to deal damage, etc...) and it showed Bjergsen scoring much higher than Jensen.\nNot that this new stat is perfect by any means, but many were surprised that Jensen scored so low compared to his normal off the charts DPM.\nI'd assume some possible factors for it are: Jensen mostly plays carry/damage champions while Bjerg is sometimes placed in a supportive role for DL or Hauntzer; both of their ability to play well from behind (This stat puts more weight on damage done from behind over damage done when you're put in a good position to do damage), and in general, how their damage stacks up vs others in every region who are on the same champion, in the same situation.\nOnce again, not a perfect stat, but definitely more telling than stats like DPM or Kills.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2017-08-08T00:00:13.313+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The diagram shows Jensen at 256 kills during the split... yet it says he got 229 in the interesting facts.
