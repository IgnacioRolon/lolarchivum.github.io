I am sitting on a dodge timer, for no other reason then I couldn't lock in my ban for the 3rd time today. Chat works fine. My entire connection works fine. I refuse to have chrome open, spotify, I have even turned off STEAM. If I get disconnected for even a second, Champ select COMPLETELY locks down, and can take upwards of 7 min to catch back up. I left it up once just to see if it would catch up and kick me out. 40 minutes later, It didn't and I had to restart League. I know this is a connection issue, I have used your Connection repair troubleshoot tool thing, and what I was told was, \"Well just make sure nothing else is running while you play\" NO F~~~~ DUH. If Riot could please look into making champ select code more adaptable, that would be great. I will obviously get dc'd in champ select just cause my ISP decides to run a different pathway, and not because of anything I have done. This issue has become a lot more prevalent in recent months.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T21:36:28.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeaaaa that does really suck when that happens =\\ . Let's make sure we troubleshoot this in some custom or practice games before hopping back in any matchmaking queues. \n\nYour internet connection is probably fine, but there might be some issues with how your ISP is routing your connection if nothing seems to be helping. Let's grab your latest network logs from a game that had connection issues, and pop them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).
