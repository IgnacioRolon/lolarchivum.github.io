It should be the **Y** key for you, unless you made any customizations to those options.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Greencard l","date":"2016-12-31T16:45:38.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you are referring to is its normal function. It snaps back to your champion when you hit spacebar. Since you just came back from a break I would check out your keybindings and make sure they are updated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judgejudyx","date":"2016-12-30T05:56:00.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YEs im set it to spacebar. I use it often what im telling you is that everytime i click on minimap to see somewhre else if my camera is locked it pans back to my character instantly. And this has never been  a thing before. I took a 4 month break so this had to be a relatively recent change. Its really screwed me over as its a big help /habbit. Pre whatever change riot made if I clicked somewhere on amp it would show where on map it is and auto unlock camera til i lock it again to pan back to my champion.","replies":[]}]}
