Only when I go to install the new client now directly through the launch menu, I click upgrade now and nothing happens. So when I click 'launch' (thegame) it says something isn't working and I must retry, but that pop up happens every time so I have to reinstall my client again completely for me to access the game. Any ideas on the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T19:43:13.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your PC isn't allowing the patcher to prepare for the updated client, so nothing's happening.
