I have noticed that about 25% of players that play League should probably be banned from playing_** Ranked**_. Its not that I don't want them to play, but just not in _**Ranked**_. I think that if a player is found to have committed a reportable offense in_** Ranked**_ games, that they should be banned from _**Ranked**_ play for the remainder of the current split. I just feels like a lot of people don't take _**Ranked**_ seriously. Honestly, I don't think a player should be able to play a _**Ranked **_game with a champion that isn't mastery level 4 or above. This season has been the worst so far, with players AFKing 5 minutes in almost _**1 out of 5 games**_. I'm tired of the developers only caring about the Pros these days and not the people that actually spend money on the game. Please Riot figure out a way to ban players from _**Ranked**_.","replies":[{"poster":"Articus43","date":"2019-02-04T01:15:26.250+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the inherent problem with this is that it further capitulates the idea that norms can't be serious. I play normals sometimes and play to win. Even though it's not as upsetting to lose a norm than a ranked game, I see a lot of people use the \"it's just norms\" defense to grief or stop trying.\n\nThere's also a large population of players who only play norms. I don't know the statistical difference, but if you banned a **toxic** person from ranked I'd bet they're just going to take the same toxic mentality to norms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-02-04T00:13:37.457+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they are proven to be griefing, why not just 14-day ban them regardless of game mode?","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Urameshi","date":"2019-02-04T00:22:45.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Here's how I see it. If Riot was to ban a player for the entire split (from Ranked only) they would be far less likely to bother someone again after their ban, because they couldn't climb in rank until the split is over. Then if they did it again their account would just drop to Iron IV and have to climb out all over again. No one wants to do that. So i would think if you get banned at Gold III you'd probably be Silver IV or Bronze I by the next split.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-02-04T20:46:57.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think we need a \"casual\" mode for players that refuse to play to win.\nThey can stay there and anyone who wants to win can play in the competitive modes. That includes draft and ranked.\nNormal game modes should not be considered non-competitive. Nothing in the rules states it. And if there is a victory screen (unless specifically stated otherwise), it is competitive. Especially when winning or losing directly changes your rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-02-05T00:54:43.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...
