So now I played 1 ranked game but I wonder if that is enough? How many ranked games do I need to play til I can be active again. I've looked on the LoL information and support page  but none of those sites have the answer to my question.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T16:53:38.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to ranked decay, it will depend on your current tier.  Bronze to Gold does not decay, but upon Platinum you have about 28 days.  More info is also available in our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h3q1).  I hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[]}]}
