This renders him unable to invite / chat. He tried searching the problems up, we've been trying for a solid hours. We have tried stuff like deleting a certain folder/file | Reinstalling | clean reinstall | force patch | changing the date 1 day back and forth.... Etc etc... So if anyone knows a solution or a possible fix pls tell :p{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-11T20:15:18.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so strange!
