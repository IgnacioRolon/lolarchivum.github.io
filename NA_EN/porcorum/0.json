Yes you were quoting someone and it's ridiculous, but no need to lie and say it's because you asked if someone was a duo. Don't lie. Just say it's because \"I quoted someone calling me a f6t in champ select\".\n\nI remember saying it seems like an attention seeking act and I kinda felt like an asshole for saying that because it's saying you just wanted attention. Now I find you in other threads talking about it? An honor thread, and you mention your ban? Lol I guess I was right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2017-07-29T07:19:06.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it today as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-07-29T02:43:17.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people (including me) just got honor level 3 today, so either there was a timer on how quickly you can rise in honor level that just ticked off today, or there was a hidden issue with the honor system that was preventing people from earning it that just got patched.\n\nAnyways, I'm just happy I can start grinding Honor Capsules for Grey Warwick! ^3^\n\nP.S.
