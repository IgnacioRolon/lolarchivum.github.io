You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Do your best to not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n3. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n4. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T23:19:52.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Eddy dicck6packs,\n\nYou may want to check to see if there is an expiration date on the card. If there is it will be in itty bitty tiny numbers. \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
