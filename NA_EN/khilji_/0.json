So I downloaded the installer and installed the game. But when I tried to open the client, it flashes \"Pvp.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\". I've checked out previous threads before and did all the granting permissions stuff. I've ran it as an administrator and all. It doesn't seem to work. I would be very much grateful if the people here could help me!

Are you sure that your firewall is not interfearing in any way? Try disabling it for like 5 min. If you have W10 instaled (especially with creators update already applied), try to run installator as W7 application.\n\nRemember that checking box \"run this application as administrator\" is not the same as rightclicking it and going for option \"run as administrator\" from drop down menu. Try both ways anyway. If those wont help we will try to run it with UAC dissabled in your system, thou i would hardly recommend checking firewall first.\n\nU can try (just for the sake of it) going to \"Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system\" there is our kernel, rightclick it and in program properties in compatibility bar check box \"run as administrator\" on the very bottom.

I have tried all these solutions, sadly to no avail. I really hope I'm not the only one having the problem and I hope riot fixes this asap. I would really love to get back into the game. \nAlso worth mentioning is that it used to work fine in the same system and the same os (literally 2 months ago).

If those are some problems on RIOT's end then there is nothing one could do. Anyway if things wont get better soon i will try to find some other solution.","replies":[]}]}
