The name is DrtyTrouserSnake and I honestly don't see how this is offensive, it discretely implies something sure, but I don't believe it is super obscene. Why am I getting a forced name change all of a sudden? It's been almost 3 years and I've grown so attached to the name it isn't right to force me to change it especially since it was probably reported by some pre-made who lost a game and Riot's \"great\" punishment system kicked in. If any Rioters are there, can you explain to me why I have to be forced to change my name after such a long time?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T22:40:06.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm guessing that name was most likely reported enough times for the system to pick up on a sexually explicit name that was cleverly crafted in order to not be picked up. In cases like yours, the name can be flagged if it gets reported enough times.","replies":[]}]}
