I am most often very positive and friendly in game and get consistent honors each game. I really am at my {{item:3091}}  of why I haven't hit honor 3 yet. I know that everyone's rate is different, but when almost everyone I play with is 4 or 5 and I get more honors than them, I really don't understand it. So please, if there is Rioter there, can you please give me a legitimate reason on why I haven't hit honor 3? I really am getting sick of contacting Riot and getting a copy-paste response. Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T01:20:20.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you're seeing plenty of other Honor rank 3's and 4's, that doesn't necessarily mean you should be there already as well. There's a good chance other people have simply been playing more games or getting honored more often. Keep playing and you're sure to rank up eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"UchıhaItachı","date":"2017-08-31T01:26:40.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you guys help me too from there ,my connection isnt good and ıt ısnt about where ı am.Its's attack my game wıth Turk people thank you !!","replies":[]}]}]}
