I have consistently play league at least 20-25 games a week since the new honor came out, I almost always get 1-2 honors every game and I'm still honor level 2. My duo's/trios are honor level 5 and they play in the same games as me. I don't understand how I haven't hit honor level 3 yet and I don't want the copy-paste \"You'll get it at your own pace\" because at this point it is really frustrating that I consistently get honored yet I see toxic people with honor level 4 or 5. I really am amazed at the fact that I haven't hit level 3 yet, I don't understand why, its really ridiculous and honestly unfair to me. I control myself in game because I believed I would earn my honor level, but it seems that being nice and honorable doesn't get me anywhere, but toxic players can get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-22T01:13:46.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe I also answered this about a month ago for you, but I did go ahead and check again. The only reason you aren't ranking up as fast as your friends is because they're playing more games, and being honored more often. Your progress is still on track, you just need to give it more time and not compare your progress with others. Other people play a different amount of games, and get a different amount of honors, so their progress is in no way linked to yours.\n\nYou're still getting the amount of honor you should be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-09-22T00:59:07.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your pre-made users honor you, you won't get the full Honor progress. You don't need any help, you will get Honor 3 sooner or later, just be patient and just play. It took me around 2 months to get Honor 3.","replies":[]}]}
