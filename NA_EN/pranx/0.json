Now it seems that i have to cast fear immediately after my ult lands or it won&#039;t work.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a workaround?\r\n\r\nIt used to be i could start channeling my ult and then cast fear so that when i finished channeling and blinked it would automatically cast it right away. When paired with flash this made fid ults actually feel strong and that i could land my fear on intended target.\r\n\r\nNow it seems that even when im smartcast spamming my fear there is still that half a second of delay that ezreals or leblanc or whoever can easily blink out of range.","replies":[]}
