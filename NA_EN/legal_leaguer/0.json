I went back through years of forum posts to try to find the solution. I've tried flushing the DNS, tried fixing the DNS to the google system. Tried the documents altering then reverting it all back again. I played two games and won them both as support and top dominating. I had zero reason to leave, and yet Riot's leavebuster system automatically flags me. I finally wait 20 minutes, get into a game, and then someone on the other team isn't in so we have to remake. Now I have to sit here for 20 more minutes? Again? I'm on a road trip for business trying to relax Riot; if I wanted to get screwed I'd go down to Bourbon Street in the French Quarter that I'm visiting >.&lt; \r\nIf anyone has an up to date, surefire way to prevent this, let me know. \r\nAnd also any advice on how to get riot to respond to tickets faster. I hate losing LP and games when I'm the last person that would ever afk intentionally. I'm the type that believes there shouldn't even be a surrender at 20 in ranked option. I'm THAT guy.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance all, and I hope I can even get into the rift\r\n\r\n-A\r\n\r\nPS: It's a hotel but I'd bought the extra high speed wifi and literally everything else was working fine. So there were no connection interrupts, and resetting anything is a no go.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T04:33:31.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man I'm pretty jealous, I haven't been on Bourbon Street since I moved away from my home state of Louisiana!! Try your best to keep dem cajuns in line while you're there, or just join in on the fun xD!\n\nIt definitely sucks that you were hit with a leaverbuster on your vaca =\\ . Let's see if we can get that fixed up relatively quickly and get you back on Rift. I've got your account pulled up and it looks like something was going on with that hotel networks connection which was causing you to get kicked out of games around the 3 min mark. \n\nSince you're running off a hotel wifi, there's a pretty good chance that the main issue is just that. I can only assume that there's a lot of traffic on that network, and sometimes they do limit your bandwidth as well, which could be the cause of those disconnects. Without being able to mess with the network settings, it's going to be pretty hard to troubleshoot this, not to mention that there's never a surefire way to fix tech problems as there are just too many things that can go wrong at any given time. I'd really suggest going through all the other steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), well as many as you can without having access to that network.","replies":[]}]}
