Regardless I hope we can overlook that and into a problem I just recently (within the past few days, and probably a resultant of the most recent patch). I can open the client, and can login successfully, I can even start a queue and enter champ select. However, upon leaving champ select and going into what should be the loading screen, all I get is a black screen that never loads. On top of this I cannot alt+ tab or anything out of this screen, and my only option is to manually shutdown the Mac. The most interesting part of this is that apparently the game does not consider this is that I have scoured the discussion boards for fixes and other people who are currently in a similar situation and about 4 months ago there was an almost identical problem that other people were having, not being able to load into a game of any kind, and specially on Mac. Last time, there was a fix a few days after, which I am praying for but I am just hoping to be heard, even though, yes I am on a Mac. \r\n\r\nHopefully there can be a resolution soon, I just bought some new skins !","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-19T06:04:10.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dualboot windows, everything is broken since Catalina, and it does not look like Riot wants to fix shit for Apple if they cant preserve basic compatibility.","replies":[{"poster":"spinplexity","date":"2020-01-19T06:17:19.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only I knew how to do that :/ , and on top of that, nota week ago it was running smoothly.
