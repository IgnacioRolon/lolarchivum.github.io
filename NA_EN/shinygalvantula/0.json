I'm guessing the girl took it from me when i was _charmed_, someone help me! i need the 14 more coins**(RP)** to play the games at the arcade,(_Looking to buy Arcade Ahri_) I'm so close to beating the high scores of 'Blitzcrank's Poro Roundup' If anyone has any leads on this criminal tell me or the officers up in Piltover and bring her to justice!\r\nShe looked Ionian, and as i said earlier she had fox ears and for whatever reason purple hair. Send all information about this evil doer to Vi and Caitlyn and to me so we can put an end to this foxy character.\r\n\r\n_I'm not sure if y'all still top off people who need very little RP, but if you still do it would be very appreciated, thanks for making my favorite game and have a good day :D_","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T22:30:42.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ShinyGalvantula,\n\nThis is Lieutenant Graves.
