Yes the chat logs shows me saying things and makes it seem like I'm the bad guy. I apologize for the Toxic behavior but i feel like this action is unjustified Im not the greatest player in this amazing game you guys have but i try my best, you sometimes get those players who nag you on and call you bad just because you made a wrong play or move. i wish you could relook at the game that i got permabaned by and see that i did not start anything i was playing passively I was in a good mood i was so happy today then i came across a player who called me names and just argued with me the whole game and then told other to report me. I did as i was told to by a friend and i muted the person who was getting my angry and i also reported them for putting me down but then 30 minutes later i was permabaned i hope that someone can get back to me i would hate to stop playing this game that i fell in love with i just spent some of my first paycheck on this game monday and i was happy i unlocked my very first adc character can you please talk to me I promise to not to get into any arguments that would jeopardize my account again\r\n\r\n-Dezmen","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T00:51:26.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up some of those past chat logs so I could get a better picture of what was happening in that game. I do see where some of the things that were said could be taken pretty negatively, and there's a pretty good chance that the others it was directed at reported you. If you need to get more context as to what exactly got you banned, you should be able to review your reform card on the client or shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to open that discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"iDezy","date":"2017-07-12T00:19:00.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Broporo, Do you think that there is any other punishment i could get instead if a perm ban that is reasonable for my punishment? i truly love this game and i don't want to quit it this early. Is there like a mute for players or even like an amount of games i have to play to talk or something?","replies":[]}]}]}
