And after reconnecting again this issue came up again in 2 min or so. and this time we were unable to even log in. after 5 min of waiting we finally reconnected and we reached just in time to see our nexus exploding. so yea i wish that you guys can make it so that me and my teammates do not lose lp for that match. and since i was in a promo series i hope you can take that one loss away. And there was another guy \"SirIronBeard\"(also an indian player\" who was in a different game at that time but i contacted him and he had the same issues as well. i hope u do look into this. Yours respectfully, theguyinbronze1.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T21:52:16.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you and your teammates experienced this issue, it's likely to have been a local or regional issue.
