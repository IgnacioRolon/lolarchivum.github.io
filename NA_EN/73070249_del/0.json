Yet my ping sat at 600 and I was harassed and abused in-game for having 600 ping. All the possibilities I've taken in advance to make certain there would be no in-game issues. And now I get punished/warned for it when I have no control over it and my team threatened to report me for telling them I was 600 ping and was not sure why when previous games were constant 80-85 ping, and speed tested before starting the match it was the same ping. I feel like I've been wrongfully punished as I had no control over the situation and yet I spend my money that I earn on a game where I get punished for that? Seriously? This is ridiculous, I understand it wouldn't be fair to the other players in the game but I took precautions before the game started and I still got punished.. Riot please at least reply or take my punishment off because I wasn't greifing or afking on purpose, I wouldn't be sadistic and do that to other people because I already know what it's like to have someone afk on purpose and it's not fun sitting in a game for 20 minutes or longer because of an afker. Also it has nothing to do with my computer specs because I haven't had issues until today and this one match.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T16:20:33.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If other players are griefing you in-game, use the /mute or /mute all to prevent any further harassment.
