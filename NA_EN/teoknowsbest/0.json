But he got in and the only reason I see how is he spammed like 20 yorick games right before his rework came into the pbe though before that he was lvl 1 yorick like 3 games played and was inactive for like 20 days... So umm... Try that I guess... \n\nThough I don't think it will work as I mained 3 mages before the mage rework Vlad, Viktor and Ahri and only played these 3 champions and had them all lvl 5 but I didn't get into the PBE and now I hate Ahri and Vlad as I feel the changes were bad and would have liked to have tested them and gave my opinion for at least the small hope I would have gotten through to riot and helped them better at least Vlad as the rework just changed him from a tanky mage with lil bit of burst damage to a burst mage with a lil bit of tank which changed nothing but his playstyle... \n\nI've had like 3 leaver busters in my whole year of league and I have been toxic only a few times I am quite active on the forum and have made posts about quite a few bugs... But no PBE for me now the assassin rework is coming up and I feel they will break my akali and zed and I can't do anything to help them... Then I see someone like brofesco or whatever (Youtuber) with like 3 PBE accounts who fails to give any constructive criticism in his videos just yelling about how amazing they are and freaking out even if they have obv problem that need to be addressed to better them as characters... And I think riot doesn't actually care and is just looking for money. (That being total salt but not a lie feel free to check into his videos) So yeah much good luck getting in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-12T09:18:40.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XTheMagicKnightX,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W50Kh9TO,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-12T09:09:58.776+0000)\n>\n> Hello guys! So I&amp;#039;ve been wanting to play on PBE for a while now but sadly, I have no account... :( I am trying to grow an account from lvl 1 to 30 so I can turn it into a PBE account.\n\nYour main account is not \"made into\" a PBE account, but given the opportunity to make an account specifically for the PBE.\n\n> Questions that I haven&amp;#039;t found an answer for on the FAQ page: Do divisions affect whether or not you&amp;#039;re accepted on PBE?\n\nDivisions do not matter.  What they do look for is great interest/involvement/activity in the game.  As far as I can tell, you're more likely to get a PBE account if you play a decent amount, and act well behaved.\n\n> Will an account with no reports be accepted faster on PBE?\n\nBeing reported occasionally is fine, but if you get punished it can seriously get in the way of your attempt to get a PBE account.\n\n> Will you be able to switch from PBE to live servers?\n\nThey're different accounts, so you keep your live server account as well.\n\n> Are there any factors that I have to respect in order to be accepted?\n\nI think that getting honors makes you more likely to be accepted.  To do that, just try to be helpful and positive (not to the point where you annoy though).\n\n> Will someone give me an account? ;-; XD{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n\nCan't/won't give you mine, but wish you luck in getting your own! :)","replies":[{"poster":"TeoKnowsBest","date":"2016-10-12T09:32:01.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! So, how much would it take to get accepted onto PBE?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-12T09:48:39.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say for sure.\nI was let on a couple years ago.  At the time though, I'd received every banner from honors, so I think they look at that a bit.  I've also talked with player support a couple times when I've had small issues (or wanted 3 rp to reach a skin), so they could also take that sorta stuff into consideration as well.\nIt's difficult to say exactly what they want from you.  Just try to enjoy the game as much as you can.  I know that I was absurdly into the game at the time.\n\nMaybe once you submit a ticket to get on the PBE, if you haven't heard back in a while (6 - 12 months), send a ticket to player support asking about the status on your PBE account ticket.  It can take a while to get a PBE account though.  Two of my friends sent their PBE account tickets a good while ago, and haven't heard back.  Though they never sent follow up tickets to player support.\n\nI myself never sent follow up tickets though, as I was fortunate enough to be accepted pretty quickly.  I think they accept people to the PBE in waves rather than a consistent trickle, but that's just my own guess.\n\nEdit: Going to sleep now, but if you want to ask me anything else, just leave a reply.  I'll probably be able to get back to you in about 11 or 12 hours.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2016-10-12T09:20:10.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do not make an account to switch to the PBE, Riot will make one for you if you are accepted.
