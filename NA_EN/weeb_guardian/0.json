I've been seeing some routing issues with Telia lately, which is a big backbone provider that a lot of EU ISPs partner with to bring your connection to our servers. Before we look into your route, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your ability to stay connected to games.","replies":[]}]}
