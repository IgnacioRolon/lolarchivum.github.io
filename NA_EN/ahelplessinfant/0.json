It would be great! When she ults she could blow a whistle and point at her target as all the dodgeballs hit them (or conversely yell DODGEBALL!).  Just think of the distinct noise those big rubber balls make!  I would buy that skin in a heartbeat.  Also, bonus points if her joke is the 5 d&#039;s of dodgeball (those being dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge).","replies":[{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2015-03-29T19:14:46.196+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok\n\nhttp://vegacolors.deviantart.com/art/Dodgeball-Syndra-476718223","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aura Master Fox","date":"2015-03-29T07:00:17.095+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:134}} *\"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!\"*","replies":[{"poster":"Wee Deedles","date":"2015-03-29T15:40:56.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aura Master Fox,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EI7sVt8m,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-29T07:00:17.095+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:134}} *\"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!\"*\n\nBut heimer autos aren't skillshots :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"AHelplessInfant","date":"2015-03-29T07:25:10.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:134}} If you can dodge a global ult you can dodge a ball","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadlyQuestion","date":"2015-03-29T18:10:34.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say it'd have to be \"If you can dodge a Q..\" or \"If you can dodge a rocket/axe/arrow/missile\" to reference global ults.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-29T06:58:55.504+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd buy the shit out of that skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2015-03-29T06:48:30.394+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra main here, so i ship it :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"2sips","date":"2015-03-29T08:56:18.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome idea...would be so hot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"By Force of Will","date":"2015-04-08T05:47:49.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs to happen.
