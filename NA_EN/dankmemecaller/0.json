I ever since the World's login screen patch, I have been having much much less FPS than normal. When I get in game, it drops from 60 to 10-20. Every setting has been changed to the bare minimum. I use a Toshiba Satellite C655-S5301 laptop. I have tried everything on the support page, sent a support ticket, tried adjusting battery usage (which had no effect), closed the client while in game, performed a clean boot, etc.\r\n\r\nR3d logs and DxDiag attached.\r\n\r\nHelp is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-23T21:24:30.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Frozen World,\n\nI read your message and took a look at the attached logs.  I actually do not see any smoking gun in either log.  Your drivers and your Windows OS is completely up to date, and there are no glaring errors in your R3d logs.  However, you do only have 3 GB of RAM, which could cause issues for League of Legends if you have a lot of running Processes in the background.  Many people drastically underestimate how much RAM League of Legends uses.  Because of that, if you have anything running in the background, completely disable it before running League of Legends.  Additionally, make sure that in your in-game settings, that \"Shadows\" is turned completely off, as it is the most graphically intensive setting.\n\nIf you are still consistently experiencing issues, please submit a ticket to Player Support, which you can find here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new\n\nIf you do submit a ticket, make sure to include the following information (in additional to the information you already provided in this thread):\n\n1) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list\n\n2) A copy of your Game.cfg File (make sure to simply copy and attach in the response message).  You can find this file here:  Local Disk --> Riot Games  --> League of Legends --> Config","replies":[{"poster":"NeekoTrap","date":"2013-09-23T23:13:39.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did Riot support just make a funny?\n\nTHE AI IS LEARNING!

If that solves your problem, start by slightly raising the settings until you are comfortable with the FPS you receive.\n\nOther things you can try if that fails you, that also work for the 2nd option, are as follows:  \n\n* Setting your priorities for lolclient.exe to low while ingame using the Task manager\n* Setting your priorities for league of legends.exe to high while ingame\n* Making sure you don't have any background processes running\n* Performing a system scan if league isn't the only program you are having slowdowns with\n* A defrag of your hard drive will also help if League of legends isn't the only program you are experiencing slowdowns with.\n\nIf none of the above help, or you need more help, Let me know so I can follow up.","replies":[]}]}
