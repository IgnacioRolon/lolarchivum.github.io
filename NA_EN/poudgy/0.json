Her kit is overall very fun to use and great for poking and kite. At least it used to be. Taliyah, with a 1.3% pick rate, has received so many unnecessary nerfs that ruined her gameplay in my opinion. She has always been one of the least played champions since her release, and I&#039;ve only ever seen 1 Taliyah in a game, so why nerf her? Ever since her release, all of the follow nerfs have been applied:\n**Q:**\n-Took off the 50% extra damage to minions\n**W:**\n-Increased cooldown by 4 seconds at max level\n**E:**\n-Added 15% fallout damage per each consecutive mine\n-Reduced base damage by 30 at max level\n**R:**\n-Increased cooldown\n**Rylai&#039;s:**\nI&#039;m  going to write an explanation for this item to go along with the nerfs. The item itself was sort of overpowered, yes, but the nerf made it almost useless. The 20% slow has almost no effect, making it useless against the overpowered tank meta. On top of that, the stat drop, getting rid of 100 health and 25 ability power, significantly decreasing its power. The kite from the item is terrible  now with almost no slow.\n\nIn my opinion, Taliyah has become very weak in her overall damage and kiting, making her not as fun to play and dropping her already low pick rate. In my honest opinion, I feel as if the nerfs should be reverted or Taliyah should just be overall buffed. Obviously I could be wrong, just looking for more opinions of the topic.\n\nEdit: When discussing the overpowered tank meta, I more specifically mean champions such as Trundle, Vi, and Hecarim, that build 1 damage item and can one shot teams while being undying. I might make a separate post arguing the need for more Magic penetration / AP items. These champions are impossible to kill with the current magic penetration available, but for now the slow reduction from Rylai's itself is the problem that just makes the tank meta even more broken.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-11T19:40:43.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont forget the w lockout/vector cast change, forces you to have e out before you can w","replies":[{"poster":"Poudgy","date":"2016-12-11T22:13:00.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed a change in the W at one point and couldn't figure out what was wrong so I eventually got used to it, so this isn't really my problem, but I can see how it can be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AstÃ´lfo","date":"2016-12-11T16:53:34.780+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"She's trash and needs a revert to pre-6.14 when she was actually perfectly balanced and unique instead of being generalist garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2016-12-11T18:28:38.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nep2une,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MgsV9AX4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-11T16:53:34.780+0000)\n>\n> She&#x27;s trash and needs a revert to pre-6.14 when she was actually perfectly balanced and unique instead of being generalist garbage.\n\nYou mean when she basicall took what A Sol did and copied it but only better?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Existential Bard","date":"2016-12-12T03:32:41.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a couple buffs for her on pbe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2016-12-11T18:55:15.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The 50% more damage was given to her before people understood how to play her properly and made it so she could Q the wave, ult bot, get double.\n\nDisgusting champ.","replies":[]}]}
