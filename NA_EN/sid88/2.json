Why is it called PROJEKT? \r\n\r\nA: Because its a combination of PROJECT and REKT!!! &lt;insert goofy laugh here&gt;\r\n\r\nEnd of FAQ. :3\r\n\r\nOn a serious note, I started writing this after the first announcement of the PROJECT skin series. But I&#039;m not exactly a musical genius and I have very little resources so the song turned out like this. Its not as fast paced and action packed as Riot made PROJECT: Overdrive (which is bloody great btw). Its basically inspired by a lot of old sci-fi series that I used to watch. I can&#039;t exactly remember which ones except Ghost in the Shell, but the music ideas come from those old animes and new music like Daft Punk&#039;s Tron etc. So it might not be what you expect but its my own little tribute to a creation of one of the best games of our time.\r\n\r\nDownloads are free of course. The artwork is basically a compilation of the PROJECT splash arts, beautifully done by [Keniaaaa](http://keniaaaa.deviantart.com/).

It started out a little tame, I thought - perhaps you worked on the start while you were still getting into it, but the latter half really wormed its way into my head.  I was listening to it while reading PROJECT fiction, and by the time it picks up, it was the perfect backdrop.  Thanks for sharing! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Sid88","date":"2015-09-11T07:28:14.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, THANK YOU FOR NOTICING ME SENPAI! :D\n\nWhile writing this I had this image in my head that I'd like to describe to you:\n\n**0:00 - 0:22**  It starts with a view of a futuristic city at night. Bright red and blue neon lights glow in the busy white and yellows of hover cars and trains. There's a gray metal platform on which our 6 PROJECTS (Leona, Lucian, Zed, Yasuo, Yi and Fiora) stand. Their visors and suits glowing with their trademark colours. \n\n**0:23 - 0:57**  Leona nods at the other and they dash off Naruto style. As they dash from rooftop to rooftop all you can see are the blurs yellow, orange, red and pink. Then the view pans upwards to the skyline meeting the sky.\n\n**0:58 - 1:44**  The next view showcases the champions themselves. Their futuristic design and blades. Focusing on each champion running in their own characteristic way, weapons drawn till they reach the battlefield.\n\n**1:45 - 3:17**  The dry dusty plateau is filled with hundreds of futuristic robotic soldiers with their robotic war machines. They stand in perfect formation. Their leader is hidden from sight waiting in the shadows. The champions land in front of the entire army. 5 PROJECTS to a hundreds. The enemy leader nods and the attack begins. Leona starts running with perfect balance, shield in front of her, breaking their lines and leading the other 5 inside. Then the PROJECTS showcase their skills. The view panning to each showing off their signature moves. As the war machines move forward, they're combos come into play. The leader seeing the battle failing calls in a 15 foot robotic monster. Their skills aren't enough to take down the gigantic monstrosity. As the battle commences, the PROJECTS failing, the background flashes and morphs into the old Runeterra.\n\n**3:18 - 5:01**  Every champion's backstory begins to play. Bittersweet memories of the past. Times of peace before the fall of the Institue of War. Friendly interactions with their treasured ones. Stories of the fall of their home. Stories of Zed's quest for power. Stories of Leona's desire to protect. Stories of Lucian's torment. Stories of Fiora's downfall. Stories of Yasuo's failure. Stories of Yi's anger. And yet a reminder of who they were. What they fought for. The memory limiter of their program failing. The control of their creators failing. Their human emotions getting stronger till they break free.\n\n**5:02 - 7:20**  The angry PROJECTS calm down. The fast paced battle slows in their minds. The PROJECTS begin to power up. Their will now their own. Their reasons and convictions strengthen their resolve. Their movements become fluid and smooth like it had something they were doing for eons. They dodge the construct's attacks with ease. They begin to use their ultimates one by one. Starting with Leona, with a bright yellow light channeling on their humongous opponent forcing him down not allowing him to move. Then Zed, immediately after, marking the monster with a giant X and spawning 3 shadows and embedding 6 blades into the construct's body which explode leaving a giant hole in its torso. Then Yi, using his legendary speed, launching himself inside the hole, destroying animatronics inside leaving open its interior mechanism, while Lucian, running fast towards the construct, guns blazing, blowing off its arms and head with multiple accurate shots. Then Yasuo, landing his tornado, used Last Breath to relieve the enemy of its legs before smashing it on the ground. The construct, begins to reassemble itself, but Fiora, using her passive spots the weakness of the monster as the exposed core. She spans a gigantic field of pink before dashing in and piercing the core having it explode. As the construct deactivated, the pink field turns green and the damage to the PROJECTS fills up. The broken off parts of their armour being to reattach themselves on their own. The battle is over.\n\n**7:21 - 7:57**  The PROJECTS wade through the bodies of the hundreds lying in pieces to the edge of the plateau. The view of them standing shoulder to shoulder from off the clip and their faces reflect a brilliant orange. The view moves slowly to their backs, the armor glowing their colors. The sky in front of them a brilliant shade of vermillion as dawn breaks and the sun rises. The entire image flashes out with the snare roll.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2015-09-11T05:51:26.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It reminds me of the soundtrack from the first Deus Ex game, nostalgia OP +1","replies":[{"poster":"Sid88","date":"2015-09-11T07:30:51.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
