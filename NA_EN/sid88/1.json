She&#039;s always this cheery, nerdy and cute (read KAWAIIIIII!!!!) kinda person (or fish??). So when I started writing this song I had this image in my head that i&#039;d like to describe (mostly cuz I suck at drawing... -.-&#039;).\r\n\r\nWhen you start listening to this song, imagine a beach. You&#039;re looking at the sea and you see the sun starting to rise. The sky turns into a brilliant shade of red and orange as it lights up the ocean and the smooth sand on the beach. You turn around and see Nami sitting under a red and white striped umbrella, lounging away, staff laying on the side. You see the sun&#039;s rays light up her face. You see her eyes brighter and grow wide as she looks at sunrise and smiles. Then her eyes close as she basks in the warmth of the vermilion sun, bobbing her head to the beat of the music while she relaxes.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of fun writing this song and I hope you have fun listening to it too!
