Mostly the bit before she joined Demacia as the Elite Guard. Here I wanted to make something which makes the listener be reminded of the origin of Shyv. Mostly about her being an outcast because of her mixed race and the death of her father who made her who she was. This isn&#039;t a very angry song. But I&#039;ve tried to make it as intense as possible with the limiter resources I have. I really hope you like it!\r\n\r\nThe artwork is by [Ae-Rie](http://ae-rie.deviantart.com) and you can find the original art [here.](http://ae-rie.deviantart.com/art/League-of-Legends-Shyvana-398724693)\r\n\r\nPlease do leave your thoughts below and please do tell me if I can improve on things here. I will try and incorporate it in the next one! :D Happy Listening! :)","replies":[{"poster":"ImortalLyfe","date":"2016-01-11T14:44:37.991+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are amazing. You should like do these and add words (Like typing) to reflect the characters lore. Not that many people actually read the lore (especially if it's really long like some champions) So it would be really cool if you retold the most important part of a champions lore in a video with your own music to it. These are awesome and def. subscribing to your youtube (Soundcloud doesn't work for me ;  -  ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Sid88","date":"2016-01-11T15:36:22.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a great idea! :D I'll use that for sure! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bark Wahlberg","date":"2016-01-10T19:33:59.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was pretty cool seeing a song on here (it's more often visual art or stories), but then I saw you have a _whole playlist_ of these! Awesome!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bgbassphoenix/sets/league-of-legends-fan-music\n\nWhat are you using to make these? If I have any feedback it's that the drums on some of them sound a bit generic or digital. Having messed around with drums in music programs myself I know that part is hard to get sounding right.","replies":[{"poster":"Sid88","date":"2016-01-10T20:25:01.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, HOLY SHIT I LOVE THAT NAME! :D\n\nThese songs are made on GarageBand/Logic.
