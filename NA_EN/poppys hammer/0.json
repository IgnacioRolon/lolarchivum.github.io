The Aether Wing skin is slightly (but noticeably) slower than her other skins (I.e Riot Kayle). Considering this is her most expensive skin I find it quite odd that it comes with a fallback (albeit it&#039;s most likely not on purpose). Keep in mind I&#039;m not requesting a buff towards her attack rate, just a fix for this one skin to make it more playable for Kayle players.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whist","date":"2015-07-02T17:32:51.844+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll look into this :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whist","date":"2015-07-08T02:04:30.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"A follow up on this - I looked into her auto attacks and this isn't going to be something as easy as  moving the animation timing around to change the pose on the hit frame like I had hoped.\n\nTalked to the animators who were here when she was made.

Sad to hear about her not getting fixed but you guys/gals have bigger things going on :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DanofDemacia","date":"2015-07-11T04:11:50.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"False words!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lynxonyx","date":"2015-07-02T22:39:54.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Whist,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fP4lp49q,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-07-02T17:32:51.844+0000)\n>\n> I'll look into this :)\n\nThank you!
