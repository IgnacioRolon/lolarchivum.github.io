Granted this is on ARAM, but would anyone care to explain to me why health alone makes a champ tanky without any resistances? And their runes were built towards comet and the secondary wasn&#039;t towards tank either. So ruins only played a part in giving her more damage, but nothing towards making her tanky.\r\n\r\nThis is the same problem that I have with {{item:3083}} , why can a champ get tanky with health alone and no resistances built?","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-01-11T03:13:10.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie E makes health go farther for her than most.","replies":[]}]}
