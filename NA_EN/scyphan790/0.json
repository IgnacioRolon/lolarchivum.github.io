It&#039;s not a skill shot, its a guaranteed hit on every enemy, and yet is has such high damage and scaling. Shouldn&#039;t the prior 2 parameters mean that it shouldn&#039;t be allowed to do so much damage? Typically skill shots do more damage because it takes skill to use and isn&#039;t just a single button press or point and click; and if a skill shot does do less damage it would be because it combos with other abilities.\r\n\r\nNow granted those are just normal abilities, but shouldn&#039;t ultimates follow similar suit? The only other ultimate I can think of that does the same amount of disgusting damage is Malphite ult, and even that falls into the same problem of being scaled way too high. Although I understand why the high ap scaling is there for Malphite because he typically builds tank, so it&#039;s to make up for the damage he doesn&#039;t build. But even still, Malphite ult is still a skill shot, so if he lands it he&#039;s earned the damage and knock up. While Karthus over here doesn&#039;t have to risk anything, being able to ult from anywhere (even while he&#039;s dead) and get rewarded so much damage for nothing. And the ways to counteract his ult are so limited too: if you&#039;re in range you might be able to stun him while he&#039;s casting (if he&#039;s even in the area, could just be at base); or if you&#039;re an ap champ, you would probably have Zhonya&#039;s to use.\r\n\r\nSo off the top of my head there&#039;s just those 2 things you can do, not including champ specific abilities that make them invulnerable. I won&#039;t include those because it&#039;s too specific and those champs wouldn&#039;t necessarily always work against a comp that has a Karthus.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-12-12T04:46:52.213+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3157}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3193}} {{item:3814}} \n\n any shield skill can lessen the  damage.. {{champion:15}}  and {{champion:56}}  have a spellshield that will completely block all damage\n\n even {{champion:90}}  will take 90% reduced damage from it.\n\n outside of that far too many champion have either damage reduction abilities like {{champion:11}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:3}}, or fault out invulnerability with certain spells.\n\nit's really not that hard to avoid or significantly lessen the impact for almost any champion in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2018-12-12T05:26:33.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't his ult damage on a 3 minute cooldown or so?

This allows a decent window of time to defend yourself or help a teammate. It's frequently used in teamfights after Karthus has died, which doesn't take advantage of its global range but also prevents enemies from interrupting it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-12-12T05:00:11.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has the longest cooldown of any ability in the game and has at least 6 hard counter items, not counting lifesteal items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-12T05:18:48.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My personal idea:\n\nInstead of mortaring everyone on the map, the channel begins creating an AoE on each champion that expands as it is channeled. When released, it deals AoE damage after a brief delay.\n\nDamage could be a lot lower, but would stack from multiple hits and have falloff.\n\nBasically, karthus now fires 5 Ziggs ults with 3-5 seconds of warning. It would allow people to flash out or spread out to minimize damage, but would be a great teamfight or objective disruptor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScyPhan790","date":"2018-12-20T08:14:50.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People keep saying 3 minute cooldown, but you're also forgetting Presence of Mind which I'm pretty sure plenty of players take on him. If he gets enough takedowns, his ult can easily go down to 50 seconds.\n\nSure {{item:3102}} and {{item:3814}} can work (if you're laning), but if it's well timed (like during a team fight) those shields aren't going to be up when you get hit by his ult. The same goes for pretty much any other damage reduction or casted shield, only in the perfect situation are those things going to work.\n\n\"Can be interrupted and deal NO damage\". But that's if you're able to get close enough to him to stop him. Like I said above, he can cast it from anywhere so an interrupt isn't guaranteed. Oh he's on the other side of the map, let me just interrupt his ult.\n\nSo good luck, I hope those items/abilities haven't been used prior when Karthus ults because you'd have to basically just hold onto those item/ability activations solely for his ult. You definitely wouldn't prioritize using them in a team fight to save yourself from the immediate danger rather then the looming one.","replies":[]}]}
