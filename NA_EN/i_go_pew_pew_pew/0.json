Because I tried to cs, took towers, and warded. Your k/d/a is NOT the only thing that&amp;#039;s important in a game. Far from it. So stop posting your silly &amp;quot;omg i went 13-10-2 no S but so many kills rito fix broken system&amp;quot; threads.\n\nTheir is way too many factors that can screw ball things.\n-CS farming\n-Kills, Deaths, Assist ratios\n-Taking Objectives\n-The role your in\n-The average bar people have basically set for said champion, especially with the role it is standing in.\n\nFunny how with a Ryze i manage to get a S rank not by simply being a over'all bad arse player, but by taking advantage of his wave clear and easily push 10 to 30 minion sized waves that flooded the the top lane on occassion and manage to hit over 300+ CS in late game by taking  the time to focus more on controlling lanes, side pushing turrets down while the rest of my team was able to hold down the middle lane rush.\n\nIts funny how the argument of 'be a team player' can easily be shut down by taking the time to focus on more important things, especially when you dont need your entire team sieging and it would be better to keep some spread around to intercept the ridiculous split push screw offs where a few players will pratically kite you to siege there base while the ADCS or other high damage champions will sneak thru the jungle to a pushed up lane to quickly rush it down and get straight to the inhibitor in a few seconds.\n\nI will admit at least that some factors need to be less influential and/or have more impact straight on getting a S rank, since i've had too many moments on A and A- when i performed a excellent game itself, but sometimes it gets cut short by the constant use of surrendering or the flip side of we get snowballed and locked inside our base while the enemy steals all the objectives as if they were some korean perfectionist pro team(in a exaggerated sense). Such as champion 'bars' being set by a player average being less influential and more along hitting a 'particular number' on CS, Turret destruction involvement and less your a jungler, taking objectives being a helpful bonus factor in upping your score in getting an S rank.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
