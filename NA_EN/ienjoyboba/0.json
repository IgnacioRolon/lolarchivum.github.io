It was not.\r\nThen, we forced quit our client to see if we could log back into the game, but the reconnect screen never popped up.\r\nNow, we got in another queue and are currently in champ select for another ranked duo game.\r\nBut according to other sources (such as op.gg), the original game is still active and going.\r\nWhat? LOL I'm guessing we'll probably take LP penalization too?","replies":[{"poster":"Clayspro","date":"2017-06-26T13:12:19.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me as well. After the Game started to load I had a black screen and couldn't log into the game.The Server has dropped the game all together after 3 minutes.

I'm curious to know if the game shows up in your history. Not your OP.GG History, but your in client game history. Also, is this the first time that this has happened to you?","replies":[]}]}
