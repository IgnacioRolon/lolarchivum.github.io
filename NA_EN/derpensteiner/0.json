(I tried to make one, but I had to be \"level 1 or higher\" to even make a post...)\n\nThe account name is McGruff\n\nI was playing Saturday around 12-2 PM and then got off and tried to log back in at around 5ish to find out that I can't log in. It says password or username is incorrect which was impossible. Then I tried to change the email which lead me no where. I don't know if they changed the email or not. The email that I originally made the account I had to delete, because that email got hacked into and was subscribed to various spam newsletters, etc. I think I switched the email to the one I have now, but I had to switch so many accounts to the new email that I don't remember if I missed this one. In the support ticket I showed various methods of verification. I also made a riot points purchase and even included the card that I used for the purchase. Overall, I just wanted to play this weekend on my account, but couldn't. I also am worried about the use of the riot points, if I can get my account back, etc. I had it since 2012 and have invested a significant amount of money into the account. I appreciate your time into resolving this issue.\n\nThe ticket was made under xMcGruff I do believe\n(the account I had to make to even look at the ticket)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T03:18:00.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I need to give those little support poros a little nudge....-_-'\n\nI've got your ticket pulled up now, and it looks like an agent is in the process of responding as we speak.
