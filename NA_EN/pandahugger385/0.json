I love her play style and kit as a whole. Her feathers stick into the ground when attacking creeps and enemy champs, which you can recall. After that you have an amazing ULT that makes you untouchable and if you pull it off right you can stun your enemies when you pull those feathers back. Great for team fights! \n\nWith that said though, there is no rush in you getting a Champion right now: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation Why not check out the free rotation and take some of these Champs into Custom, or Practice mode to see who and what you like. \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"pandahugger385","date":"2017-08-08T17:12:42.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"pandahugger385","date":"2017-08-08T17:07:08.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm seems like u noob{{champion:17}} ","replies":[]}]}
