And i am going to \"pay\" for it?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So today i decided to play a ranked match and for some reason i just couldn't join my game was giving me an error that was something like \" Network Warning \" you have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again \" I tried to join the game on BOTH my computers, reset my router, reset the computer, everything and nothing would work ( PS: my internet was working 100% fine i could use facebook twitter youtube and all that ) i spend the ENTIRE game trying to reconnect and after so many minutes of trying, at the end of the game i get a leave buster warning? For something i didn't do? I've NEVER left a game on purpose, i have been playing for a couple of years now and i left like 2-3 MAX 4 games because of techical problems i couldn't solve on my own and ONLY 1 of them was a ranked game, is this even fair? Like seriously?Is anyone else having this problem? There is no way both my computers will crash at the same time and even reseting my router this would still be a problem... I do NOT deserve to be responsible for a mistake that i didn't do, i am extremely careful with leaving games and all that so this wouldn't happen and this is what i get? I dont think this is MY problem because 2 computers crashing at the same time? Even when i turn them off and on again? And RESETING the router?... Come on... really?!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T20:35:45.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the efforts you took to get back in game and rejoin your team.  The system wouldn't penalize you for just one game, so you'd have to have a steady history of leaving.  Even if it wasn't intentional and you tried to come back, other players in that game also had to pay for being down a player.  The only way to restore standing is by playing without any issues, and if you still have issues connecting let me know.  I'm happy to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Aibisi","date":"2016-09-13T20:45:02.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if it disconnects me again and i cant join... i said i wasn't going to leave games again and if it doesn't let me go inside the game i am already \" lying \"...
