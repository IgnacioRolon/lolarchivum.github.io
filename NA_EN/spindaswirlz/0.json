There was a bug that appeared in which the character model froze, occasionally with all of his tentacles extended into a triangle. Near the end of the game, I found I was able to replicate the visual effects by Auto-Attacking while the animations from his abilities were happening.\r\n\r\nI have a recording of the game, but I don&#039;t quite know how I&#039;d even start putting it as a link here. It was pretty spooky  {{champion:161}} \r\n\r\nIt was pretty simple to replicate, especially after a few tries.\r\n\r\n1. Use one of his basic abilities, I don&#039;t know if the Disintegration Ray would work.\r\n2. Auto-Attack something nearby. In the ARAM I played, my only targets were Minions, Champions, and Illaio Tentacles.\r\n3. The character model may freeze. I found that using Q created the triangle and E made him create a little upside-doen heart.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T23:36:05.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SpindaSwirlz! \n\nThanks for the awesome bug report!
