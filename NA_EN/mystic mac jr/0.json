To find out for sure, have you and your friend run a traceroute to that server (66.151.33.248) using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and compare the results. \n\nMy first step in trying to get that ping lowered would probably be adjusting my DNS settings to googles to see if that would get me a better route to the LAN servers. Give that a shot following the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if you aren't familiar with DNS settings, and let me know if that helps or not!","replies":[]}]}
