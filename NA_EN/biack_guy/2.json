I typically get an S on support shen when I am in the 5/0/25 range for a score. best of luck! My advice is if you want to get that S take him into the jungle, its less common for shen to be in the jungle so you are competing with a smaller pool, so those scores will likely be good enough to get that S ranking. Plus I really like jungling Shen as well. I recommend trying out Jungle item + Titantic Hydra + Trinity Force thats my go to jungle shen build at this time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T04:27:59.295+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those mastery scores are calculated by looking at how you played Shen, in what lane/role you played him, and how well you did compared to everyone else who played the same champion and role. The best advice I can give on how to get S's with specific champions would be to look into how others are playing Support Shen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Nope","date":"2017-07-03T17:05:45.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/976/327/98f.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-03T06:15:53.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cs seems to be weighted heavily... need a lot of cs for S","replies":[]},{"poster":"BIack Guy","date":"2017-07-03T03:23:01.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I AGREE","replies":[]}]}
