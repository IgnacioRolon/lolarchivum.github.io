I opened my match history to check it out and it's not there. I'm pretty sure I got my LP but the game and ranked illaoi statistics weren't updated. On OP.GG it shows the game but when looking for any details it tells the following. \r\nUnknown Error! (403) Debug Message:\r\nOops seem's you've flashed into an inaccessible page!\r\n오류가 발생했습니다! (The requested data is not available because the Riot API has not yet been updated. Please try again later.)\r\n\r\nIs this a common bug? Is there an easy fix or do i need to write a ticket to Riot?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T20:31:12.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, the last Illaoi match I see was 3 days ago.  It's possible that our server failed to retrieve completion of your match, and in which case it could act like it never existed.  Alternatively, there might be a delay and it will eventually retrieve the information eventually.  Best bet for now is to wait and see which happens, but in the meantime I'll keep an eye out in case this was an isolated issue or not.  Thanks for letting us know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-05-24T20:15:53.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI think it has something to do with the replay bug that the informed players about. \nHowever, it doesn't say that Match History is offline... but it is. I hope that the stats are actually recorded, and that we may access them at a later time.\nI also would like @Riot to clarify this.","replies":[]}]}
