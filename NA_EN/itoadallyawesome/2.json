I had to restart my client to get into a game, whatever. That didn't work, so I restarted my pc, didn't work. But it did do something. It had me redownload League. So I got to the \"Configuring LoL\" part where it's almost done, and it says \"Another installation is in progress. You must complete that installation before continuing this one. I had nothing else downloading at the time.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T01:41:49.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have opened more than one instance of the installer if it's shooting you that error. Open up your task manager and look for anything League related and stop those processes. Make sure to start the installer as administrator and let it run through the update process again.
