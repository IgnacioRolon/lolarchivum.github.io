I hit silver 4, but was immediately demoted after ONLY two losses at 0 lp. I don't understand.. shouldn't it be like, 3? I've had cases like this before without getting demoted, and I'm not asking for like a reroll on these games or anything, I'm just curious, how DOES the demotion system work? Is it based on your W/L ratio, or what, because I am very confused at how that happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T18:25:39.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and don't see any demotions after two losses.  Losing after your [ranked shield](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) is gone can risk a demotion in your division, and in this case it looks like a streak resulted in that.  I do see you were promoted back since then, nice job!","replies":[{"poster":"NyCrit","date":"2016-10-04T16:59:19.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
