The first problem was that every time I get into my promos every lose counts as 2. This problem was not as major as when i found of someone hacked into my account, but I found the site wouldn't let me change the password. I am very concerned as I never share my password, the password is specific to this one account, and I have never fallen for a \"free riot points\" scam. Please help!\n\n(Update: I managed to change my password via the \"I forgot my password\" option. I would still like help with he malfunctioning support page and promos tracker, I can send in video proof of the problems I needed.)","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-14T00:17:40.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try a different browser or a different computer or phone.

I have a video of the incident, is there a place i can send that?

I just realized that I could upload the video to YouTube, I will make the video unlisted to it doesn't attract negative attention towards riot games, I will post the link when the video is done uploading)\n\n(This is the video i recorded: https://youtu.be/6ZPvrnQ2AsQ )","replies":[]}]}]}
