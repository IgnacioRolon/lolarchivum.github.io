I initially thought it was my internet, but every other online game runs smoothly, and my internet ping is what it usually is - except while playing league where it'll spike up, to an unplayable amount.\r\n\r\nI lost a ranked game because of this, is anyone else having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Average Gerg","date":"2017-02-14T12:27:37.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
