Some of our players have noticed that the issue started when they updated to the WIndows 10 Creator update, which I believe is still technically in beta. You may be able to get around this by reverting to the most recent stable build of Windows, but let's go ahead and try double checking the steps in [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well.\n\nEDIT: Looks like I was a bit out of touch with how far the Creator Update had come. I would not actually recommend reverting now that Creator is an official release.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2017-06-02T01:35:33.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My computer was told I needed to upgrade to the Creator update. Based on everything I can find, it is now in full release and no longer in beta.\n\nFurther more, there are some critical security fixes that were included in the Creator update that prevents your computer from being compromised. Recommending users to revert to a less secure system that leaves them open to random-ware may not be the best choice for their computer's safety.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-06-02T01:43:18.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perform the steps in the article Broporo provided, let's attempt to fix this without a revert.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maxtilt","date":"2017-06-01T23:59:52.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried all of the internet \"fix's\" none of them work. \n\nI have an AMD Radeon R9 290\n\nI found reinstalling an old out of date driver soft ware to fix it....
