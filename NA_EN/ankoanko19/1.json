Okay.\n\nIn melee range it won't matter. No yas is going to react fast enough to windwall either a q or an ult at melee range. He will ult preemptively if anything. In melee range it's even easier to tell actually. Did it pass through you? Well it was his Q. Did it hit you and stop? It was his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-09-14T14:04:59.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wimbledofy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gTEEVXLs,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2018-09-14T08:44:10.600+0000)\n>\n> In melee range it won&#x27;t matter.

So it's actually fairly easy to wind wall it even in melee range since wind wall will poof it so long as it hasn't dealt damage yet (assuming max melee range and not like, model touching range).","replies":[{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-09-15T14:11:57.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Z3Sleeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gTEEVXLs,comment-id=0000000200000000,timestamp=2018-09-14T14:04:59.703+0000)\n>\n> Hahaha lemme just stop you there.
