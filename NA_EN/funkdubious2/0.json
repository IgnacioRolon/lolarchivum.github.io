Do we have any other counters that level the playing field?\n\nAnyone who can dash over a wall, as there is almost a guarantee to be one. Morde cannot jump these walls, though his Q can hit you from over most of them and proper E usage makes the Q easier to hit. \n\nShaco is a risky Morde Ult target because it goes on cooldown ... wirthout doing anything if he Rs the clone. \n\nMalzahar, however, is NOT. \n**DO NOT** pick Malzahar into Mordekaiser. \nRiot put a 0.5 second slow on the R, which dispels Malz' passive. And THEN the pull into the other dimension happens after that 0.5 seconds. This means your passive will never actually block the R. Not sure what happens to existing Voidlings, if Yi R counters the Morde ult by preventing the slow (probably not. Also, going untargetable due to Alpha will just fizzle the CD and he'll ult you after anyway.) \n\nOf course, any long-duration CC or Stasis will help even the odds in your favor a LOT, as Morde does not have a whole lot of upfront burst so cutting his 7 second window down as much as possible will at the very least mean he doesn't keep your stats after you die to him anyway. \n\nThere's weird interactions between Akali's E, pets, and Vi R that I dont completely understand yet. \nIf only Riot would update Sandbox mode to include multiple playable champions on either side so I can do things like Ult a target behind an Enemy morde whos ulting one of my allies etc. without having to have friends coordinate this with me. Not everyone is Vandiril","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
