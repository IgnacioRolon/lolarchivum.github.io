I have no idea how to fix this problem or really what causes them.If anyone could help me, please do.   {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T05:33:03.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oof, that doesn't look good at all! This can sometimes hint towards some hardware failure, so I really hope that isn't the case here! This may also be affected by certain display driver or windows power setting issues, so I'd like you to work through our [**FPS Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as your next step.\n\nPlease let me know if you continue to experience these issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vibranium Heart ","date":"2017-01-21T02:09:37.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i took my PC to service for a drivers update and some prophylactics especially on the video card GPU(everything was ok).And the problem is still the same.My video card is workin fine at low temperatures i tested it again with high graphic requirement in other games and  no problem there.But after i play 5-6 minutes LoL here we go again.And btw i still have that full screen problem and cant play on full screen in any resolution.Before i was on 1024x768 fullscreen(had no problem),since the last patch im playin on 1280x960 (boardles,windowed mode) so i can redeem my previous fullscreen experience.....Thx for the reply btw and sry for my late respond.  Edit: I want to add that my Monitor isnt the newest one i will speak in numbers : \nNative Resolution 1440 x 900 at 75 Hz ,  TFT active matrix ; Horizontal Refresh Rate 83 kHz ;  Vertical Refresh Rate 75 Hz.I mean that im aware of my Refresh Rate video card to monior..A higher refresh rate allows you to enjoy higher frame rates in your games without graphical tearing,something my monitor doesnt have.But im not rly sure about this ...anyway im 1 step closer to buy a new Monitor only cuz of that.\n\n\n","replies":[]}]}
