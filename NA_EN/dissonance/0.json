(damn I wanna say his name here, but yeah... rules). He sent me a link for a Halloween Event ... It was fake ofc, but I was drunk at this time, so I didnt really care.. he was really friendly and etc ... after all he's in my friend list and I try to avoid inviting negative ppl, looks like I will have to clean this list. Anyway, I've managed to change my pass and e-mail after that, but just wondering in case I could save them do I need a ticket for restoration ... I mean the only reason I write now is that I want to name this guy so he get punished. Hopefully you guys have some chat log files or something :S I will check my browser history about the link if it's needed to be given.","replies":[{"poster":"President Swa1n","date":"2016-10-24T00:37:22.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people send these links thinking they're legit though.
