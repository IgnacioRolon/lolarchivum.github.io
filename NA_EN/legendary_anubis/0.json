I had a fully built mercurial and used it mid-air **after** he ulted me yet, I still floated in the air for that half-of-a-second during his ult.\r\n\r\nBeing knocked airborne is CC soooo...why can&#039;t I cancel it with mercurial when it&#039;s supposed to remove **all** cc effects? Maybe I&#039;m missing something?\r\n\r\nPS.\r\nI made sure to use mercurial **after** his ult landed and cc was applied.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2016-09-05T20:17:26.784+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't work on any knock ups as far as I'm aware","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-09-05T20:22:51.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has never worked on knock-ups or knock-backs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legendary Anubis","date":"2016-09-05T20:49:18.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I didn't know it didn't work on airborne CC.
