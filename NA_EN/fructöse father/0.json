Meow'zahar?!","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Plans for new Malzahar skin leaked from Riot- Meow'zahar!\n\n* Malzahar&#039;s spell shield _void shift_ (passive) will appear as a cat shape, complete with cat ears and whiskers\n*  _Call of the void_ (Q) will look like 2 kittens pouncing inward toward target location \n* Malzahar&#039;s _voidlings_ (W) will obviously be little **kittenlings**\n*  _Malefic visions_ (E) appears as a ball of yarn on the target (to which the **kittenlings **would obviously be attracted) \n*  _Nether Grasp_ (R) features Malzahar suppressing his target as normal BUT the pool of energy underneath the target is a portal with kittens pulling the target down. \n\nThe new skin will be classified as a legendary skin- 1820 RP with plans for chroma bundle and icon set at 3200 RP. The date of release is currently set for never since Riot already has too much money and this skin would obviously make them so rich that they literally would not know what to do with themselves. RIP meow'zahar. \n\n{{champion:90}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-07T01:25:01.549+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It cant be worse than Meowkai's cat-dragon wave.","replies":[{"poster":"Fructöse Father","date":"2018-01-07T01:45:27.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha the \"meows\" are the only thing that make the kitten wave tolerable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gamma Sector","date":"2018-01-07T01:51:57.778+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would buy it.

It's pretty hit and miss with many of the skins that get released. TBH though I feel like Riot doesnt particularly care about whether or not a skin adds to the lore or fits the story/character/attitude. Yeah meowkai got old real quick but I bet you Riot made a ton of money off of it (they even created chromas to milk it even further). But I agree I think there are lots of other great ideas for malz skins that might fit him better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xSmellOfDaFeetx","date":"2018-01-07T01:48:13.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly you just need to get a Riot member to see this and we are good to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Fructöse Father","date":"2018-01-07T01:59:05.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the Rito gods will shine on us","replies":[]}]}]}
