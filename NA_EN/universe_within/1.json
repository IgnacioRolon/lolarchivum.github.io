Part 2","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":104,"down_votes":30,"body":"ATTENTION! Riot's support told me to make a thread on the forum if I want to discuss my case. I made a thread on the forum and Riot's mods deleted it! Riot is trying to silence me because they know I'm right and they're afraid to address me.\n\nHere is the support ticket telling me to make a thread on the forum:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/y2qzXAd.png\n\nHere is my thread being deleted:\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/67623b1a756aa2f00616a494907d0ba6.png\n\nTrying this for the second time now:\n\nI was ranked restricted for 40 games so I could only play draft normals. I was also chat restricted during this time so I could not speak during those 40 games. I also played the majority of them we a premade of friends. I lost some games along the way but had less than 10 games left, so I suppose I played around 40 games or so during this time that I was serving out my punishment for my toxic behavior.\n\nHowever, while serving the double punishment of a rank and chat restrict, I was banned for 15 days despite behaving well and playing only with friends. I sent a support ticket to Riot. I told them the situation, that I was already punished and serving out my punishment. I asked them for logs, and specified that they give me logs from the games I played while serving out my ban.\n\nThey informed me that they punished me for my previous behavior that originally restricted me and provided the logs that originally got my restricted. Even though I was well behaved during my time restricted, they decided to punish me again for the old behavior. They essentially admitted they do not trust their system, despite it actually working as my behavior improved while I was restricted.\n\nDouble jeopardy.\n\nThis is unacceptable. I am requesting dialog with a Riot employee who works on the player behavior team. I was well behaved during my initial punishment, and was almost done serving my time when I was banned. Let's talk about why you double punished me for very old behavior that was improving under current punishment.\n\nDr. Lyte please respond.\n\nedit: I am no longer banned but I will keep this thread active to expose the flaw in Riot's system until they give a proper reply.","replies":[]}
