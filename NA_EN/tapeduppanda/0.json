A recent update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing freezing problems for that player.  If so, disabling the bar should fix this up.  I also recommend disabling any third party add-ons you might be using like play.tv and overlays, as that can cause similar problems.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TapedUpPanda","date":"2016-11-11T19:35:26.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running on Windows 8 with no third party add-ons.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T19:39:51.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
