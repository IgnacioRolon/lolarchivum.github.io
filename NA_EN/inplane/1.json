Giving it QoL fixes or a revert to Double Cast without Lockout would be very appreciated. \n\nPeople said to &quot;Get used to it.&quot; on July 13, 2016 when there were lots of complaints about the change to {{champion:163}}&#039;s W. I gave it a chance since I was probably being impulsive and selfish about it.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nIt still feels exceedingly clunky and annoying to use as the game becomes progressively quicker-paced and a missed CC skill will make or break a fight. No, it&#039;s not because I don&#039;t win with her or that I perform poorly with her, thus motivating me to make a post like this. If anything, I win more with her than any other champion I have played in League. \n\nIt&#039;s the fact that Vector Cast and the lack of a proper targeting reticle feels terrible for a skill like Seismic Shove. It&#039;s her main CC skill. It should be more polished than it is right now. Plus I&#039;m a visual learner (Hence why I use Normal Cast to see where I&#039;m aiming my skills in a fight), so I process things better visually. A proper AoE targeting reticle helps a bunch with aiming and I&#039;m sure many people will agree. \n\nAt this point, I would definitely take the old Double Cast W back. NOT THE LOCKOUT. The Double Cast paradigm. It feels so much better to use than the current one does. It had:\n\n* Max Range Cast so it wont force {{champion:163}} out of position just to cast it out of range. \n* A proper targeting reticle.\n* The flexibility to knockup or shove.\n\nThe current W allows {{champion:163}} to shove by performing one action. That&#039;s it. The current W has none of what is listed and it feels like a slap to the family jewels when I saw these aspects being removed. Worst part is, Vector Cast will not ever have Max Range Cast or the flexibility to knockup or shove due to the nature of the cast paradigm. Unless tweaks are made. \n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong. I still love everything about {{champion:163}} and will continue playing her, but I want to make her feel good to play as much as possible. Her W sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of her fluid kit due to its awkward and outdated casting paradigm. \n\nEither revert it back to patch 6.13&#039;s version of Seismic Shove or give it a proper targeting reticle and make it work like pings and see how that goes. I can guarantee people will start giving her a try more.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-07-22T05:55:25.940+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"#RevertTaliyah's W","replies":[{"poster":"Îœid","date":"2017-07-22T09:18:53.337+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg if riot would ever do this I would be so fucking happy lol","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-07-22T09:51:52.300+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"all of us old tahliyah mains would be.

If anything, they should adjust it or make a new form of casting type for her W.
