For Normal Cast, it casts when left click is held down. For Quick Cast, it casts when W is held down. It would choose a direction when the button is released. This would get rid of the delay from Vector Cast and allow Seismic Shove to feel more responsive. One of the major problems with Vector Cast on Seismic Shove is that it adds an innate delay when the user is required to click, drag, and release. That adds onto the delay of the skill itself and makes it harder to aim than it should.","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-02-09T05:59:05.570+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd wish they would revert the patch 6.14 change.

The enemy just has to walk up to you and take a few steps behind you, you would most likely expect him to hit you directly so you cast your W under yourself, but it doesn't hit the enemy because he walked pass you before hitting you.

I had this idea to kind of help her out so she wouldn't feel so clunky to play. I realize her power distribution is completely fucked up, but making a thread on it probably wont help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ColorfulNarwhal","date":"2017-02-09T00:09:11.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you sir are a genius","replies":[{"poster":"NOT JHlN","date":"2017-02-14T03:48:12.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ColorfulNarwhal,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cKu27yKJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-09T00:09:11.568+0000)\n>\n> you sir are a genius\n\no","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EinarUlfar","date":"2017-02-09T12:43:44.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"6.14 revert pls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2017-02-09T01:36:43.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about it..... how does Taliyah's W work with Quick cast + range indicator O.o","replies":[{"poster":"inplane","date":"2017-02-09T01:49:04.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XeroKimo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cKu27yKJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-09T01:36:43.580+0000)\n>\n> Now that I think about it..... how does Taliyah&#x27;s W work with Quick cast + range indicator O.o\n\nHold down W, drag cursor, and then release W and it will cast.

But as it stands, a lot of {{champion:163}} mains have learned the skill's range by muscle memory. Riot hasn't even taken the liberty to give it a proper targeting reticle yet even after half a year. Her W is just a dot with the range, but no AoE circle like it should have.","replies":[{"poster":"Asteck","date":"2017-02-09T05:53:06.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm well aware, she's my most mastered champ (as far as points go). but she's already awkward to pick up for many people, now you're just taking away anyone who wants to use QC.\n\nI use it to check for when people are on the very edge of the range and I don't wanna waste it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
