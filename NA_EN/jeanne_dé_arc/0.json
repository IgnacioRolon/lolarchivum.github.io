Then I open my league (of course it's in alpha client) then opened my Xsplit Gamecaster, I was shocked because I can't see the overlay of the Xsplit (which is the fps counter) and like I tried to search for the solutions and from the twitter post of Xsplit, \"If Game Source can't detect your games, see if you have mods or third party apps running as they could usually cause it.\" they said. I tried to find the app and repeating to close all my apps and opening them one by one. Now I tried to open the legacy client (which is the old one) and Voila! There it is. Xsplit does detect the client but it doesn't detect the new one. \r\n\r\n{{champion:39}} {{summoner:12}} {{summoner:4}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T04:07:14.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a common issue with a few different streaming programs, due to their frameworks being similar to the Beta Client's framework.
