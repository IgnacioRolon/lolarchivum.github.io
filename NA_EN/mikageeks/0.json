But after that when the game should be loading into the match, my screen goes completely black, can't move my mouse, can't minimize or exit the window, can't do anything except force my computer to restart afterwards? I've tried it several times with the same result. And if I try to log back in after I restart, the game tries to force me back into the match and I get frozen again. I was playing the game fine just a few hours ago and I can't seem to find another discussion post with this issue. Anyone having the same problem or know how to fix it? Please help!\n\nNot on a windows computer, I use MacBook Pro.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-29T04:30:32.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm it kind of sounds like your connection might actually be timing out while the match is trying to load up. If your connection goes dormant during that time, the loading process can sometimes get completely stuck like this. Hit up our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) for some basic troubleshooting, but make sure to do the two steps on port forwarding and configuring DNS for sure. Let me know how that goes!","replies":[{"poster":"MikaGeeks","date":"2017-09-29T17:19:17.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, neither of those or anything on the connection guide were working for me. The solution was to manually put the game in windowed mode (since the default is full screen and there was no option to change that). I'm not sure why, but my friend happened to have the same issue and that's how he fixed his too. Thank you for the response though!","replies":[]}]}]}
