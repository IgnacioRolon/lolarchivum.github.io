(Oh, absolutely, because you guys hate global passives, I get that -seriously, I do-.) \r\n**(pseudo) Buff:**\r\nUpdate those Ult visuals! (Thanks, guys! Absolutely makes up for removing the global passive, right?...No?... No...)\r\n\r\nS5, Zilean has a pretty board wide win rate of 45% in Normal, Solo Ranked, 5v5 Ranked.\r\n\r\nSeriously, update the poor guy. Give an equal value to the nerf he took.\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions I've long seen float around.\r\n\r\n**Time Bomb:** Heals if it's put on an allied player (for a much less % than damage)\r\n\r\n**Rewind:** Can be used on an ally to heal a certain amount and reduce CD (not by 10sec), woah, hey. No one has a heal like that!\r\n\r\n**Time Warp: **Reduces Attack Speed and Movement Speed/Increases Attack Speed and Movement Speed.\r\n\r\n*I mean, I'm sure no one really cares to see all of this, but hey... How about something so the champ is worthy to play support?*","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-04-19T22:12:10.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just rework the passive. That's all there is. His kit is pretty much fine, the real problem is his overnerfed passive...","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-19T22:54:15.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zilean new passive:\n\n>Heightened Learning: When Zilean uses an ability, all of his other abilities have their cooldown reduced by 1 second. (And act like Zac's W if the skills  are out of CD stacks for future usages)\n\nWith this he can put at 3 bombs at the same time .\n\nAnother problem with Zilean is that late game, he only have one damaging skill, and his rewind skill lvl up in final levels don't help him in anything so:\n\nRewind:\n\n> New Passive: Zilean gains bonus AP.\n> \n> 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 %\n\nThis works like a Rabadon passive, and add more late power.\n\nAlso his Q on Allies need some new, maybe a shield before the bomb detonate can help his role as support.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-04-19T22:57:11.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing would have nothing to do with \"learning\", the other one is a meh stat boost - overly boring and out of theme.\n\nHow about something else: New passive: Temporal Anomaly: Projectiles around Zilean are slowed by X% They still reach their destination but are just slowed. Walking into a slowed skillshot will make it hit you. After leaving the zone the projectile speed returns to normal.\n\nA passive to counter skillshots... sounds nice to me ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-19T23:04:28.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if the enemy team don't have any skill shot? The passive never active, so I play all the game without a passive, that passive its better on rewind than a innate passive IMO","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-04-19T23:13:38.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Projectiles are not limited to skillshots. Basic attacks are projectiles too, as well as the dragon attack. Even stuff like the Nami wave counts into this xD Basic attacks cannot be dodged, but slowing them is also an amazing feat ^^\n\nWell, then he's better against a certain team-comp... That's not really bad no? ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-04-19T22:13:38.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the passive even enough to get you level 2 one creep early?","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-04-19T22:27:51.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not in a 2vs2 lane as exp is split.
