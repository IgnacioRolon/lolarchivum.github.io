New players that have money to spend are likely to take the large number of AI as a sign of a failing game. Given that most of Riots new projects tie heavily into league it will probably cost them a lot of potential sales in those properties as well. Just a though.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-12-30T18:36:49.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they do what they can. Honestly when you cut off one it sprouts two more and so on. Botting is not an easy thing to completely stop. They ban most of them in waves as well, so you'll see lots of posts on the forum at various times that are like \" my account was banned for nothing blah blah blah\" when if you look at the match history there are some clear signs of botting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-30T18:24:42.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In any game that i see numerous bots, I quit, not as is a sign of a failing game, but as a sign that farming is a big deal and people are paying for it. If endgame gear is exhausting to farm mats for, and this is present, it's those player's fault for buying from botting and the company's fault for not putting a check on bots.\n\nJust never seen farming for this reason. This is so players can get away with saying/doing what they want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-12-30T18:24:37.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think botting is the smallest issue when it comes to new players.\n\nif you pick up \"the biggest moba\" in 2019 or almost 2020 and the first thing you see is a virus open up, sorry i mean a client thats still in the 2010 early alpha, you'd wonder wtf is going on.\n\nthen if you make it into the game, you'll encounter permabanned players that go apeshit.\n\nAND AFTER THAT if you still continue to play, you'll most likely see the botters.\nbut i dont think people these days have the patience to put up with the client. if i pick up a game in 2020 and the client is like this, im out instantly.\nthe current playerbase is just kinda used to it.","replies":[]}]}
