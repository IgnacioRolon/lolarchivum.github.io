I like playing a game every day, but for some reason, whenever I click the icon on my desktop, a little info box pops up saying (ver badum) that \"Another instance of the launcher is running, do you want to terminate it?\" I click yes, but even when another one isnt running, it says this, not a huge problem, the game works fine. The big problem is when I am logging in, I enter in my password, and it loads, and then crashes instantly after.\r\n\r\nAnybody know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:58:37.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect your client may be frequently disconnecting from the platform service, causing it to both not come up and to crash entirely.
