In the example given above, we would try to initiate on the enemy team (once we hit 6) and they just kited backwards every time. They had us constantly pushed to turret (via Heimer, AP Janna, and Caitlyn Q), they constantly poked at us (like playing a bullet hell game, if I wanted that I&#039;d play Touhou).\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s also the fact that, in blind pick, you can have the same champion on both teams (the dreaded mirror matchup). Since ARAM is Blind Pick, if it were truly random, there would be mirror matchups from time to time. Not only have I never seen an ARAM mirror matchup, but neither have ANY of the people I have spoken with about the matter.\r\n\r\nAdd in the number of times that I&#039;ve rerolled a champion, only to see it on the other team when the game starts up, and I get the feeling that a pool of ~20 or so champions are picked prior to the champ select starting, the dishing out the champions from there. With the number of OBSCENELY one sided games I&#039;ve seen, I&#039;d also say it &quot;randomly&quot; places the champions on their teams based on synergy (at least to some extent).\r\n\r\nEverything I&#039;ve seen thus far completely dissuades me from trying to play another ARAM, because it honestly makes me feel like Riot has determined which team should win, and then 5 people are lucky before the game even starts. This doesn&#039;t make for even a remotely fun game in, what should be, a &quot;specifically for fun&quot; game mode.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nAlso: Leona","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-07-05T06:32:13.836+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"During the pool party event i had 48 champions available\nFirst 3 games with a group of 5\nVlad\nVarus\nVarus\nI take a break and the next ARAM game i play\nVlad\nI think it's essentially random blind draft which actually narrows the pool a bit.

If you want to make the argument that it's unfair because you might not know the champion, than the opposite is true. What happens when a player gets their main champion in aram, is that fair to the other team? When you allow accounts with 10 champions only to play in a gamemode where balance isn't enforced properly, you ruin the whole point of the gamemode. It's ALL RANDOM ALL MID. Owning 10 op aram champions only isn't random, and makes for terribly one sided games.\n\nThe best solution is to stay true to the concept of aram. Everyone gets a random champion, regardless if they know how to play it or not, and not based on the champions they own. The games will be WAY more balanced because both team will probably end up with players playing champions they don't know. Aram isn't a learning ground, it isn't a tutorial, and I wouldn't recommend it to new players.","replies":[{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-07-06T10:57:54.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) I don't care if it's fair.
