The most common one that I'm seeing lately is that Gnar is OP because:\r\n\r\n- he is resourceless\r\n- he has a low CD Q that applies a slow\r\nand\r\n- he has an escape\r\n\r\nWhile these are somewhat valid points, some things that Bronze players may not think about (I surely didn't when I was in Bronze V) are that his Q CD is HELLA long if he doesn't catch his boomerang, his Q is EXTREMELY unlikely to hit you if he hits a minion with it first (remember the tutorial? \"Stay behind your minions\"). Lastly, of course, his hop is on a relatively long CD.\r\n\r\nHow many people in Bronze actually punish a Gnar if he uses his Hop? I know for a fact I wouldn't have done that when I was in Bronze.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, saying that a champion IS balanced because you stomped one pretty hard in your game has next to no meaning when you're in Bronze. Using the Gnar example again, certain game knowledge, such as positioning, is required to play Gnar well. If you're opponent doesn't have that ability, then it is only natural that they would get stomped, regardless of what champion they are on.\r\n\r\nSo, based on that, I don't think that lower level players should be barred from discussing matters of balance, I just don't think that their own gameplay is valid as an example in discussions of balance.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"DulyAppointed","date":"2014-12-08T04:31:36.340+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think it absolutely makes no sense.

It's not healthy for the game if a really easy champ is super powerful while only being counterable by high elo players, because that champ is still ruining the game for the low elo players.  All levels of play have to be considered when balancing unfortunately.  This is why you will never see perfect balance across all levels of play.  The pub stompers get nerfed because they are too strong against low elo players and that results in them being a tad bit weak in elite level play oftentimes.

A Bronze or silver player (even gold to some extent, Darius is stronger the lower you go though) however, will see Darius, think to themselves, \"well F***\", and proceed to not try kiting, or fail at kiting due to poor mechanics, and feed away. I know, because I was that feeder in MANY games when I was Bronze and Silver. I STILL have that issue with some champions, but I'm trying to work on it every game that I play.\n\nAs it turns out, Darius was overpowered upon release. However, it wasn't because you couldn't beat him in lane (as many a Bronze and Silver claimed), it was because of his ult, and how HORRIBLY good it was in teamfights mid to late game.\n\nThis is a great example because it shows that Bronze and Silver players CAN be right when discussing balance, they said he was OP, he was OP. However, using their gameplay as an example would suggest that Darius had issues outside of his ult if they, like me, fed him over and over again in lane.\n\nSo I say that everyone's opinion matters yes, but not everyone's gameplay does, because if you're just walking up to ANY CHAMPION and letting them kill you, of course they're going to stomp the game.

That means that he has it up every time until he uses it and doesn't get a kill.\n\nThis is true regardless of whether or not the Darius is fed though. Because let's say that there's a Darius and a Fiora. Both equal. They teamfight. They both ult and Darius gets his ult reset. The next teamfight Darius will have his ult while Fiora wont since her's has a long CD.\n\nWhile a Bronze player might not focus on on the actual problem with the champion as on the problem with the game they just played they will be able to identify it. \n\nI would also like to mention that this game is for everyone regardless of their rank.

If there is a trend for a champion to be \"stomping\" in lower elo there may be more to it than just a lack of knowledge of skill of the majority of the playerbase. What better way can you evaluate the power of champions if you cannot reflect on your own play, to tell people to think of their opinions as lesser greatly diminishes room for growth and understanding for the game.

Players of any elo will hold ignorant opinions of champions and bits and pieces of the actual truth when it comes to the actual balance of a said champion, it's just tha tin higher elo theres more likely a chance that reasonable counter play is developed because they've already been through those growing pains.\n\n I read these forums a lot and not every Diamond player agrees with their fellow diamond peers and that doesnt make them any more or less valid. If there's counter play or a reasonable argument to be made then allow everyone to present their case, don't encourage exclusion of opinion and unnecessary elitism because balance will never be a lightly debated issue.

So while you say that I'll defend myself by saying \"I didn't mean 'x'\", you're right, because you didn't understand what I was saying.\n\nI was saying that EVERY OPINION MATTERS, but the gameplay of said opinions do not necessarily matter when it comes to balance. Now, whether this be due to mechanical issues, or people not understanding things about the game, doesn't really matter.\n\nPeople in lower elos do not perform on champions well enough for the gameplay to be an indication of balance. Anyone, however, can watch a lot of the LCS and be able to see, at least to some extent (or even just look over the stats etc.) and be able to wage an opinion on the balance of a champion.\n\nAs an example, I'm Gold V. I don't see my gameplay as being important in the discussion of balance, simply because I know that I have flaws that would skew said balance (as do many MANY MANY people in Gold.) However, I still assert that Poppy will (and I told this to a friend of mine prior to the 4.20 patch) become more dominant with Patch 4.20. We saw some dominance from her in the IEM tournament where UoL used her against C9.\n\nHowever, this particular example has nothing to do with why I feel she will become dominant. Why? Because I theorize that she'll become more dominant because of the changes to the regen stat. With the regen stat being the most effective way to make Poppy tanky with her passive, I feel like the changes to HP regen will bring her to the point where Morello will completely annihilate her (and UoL built no regen on Poppy in that game).\n\nJust my thoughts on your post.","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceArchie","date":"2014-12-08T05:51:03.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To quickly touch on my comment in regards to you defending yourself, I didn't want to engage in that because it would be a moot side conversation that would delve into personal opinion of manners, decency, self respect and so forth. Our opinions on such things probably greatly differ and thus wouldn't edify the conversation and only cause friction I just wanted to express what I gathered from your post, knowing it would end up in agreeing to disagree. With that being said I understand your logic behind lower elo game play and like you I watch alot of pro play as well as read alot of guides and such. I don't know many things and I learn a lot with every viewing, read and new champion I pick up. While I do not see my individual success in solo queue as concrete evidence of character balance, I do not make the mistake of discrediting my impact, my peers impact and my overall experience in my current elo as it regards the strength of champions. Doing so results in two things.\n\n-**You start to think that Champions are totally fine and blame others (or yourself) for failure or success.\n-You do not seek a greater understanding of the meta, why it is, and it's possible future changes because what you pcik doesnt matter at your elo**.\n\nYou cannot watch pros and think you know how to play because you watch pros, you need to devlop yourself in practice and discrediting the majority if not all of your personal observation sets you back a lot. Yes you will quite often stumble upon something you feel is imbalance but will either not understand fully the reasons for the outcome or completely miss it altogether. But failure to understand and learning from that misunderstanding is better than keeping yourself in ignorance and stumping your own intellect. No matter what elo you are one thing remains constant in League and that is the expanding/renewing of your mind. \n\nTo be better at league you must learn and understand things. You must research things  and stumble upon crucial things the average or casual player does not find in their everyday play so early. You need to discover the game for yourself, their is no guide to success. I don't think the message you want to get across is wrong, it's just poorly worded. In short I agree lower elo players shouldnt use their performances as the primary basis for \"truth\" in the game. Much of thier experiences will be unrefined, however they need to compare and contrast in order to gain a discernment and understanding. Thus by engaging with thier own experiences while keeping in mind the circumstances of those experiences value can be taken, even in the most suboptimal of scenarios.","replies":[{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-12-08T06:52:10.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To some extent, you're absolutely right.

It's important to know how well/poorly a champion does from every aspect, not just from a Diamond+ game play stance. And how does one attain that? Through game play.\n\nI get what you're saying (Least I think), but its difficult to really offer a proper legitimate opinion on something without game play experience. Furthermore, its difficult to take a person's opinion seriously when they don't have the experience or game play.\n\nIt would be like my friends who don't play ice hockey trying to tell me what the best equipment to get is based on watching NHL, some things work in professional or higher level of play that simply don't work at lower play, in my case D3 level college hockey, I could explain, but that's not important. \n\nPoint being, I'm not going to listen to them over my own 18 years of experience because I know what I see in professional play does not translate to my own play. Which is about the same for LoL. The job for Riot and for those of us who are interested in balance are to weed through which ones are legitimate and which ones are nothing more then \"OMG WTF champ is HAXOR\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nubeel","date":"2014-12-08T12:52:35.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a B1 player.
