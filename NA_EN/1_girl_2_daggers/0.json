Does my honor not reset with the new season even tho I got banned in pre-season?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T04:52:14.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor ranks 2+ were reset back to a certain checkpoint depending on which rank they were. Accounts which were dishonorable and placed at rank 1/0 haven't had those negative honor ranks reset just like regular punishments aren't reset at a new season. You still need to show consistent reform by not repeating the same type of behavior or language that warranted the report or punishment.","replies":[]}]}
