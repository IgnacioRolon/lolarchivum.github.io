The camera would get stuck in the beginning of the game at fountain. I really would like you to fix this so gameplay could be better.It would mean that you would have to restart and reconnect sometimes and it will give you low priority ques some of the times you reconnect.\n\nI have found a way to fix it but you cant free roam with it. Press the camera button 2 times so it can lock on to your Champion.","replies":[{"poster":"KatarinaScriptz","date":"2015-08-03T11:53:01.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for Grammar.\n\nPost your comments on how you feel about this.","replies":[]}]}
