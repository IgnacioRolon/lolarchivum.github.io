I thought maybe it was just a bug with the shockblade zed skin, but when i went into a game with the classic skin on, he doesn&#039;t make any noise at all, no matter what he does. Is anyone else having this problem, where Zed isn&#039;t making noise no matter what he does, or what&#039;s going on??","replies":[{"poster":"Faceless Jack","date":"2015-06-04T16:06:00.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kateykhaos there has been a “game breaking” bug with {{champion:238}} w+q combo, where his q doesn’t go out of his w which can lose you the lane and make bad trades, it’s just very toxic and many zed mains like myself has to struggle with this bug, please fix it, much love.","replies":[{"poster":"Vaati006","date":"2015-06-04T18:10:40.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to rethink your use of the word \"toxic\" there, \"toxic\" is usually used to describe players being salty, malicious trolls.
