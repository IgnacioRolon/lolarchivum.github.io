The buildup is the hunt and the chase for the kill, ~1:32 is the kill shot/climax, and then the rest is Jhin immersing himself in the beauty of the kill and celebrating the majestic end of another life.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"stealthfox94","date":"2016-02-01T01:55:35.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best since Lucian's theme song. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agEbNaQhmog","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baedaf","date":"2016-02-01T01:18:27.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree this is one of best they've ever produced.  I only have one minor dislike for it, and it's that they didn't use the gun sounds throughout.  The quieter choir/violin portion still sounds amazing, but felt a bit disjointed when spliced into the second half of the song.  I almost want two songs for him: one all guns and threatening sounds, and a second emphasizing his dramatic flare.","replies":[]}]}
