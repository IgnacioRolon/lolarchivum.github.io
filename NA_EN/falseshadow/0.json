League client loaded up normally but didn't show any LP gained or my previous match in my match history. I restarted the client and now it thinks I'm still in a game and is asking me to reconnect, but there's no game to reconnect to.\r\n\r\nIf someone could look into this for me I would be grateful, as I can't play until it is fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Falseshadow","date":"2016-07-21T19:14:55.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's now been over an hour and I'm still locked out due to this bug.

I got done with a normal game with friends a couple hours ago and have the same problem. Skipped the post game lobby because it refused to load. Then me and my friends are unable to play because the \"game is still in progress please reconnect\". Press the reconnect button and you get an endless black screen. Relog multiple times and still have the same message. Me AND my friends are having this problem. None of us can play.","replies":[{"poster":"Falseshadow","date":"2016-07-21T20:10:46.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've taken a look and at least a couple other people have had similar issues. It's now been over 2 hours and I'm still having the same problem, hopefully someone takes a look at it soon. If nothing is done and I'm still locked out after 4 hours have passed I may re-post this in the bug report forum.","replies":[{"poster":"Falseshadow","date":"2016-07-21T21:25:57.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game lockout issue appears to have cleared up, whether by itself or if someone helped I don't really know, but hopefully it does not happen again. We'll see what happens over the next few games.\n\nHowever I still cannot see my game in the match history, and I still didn't gain any LP from the match. It seems that the match glitched out in the end and I will not get any credit for my win.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-21T22:17:46.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For your specific issue, it seems that the server had a problem which caused it to not record the game correctly and not report it to PvP.net. It's unfortunate that it happened to you, and that the match cannot be manually recorded after the fact.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Falseshadow","date":"2016-07-22T02:59:24.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no specific questions but thank you for checking on the issue. I just want to make sure you're aware of the problem so a fix might be worked out in the future, if that's even possible.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
