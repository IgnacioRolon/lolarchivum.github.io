This makes perfect sense considering the outdated nature of most splashes post-rework. \r\n\r\nThis is my question though: will splash arts that are for champions not slated for reworks (Karthus, Rammus, Kennen, etc.) be updated at some point like the 2 Yi splashes (Chosen and Assassin) that were updated few months ago?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T17:29:17.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course! Just because a champion isn't slated for a champion update doesn't mean that they'll be left in the dust. Unfortunately, I don't have info to share regarding who/when.","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-02-09T18:04:33.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assumed that would be the case, but you never know.
