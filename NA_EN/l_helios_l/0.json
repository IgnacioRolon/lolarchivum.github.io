For the same reasons she would be bothered by a compulsive gambler or alcoholic. He is doing the same thing over and over -- because he can&#039;t help himself. Hidden in Jhin&#039;s lines you can find the hints that he knows he&#039;s a monster and want&#039;s to stop...but can&#039;t.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis...is just awesome. My fear after seeing Jhin was that he would be a one-dimensional guy who just loves killing for the sake of some perverted passion, kind of like Shaco. But after paying due attention to his VO, I noticed a trend:\r\n\r\n&quot;I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time.&quot; - he wants to stop, but he finds himself unable to break the cycle; he feels trapped\r\n&quot;I am a slave to this passion.&quot; - captivity within killing; inability to escape\r\n&quot;There is nothing for me but this.&quot; - futility in trying to do something else; again, captivity\r\n&quot;My work asks questions, it never has answers.&quot; - futility in pursuing this passion; he will never get any answers by killing, and he knows this\r\n&quot;I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do.&quot; - euphoria in killing; a desire to experience euphoria and happiness\r\n&quot;It is only when the gun fires that I am alive.&quot; - euphoric emotions when killing; indicates this is the only place where he gets this\r\n&quot;I envy silence... because I must be loud.&quot; - silence often means peace; Jhin can never have this because he feels forced to be loud, i.e. chaotic\r\n&quot;Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire.&quot; - killing/his art is his only source of happiness\r\n&quot;This... passion... compels me.&quot; - he feels forced to follow his passion; a lighter sense of enslavement\r\n\r\nJhin always seems to be trapped within his own passion for creating this art in killing. He&#039;s not in any way ignorant of it though, as WAAARGHbobo said. It&#039;s evident that Jhin feels alive (or enters a state akin to some type of extreme euphoria) when he is killing and equates it to artwork. Jhin finds his identity in this and thus feels trapped within it, compulsively following this passion because it&#039;s the only thing that gives him any sense of being alive. Jhin finds himself enslaved by his art and has been doing it for so long, he knows of no way to free himself from it; it&#039;s all he&#039;s known for so long. When someone lives in a cage for a long enough time, they can&#039;t leave even if they want to. This is Jhin&#039;s mentality. He know&#039;s what he does is wrong, that he should stop, and that he wants to stop, but he can&#039;t. \r\n\r\nIn this, we have a dynamic character who feels a sense of depression in that he can&#039;t escape his art, but at the same time it gives him enough satisfaction that he is able to lose touch with reality during his artwork. In the same manner as a drunkard who escapes the pains of his life through inebriation, Jhin escapes his feeling of captivity and the futility of his passion in the euphoria he gets from killing. This aspect of his character is so amazing and dynamic that it creates a fully rounded character that has multiple facets of personality, which is way cool for me. I personally love these types of characters who have a crazy side but still try to cling to humanity as much as possible.\r\n\r\nEveryone has hardships in life, and everyone tries to escape them through something. Some have religion, some have alcohol, some have art, and some have murder.\r\n\r\nAnd others have video games.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-02-04T23:32:26.881+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"ThanX!.

It also made him become really terrifying to me. His voice actor also did a great job, because his voice is the only voice in LoL that actually comes off as scary to me. Most of them just sound mysterious... Shaco's lore is definitely spooky, but his voice is more comical (which does make since since he is a demon JESTER). :)\n\nThe first thing I noticed in my first game against Jhin was his voice and then his movements. Really sparked my understanding of him. This is clearly a result of good communication between art/lore/animation teams, probably.","replies":[{"poster":"Brenticus12","date":"2016-02-06T11:40:54.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most chilling piece of voice over is when he hums at the beginning of the game.\n\nIt makes my skin crawl.","replies":[{"poster":"Civil Dawn","date":"2016-02-07T05:38:53.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Brenticus12,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=IjsgAJp5,comment-id=000400010000,timestamp=2016-02-06T11:40:54.518+0000)\n>\n> The most chilling piece of voice over is when he hums at the beginning of the game.\n> \n> It makes my skin crawl.\n\nYeah, chilling is a great word to describe it haha","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-02-05T09:21:08.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As strange as it may sound, when I actually realised the amount of depth in his character....\nI'm even more hyped for Yorick.\nFor his gameplay, for the way he will look, but also for his backstory and character.\n\nAnyhow, now that I'm posting something anyway, Amazing job on Jhin!\nI'm not much of a marksman player myself, but just reading all the posts like this...\nGod you have created an awesome character\n{{summoner:31}} \n\nPS I just realised my english might not be 100% on point.

Maybe he is interested in pursuing a less volatile form of art, or simply tired of doing the same thing over and over, but I sincerely doubt he wishes to stop because killing is socially unacceptable.\n\nJhin is insane, at least from the perspective of the general population, and it manifests most clearly in his lack of empathy. He feels nothing for others outside of how he can use them to create art. WAAARGHbobo noted that Jhin is \"kill-sexual\" or \"gun-sexual\" implying his only interest rests with his work, which in turn provides evidence of an asocial or anti-social attitude.\n\nHe may be human, but any humanity Jhin might retain is nearly incompatible with our own conception of the concept; less than a man, more than a monster.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=UltimoMark3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=IjsgAJp5,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-04T17:07:30.159+0000)\n>\n> Everyone has hardships in life, and everyone tries to escape them through something.

Characters where they're just pure evil for the sake of being pure evil. Jhin does a great job of avoiding that, in my opinion.\n\nI think one of my favorite archetypes of characters is one where the person is good natured, but circumstances have forced their hand against their nature, and they feel remorse and regret over it. Some examples of those would be Hotchner from Criminal Minds, ASGORE from Undertale, Sans from Undertale, and many other characters. \n\nI mean, just listening to [Asgore's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfgmMPke7_k), you can hear the regret and sorrow in it, especially the solmn-ness in the Bergentrückung beginning.. It's upbeat because it's a boss battle, yet the entire time you feel his pain. His kingdom/race lost their home and were plunged into the Underground because of humans. He lost two children in one night, because of humans yet again. He feels pressured to save the monsters from the Underground, so he declares any human who comes into the Underground will be killed to collect souls in order to free the monsters. His wife leaves him because she's disgusted by his choice of declaring that... and then you come along... Innocent, trying to do the right thing, sparking the good nature we know he has.. He doesn't want to kill you... But he has to. Eventually he can't do it anymore. He's quick to help you, offering you a home and family. And before you fight him, he even feels the need to offer you a cup of tea. Indicating that he's actually a really nice guy. Some of the fan [remixes ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AbK8YII0qM&list=FL0yZl-7ON0WBJB1Tj96wmzQ&index=2)of ASGORE really show through what I mean.\n\nAnother archetype I like is the determined one, where they feel the undying need to put others' needs before their own, even when it ultimately hurts them. Some examples of this would be {{champion:201}} {{champion:16}}, Toriel from Undertale, Undyne from Undertale definitely, maybe {{champion:22}}, etc. I like that one a lot because I know people just like that in real life.\n\nA third archetype I like is one where the character tries to generally do good, but is naive or young, and sometimes makes mistakes or maybe APPEARS to be naive but is really quite capable...
