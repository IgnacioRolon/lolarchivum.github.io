It's funny, it worked OK in the first few days because people were actually using \"fill\", but no longer - everyone learned their lesson. Here are the problems:\n\n1. **The \"Fill\" role _IS _\"Support\".** There is literally no difference between the two buttons. Both result in you getting Support.\n2. **You cannot choose support (or fill) as your \"second option\".** Doing so will result in you playing your first option 0% of the time. The last 50 games I played were all support because I want to play Jungle primarily and Support secondarily. That's what I want to do, and so that's what I select, and yet I play nothing but support.\n\n**SOLUTIONS**\n\n**Solution**: _Force some weighted randomization between the roles chosen._ So if I say I want Jungle | Support, then when I do, roll an RNG that's like 60% Jungle, 40% Support. Don't tell the player which one got chosen, but if it chose Jungle, now you just sit and wait until a Jungle spot opens. This is a pretty good solution in my opinion. Wait times go up a bit, but players have an experience similar to what they would expect from your system.\n\n**Bad solution**: _Own it._ This would involve deleting \"fill\" as an option and making it so that if you make Support as a secondary or primary option, you can not select any other options. Basically this would be Riot essentially admitting that no one wants to play Support.\n\n**Solution**: _Provide IP rewards for playing roles that are less popular._  This is also kind of bad because you're similarly acknowledging that you have roles that people don't want to play, but it might be a good stop-gap for the next thing.\n\n**Great, hard solution**: _Make support something people actually want to play._ This would be a huge project, but I would say you can start by deleting all of this extra fanfare regarding getting kills. Delete the \"multi kill\" shit. When you have this giant banner that comes on the screen saying PENTAKILL, it sends a clear signal that the game is really all about getting kills. In fact, it is not about getting kills at all. The team with fewer kills can and sometimes does win. So by putting focus on kills - something support shouldn't be doing - you're basically telling your audience that support is a lame role to play.\n\nI feel pretty confident that Riot will do something about this - it's pretty obviously not working properly - but looking forward to seeing what they specifically do.","replies":[{"poster":"Comrade Napoleon","date":"2016-02-21T05:55:17.081+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot should see this and consider the solutions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-02-20T18:55:15.804+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my biggest gripe with the new system.\n\nIf you are an XXXXX Primary main with a support secondary main, this new system is basically telling you I hope you don't mind becoming a support main. \n\nI wouldn't mind if they at least take awhile to at least LOOK for my primary role availability.

I know people say you can carry on support but I've found that in the depths of bronze 5 I cant trust my adc to know how tower aggro works, much less use the double kill he has been gifted. Long story short, I (in theory) would Q up as Jg Support, as my love for both came from my poor habit of focusing too hard on csing and tunneling on creeps all game. But If I want to play JG i cant Q up as support. The funny thing is if I put top, mid, or adc as my primary and Jg as my secondary ill get jg 7/10 games, but support is so much worse than jg in terms of getting it that even with JG, the job that is 2nd worse in terms of getting stuck into it all the time, as my primary roll i still have almost all my games as support. I think part of the problem is how support works. If my top laner goes teemo and my jg goes shaco, i can't go sona. because then it is my fault that we dont have a tank. Sightstone pisses me off so much. Sightstone is such a broken item and also my least favorite item in the game. Because of how good it is I usually have to get sightstone first item. By the time I have sightstone and boots and either the shitty sightstone gold item if i lost or the normal items if we won lane, teamfights are starting and Its too late for me to build something I want to build i have to get those broken support items that are way too op but no fun at all (Locket, old rightous Glory). Support has some of the most broken items in the game, but none of them are fun in any way. My main champ is Alistar. It is so fun to flash, headbut Q into the enemy team and set up a great start to a fight, but i cant do that. I have to spend my game after lv 6 sitting on my adc and using my knock up if the talon gets close. If I do the first thing we win the fight sometimes, The second thing is a 90% winrate. It feels like support is the job where the most boring thing is the best thing. I want to play support and feel like I passed the ball to someone for the winning shot, or stuffed a shot in basketball.
