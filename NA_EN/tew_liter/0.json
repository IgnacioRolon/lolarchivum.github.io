But I think I have to be honest to the fact that im never going to be able to clim my way out of silver in sup It a miracle I managed to even get out of bronze. But if I ever want to actually get good at this game Im going to have to give up playing support.","replies":[{"poster":"LothÃ rs Edge","date":"2017-06-30T18:23:34.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not that good and I reached plat with support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pie Cubed","date":"2017-06-30T18:26:36.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, a good support makes or breaks a team. Mechanically, it's pretty simple. But the macro required makes it a higher skill floor role. If you can provide everything your team doesn't, you should be able to climb. A good support carries their ADC, not the other way around, especially in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-30T18:51:54.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pie Cubed,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=d4QAANZO,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-30T18:26:36.283+0000)\n>\n> A good support carries their ADC, not the other way around, especially in lane.\n\nI agree, when I'd play botlane I'd always notice if I'd lose as ADC it was because I had a bad support, and if I'd lose as a support it was because I played poorly. I have never lost a game because the ADC was bad, but I did lose lots because the support was bad. \n\nI only played Zyra (occasionally Morg) so that might have something to do with it though.","replies":[]}]}]}
