But if you have people telling others to \"KYS\" well guess what, people will say it too. I dont want you to hover over my generation (millenials) but I want you, RIOT, to be responsible for the content in your games. Once that starts to leak out in the real world, we have people with mental illness, and in your country, guns. Its not really a big surprise that those people who are able to acquire a gun, go ape shit and kill people. Thank god I live in Canada where its hard to acquire a gun. Unfortunately, these things arent really far fetched. Its pretty eye opening. Your community doesnt get your charade, and thats dangerous.\r\n\r\nRemove KYS in your game.","replies":[]}
