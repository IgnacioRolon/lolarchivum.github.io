Usually, it's something like Discord Overlays or some other program, so I would start by turning off any programs that might have an overlay feature or just turning off the program entirely. Test it in a custom/practice game and let me know how it works without background programs interfering!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Splatyo","date":"2018-02-09T04:08:01.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy shit tahnk you it was discord","replies":[]},{"poster":"ÁrYaN","date":"2018-01-18T02:46:08.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too :(","replies":[{"poster":"ÁrYaN","date":"2018-01-18T03:22:41.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So after restarting my pc windows did a little update and it's working fine after","replies":[]}]}]}
