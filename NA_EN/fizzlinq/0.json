The next game I play will be totally normal from start to finish. The only recent change I made to my computer was installing a pci internet card, but this happened once before I even installed that (I am 99% sure at least). I haven't made any other changes to settings, I've updated drivers, repaired league, messed with settings within league, but can't seem to find the source/problem. Anyone else experience this and have any solutions?\r\n\r\nIn case new drivers have a bug or something, I have an i5 6600k + RX 480 8GB","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2017-12-28T00:16:18.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your config might be messed up.
