Today I logged into LoL to find my account on my pc is Chief Burg which I never transferred and I don't know how to switch it back. I believe this is due to me using the same Microsoft account on both my pc and laptop. Also when I login in on the internet as I'm doing now the account is also Chief Burg. Please help.\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T22:14:53.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh it sounds like you might be a little confused about the different between your username and your Summoner name.

It looks like your Summoner name is Cheif Burg and the other name is your username.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-04-24T22:18:32.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now he needs to change it because we all know. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}
