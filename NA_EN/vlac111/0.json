Go to start menu, in run(search) write cmd, than when window open write ipconfig, find your default Gateway and paste that number on your internet browser, tape your username and password if u dont know your username and password, contact your internet provider to find out.\n2. Than when you open your router settings go to advance/Nat/port triggering and remove all custom ports if u have any ( I had port like 16000) and I removed it and problem with disk.cab error expired.\n3. When you install the game, than if u cant log in try the solution- Open internet explorer/open tools/internet option/advance/ and scroll down and remove Use SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 and put the correct to the use TLS 1.0 and apply/OK.\n\nlp\n\nI hope you understand what I wanted to say and it helps u solve the problem.
