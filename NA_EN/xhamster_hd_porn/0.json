I downloaded the PBE client, followed every step and looked at multiple discussions to no avail. I got a PBE account and when I tried to login, it didn't work. It said I had invalid credentials. I tried for about 20 minutes and finally got in. Yay! Seems the problem is solved right? Nope. I change my summoner name and then bam. My game crashes. I come back and then I try to log in again. I CANT LOGIN ANYMORE!!! IT STILL SAYS INVALID CREDENTIALS!!! BEEN GOING AT IT FOR AN HOUR SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T22:52:36.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty weird. Try changing your password to something completely different to see if this still happens. Also be sure you're launching League from the executable in the installation folder for the PBE rather than any other shortcut created.\n\nLet me know if either of those suggestions caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
