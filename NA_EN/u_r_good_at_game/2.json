Yes, I believe the current ranking system allows you to get to your deserved elo but it elongates the process much more than it needs to. Your solo queue / dynamic queue rank is supposed to rank you based on your player skill. This is hard to achieve when the ranking system currently ranks you based on your team&#039;s skill in that match up. Yes eventually RNG will even out and you will be at your deserved rank but it stalls and takes much longer than it needs to due to the matchmaking of random teammates of all ages, maturities, intellect, standards, thoughts, priorities (in and out of game), mental stability at the time (on tilt, depressed, tired, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\nYour solo/dynamic queue rank should reflect how you as a player are improving at the games mechanic. Not if you can lead your team to victory against another team. This is for pre-made 5&#039;s and 3&#039;s which have returned. In pre-made 5&#039;s/3&#039;s you have the practice, time and compatibility to be able to efficiently work as a team. That is something you just do have in a solo game.  As we know, riot tracks everything our champ does in-game and alot of that info is kept on the after game report. I think instead of a simple win = lp and loss = -lp they need to reward you for showing good gameplay and punish you for showing bad gameplay. That is the point of solo/dynamic ranked. To rank a player based on his/her ability, not the team&#039;s.\r\n\r\n(note: I am about to give an extremely simplified version of the system and of course it needs crazy work and refinement. Think about the principle, not the specifics)\r\n\r\n**In this system **you would start every game with 0 lp on a scale of -30 to +30 or so. Good behavior would gain points. Bad behavior would lose points. Wins would give points. Losses would take points. This way working as a team to lose/win still matters but it won&#039;t completely screw you over if you have shown higher elo gameplay and still lost. The system would say even though you lost, your ability as a player was so exemplary that you deserve to gain lp. \r\n\r\n**Here are things that would gain points in theory:** Kills, Assists, Wards placed that pick up an enemy, wards destroyed, multi-kills, multi-assists, towers, dragons, barons, having high cs for your champion/role in your elo (For example, if your ahri mid, the system would take the average cs for all ahri mid&#039;s in your elo to determine if you have good, high or low cs), Aces, high damage based on champ/role/elo, high healing based on champ/role/elo, tank champions having higher damage taken while still having a low amount of deaths, killing or ccing an enemy that was about to kill an ally, winning, etc.\r\n\r\nThe above rewards you for having a good KDA (kills + assists / deaths), smart vision, vision denial, objective control, high stats on that champion based on role and elo, team fighting, saving teammates, etc. Is that not what league of legends is about???\r\n\r\n**Things that would take points in theory:** Deaths, Low stats (damage done, healing done, gold per minute, etc) for your champ, role and elo, losing drag, losing a tower, losing baron, having low cs for your role/champ (for supports it would probably be gold per minute), getting aced, teammates dying near you in a fight, having a ward destroyed, placing a ward that picks up no enemies before it is replaced or expires, getting hit by skill shot  and non targeted CC,  losing etc.\r\n\r\nOf course for both of these, those probably won&#039;t be the only things and riot would come up with some algorithm that blows my system out of the water but the core principle still stands. Reward the player for good gameplay for his elo, punish him for bad gameplay for his elo. I think you will find a much faster climb this way. The above rewards you for having a good KDA (kills + assists / deaths), smart vision, vision denial, objective control, high stats on that champion based on role and elo, team fighting, saving teammates, and much more. Sure you still lose points on the scale but if you played really well for your elo you would still have an oppourtunity to break even at 0 lp or even gain points because you showed improvement as a player.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Phelas","date":"2016-09-20T13:23:06.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your system is more flawed than the current one, you can't just make people climb just by analyzing their stats.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-09-20T19:01:18.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And how does a win do more? A win shows nothing but a team taking the nexus. No skill, no improvement, no nothing. Hell, alot of times you can climb by playing the tankiest mofo and then just not feeding and wait for your team to carry you. Oh but I guess that is skill right? no.\n\nStats will always be more accurate than wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Phelas","date":"2016-09-21T06:03:10.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But thats how MOBAs work!\nSome people are the damage dealers, some are the ones taking the shit for the damage dealers. All have to workt TOGETHER to accomplish a win.\nYou can't say, just because im playing Nautilus and dealing next to 0 damage, i don't have \"skill\". \nAs long as i bring in my CC, i have put something to that win, so i deserve it too.\n\nI should not be rewarded less than my midlaner or adc, just because i have like 8 deaths, less kills, less damage and fewer cs.\nBonuspoint: It's also somewhat skill not to die in your lane, is it? \n\nYour system turns the game into an \"everyone for himself\" kind of environment, this has nothing to do with the spirit of MOBA games.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-09-22T22:44:36.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my section all of these problems are covered....\n\nLets look at your tank example:\n\n1. Damage is based of champion AND role across all of your elo for THAT champion and THAT role. Meaning if you play naut jg, you will be compared to other naut jg's. Not a kha'zix or other damage dealer.....\n\n2. Tanking also has rewards. If you tank more than the average naut jg while maintaining reasonable deaths, this means you are able to block damage for your team without being forced into giving the opponent gold, thus the system rewards you.\n\n3. Hitting shots rewards you while missing punishes you. So even if your doing bad at damage and tanking for Naut JG in your elo, if you have crazy 100% accuracy while hitting champs you can possibly still at least break even. Maybe.\n\n4. \"everyone for himself\"? Your simply rewarding preformance > carry. This current ranked system is the epitome of \"everyone for himself\". That is why the videos and streams are called \"how to play as a team and climb\" they are called \"how to carry your team and climb\".\n\nThis current system does nothing but causes players to want to be the carries. That is why mid lane is constantly 20% longer queue. Why trust mid lane to someone in SoloQ when you can be the mid lane and carry your team? Why play support when it's one of the harder lanes to carry from? Ever wonder why the most popular to least popular roles are the ones that are easiest to hardest to carry from? because that is LoL in it's current state. League of Carry. Hell, at least in overwatch if you win and still play like shit youll only gain maybe 5 points. I can feed my ass off, afk, and/or dc and let my team carry me for 20+ lp. Oh that reflects my skill? Feeding or leaving and allowing my team to win is skill? Didn't think so.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T06:29:55.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, i see this more as a thing that punishes certain playstyles. an Example would be someone like Trick2g. He tends to die alot, but will get something out of it most times like his team was able to get an obj or towers while he distracted the enemy team even though he died.\n\nTbh, this system would more or less bring out the worst in people and make games so much longer as people will be too K/D/A worries and try to stack up CS to get ahead in this system. Rewards Flat in your face things but doesn't reward the behind the scene type of things.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-09-20T06:34:52.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your rewarded for towers. In my systems towers/drag/heralds/barons would be worth more points then kills/assists. So if trick2g died he would lose points for the death but gain more points for a tower being taken on the map. This is because for trick2g to die this means at least one enemy was attacking him and this enemy could not defend the tower that was destroyed.\n\nAlso, deaths by minions and creeps would be worth double lp loss so the system isn't exploited.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T06:38:58.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, Let's alter the situation to the point that trick2g was in a lane and just randomly died, but it just so happened at the same time his bot lane took the tower.  It's an overall same situation but with a different backstory... How is it treated then? and how would it detect how this would have happened instead of the 1st scenario listed?","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-09-20T06:42:21.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know if the server added my edit but dying by minions, creeps, baron, dragon would be worth more lp loss to outweigh the lp gained by tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T06:47:16.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never said it was a minion/ objective that killed him. It's one of those coincidence type of situations, because you aren't going to send 5 people to defend a t2 tower and let everyone on the map be free for whatever, Do the other laners get credit for this also? he just randomly tried to tower dive and the jungler was clearing a camp and went top and counter gank, and bot took the tower cause enemy bot had backed. \n\nThe point is, how would your system actually detect whether or not certain things were intentional or not?\n\nIm not trying to say your system is bad, i'm just curious as to how it would handle these type of situations that could have any outcome based off any origin but took the same path to get to the conclusion.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-09-20T07:01:43.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a tower is taken on the map everyone would get credit at some level. balancing how much credit each player gets depending on what would be up to a seasoned game designer. The general thought though is, if your team is applying enough pressure around the map so that the enemy team cannot stop a tower from being taken without laners getting advantages then that is good map pressure gameplay resulting in points.\n\nIn the second scenario, they would get credit because the jungler was forced top lane because of the enemy top laner attempting a tower dive and the enemy mid laner had so much pressure on mid that he could not roam down to bot. These are both good gameplay. Had the top laner not dived and recalled the JG could have went bot. If the enemy mid laner didn't have pressure the mid laner could roam. If the enemy bot lane didnt force the bot lane to back they wouldn't be in the predicament in the first place. \n\nI can't get much more specific because I am not a Systems Designer, Programmer, nor do I have acess to riot's gameplay API to play test these systems. Try to use the core principle instead of specific situations because I am sure a seasoned designer and programmer that had direct access to thousands of playtesters and direct control of the clients code would be able to figure out the kinks.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:06:44.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmk, i understand what you're saying and was just wondering as because like i said 100 different scenarios with the same path and such.\n\nJust feels more or less like a judging contest, but that's just my opinion, the idea of it overall is nice though to a degree","replies":[{"poster":"D3M4L1S","date":"2016-09-20T07:24:08.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's an excelent idea, have a team vote at the end of match for best overall player.

But overall I think this would work out it let's the team decide who the best player was.\n\nThey could use the system they have in place, god knows how that works.
