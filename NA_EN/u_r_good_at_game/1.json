Zed presses R at level 6 with 0 kills and 100 - 0 me unless I take barrier. Leblanc just freezes lane and Q W W(her ult) me until I have to back or just die. Do I just need to tough it out until the rework because it seems like they are adressing my issues above in the rework. It gets so bad that I can basically afk under tower and they are still strong enough to full dive as soon as they are 6. Their isn&#039;t really a risk to play them unless they are against hard cc like Annie or some crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-10-18T06:45:24.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So your mistakes are picking champs who dont have the reaction time or escape availability. I havent heard anyone have trouble with zed because {{item:3157}} , but regardless. If lb QWR's then she sucks. QRW is a lot more efficient and a lot easier to land imo. I dont recall zed being in the assassin update so im just going to discuss this briefly, his ONE escape has a very VERY high cd until at least lv 15, his q is easy to dodge, if he ults you,  literally flash and suddenly he does no damage with death mark. Cass, beats zed early has a hard time mid game, and its a skill matchup late, depending on summs and itemization. Karthus... Dude.. karth is actually really trash against a lot of champions rn so idk what to tell you tbh. TF, eh, skill matchup again but their early games are both kinda garbage damage wise but tf can stay in lane longer withe asier waveclear.\nOkay now lets get to lb\nLiterally, lb beats all of them if she is good. I never understood why people pick immobile mages into hyper mobile assassins.\nKarth and tf : Play safe, pray she doesnt get fed and falls off late game.\nCass, if you can land w, you win trades, if not, you die.\n\n\nAlso Don't say \"Annie or some crap\" As if it isnt smart to play a stron g burst mage. Dps against an assassin is decent, but a strong burst cc champ is amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-10-18T06:55:05.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never said it wasn't smart. I'm just not trying to play something stupidly broken rn. Annie being an example. She has held near top win rate for mid for like 20 consecutive patches. I never liked using the god tier approach to climbing or winning. Seems cheap to me. Meh maybe that's why LB and zed shit on me.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-10-18T07:46:27.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i agree completely, \"pogchamps\" arent really my cup of tea, but that doesnt mean you shouldnt check counters.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-10-18T10:49:10.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Barrier is good against burst. Take it over Ignite or ghost against 100-0 burst champs.\nImmobile midlaners are very weak to mobile assassins.\nYou don't beat them 1v1. You farm up, and wait for ganks so you can 2v1 (or better if other lanes roam too).\n\nChampions have bad lane matchups. This means other champions have good lane matchups. Understanding how to play into bad lanes is an important thing to learn.\nUnderstanding you can't win lane without help from your team is the first step to learning how to play into counter matchups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2016-10-18T10:07:46.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put your head between your legs and kiss your butt goodbye...\n\nThen when the game is finished go out and buy Lissandra or Kayle","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-10-18T07:44:24.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure on LB, but Kayle is decent vs zed without relying on hard cc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalizard","date":"2016-10-18T06:42:02.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tf is good against them if played well, take second spell exhaust so You will survive after they go in for you, you have adventage for few first levels and then play def, wait for your ult to roam or do it even without ult. His power is about that you can't counter him as he is not about fighting in lane unless you can counter roam really well.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2016-10-18T06:57:59.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'll try exhaust. So far I have only done barriers and heals for defensives and they aren't doing enough :(. I did end up catching up to LB after she ate me up in lane with the roaming  but by then she was one shotting my teammates. Maybe with exhaust it'll be better. thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2016-10-18T06:40:39.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zed is a hard counter to any of those people because they are all immobile. if you play any mid with mobility, zed becomes significantly less frightening","replies":[]}]}
