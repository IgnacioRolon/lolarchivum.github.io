It sucks that you only need to play objective in the top 10%. I get that the premise of kill gold is to reward you for being good and allowing a spike because of it but the spike is so big if your left to 1v1 that it&#039;s in all honesty unfair. Let me explain.\n\nIf I play mid vs someone I am clearly outplaying and I grab an early 2-0, that allows me to then hit 6 and one shot almost anyone on the map unless I really fuck up. That doesn&#039;t mean I am rewarded for being good. It means I am better than 1/5 people on that team.... A recent example that I actually fed in was vs a kat. Kat killed me and my jg dived her for the 2-0. That one play let her come back in lane q-e ult me for all my hp, run down bot with that like 40sec cd and do it again. 1 play = 3 kills. That wasn&#039;t skill at that point. That was reaching a power spike making your champ toxic amounts of unstable.\n\nOverall, especially in early game I think kill gold/xp needs a major tune down. Your reward for killing the enemy champ should be more focused on the amount of free cs you get and cs you can deny. Not playing tdm for some asshole rediculous power spike. It&#039;s especially frustrating when I like playing tank/supp champs but most of them don&#039;t get one shot mechanics for being &quot;good&quot; while we have any mage/assassin/juggernaut winning the game over 1 misplay. \n\nI do think kills should grant rewards but not so much that 1-2 kill advantage means that you have to afk under tower and can&#039;t even think about contesting drag/herald/baron. It defeats the purpose. Why focus those objectives when I can play tdm so you don&#039;t have an option to contest.\n\nRiot's response to me on this was \"call your teammates\". We all know how hard this is in any elo tbh. Let's say your the teammate. You have a 80% chance of roaming and the power spike being already too big and giving him a double or simply being seen and losing 2+ waves. Doesn't work in low elo and barely works from what I've seen in plat when my brother plays. Not to mention a counter roam resulting in your laner killing you or you both and now 2 lanes are spiking.","replies":[{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-04-13T22:27:03.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The {{champion:55}} player was smart to proactively exploit her advantage to snowball her lead, and help her bot lane out too. Why shouldn't she get rewarded making a smart play like that?\n\nObjective play matters at every elo, even if most people don't understand it's influence on their games. Heck I've turned many a game in lower elos around by simply soloing dragon and split pushing towers while my allies derped around the map skirmishing and doing nothing all that productive (because our opponents were more or less doing the same). If anything, I feel like it might help if new players were taught the significance of objectives in the tutorials (AI games don't teach it at all because the AI doesn't do anything other push lanes, and are so terrible at the game that anyone competent can win a game against them 1v5)","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2017-04-14T01:22:49.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smart play?

Now everyone in plat V -  looks at those videos and says it's not their fault they lost lane so fuck them ima farm. It is rare that when I asked for help in a losing matchup I get help. 9/10 it's bm to get \"guud\" even though I have a climbing win rate, you lose matchups, it happens.

Neither of those is oneshot in a balanced game. What do you mean very smart? That's common sense on kat.... What kat doesn't roam? kat's roam when theyre 0-3... Your putting too much thought process into it to give off something that isnt there. People who play kat roam more than the average champ because it's kat. Your not gonna see viktors and shit roam as much as her.

I would say the second kat has more skill because she achieved the same result with less \"guard rails\".\n\nKill gold and xp are just tools. The less tools you have the harder it is aka the more skillful you need to be. There is a fundamental difference between skill and 2 shotting someone because you have ludens early. 2 shotting me takes far less skill than outplaying me.

You would need an entire wave of cannon minions for that logic to work dude. 3 casters +  3 melee is ~110 gold. So THREE WAVES. Now lets take into account that that one kills ALSO let's you double dip and get 2 more free waves if not more depending on timer. So you get FIVE total waves. If thats first blood that's ~ 720 gold advantage from basically just that kill. Every other kill is still 520 gold lead. So when kat killed me and lee cas he dived he got 1120 gold advantage..... 1st back..... that's a bit too much. You don't need to double dip the minion wave.
