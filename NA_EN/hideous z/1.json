I figured I'd throw this up here anyway in case this issue makes it all the way to live.\n\nI've been participating in the Insider Preview program since the launch of Windows 10, and playing League on it without issue up until recently. The last two builds on the Slow ring, however (I'm fairly certain it started with the first one to include Game Mode) have caused an issue with logging into League.\n\nWhen I input my username and password, it immediately gives me an error \"Can't connect to login queue.\" Tells me to check if the servers are up and then to run through the connectivity guide. Check and check - the servers are gucci, and I've run through all the steps in the guide, and run the Hextech Repair tool several times. None of that has any effect as far as I can tell - same error.\n\nInterestingly (I think), after the first time it gives me the error, if I try to login again without exiting the client, it'll sit and think for a while before giving me the error again. The \"Authenticating\" wheel will spin for a good 30 seconds or so, and then the same error pops up.\n\nAlso interestingly, the legacy client does allow me to login, but won't connect to the chat server. I haven't actually tried queuing up a game in the legacy client, not sure if that works or not.\n\nRolling back the Windows build to 14986.rs_prerelease.161202-1928 fixes the problem. Login works immediately, I can use the client normally.\n\nAny help would be appreciated - it's not a massive issue for me at this point, I don't mind using the older build, but as time goes on it'll become more of a problem.\n\nEDIT: I realized it may be only the latest build on the slow ring - Windows 10 Insider Preview 15063 (rs2_release). I'm not sure if there was one in between 14986 and 15063.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-08T04:47:50.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'm not 100% familiar with the Windows Insider builds myself. From what I was able to find, it seems like Windows knows that the slow ring is a bit buggy at the moment. [**Here's**](http://www.windowscentral.com/all-you-need-know-about-windows-insider-rings) the article I was able to find. There's a bit down under the slow ring section that says the Slow Ring is still experimental, and there are still bugs around, so it can be a little 'risky'.","replies":[{"poster":"Hideous Z","date":"2017-04-08T06:45:53.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply :) I definitely understand that this build may have some bugs, and I'm hoping whatever the issue is gets fixed eventually. I just hoped someone on here might have run into the same problem, and wanted let you guys know about a potential future issue.\n\nRegardless, thanks for taking the time to do some research on my behalf, I really appreciate it!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-08T20:35:52.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem!
