The way it is now on PBE, STE line is even worse off than it was before it got 10% CDR. Is it time to shelve this support item line in favor of something else because it can be abused by niche midlaners?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-28T01:27:07.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bug resulting from moving a lot of files around to get everything onto PBE for pre-season.
