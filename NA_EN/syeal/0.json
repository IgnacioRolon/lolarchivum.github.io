However, hasn't anyone ever thought how crazy it would be if Rumbles Equalizer or Lux Laser(just to name 2 off the top of my head), could actually do damage to every champion/minion hit?  That's right including your own teammates!!! I am sure tons of people will rip on this but if you have anything to add or if this gives anyone more ideas, that's great too! Just a thought of course because I know it would be entertaining. \r\n\r\nLets shoot for that NONAKILL!!!! (nonakill??? maybe?? idk just tried it out :P) \r\n\r\nLove the community and love league hope you all have some interesting ideas even if it is rippin my idea!","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2015-02-18T00:37:20.535+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, people could troll their own team; however, it goes both ways.  It would give players a lot more to think about before using a skill or ult.  Like every game mode, there would be those that like it and dislike it.  Perhaps it would be better if it did 50% less dmg to your team and full dmg to enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Syeal","date":"2015-02-18T00:42:00.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There ya go!!

To be completely honest I got the idea off of Monte and Doa (casters during Champions Korea Spring 2015), I believe it was Monte that stated Corki would be one of the worst friendly fire champions (GE Tigers game with Pray as Corki and Gorilla as Leona) because he cant aim his E(Gatling Gun) and of course you have that Leona Eclipse followed by her passive it would get scary!
