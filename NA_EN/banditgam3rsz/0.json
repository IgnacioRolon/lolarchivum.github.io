So I just finished one off them to get into Que and have to ban a champion but when it came time to ban there where no champions to ban and caused me to dodge therefor causing me to have to wait another 20 minutes plus another 5 just to get into a game to get rid of one low q time. I doubt you will do this but i am asking you to consider lifting the low q time on my account since it wasn't my fault in the first place that i got the ban it was you new clients glitches that are causing me to miss out on extra games.","replies":[{"poster":"LukeMan95","date":"2017-03-26T21:57:07.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The EXACT same thing happened to me.
