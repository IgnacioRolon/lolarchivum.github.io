Single. Thing. About pre-30 is terrible. It is done so horribly im simply baffled there are even any new players coming into the game at all.\n\nThe leveling is horrible. The matchmaking is horrible. The IP/RP system is horrible. The IP costs are crippling. The champion rotations are very limited and in some cases actually malicious to learning. It is the absolute worst I've seen from any game besides sc2. That isn't saying much, since that game made it very clear it didn't even want casual players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ŁORD OF HEŁŁ","date":"2017-03-08T04:21:50.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"8:48 seconds. the jayce didn't open but he might as well have been.
