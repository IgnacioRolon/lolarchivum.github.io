This doesn't work either and is stuck in a ring of errors. I know my password is right because I was able to login to my girlfriends computer with her client perfectly fine and updated, but mine is not working (both on windows 10) I have uninstalled league and reinstalled it to no avail - infact now it won't even reinstall because the errors come with it. Please help or send out a fix as this seems like it's happening to a lot of people.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T17:58:01.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection might be unstable and failing to connect to the patching servers, so it can't get you to the current patch.
