The client installer claims to be search for a file LoL.NA.MSI in the folder, I can see it in the folder only when the installer is running, but the file doesn't appear to have the .MSI extension.

Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with both **reinstall and clean uninstall** turned on so that you can be sure that you get a full clean install.","replies":[{"poster":"zzCitizen","date":"2017-08-12T03:48:59.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I tried this and I get \"Install Path Not Found\" LoL is not installed in the default location...\"\n\nSeems like I can't even download the client..\n\nI've been playing all week and I'm even using a different pc with the exact same issue I've been troubleshooting for hours please help me.","replies":[]}]}]}
