Also, they randomly freeze for like 1s, making it extremely unpleasant when I'm trying to drag the map up/down.\n\nAny tips what it could be? I'm playing on a PC and ONLy when League is running.\n\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-07T15:41:50.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is freezing exactly, your cursor or the game itself?

Thanks for trying, but it seems that I found the issue on my own. I tried one more mouse, non-logitech, and it works fine. I'm not sure if the drivers were conflicting or both mouses that I tried previously were faulty (somewhat unlikely, as both are different models, from different sources and one is brand new), but as long as I know what's the issue, buying a new mouse and putting the two as spares isn't a big deal.","replies":[]}]}]}
