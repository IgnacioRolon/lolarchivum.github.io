Punishments are for intent, and your intent was harassment.\n\nMm, I have to disagree with you a bit here. \n\nSounds like someone was actively and openly feeding lanes in an attempt to make the game be lost, and essentially report baiting the whole way. There has been an influx of this with the recent ban/chat restrictions, which has caused many players to say/make posts along the lines of \"since its ok to ruin people games, I guess i'll make/buy another account just to do that.\" Thus, they bait more players into quote unquote \"flaming\" them so they can report and get as many as they can punished by gaming the report system against otherwise docile players. \n\nThe punishment was truly because of calling people an idiot after obviously a series of prior punishments that escalated here. However the issue most complained about is that the escalation is not comparable to the de-escalation.  Where a player goes from calling their teammate multiple swear words in a game and ends up with a chat restriction a couple of times, then not swearing at all but kind of badgering teammates with waves and waves of text and ends up with a 14 day ban, then ends up in a game with a player feeding on purpose to bait out any response they can to get as many people in trouble, and even though they had done so well and tried so hard to be a quote unquote \"reformed\" player this report baiter perfectly went out of their way to get the tiniest response out of them by getting them to call a teammate an idiot or something, and thus a permanent ban is issued. \n\nIt is not an easily fixed system, but if we do not at least admit there are ways to abuse the system to pointedly get others in trouble then all we do is further victimize the victims.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-11-09T07:13:54.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really see what those people do as abusing the system, and much more as one specific way of being an asshole. At most I'd use the word \"exploit\".\nAt the end of the day the behaviour these people try to provoke is still the kind of behaviour Riot is trying to deter and punish, and holding people accountable for actions even if they were provoked into them (assuming they weren't tricked or coerced) is not a flaw in the system. \n\nSo even though it is absolutely despicable to go around and specifically try to get people in trouble, I don't see any part of the punishment system being used in a way that wasn't intended.\nThe only thing that needs fixing is how quickly those people themselves are caught by the system so that they cannot spread as much toxicity as they do. After all, preventing toxicity from spreading - or at the very least inhibiting the \"growth\" - was the original idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ranyhin2","date":"2018-11-09T01:19:37.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"I see.

Let me throw out some statistics from the game.\n\nIrelia with 16 deaths in 20 minutes.\nVery consistent deaths, apparently not playing particularly safe.\n\nWhat else do I see, though?\n\nIrelia has 3 kills and 5 assists, 8 kill participation out of 15 total on team.\nEnemy Top laner is Renekton, Jungle is Nidalee, both strong early game kill champs.\n\nEarly kills go as follows:\nRenek fumble/death at 2 minutes\nNidalee death at 3 minutes\n**Irelia/Renek kill trade**\nRenek death at 6 minutes\n**Irelia kills Nidalee in mid at 7 minutes**\nRenek kills Irelia as a trade at 7 minutes\nKatarina kills Irelia at 8 minutes, *maybe an int dive*. hard to tell without context.\nEzreal kills Irelia at 9 minutes\n\nSo, here's the basic game:\n\nIrelia has a bad start early, going quickly 0-2. She somehow makes it up to 2-4, regardless, though the jungle *has been lurking*. A couple ganks go sour (including the 2-4 one), and the rest of the game is spent teamfighting, pretty much. with no real tank on the team. With a poke-heavy comp (Ashe, Ahri, Brand, Pyke, Irelia), she's the front line for every teamfight, and that spells disaster for Irelia against a very mobile enemy team that poses a heavy threat from very large distances, and from safety (Nidalee, Ezreal, Katarina, Nami, then Renekton as tank). If Irelia commits like Renekton commits, Katarina comes out and shreds everybody to pieces, often Irelia for having to commit so hard.\n\nBasically, Irelia is between a rock and a hard place by team composition, and she actually decides to fight with the team instead of splitpush top and pray for squishies to feed themselves, and dies consistently for it.\n\nThis is not to say Irelia was playing well. However, after giving Renekton 6-1 early game (Pyke his only non-Irelia kill), Renekton spent the rest of his game teamfighting as well, and only 1 of his following 15 kills (21/2/4 Renekton) was Irelia. Yes it was early feed, yes Renekton got out of control for it, but that's exactly the goal for a toplaner to carry such a lead into squashing squishies.\n\n**My main shocker for the game is how an inting player managed to be the only one on the team to reach level 11, particularly when she clearly teamfought and/or inted basically all game.**\n\nTL;DR, This game is bad from the base up. Irelia was essentially destined to be fodder all game while others tried to squander whatever kills they could get.\n-----\nAnd final note, this doesn't have to do with the context of the actual ban at all. However, this was a team game that was lost as a team, and when the team needed to come together, you focused on reporting your own ally with the enemy team rather than bringing anybody together. After that happened, you then got hounded by the enemy team for toxic behavior, and even defended that with insults. I don't know about bannable, tbh, but this is the behavior I despise the most from teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2018-11-09T01:15:53.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could not use reporting as a threat for the purpose of harassment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-11-09T01:15:47.615+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's pretty simple - you can't spend the entire game flaming or harassing people **ever**.
