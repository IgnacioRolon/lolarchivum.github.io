That&#039;s ridiculous.. what kinda questions were you asking?\r\nMike\r\nAsking for clarity and context in a situation\r\nlong story short their banning system is broken as hell\r\nBut they also refuse to address any of the subjects that make their system broken\r\nMallory\r\nUggghhh... I&#039;m sorry you gotta deal with that.\r\nMike\r\nBasicly I was punished for speaking out verse a player who was supposed to play support, their job was to help me out in bot lane and keep the enemy off me while leaving me the minions to kill\r\nThey took my minions, refused to ward so I could stop the enemy hiding in the bush next to us from killing us (so we could see them and shoot them from farther back without having to walk into the bush first) and did prettymuch everything they could to make my life hell\r\nSo I spoke out verse them telling them not to take my cs and that their job as support was not to carry lane or take over my lane but to ward and help me out and get me ahead\r\nSo that flame me and I get reported after the game by my team despite me playing legitimately while this guy who I&#039;m forced to share a lane with is making my life hell\r\nI&#039;m behind like 100 minion kills, weak cuz I have no gold or items, I&#039;ve died multiple times trying to 1v2 vs a annie who just camped in the bush in my lane while my support roams across the map\r\nWe ended up winning game cuz I just kept split pushing, they having 5v4 team fights and I&#039;m off in a lane by myself taking objectives like towers so we win\r\nBut the point is that in that game the trolling player really fucked with us all and there was nothing we could do about it aside of use team communication... while they have a mute function to turn that team communication off if they don&#039;t want to hear it, they had protection while we had zero protection.\r\nMike\r\nSo my question to riot was if I&#039;m being punished for team communication, what else can we do about trolling players if you don&#039;t want us to use the only option of team communication?\r\n\r\nI then outlined how their suggestions don&#039;t work, either have a zero percent succuess rate or will see you punished.\r\nMike\r\nI mean if you leave the game you get punished\r\nIf you mute the player nothing happens cuz it doesn&#039;t effect their actions\r\nreporting them after the game doesn&#039;t effect their actions 10-20 mins previously\r\ntelling them what they are doing is reportable is in itself a offense you will be punished for (even tho its got a good chance to smarten your team up)\r\nLeaving the game you will be punished for (I guess kinda successful cuz your not playing anymore or dealing with it)\r\nThe only option with a positive success rate aside of leaving the game is attempting player communication\r\nYet if you do there is a high chance that if your telling someone something to do or what not to do that you will be punished for it\r\nSo my question to them is what should a player do if all the options equal punishments or zero success rate?\r\nMallory\r\nThat&#039;s actually pretty fucked.\r\nMike\r\nYeah....\r\nSo.... They banned me from help desk and live chat for asking about that\r\nMallory\r\nWhat kinda customer service is that... Wtfff\r\nMike\r\nThe kind that doesn&#039;t care about their customers lol\r\nThe kind from a company who deems themselves too big to fail\r\nMallory\r\nThat&#039;s some shit though.n\r\nMike\r\nyuuup","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-09-10T06:42:22.096+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't *force* someone to do what you want, and Riot isn't going to punish a player in the middle of the game because you don't like their strategy, which it very well might be rather than them trolling you; they aren't actually required to play a traditional/meta support role. Am I saying they weren't trolling? No, but it's impossible for me to determine that from here, so please entertain the idea that that isn't always their goal when they don't do what you want/expect. There's no need for you to \"protect yourself\" from someone playing off-meta, you can still adjust your playstyle and work with them if they are actually trying to win, and you are *their* teammate just as much as they are yours.\n\nAs for them \"protecting themselves\" from team communication...I'm not really getting what you think they are being protected from. It's not an attack unless you make it so. You say you are afraid of being reported for it; unless you're doing it wrong, as in you're being a jerk, it doesn't matter whether they report you or not. False reports like that do absolutely nothing.\n\nSometimes it will be a straight up troll just trying to piss people off or vent in a destructive way. We all have these games at some point if we play enough, but if we retaliate with negative or toxic behavior of our own, that just adds fuel to the fire. It can be frustrating for sure, but it's still possible to salvage the game or at least your enjoyment of it, if you try.

He is allowed to CS. He doesnt have to ward. And yes, harassing teammate about things that he is allowed to do is wrong.

You ARE entitled to that opinion however wrong it may be.\n\nToxic and negative are both subjective words, meaning that it requires someones opinion of a situation in order to exist. My opinion of what is negative or toxic may differ from your opinion and both of our opinions may differ from someone else's opinion.\n\nIf beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then the person who is observing gets to decide what is beautiful. A common saying is \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" which means beauty doesn't exist on its own but is created by observers.\n\nAnything they view as toxic or negative is. This is a concerning subject when you take into account the fact that riot staff take what your saying out of context by looking at a one sided conversation of you talking to yourself. This means anything from playful banter to legitimately pointing out a problem with a players actions or any legitimate part of the game can be taken as negative since they are again taking what your saying out of context, playful banter becomes one sided toxic activity if the staff views it that way due to toxic and negative being undefined and subjective, it fully depends on the opinion of the staff member viewing it.... And when most staff members skim looking for a way to post blame instead of actually trying to read or understand the situation, then your left with many missunderstandings that they will just assume are automatically toxic or negative due to their perspective and opinion on those subjective words.\n\nProof?\n\nBelow staff was 100% unable to tell the difference between the word \"ME\" and \"team mate\" or \"you\". If riot staff can't even read enough to see that I was using the word ME and due to that it was not directed at any other team mate, then how do you expect them to deal with any other situation legitimately when they are more complex then trying to get them to look at one word they refuse to stop skimming over? I mean they punished me for calling a report on another player when that was not reality due to them skimming and refusing to read, then tell me cuz another staff member punished me due to their own inability to read that nothing can be changed or overturned cuz a previous staff member already addressed it wrongly with a missunderstanding that I was calling for a report on someone else instead of the reality that I used the word \"ME\" that can in no way be directed towards any other members of the game.\n\nCalling for a report is punishable due to it griefing your team mates... however I was not doing that... So I was punished then for griefing myself since they skimmed, assumed what I was about and then punished me for their assumptions while skimming, claiming that in their opinion I was griefing another player with this statement I was punished for... Yet we can clearly see that by saying ME I was not directing it at another player but rather myself in a joking way when another player called for a report on me.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwisted Spade\nJuly 27, 2017 23:00\n \n\nI have had you guys close my previous ticket telling me this has been addressed but that is not true\n\nYou have addressed the issue of \"a player calling for a report on another player\"\n\nBut I am NOT doing that.\n\nI am repeating that another player has called for a report one ~ME~\n\nIs it verse the rules now to mockingly call for a report on yourself after someone else says it to you, about you, in all chat?\n\n\"[6:46] [All] Twisted Spade (Fiddlesticks): yes report me\" \n(01:37:44 AM) Twisted Spade: agent 007 pointed that out as reportable\n\nI was just re reading this...

They can grief and troll in peace if they want by just using the PROTECTION in place called mute so they don't have to hear their team trying to talk them out of doing what they are doing, or convince them to do something they should be doing. You've gone one step farther by PROTECTING players who use mute and don't want their team ~Who cannot communicate with them~ from using the last form of communication, pings, cuz trolls and griefers dislike people spamming question marks on them IN A ATTEMPT TO GET THEM TO SMARTEN UP.\n\nIts called cause and effect, it means that in order to have a effect, there needs to be something causing this, this means that in order for a player in game to stop playing the game and then type on their keyboard, there would have to be something that triggered that, or a cause. Most times this is another player that cause's this and the effect is that players type to them in order to get them to stop the action they shouldn't be doing or to start doing a action they should be doing. Nobody is talking about meta or not meta, you could be play any off meta support you want, the job remains the same, the expectations from your team mate remain the same.. so I'm clueless on why you think this is a meta vs off meta issue when its a trolling+griefing vs team communication issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MaroModo","date":"2017-09-10T06:12:49.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this like the third thread for the same thing?

Of  course they care to  some degree.  They care enough so that players will keep spending their dollars/money in the game.   THATS  IT.  \n\nRiot is  just like any other company.

From what i can gather is you got a stuck in a lane you didn't like and told him he was playing wrong (i will say I agree with following the meta since it is proven to work the most effectively and often) even though it is their right to play however they want, no matter how weird or inefficient it may be. A video game is meant to be played for the fun of the person playing and if that guy was auto-filled to support when he might not have wanted it he probably just wants to have fun in the game. The report system seems to work just fine for me and 99% of other people. You just got mad at them not playing meta and got punished, you served the sentence and are still here so just move on to the next game.","replies":[]}]}
