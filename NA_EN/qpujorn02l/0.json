I&#039;m a new player to league, I just came back to play this game after I was watching other people play it. I come back today to see if it&#039;s as fun as it looks. I have a lvl 11 account, I&#039;m new. I have almost no game time. I don&#039;t even know how to play what most of the time. So please tell me how it&#039;s fair for a brand new player that is lvl 11 to be matched with 2 golds 1 plat 1 very skilled 30 with a keystone and a regular lvl 8. I run lolwiz I know what I got into and it discouraged me when I saw it. Our team consisted of everyone below lvl 20. How is this match fair???? I don&#039;t understand it. We got completely and utterly demolished with no chance for a fight at all. I just don&#039;t understand how the matchmaker could do this. This match ruined my whole experience because it is not the 1st time I have been up against this kind of thins, this one just so happened to be the worst. I&#039;m not a good player either!!!. I lose the vast majority of games and suck at fighting. I&#039;m still 2 days new to this so how can I be matched with plat and gold??","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-02T08:19:38.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, you have 16 wins and 16 losses in non coop games, and in most of your games you have competent scores, even the losing ones. I would say the reason it is trying you out against level 30 players is because you are playing on a level 30 level, and the reason it matched you against them is because they have a new player or smurf queuing with them.","replies":[]}]}
