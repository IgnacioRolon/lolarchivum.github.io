However, instead of boosting me to Gold V Division, the ranking system put me back into the Promotion again (start over the 3-games evaluation). What happened? I clearly finished my game with my own strength and myself only. Why did this happen?\r\nIt would be nice to hear from Riot assistant. Thank you so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T18:22:31.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, I took a look into this for you and see that there was a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging).  Any dodge during a series will count towards a loss.  :(  I do see that you got back into another series, though.  Best of luck towards Gold!","replies":[]}]}
