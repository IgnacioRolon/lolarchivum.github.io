Every Free Champion Rotation, we give a couple of days advanced notice.  Typically, Free Champion Rotations occur on Tuesday in the NA region.  I have gone ahead and checked, and the new Free to Play Champions have been released!  You should be able to see them when you re-launch your client!\n\nI hope this alleviates some confusion!","replies":[]}]}
