If there were a lot of false positives before that, it doesn't matter and you don't get to see that. That doesn't mean those false reports and claims against you don't add up to tilting the scale to punish.\n\nSince the *logs* are reviewed, false reports can't hurt your case - after all, a player with one kind-of punishable game in a case full of really positive ones probably won't be registered as being very negative overall. What is sent for the player is not all that is reviewed, after all.\n\n>  Lastly, the system is mostly automated and has many errors as in the link given. It is nothing like a court because there aren't any people objectively looking at the data.\n\nI like how you put that. It's particularly interesting, because it's almost *impossible* for people to truly be objective. Each person brings their own beliefs and biases into their determinations. Meanwhile, a program does only what it is programmed to do - it has no beliefs or biases with which to make subjective decisions.\n\nAs for errors, please do point me at one. The case you've already linked looks punishable to me - I probably would have punished it in the Tribunal - so I don't see much evidence there.\n\n> Just because Riot has complete access to chat logs doesn't mean they have the means or inclination to fairly assess each case. There are millions of games played every week.\n\nDefine \"fairly assess\" for me. I want to be sure I understand where you're going with this.\n\n> Regardless, just like we wouldn't want to jail or execute innocent people, there should not be a system which makes such decisions rashly. As the link I've given proves, it currently cannot detect sarcasm, doesn't understand when another toxic player is quoted and just has a whole bunch of flaws which can lead to unfair punishments.\n\nSarcasm is *inherently* negative - the system being unable to detect it would seem to ensure more false *negatives* than false positives (with the latter being defined as innocent players being punished, and the former being defined as guilty players being pardoned).\n\n> It's also asinine to give chat restrictions but no logs - this is again heavily influenced by false reports from (which you can't contest). Even when justified, you should at least see the evidence so you know what not to do anymore.\n\nOf course I can contest that. Truly false reports do nothing more than give the system a *neutral* or *positive* game to review. That **cannot** be a negative thing for the case - it's possible it could even be a positive thing for the case, as mild toxicity tends to be issued punishments based on frequency, and positive games actually *reduce* the perceived frequency.\n\nEven so, your entire argument is premised on this concept that players should be given leniency for what they *didn't* do. It's not unlike arguing something like, \"yeah, I mean, I robbed that one gas station, but think about all the **other** gas stations I went to that I **didn't** rob!\" It just doesn't fly.","replies":[{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-08-06T06:37:39.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought you meant the OP not that linked thread.

Could humans make mistakes too? Sure but they are much better at understanding context in ways that computers can't. They can be programmed well but they will still fail to understand nuances and intent. This is obvious by how hard it is for AI to pass Turing's test. Sarcasm is one example among many and actually is just a form of self-expression, not inherently negative. Is LoL a sarcasm free zone now? Should we make it a compound sentence free zone too? It's just nonsense to say that being punished merely for a method of self-expression is valid.\n\nYou don't seem to get what is [meant by false reports.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/XPEFiBuZ-riots-needs-to-punish-people-for-false-reports?show=flat) Even people who don't report often can be annoyed at you merely for disagreeing with them on something they care about or other reasons. These reports still stack the deck against you and make future reports more likely to lead to punishment despite that not being the case had those false reports not been included (leading to unnecessarily severe punishments). \n\nSince the cases are not assessed by an intelligent being who can really understand what reports are false and which are right, it is mostly guided by consensus. If a lot of players don't like what you say, you could be completely deferential and still get punished. Maybe they say you're bad and you say that their division is actually lower than yours. There is nothing inherently abusive or toxic in any of this. It's merely a factual statement highlighting the hypocrisy of a toxic player's comments. However, it can annoy the toxic players raging at you and lead to spite reports. A fair human wouldn't punish someone for writing this but the automated system easily might if they see that a lot of players report you for it. \n\nIt has nothing to do with being given leniency. It has everything to do with ensuring that only toxic players get punished and that the system has multiple checks and balances as well as appeal options to correct mistakes (not just tough luck). A system that doesn't allow you to review evidence, to defend yourself, to be judged by your peers not a flawed automated system etc. cannot offer that. Moreover, even if someone was \"toxic\" (a blanket term that seems to be used way too loosely), that doesn't mean they deserve the maximum punishment. If you're pulled over for a faulty light, would you think it's fair if the cop planted a bag of cocaine and then arrested you for intent to distribute? That's what false reports do. You're punished for things you didn't do because there is no oversight. It's uncommon but it is a problem and a breach of justice for those who have to face it. That's why there is supposed to be transparency and not iron hand justice (without even being presented offending logs for chat restrictions etc.).","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-08-06T07:00:50.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=atomicwit,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Gkv8J06I,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T06:37:39.580+0000)\n>\n> I thought you meant the OP not that linked thread. But yeah, that is an excellent example of punishing the victim and a false ban. There was nothing to merit a ban there in any way for a reasonable person, especially given context. \n\nTwo things:\n\nOne: context isn't relevant. The actions of others are not a justification for negative actions. Or, to put that another way, someone being a jerk does not give *someone else* the right to also be a jerk.\n\nTwo: there are three report calls, a ban threat, and more than a little badgering. All of those are reportable, and can be considered punishable. They often *were* punished in the Tribunal.\n\n> If you think that's punishable, I think you're insane and brainwashed to support anything Riot does.. There was harassment from other players and the response was calm and collected. \n\nI like to think of the moment someone resorts to ad-hominem attacks as a good indicator of when a debate is lost. It's a strong sign that that person has been forced into the position of admitting that their arguments aren't strong enough to stand on their own, and they have nothing left with which to back themselves. Your mileage - as always - may vary.\n\n> No personal insults were used, no player's skill was berated, etc. It was mostly a factual assessment of the situation and frustration for being used as a scapegoat. There is no way in hell that merits being punished let alone a ban.\n\nWhether a statement is factual or not is irrelevant in determining its toxicity. For example, your statement from above, \"I think you're insane,\" is presumably factual. It's also an insult - which is toxic behavior.\n\n> The logs are absolutely not reviewed by a human. It's an automated system and that thread proves exactly that. You don't get a 14-day suspension instantly after toxic players claim to report you and then have the logs reviewed 1 minute later too. \n\nI never said they were reviewed by humans.

Yes, and in a way that no human could ever be.\n\n> You don't seem to get what is [meant by false reports.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/XPEFiBuZ-riots-needs-to-punish-people-for-false-reports?show=flat) \n\nThen perhaps you should define it for me. The commonly recognized definition is a report issued against a player in a game where that player demonstrated no toxicity whatsoever. If you have a *different* definition, it would be helpful for me to know that - discussions such as these are always easier when all parties are on the same page regarding the terminology.\n\nReports such as those referred to by the definition I provided **cannot** hurt a player's case. All they can do - at worst - is help *build* one. Even then, those games will not count against the player in the review of the case.\n\n> It has nothing to do with being given leniency and if you got that from this, I don't know how. It has everything to do with ensuring that only toxic players get punished and that the system has multiple checks and balances as well as appeal options to correct mistakes.\n\nYou've made multiple arguments about how terrible these false reports are because they ensure that players who **have toxic games** get cases built against them. Why do I say that? Because if they didn't have toxic games, the case would almost certainly be pardoned.\n\nThis is no different than claiming that \"Because I didn't rob all those other gas stations, I shouldn't have been punished for robbing this one, because if they didn't call in false reports, I would never have been caught!\"\n\n> Moreover, even if someone was \"toxic\" (a blanket term that seems to be used way too loosely), that doesn't mean they deserve the maximum punishment. \n\nThis is the exact reason new punishments were implemented, such as Chat Restrictions and Ranked Restrictions - because ***no one disagrees with this statement***.\n\n> You're punished for things you didn't do because there is no oversight. \n\nOf course there's oversight. This was not some \"fire-and-forget\" system. There are spot-reviews to maintain accuracy, and there's even a couple variants of appeals processes that can be undertaken. If most appeals do not lead to overturned sanctions, it's because those sanctions are - in the opinion of the person handling the secondary review - deserved.","replies":[{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-08-06T10:40:51.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Context doesn't give one a right to be abusive but it is never irrelevant in morality, life or courts.

Reports that are truly false would show games that were **NOT TOXIC** - and therefore, would disrupt the pattern of toxicity the system would be trying to detect. So they **don't count** against him in the case.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that the player in question - just because they had some false reports - didn't still have **enough** valid reports to still be punished.

Just because Riot throws some numbers at you without even explaining how they got them exactly or giving us full access, doesn't mean much. There are cases like the above which prove to me that there are issues with it. Even the fact that it learns from what's reported instead of having objective guidelines can be an issue when people frequently make false reports for similar things (I gave examples).

Pings already have restrictions in place and can be muted but I suppose they can be abused if someone really tries. I don't see the same for taunts. They were never meant to serve a gameplay function so players should be able to use them any way they like. In any case, someone overly sensitive might find a ping to go somewhere \"bullying\" and a taunt \"verbal abuse.\" This is a huge stretch to me.\n\nReport requests can be spammed or written in toxic ways. That is not OK but there are also instances of obviously toxic behavior where asking for reports is entirely valid (just like asking people to call the police in your analogy) and an important reminder for players in the game to do their part to help improve the experience. There is no \"or else\" threat component. Most people asking for reports have already observed toxic behavior and know that it deserves to at least be evaluated. It's not even an appeal for reform. \n\nAlso, even if it was written as a threat \"stop suiciding in the enemy's fountain or I'll report you for intentional feeding,\" there is again nothing wrong with this. Likewise, \"get out of my house or I'll call the police\" is not toxic bullying behavior. Both of these are justified responses to negative behavior. To suggest that threatening to report a player intentionally diving the enemy fountain over and over is bullying behavior would be illogical. This is just a rational consequence of game ruining behavior not an attempt to control somebody. The problem isn't with offering opinions in valid report scenarios. The issue is report spamming, writing reports in ways that constitute harassment \"report this retard\" or simply making false claims against a player \"report x for intentionally feeding\" when a flash is failed etc.\n\nThe report requests in that chat are literally NOTHING like \"go play in traffic\" or \"just go kill yourself\". These are clearly malicious statements and insulting. That doesn't even remotely compare to offering the opinion that players harassing you merit a ban (which could even very well be true as you didn't see their chat and he has a right to the opinion if expressed civilly). The fact that I even have to argue this is what makes debating this with you so exasperating and why it feels like such a waste of time. It should be common sense that \"i think you've proven enough in chat that you're a toxic player and should get banned for harassing otehrs\" and \"just go kill yourself\" are night and day statements in entirely different categories. \n\nAnd yes, you are blaming the victim 100%. Nothing in that chat is toxic and neither is holding an opinion that players raging at you should get punished. This is just having a sense of justice. You're saying he doesn't have a right to express the opinion that toxic players are ruining his experience and ought to get punished? If someone stole your car and you say \"I hope they catch this thief and he goes to jail.\" is that some grave example of toxicity too?\n\n\"You claim I'm insane, and therefore my arguments can be dismissed.\" I don't know if you're trolling or really believe this. After the \"go kill yourself\" comparison to showing displeasure at being harassed in-game and now this, I'm really having a hard time taking you seriously and starting to think I'm feeding a troll. You're taking a figure of speech so out of context that I feel you're trying to instigate and annoy. This was evidently not the intention or point. It's just a red herring. First of all, it wasn't an actual claim of insanity, as should have been patently obvious. Secondly, even the form is wrong. It's more like, \"if you hold that opinion, you must be insane.\" I wrote, \"if you think that's punishable, I think you're insane.\" And again here, it just means that you think someone's opinion is extreme. When I say, \"you're out of your mind if you think I'm going to loan you $5\", it also doesn't mean I think you actually belong in a mental institution or that I believe you have transcended your physical state and your skull is now an empty vessel.\n\nYes, you can say that it is factual someone holds a certain opinion but that isn't what someone means. It might be factual that person X thinks eating dirt is delicious. You ask them and they always say \"yes\". Dirt being delicious is not, however, a  statement of fact. It is opinion. When someone claims something is factual, it is a reference to something that can be externally verified and is not really subjective. \n\n> That's exactly my point. Reports that are truly false would show games that were NOT TOXIC - and therefore, would disrupt the pattern of toxicity the system would be trying to detect. So they don't count against him in the case.\n> \n> But that doesn't mean that the player in question - just because they had some false reports - didn't still have enough valid reports to still be punished. Yet your argument is that those players (who were toxic enough to be punished, but not toxic enough to have had a case built against them yet) shouldn't be punished, because the system shouldn't have caught them yet.\n\nIf you really believe this, go duo with 10-20 people over  2-3 dozen games and tell them to report you in-game every time for verbal abuse. Make sure your chat is nothing but a shining beacon of positivity and teamwork. You will find yourself chat restricted anyway as this experiment has been done already. I urge you to try it before responding to this point since it highlights a key problem with the system and how false reports are counted. The only time where this wouldn't raise major flags (with subsequent punishments) is if the players have a very high report frequency and lack agreement with others.\n\nIt's not about getting caught and I just explained this in detail last post. One's behavior is on a spectrum and \"toxic\" is what happens when certain negative actions pass a threshold. Not every negative or even toxic statement means a person is toxic. One comment doesn't make a player. It's about a pattern. False reports create an artificial pattern when there is none and said player should not be under \"toxic\" on the spectrum but they reached the threshold due to abuse of the report system. It's just like being annoying. Saying \"are we there yet?\" one time isn't annoying. Saying it 10x in 10 minutes is. If I tell you that someone said it 10x in 10 minutes but in fact they only said it once, you'd think they were annoying when they really weren't.\n\nAs far as just deciding whether something is negative being sufficient, that is really no basis for a report. Maybe we're talking about Power Rangers and I say the Pink Ninja Ranger sucks. Am I going to get flagged for negative attitude now? Just providing a negative opinion on something isn't the same as negative attitude. Likewise, \"we shouldn't clump in teamfights\" is constructive not negative attitude. \"don't teamfight, we're getting crushed\" isn't negative attitude either but can be a negative statement. The system should not have the power to punish players without human oversight barring very clear cases like using racial and homophobic slurs. It is simply not actually capable of understanding what it's reading and is just making guesses based on patterns, frequencies, comparisons to template cases etc.. It's excellent for determining high probability cases of toxicity but there are still too many flaws with it to trust it with enforcement entirely (and yeah, it's pretty much all automated now). If Riot really wants to go that route, I'd like to at least see something like Tribunal for an appeal process to give some semblance of justice. If someone is given a log with the suspension and disagrees that there was toxicity, others from the community at random can review it along with other logs which were flagged. Most people who claim they aren't toxic after getting punished actually are and tend to admit it once they see the logs so I don't think it would be even half as hard as the old Tribunal.\n\nAlmost everything you wrote here has been covered and debated extensively in the linked thread. That's a better place for it than this thread since much of the discussion here is redundant. Anyway, I urge you to try the experiment I suggested and get back to us on the results. I guarantee the false reports matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-08-06T21:51:25.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=atomicwit,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Gkv8J06I,comment-id=0005000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-08-06T21:04:26.097+0000)\n>\n> You can argue it's Riot's policy (although I believe that's only about retaliation and other toxic behavior) but there is no \"strawman argument\" here. \n\nYou falsely represented my position in order to prove my position false by attacking your misrepresentation. That's the **definition** of a strawman argument.\n\n> To suggest that an evaluation is more accurate devoid of context in ANYTHING makes no sense. \n\nThat's not what I suggested. I'm simply pointing out that the context isn't relevant in determining whether or not a particular statement is toxic. Or, to put it perhaps a more explicit way, \"There is no context in which it becomes acceptable for a player to exhibit toxic behavior.\"\n\nWhich is all I've ever tried to say about it.\n\n> You ignored the stealing example but it's a perfect illustration of where an identical action might not be equally severe due to contextual issues (unless you really believe they are the same - which wouldn't totally surprise me). Moreover, there was no claim that context justifies abusive behavior. You're misunderstanding the points made if that's what you got from it.\n\nI didn't ignore the stealing example. I addressed it by pointing out that it's a strawman argument. Because it misrepresents my position.\n\n> I'm not sure why you have such confidence in this system unless you work on Riot's team for it. It's really not a very good system and lacks the necessary oversight.\n\nBecause every scrap of evidence I've seen shows it to be effective at *exactly* what it's intended to be effective at.\n\n> There are cases like the above which prove to me that there are issues with it. Even the fact that it learns from what's reported instead of having objective guidelines can be an issue when people frequently make false reports for similar things (I gave examples). At that point, it becomes part of its standard.\n\nA **FALSE** report is a report for a game that has no toxicity. If the game has no recognizable toxicity, WHY would the system assume that some common phrase should suddenly be considered toxic? That would lead to a system that considers \"gg\" toxic. Or \"well played.\" Or \"great job.\" Or \"dragon in 30.\"\n\nThat would be utterly **stupid** - any idiot would recognize that as problematic. And regardless of what you may think of them, Riot's PB development team are not idiots (at very least not *all* of them).\n \n> Pings already have restrictions in place and can be muted but I suppose they can be abused if someone really tries.

It's not even an appeal for reform. \n\nIf that's all they want, then all they need is to issue their own report, since the game builds cases (thus triggering evaluation) based on the number of *reported games*, rather than the number of reports *per game*.\n\nYou can disagree all you want. I don't care. You're welcome to your opinion. I'm simply pointing out **Riot's** stance on the matter. Because their stance is what's relevant in the context of the game.\n\nYou seem to misunderstand my point in posting here. My goal is to help these players avoid future bans/restrictions by pointing out the things that Riot punishes for. That's all.\n\n> The report requests in that chat are literally NOTHING like \"go play in traffic\" or \"just go kill yourself\" or even in the same category at all. \n\nI didn't say they were. \"Go play in traffic\" and \"go kill yourself\" would fall under the category of **death** threats, while the report calls and similar comments may fall under the heading of **ban** threats.\n\nPlease note that these are two *different* categories, as I had clearly indicated in that post. The only point of similarity is that neither is directly a \"threat,\" yet may be categorized under that a larger heading that uses the word anyway.\n\nAgain, this is a strawman argument. Please try not to misrepresent my position.\n\n> And yes, you are blaming the victim 100%.\n\nIn that he is the victim of toxicity, and I am blaming him, yes.\n\nBut I am not blaming him **for** being a victim of toxicity - which is a requirement of the term \"victim blaming.\"\n\n> Yes, you can say that it is factual someone holds a certain opinion but that isn't what someone means about factual. It might be factual that person X thinks eating dirt is delicious. You ask them and they always say yes. Dirt being delicious is not, however, a  statement of fact. Again, it's so obviously not the intended meaning of factual that I don't know why you bring it up. \n\nI brought it up because it was a somewhat comparable situation to the point I was trying to make. That point seems to have missed you, so I'll be dropping this line of discussion after restating the point as clearly and unequivocally as I can:\n\n**TRUTH** and **TOXICITY** are not mutually exclusive.\n\n> If you really believe this, go duo with 10-20 people over  2-3 dozen games and tell them to report you in-game every time for verbal abuse.

I urge you to try it before responding to this as it highlights a key problem with the system and how false reports are counted.\n\nIt's also been shown that every experiment of the sort falsely presented their data. Specifically, they were punished for **other games**, where they **were** toxic.\n\nYes, I've seen them. Yes, I read the threads, both on the forums/boards and on reddit.\n\n> False reports create an artificial pattern when there is none and said player should not be under \"toxic\" on the spectrum but the threshold was lowered. \n\nThis presumes that the system assumes that any reported game is toxic. If the system made that assumption, why would it ever review anything?\n\nThat - again - would be stupid design. It would be both better and easier, to my mind, to have it review the games with no assumptions regarding whether any individual game is toxic or not. To do otherwise would be to apply human bias to a system that bears a primary benefit of being *unbiased*. Which, like I said, would be stupid.\n\n> It's just like being annoying. Saying \"are we there yet?\" one time isn't annoying. Saying it 10x in 10 minutes is. If I tell you that someone said it 10x in 10 minutes but in fact they only said it once, you'd think they were annoying when they really weren't.\n\nSo, you mean, if you lied to me about something and I had no way to fact-check it, I might believe something false about someone?\n\nThat's true, but it doesn't really apply here, since the claims **can be** and **are** fact-checked.\n\nWhich is kind of the whole point.\n\n> As far as just deciding whether something is negative being sufficient, that is really no basis for a report.

Please don't do that. It doesn't reflect well.\n\nWhen I refer to \"negative,\" I'm not talking about negative grammatical constructs (i.e. statements that include or use the word \"no\" or its derivatives). I'm talking about *emotionally* negative language - notable because it is divisive and disruptive to community members (on the small scale, this would be a team/players in a match).\n\n> Most people who claim they aren't toxic after getting punished actually are and tend to admit it once they see the logs so I don't think it would be even half as hard as the old Tribunal.\n\nYou must not have been around the TBI and PB forums. **Huge** numbers of players posted there complaining about their punishments. Every single one I saw was valid.\n\nThe tendency I have seen is that people who claim they aren't toxic after being punished not only actually are, but they **refuse** to admit it - either claiming something wrong with the system, or that Riot's policies should allow them to do whatever it is they were doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-08-06T21:40:13.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*slow clap* this is the best thing I've ever read on the boards.

My point was simply that the Tribunal punished the **same behaviors** that the current system does - and by the same criteria.\n\nYet you claim the current system shouldn't be doing that.\n\n> Trolls getting punished? did you miss when it was a big deal and announcement worthy that one **single troll** was pick up by the automated system? Because it never happens.\n\nSo because trolling behaviors hadn't been addressed by the automated system, they weren't being addressed at all?\n\nPlease do tell me where you're getting that data from. I keep hearing the claim, but no one seems willing to source it.\n\n> It also says they'll send you messages when someone you report gets banned etc. Yet, in the 4 years i've been playing, I've never once received a single message about any of the trolls i've ever reported being punished. not. once. \n\nThe system is around a month old. It also only shows for the player who's report **triggered** the case. This was done intentionally, because of concerns about the potential spamminess of the system as more tools are applied to the punishment systems.\n\n> Do you have any proof that number of reports in game do nothing? it's a big reg flag on you that more than one or two people in a single game found you unpleasant to play with- that makes a difference in the same ways number of reported games does. Let's say you play 3 games. 1 report per game, or 4 reports per game. hmm.....multiple numbers of reports going into an automated system that just takes numbers of reports over half the time anyways. hmmm.\n\nWhile that may be true, it would **also** be hugely abuse-able - any random 3- or 4-man pre-made could trigger cases against whomever they wanted almost at will. Regardless of what people think, Riot's not that stupid.\n\nBy counting the number of reported games to build a case, the system ensures that pre-made groups don't have any more power than a single player. Because to do otherwise would be stupid.\n \n> Do you have any data for any of your claims other than what riot says? because riot tells you shit just to shut you up because they don't care- I don't believe anything they say at all until i see proof from personal experience.\n\nI've seen no reason to disbelieve them. I've yet to see any trustworthy evidence that any of their claims about the general functions of the system are false.\n\nIf you have such evidence, I'd be very excited to see it.\n\n> And not as much of a problem? again, i've been playing this game for four years. I've never once encountered someone who spams their stuff like that. not one game in four years. Soooo.....your logic is where, exactly? if it's a **rare** problem, and 99.9999999% unheard of....what's your point here? One person got banned one for spamming the entire game in multiple games, and suddenly you're telling people they can get banned for just spamming like it's nothing and happens all the time. Yet, like i said, there isn't even a report feature for trolling.\n\nOne person gets banned for something that's done **extremely rarely** (which would indicate that even just a single ban is a very high ban rate for the behavior) and it... means it's not bannable?\n\nI don't really understand what you're getting at, here.","replies":[{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-08-07T00:52:38.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yet, you have no proof for any of your claims either.
