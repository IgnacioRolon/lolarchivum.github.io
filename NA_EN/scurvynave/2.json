This has happened to me randomly but usually during a fight in each game but in every game I have some lag issue. I never had this before the new summoners rift and my internet connection has not changed so what is causing this issue and if anyone has an idea on how to solve it please advise me. On the other hand if there are others having lag issues ever since the updated summoners rift add your thoughts as well and lets get this problem some notice.","replies":[{"poster":"Coffee N Kitties","date":"2014-11-14T03:40:35.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant even play now, I get 1-3 sec lag delays.

Personally I think new map looks cool but if you take away the accessibility, then your going to lose more gamers then attract. I tried the new summoners rift and it was completely impossible to move or play. I have about 35 FPS on old map and I go to 8 on new map... Dont push out your fan base by making your game unaccessible.
