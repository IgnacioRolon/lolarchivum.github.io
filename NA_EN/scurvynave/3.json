New items and better costs but Essence reaver makes the 3 listed champions as broken as RIven&#039;s sword. Sure there are new times but as always, there&#039;s the one build path which is best. No variety in style of build or champion choice.\r\n\r\nGameplay/Momentum: We&#039;ve all experienced it. Games are short curb stomps or slaughters where one mistake by one teammate can screw over your chances of wining. The minion changes help slightly but now I feel as if I&#039;m playing an over glorified Call of Duty game instead of a strategic team game. Get you ad assassin or marksmen fed is the new name for League.\r\n\r\nMasteries: Good Lord. Instead of choice we have broken mastery of the week where you find out that these new masteries are better than most champion passives. The Warlord&#039;s rampage, thunder lords League etc. Not only are the masteries too synergetic with some champions while leaving others in the dust. Plus Swain, Anivia, and Karthus nerfs because of them? Really? Did we learn nothing from Warwick and Feral Flare or Sejuani and CInderhulk.

They do exist.\n\nFor me personally, I don't see any pros to it then shorter games that are stomps more then close drawn out games. I find a game dependent on snowballing to be poorly designed because when about half your champions are reliant on at the very least three items, they become unviable to your team. Nasus is literally only slightly viable because he can 45% CDR, and the stall-to-win is still what those few games I don't have decided by 20 minutes are.\n\nI am someone who despises anything that is reliant on getting kills to get ahead, any system designed that way is flawed. If I wanted to play a game designed that way I would play First Person Shooters, and I don't even see this new system punishing mistakes, in fact I am seeing less of it, because 75% of the top lane reliably-viable champions(such as Darius) don't care if they give up two kills, because in most matchups, him simply being that strong up until late mid game and into late. \n\nAnother issue is an entirely personal. I like huge tanks(Sion/Maokai/Naut/Sej) and picking those champions other then sejuani is very set circumstances just straight up puts your team behind from the get go. When games are basically based around stuff that happens in the five-to-nine minutes, I see flaws. Mistakes that early, should not be strongly affecting what happens twenty minutes later unless there a ton of the deaths in that span, and yet, they do.\n\nIt is flawed to me, and more infuriating than entertaining.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solitair","date":"2016-01-03T00:16:09.703+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I like what they did as far as trying to give each adc a unique identity, but MF in particular feels a little too oppressive with her unfairly long ranged slow, generally steroided abilities, and insane poke.

Unkillable Mundo's surface every game it seems, and it's exceedingly difficult to recover from the failures of other team mates to deal with them--at the very least, people could learn to lose their lane without feeding. \n\nI feel sad for mage mains, and as someone who often fills, I usually have to take on mid lane because it seems most people would rather not. This was not the case last season(seemed like support was least wanted role).

I just wish Riot's purpose for them regarding meaningful desicions was not limited to \"pick thunderlords or your team will hate you\".\n\nWhat I really, really, REALLY DESPISE about this new season is the vision nerf. I feel like I'm freaking blind all of the time, and heavily reliant on the support's ward placement. When I am the support, I feel a lot of the burden of vision come down to me. Everyone else uses blue trinket, not because it's so great, but because the alternative is garbage. So the answer wouldn't be to nerf blue trinkets, but to bring the other trinkets back to a good place. A dark map may be exciting to watch, but it isn't fun to play, and having been used to taking control of vision, it freaks me the fuck out. I feel frustrated playing top and mid.  Where I used to have such a good handle on my vision, and liberally used vision advantage to win  my lane confidently, I now shiver in place like a Chihuahua in December because I don't know what the fuck is going on around me. It's all very confusing because Riot's idea about season 6 and running theme was \"meaningful decisions\". What about the decision not to buy greens? Or the decision not to purchase a trinket upgrade? Or To purchase such things? were these not highly meaningful decisions that could win or lose games or otherwise severely impact the outcome?

Graves is strong but not an every game adc. Caitlyn serves two roles: A safe option for non-adc mains who just want to farm and stay relevant in team fights without putting themselves in too much risk, and over aggressive early game styles where you want to keep bot lane pushed hard. Jinx and Sivir are only hurting because games don't last long enough for them to really put on the hurt anymore, but are still decent picks. Kog and Draven are the two really in need of help.

The sacrifices you make for utility and defense are actually fair and not gutting to the whole laning phase. Supports can actually build some damage and god help be a little more fun to play without completely f'ing over your adc. Thunderlords does need to be looked at, but even if they made no changes for season 6 it's a way bigger improvement over past masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-01-03T19:05:09.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Hey, it wasn't only 2 jungles that could do a full clear. {{champion:19}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:11}}  could. that's 4","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MKDkilla","date":"2016-01-03T03:14:02.403+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Rift Herald is extremely important, especially for devourer junglers. Adds +5 stacks, and it's a very good objective to play around. Top lane is less of an island now, which is much better.\n\nADC upgrade also threw out the reign of {{champion:222}}  and {{champion:67}} , both who were much more cancerous than MF and Lucian. Quinn, Trist, Corki, Twitch, also got very much needed changes, especially the former. Variety in bot lane is far better than it was before, Urgot and Kog are the only ADCs I have seen little of. \n\nThe game punishes mistakes far more now, which I think is a lot better. Teaches idiots not to try and take enemy red after taking inhib at 40 minutes. Lane phases, especially top, are far more interesting than the average 20 minute farm fest it used to be. \n\n6 Masteries are already in plan to receive buffs, and it will almost certainly change before season 6 comes out. Masteries before were stale as shit and were unnoticeable for the majority of their time. Swain/Anivia/Karthus nerfs had nothing to do with masteries either. \n\nJuggernauts are not ban/pick anymore... Assassin item hasn't even been released yet, so calm the fuck down.\n\nAnd no good changes? Poppy rework, revamped champion select on the way, stop talking bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-01-03T05:31:06.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> ADC upgrade also threw out the reign of {{champion:222}}  and {{champion:67}} , both who were much more cancerous than MF and Lucian.

The top 5 ADCs are Lucian, Vayne, MF, Jinx and Trist. You could argue that Corki is also up there, personally I'd say he's a solid sixth place, he's better than the rest of the ADCs but isn't quite as good as these 5.\n\nAfter these 6 ADCs fall off super hard. I very rarely see ADCs like Ashe, Twitch, Sivir, Draven ect. These guys just seem to have fallen off the face of the earth.\n\nSure, at the top end ADCs have better variance, but in the mid range there's just a huge gap between the ADCs who are actually good and who just aren't good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"MKDkilla","date":"2016-01-03T07:15:12.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cait is in a good spot, Twitch is considered good by pros who use him like Dlift, Sivir is the same.
