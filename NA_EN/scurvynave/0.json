They went on to explain how they had made changes to it and that they acknowledged the player base&#039;s outcry at the (lets admit it) ugly splash art.\n\nThis post originally made me smile. Not only did it explain Riot&#039;s reasoning for what they did but they also admitted they did not exactly hit the nail on the head with Fiora&#039;s visual look.\n\nBut then.....\n\nI though of another rework which bombed in both visual and gameplay terms and was hated before during and after the rework till this day by the champion&#039;s original player base. Thats right, I&#039;m talking about {{champion:69}} .\n\nIn my opinion she&#039;s practically been ostracized by riot ever since her rework. It was a rushed, shoddy affair for the Shiruma event and most players in general will say she now sucks in game-play, balance issues, and lore/ champion identity.\n\nSO WHERE IS THE POST FOR US CASSIOPEIA FANS? ......admittedly I can&#039;t expect riot to make a post about every mistake (which Cass&#039;s rework is), but it would be nice to see that they aren&#039;t picking favourite&#039;s when it comes to player feedback and rework attention. Morde is still getting attention but Cass is left in the dust.\n\nI don&#039;t need a full scale rework to be happy, nor a promise of one in the future. \n\nHowever, it would be nice to know that since Fiora&#039;s rework, where only the art was an issue, got so much attention and change that maybe we can give some love to our favourite snake lady cause Stashu stomped her into the ground and we haven&#039;t seen anything about her since.","replies":[{"poster":"Tummers","date":"2016-01-06T20:35:43.355+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":5,"body":"As the dude who wrote the Fiora post, I can maybe shed a tiny bit of light on some of this:\n\nMy job is telling stories about League and the work that goes on behind the scenes to keep it running, make new stuff, etc. Some of these stories will touch on tough topics like [Fiora](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/champion-update-and-flawed-fencer) and [the recall bug](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/total-recall-or-time-we-disabled-ranked), some will support new stuff like in-depth looks [at Foundations' Bilgewater work](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/building-bilgewater-pirate-renovation) or the way [artists think about animation](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/dev-blog-animation-poppy).

I like her current state (in game, both play and look wise) and I feel how she was before was a big problem and needed to be changed. I also don't feel it was in any way shoehorned into the Shurima event. It makes perfect sense to combine a rework with a matching lore event and when done right it's a beautiful thing, like it was with the GP and MF reworks (not saying they're perfect balance wise, but overall great reworks).","replies":[]}]}
