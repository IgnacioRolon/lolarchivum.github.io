She got a shitty rework and lousy lore which turned her from a sympathetic villain into a generic backstabbing evil noblewoman. She now has no character no reason for any ambitions and nothing redeemable whatsoever. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys feel? Do we really want updated lore or are we really just wanted expanded lore with the same Characters we know and love not some new idea of Riot&#039;s &quot;vision&quot; for how they are supposed to be? Its fine for them to say that they will &quot;continued/add on to the stories in the future&quot; but we all know how their promises for things in the future go.\r\n\r\n-Just kinda sad and down about how Lore recently seems to be shifting character personalities and such or eliminating them like Pantheon&#039;s. Is all the old stuff I liked doomed for destruction?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-27T03:05:10.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think that the recent lore has been great.  I really liked the bilgewater, shadow isles and targon events. Also the write ups for kindred and jhin were pretty great. I mean they aren't probably going to get to every champ anytime soon but so far like what they have released.\n\nFingers crossed for my favorite champ jax to get new lore. He old was basically being so fcking op in the league of legends (the old lore when it still existed) they had to limit him to fighting with a lamp post but even then he still went around smashing people to bits.","replies":[]}]}
