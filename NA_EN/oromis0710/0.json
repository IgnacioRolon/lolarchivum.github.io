Now all the sudden she can't log on to the legacy client, has to log on using the new one, and every single game it won't let her connect after we get past champion select. I've done EVERYTHING on the support and connection page, I've flushed the dns and tried everything I could find on this forum. It is in no way our network because I connect and play just fine sitting right next to her. We have NEVER had this problem before and I'm going to get very upset if leaverbuster starts making us wait in low priority que because all of the sudden riot won't let her connect.  Her screen name is Skylight082. Shes running a repair now after already trying a reinstall and it failing. Any help would be greatly appreciated cause I'm getting severely frustrated.","replies":[{"poster":"A Karthus Main","date":"2017-01-08T10:13:28.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm having the exact same issue, having also tried the exact same measures you have.

We understand that sometimes emergencies happen, but a consistent and common trend of leaving will eventually land the account in an LPQ. This is because regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively affects everyone in the match. This is a contributing factor as to why all disconnections are treated equally and why we are unable to remove penalties associated with disconnections for any reason.
