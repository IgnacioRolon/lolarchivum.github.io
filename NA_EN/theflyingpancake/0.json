But yet it works, didn&#039;t know that its godly to bring smite and ghost top and dominate lanes that way. or purposely die under towers whenever you need to back. And I didn't know that the best build path was to just buy 4 dark seals boots and refillable potions 10/10 seems like something everyone should build His whole fucking kit just does not fit anything the game has to offer.","replies":[]}
