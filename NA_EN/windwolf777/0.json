My name is Akali. People seem to have forgotten I exist since I was nerfed in 5.2._\n\nI believe Akali is actually really strong against Yasuo. Here is how I use Akali to beat Yasou.\n\n1. Start boots + 4 pots. You need the MS to help dodge is tornado, at least, if you are on the east coast like I am.\n2. You first item is {{item:3145}}.\n3. If he is competent, you next item is going to be {{item:1029}} . If not, then you want upgraded boots. I usually go with {{item:3020}}. These will help you position better for setting up your harass (wind wall is a pain).\n4. Finish {{item:3146}}  and build as the battle unfolds; if you are primarily dealing with Yas, I recommend {{item:3157}} as your next big ticket item as Yas will probably be your problem the entire match.\n\nNow, how do you use your kit . There are a two things to accept as fact (and they will make you play better as you won't stress them):\n\n1. You will not out farm most Yas players early game. Farm as best you can, but you don't need to out CS him to beat him. If you are getting about 70-80% of his CS you will do alright early. You will make it up later (and make sure you do, you need that gold to stay relevant as Akali relies on raw numbers to stay relevant).\n\n2. Do not try to kill Yas. This may sound counter intuitive, but you will get more kills not trying to kill him. Trying to kill him will get you killed. If he wants to run away, let him. Do not get baited into a tornado/ult combo. Make him play your game (which is a balance of patience and aggression... fitting for her character now that I think about it).\n\nAkali's basic Anti-Yas strategy is as follows:\n\n1. Watch him. When he gets his tornado proc, bait it and dodge it. Do not go in on him until he has burned it (I would go so far as to say wait for him to get it, bait, dodge, engage, so you don't have to worry about him getting it during a trade).\n2. Akali's best opener (Q [wait] R AA Q AA) is the perfect combo for Yas. Your first Q will proc his shield, which will fall off before you want to AA (or R-AA) anyway. Q doesn't hit as hard as its proc, so this ends up being pretty big advantage for Akali.\n3. Yas will be forced to choose to block a Q or your R. If you find he is saving it for your R, bait the wall with an R immediately after Q. This way, you can reposition and R-AA the Q proc or you end up on top of him and proc it (then use shroud to escape or set up another Q-wait or Q-AA combo). If he blows it on Q, just wait and try again.\n4. Once you have blown everything, RUN. Do not stand there and trade with him, he will beat you. If you have been keeping even, he is going to be very hurt and will either back, or try and stay in lane. The former is as good as kill as you can now make up some farm or roam. The latter, just have patience and wait for your next opportunity to strike.\n5. Careful fighting him amongst minions, he will build stacks quick. You need to be ready to run.\n6. Shroud isn't always about defense or escape. Sometimes (this is something I don't have a guide for, it's just something I do on the fly) I will W before or after the initial Q to set up a pattern. After one or two full combos on Yas, opponents learn that your shroud means you are going to unload and they should get out of your R range. This is really useful if you want to farm as you can set up your combo, then farm when he distances himself from you. Don't make a habit of this or your opponent will learn to call your bluff (and sometimes you want this, as you bait them to their demise, again, you need to feel the flow of the lane and your opponent).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buttigieg 2020","date":"2015-08-03T23:18:22.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pop his shield with an auto attack and then follow up with a damage ability.

DO NOT push him into tower, he can get every minion with an aa+e, if possible let him push and freeze it infront of your tower. If he blocks an ability with windwall, abuse the long cooldown.

If they land a grab their win chance raises by 3%, I swear. If they have a Blitz in general it's like a guaranteed lane win. If he grabs you then you are fucked and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nYou may say, \"Stay behind minions lel\" but he can just ult to clear them instantly or use his W to zoom around them like Blitz formula one. \nYou may say, \"Get Banshee's Veil lel\" but unless you're waiting until FULL BUILD like 40-50 minutes in where you've likely surrendered then it'll be too late.

At an average of 400 movespeed I'll have 160 distance I'll be able to travel if I click immediately after he uses grab. So that gives me like a 0.2 seconds max time to click and dodge it. Average human reaction time is 250 milliseconds so I'm fucked. \n\nYou may say, \"What about Thresh lel\" but his has a windup of 0.5 seconds, pulls you half the distance, and takes 1.5 seconds to pull you. \n\nThen Blitz also has a 1 second knockup on a 5 second cooldown.

If you get there just as the minions start fighting, chances are he's already got 3 turrets down and is ready to dominate. Get to lane early and harass him super hard. Destroy his turrets. Poke him a bunch. Heimerdinger is EXTREMELY squishy early game, so you can get him really low. Also, play intelligently. Never stop moving around so that he misses his rockets and stuns, and most importantly, **NEVER** chase him through his turrets. You have no idea how many kills I've gotten because someone decided to head right into my turrets and walked right into a stun, or I was ganked and both players decided to head into the turrets.\n\n...which brings me to ganking. There are certain times you should and shouldn't gank Heimerdinger- because trust me, if he has 3 turrets up and all of his abilities ready to go, that's a double kill for him right there. Gank him when he has all of his turrets down and on cooldown and doesn't have his stun or ult up, either. After level 6, he'll probably place down a mega turret during ganks. **In scenarios like this, focus the mega turret.** By around this time, he'll have rushed Zhonya's, and so he'll most likely activate it after placing his mega turret, giving you time to destory it before you kill him.\n\nAlso, **DON'T let him get fed.** This tip stands for any champion, but especially Heimerdinger. How viable he is late game depends on how fed he became early game.\n\nSo yeah, just do all that. Or you could play {{champion:69}} and be the bane of my existence.

Personally I don't ever start stacking turrets in lane unless I'm top and jg starts that side (bc then I can't take lvl 2 and walk to lane). Heimer takes a jg camp w/ turrets while taking very little dmg from tanking a couple hits, and level advantage can be huge because it sets up a tower dive when you hit level 6 and the enemy is level 5. Also it lets you not push the lane immediately and get level 3 before you start hard pushing, so level 2 ganks aren't a big threat. I find that more heimers do this as you go up in elo bc it's a pretty big advantage, and almost no one checks to see if they're doing this, or tries to stop it.\n\nAlso {{champion:8}} is the true bane of his existence, a good one auto beats heimer. His aoe thing clears turrets w/ the wave really fast at 4 stacks, and he can q to heal off the turrets and just out sustain the turret damage.

If you win your trades soon enough LB will have to recall and you can shove the lane and earn back the creeps you lost and if LB does not recall you have lane advantage and she is forced to play safe. \n\nOn your first back buy as many potions as you can - you will need them.

Being aggressive from a range early will usually cause them to lose cs and fall behind. But one still needs to be wary of her level 6. Her Q travels counter clockwise, and it can be used to farm or poke from a distance. Try to walk counter clockwise if you see it cast or walk directly towards her so it will arc around you.\n\n After level 6 try to see if you can keep the jungler nearby. Diana will probably go in on you as soon as she sees an opportunity for a kill with her ult. Bait them and have the jungler come in when they do. If Diana does go in on you the best thing you can do is keep calm. If you try to run she'll use her E and proc her passive on you. The best you can do is turn and try to trade or CC her. And keep a close eye on her. She may go bot to snowball and her ability to kill squishies makes her very good at killing ADC's or their valiant support sacrificing themselves. Late game she relies on a strong engage to go in first. Otherwise she'll die right away. She'll most likely dive in on the squishiest person in the fight to kill them. Then use the reset to kill the next priority target. Try to CC her and prevent that from happening. \n\nI hope this was a bit helpful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"windwolf777","date":"2015-08-03T21:09:45.309+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jase135,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B7Uyyhh4,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-03T20:51:38.881+0000)\n>\n> Personally the champs I have issues with are {{champion:1}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:5}} and {{champion:157}}\n\n\n{{champion:1}} I honestly don't know really.
