Faker wants either SKT Ahri or Syndra, Duke wants Gnar or Ekko, 2 Junglers have not yet decided, Bang has chosen Jhin, and Wolf has chosen Nami,&quot; (Daily eSports)\n\nEdit (12/6/2016): SKT Ekko has been confirmed - Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVyfHbh-Iz4\n(38:42 - Duke: \"...at the end I chose Ekko but I don't know if they will make it or not\")\n\nEdit (3/21/2017): Okay some people are getting confused. These picks are for Season 6 Worlds. I just said 2017 because that's the year (THIS YEAR!!! :D) the skins are being released in.\n\nEdit (4/17/2017): This is a month old, and I forgot to update this when this vid came out. But, Bang confirmed his pick 'Jhin' himself in his stream. \nVideo: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5guqoIkTsg\nAdditionally, the proof video of SKT Interview I attached few months back also had Wolf revealing his pick to be Nami, confirming the rumors. Furthermore, Bang in the video attached to this edit again says the same.\n\nEdit: 6/9/2017 - A new thread dealing with the brand new spoilers of the skins are now posted: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/fOLtrbLY-2017-skt-skins-spoiler\n\nSKT Syndra and SKT Olaf has been confirmed officially, as well as other skins for the second time.
