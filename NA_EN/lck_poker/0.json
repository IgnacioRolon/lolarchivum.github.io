It sounds like your wi-fi is causing you some problems, and if possible I recommend using a wired connection to see if that helps strengthen things up.  If not, our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide may be able to help get you setup with a consistent connection.

Even if it was bug related, like how I was getting knocked in and out of games during the first week of new client, they don't even pull you out of LPQ.","replies":[]}]}
