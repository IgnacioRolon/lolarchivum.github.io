But because of mystery gifting, I am finding that I'm having to keep an outside notebook listing of skins I have for \"coordinating\" with teams. I know, I'm probably the only player who even cares. It would be nice to be able to see what skins I owned, and perhaps which champs I don't even have skins for before champ select and without having to go into each champion's page to see whats \"owned\". I play with a few different groups of people and half the fun is coordinating our picks so that we have matching, similar, or \"all\" skins.\r\n\r\nAm I really unique or are there others out there who care as much as I do?\r\n\r\nNOTE: Why is there no longer a \"client feedback\" board? Am I missing it?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-07T23:21:09.438+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to Skins > Selecting Show All > Sort By Champions, or are you referring to something else?\n\nEDIT: I realized this only shows skins that are currently available.
