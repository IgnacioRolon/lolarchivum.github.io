I log in to league and it says an update is neccessary, which takes a few minutes, then when i am in the play button is 0percent and scanning files.  I also get the message we had to revert you back to an older version of league and will reinstate you to the new version which takes a further hour.  \r\n\r\nwhat can i do to just play the game?  i dont want to delete the game but i guess that is the next choice. suppose my playstation will fill my days from now on....\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-06T01:26:28.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your client is having problems getting patched up to the latest update, possibly due to some file getting corrupted during the download, let's try a relatively easy fix before you jump to uninstalling/reinstalling.
