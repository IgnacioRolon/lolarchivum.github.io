In almost every game I lose connection with the game but only in the game (my friends can still hear me on discord). I don't have any weird lag or anything and my connection is fine until I lose the connection to the game. It's really annoying because it's totally random and I need to quit and reconnect from the game to be able to play again. I have this issue on LoL only. \r\n\r\nPlease halp me Riot :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T21:53:48.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network is probably having a few problems keeping it's connection with our servers for some reason.
