Shes always been a solid pick, if not popular.\n\nShe's not necessarily bad, but she was on the receiving end of some pretty harsh nerfs because she synergized so well with cinderhulk. Then they nerfed cinderhulk and never reverted the nerfs on Sejuani.\n\nHence the term, Sejuani'ed. \n\nMy memory is pretty hazy, but I do remember a Rioter also saying they also nerfed her because she had received enough spotlight attention in the LCS and wanted to basically remove her from it? Extreme paraphrasing, but it was something along the lines of like that.","replies":[{"poster":"LaughingMan11","date":"2016-02-11T16:11:21.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes always been strong though, thats the part im confused on, even before her rework, she was a strong and solid pick, they just buffed her too much when they reworked her. I think in general Riot seems to have an issue with champions being too viable, while having good team lock down at the same time. I've noticed when a good team lock down champ gets to be too popular, and sees LCS play, they very quickly nerf it so it loses popularity, happened with Malphite, happened to Sejuani, notice how Galio and Amumu havent really received any buffs other than minor adjustments? I could just be chasing a red haring, but thats my view point on it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-02-11T15:51:17.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All they need to do is nerf his synergy with that item, in order to keep it in hand.
