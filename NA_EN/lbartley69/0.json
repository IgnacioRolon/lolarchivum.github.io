(By the way i'm on a Mac) What is happening is that when i Launch the LoL Patcher It comes up and starts fine. it scans the files, then goes to the update. But within seconds of doing so, the speed goes almost all the way down, then back up to around 120, the back down to near 0 and it goes on like that making no progress. I left it on last night to see what it would do and it got to about 2 percent. I hooked my mac to the ethernet cable to insure that the speed was not an issue and it still does it. Im sorry if this has been answered before but i couldn't find anything. Im still new to the game and the community. Thank you in advance for the solutions.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T18:04:49.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble maintaining a connection to the patching servers.
