Earlier i used to play game at a constant FPS of 60 now the game starts around 100 fps and goes down to 30 in no time. it goes to 15-20 in team fights.  I tried reinstalling the game, playing at minimum settings, did everything asked in connection support. My PING count is same as to when I was able to play the game normally. I have updated my drivers and ran the repair tool too. almost tried every solution suggested on the support and forums but still the same problem. \r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T22:39:10.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be some bad game files not properly rendering some game files, and causing frame drops during some pivotal moments like that.  I don't think that this would be a connection issue in this case.  What specifically did you run on the Hextech Repair Tool?\n\nTo help rule out some possibilities, you'll want to go over the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide instead.  This will also help tune up anything else that can cause these frame drops.  Let me know if you have any questions about this!","replies":[{"poster":"Chancator","date":"2017-05-12T14:39:29.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he reinstalled the game, wouldn't that eliminate the bad game files theory?
