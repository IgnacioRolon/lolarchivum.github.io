You're adding more keys that the player has to maneuver their hand to. Some are particularly out of reach, in the case of the Alt and Ctrl example, and reassigning keys runs into problems of leaving other commands out. I can agree with the idea of scaling the communication learning curve by having the basic commands on one, and the specific commands on the other, but that can also be done by having an option in the menu to change from basic to advanced. \n\nEssentially, this is something that has equal arguments on both sides. I prefer ease of keystrokes, with higher required mouse accuracy, to more complex keystrokes with easier mouse accuracy... but I can empathize with those who prefer it the other way around.

I think a lot of people blindly look at this proposal and think \"Yeah, that's a great idea!\" without actually thinking about what it would be like in implementation.\n\nPings are meant to be a *quick* communication tool. As the current smart ping tool is set up, you just have to flick the mouse in one of 4 main cardinal directions. It's easy to learn and becomes second nature very quickly. Splitting everything in half to double your options means you actually have to use a degree of precision when you go to ping. Suddenly, it isn't necessarily quick anymore. It'll become more like bringing up a menu and selecting a menu option. Especially the Ult Up In X as shown on the example. People will either have to take slightly extra time to make sure they issue the correct ping, or they'll try to do it by muscle memory, and incorrect pings would happen much more frequently.\n\nNow, I can think of a possible viable alternative to this. We currently *do* have two buttons for pings. We have the normal ping button that gives you the smart ping menu. There's also the Back-ping button. Something that I could find much more agreeable would be to create a second 4-way smart ping menu for the back-ping button. It could include some of the things suggested (I would still shy away from the Ult Up In X, because I think the sub-menu idea is nowhere near optimal for quick communication). \n\nAlternatively, the back-ping could be replaced with the Danger ping (I view these as fairly interchangeable in terms of what they communicate). Then the Danger ping in the smart ping menu could be replaced with a Warded ping. Of all the proposed new pings, I think that a ward ping would be the most useful. The *only* disadvantage the ward ping would have, versus typing it in chat, is that you get the timestamps in chat. This lets you actually track how long the ward has left.","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixUnreal","date":"2014-07-26T18:34:46.596+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like suggestions such as having a secondary ping wheel for more advanced players as [Ctrl] + Click and drag. \n\nIt greatly improves accuracy and {{summoner:13}}, and leaves the regular ping wheel for beginners.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2014-07-26T23:19:27.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose a basic and advanced ping wheel could work as well.
