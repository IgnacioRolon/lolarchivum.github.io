Well here is my suggestion, Once in aram and a Champion has been selected they have to be stuck with that as their selection until they complete a minimum of 20 mins game play on that champion or until the match ends.  Dont let them be able to skip the Aram selection process if they get ashe and hate it then they have to be forced to play her unless traded or re rolled.   Just my simple thoughts on the matter.  Stops ppl from leaving aram to get a new selection.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T21:54:42.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an interesting concept.
