I even waited like 30 mins before and still got in q with them.  Like if i don't wanna talk to them or see them for reasons there has to be a way in the system of if you block someone you can't be on he same team.  I blocked this guy because he was my duo but after like 2 games i noticed all he did was be toxic  one game never talk the next and would troll hard and split push the whole game never group up.  We were duo bot and he trolls and goes top forcing rumble to bot with me like wtf why would i want that kid on my team so i blocked him and there he goes on my team the very next game.","replies":[]}
