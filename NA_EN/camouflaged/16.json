Your sticking to your guns to a bronze mentality that has already proved to keep you from improving and moving forward. KDA does not matter, kills while they can translate into objectives are NOT needed in order to get them. KDA means nothing. This should be evident from the png of your Annie game, why because you didn't win despite having a good KDA.\nIn my opinion you need to change your whole outlook on what wins games and how you go about winning. Again I'm not trying to be rude but your in bronze and there is a reason.\n-----\nFirstly stop blaming teammates, almost every game is winnable and blaming teammates means your not giving yourself chance to improve because the loss is not your fault it's the bot lane feeders. If you want to improve this is not a good mindset. \nIf your playing mid and winning lane you should be roaming to other lanes, ganking and then taking their tower. This is called extending your lead to other lanes. Or if your top and winning lane, ward and push their towers. If you find yourself pushing tower but not being able to kill it then push, let minions dmg the tower and roam mid or steal the jungle. If you bring tp top lane then use it to tele in for a drag fight or to help botlane.\nKills mean nothing if you don't use it to get objectives, if you roam and get a kill or force them to recall pressure the turret.\n-----\nFor example: your playing zed and you've forced your enemy mid to recall and your still reasonably healthy, you go bot and force them to recall. Now you and bot take tower and the enemy has a huge wave to deal with in botlane. Now you call your jungler to help drag because botlane has just recalled, now all 4 of you go mid and push. The enemy bot laner has to choose between stopping the minion wave bot (the choice most adcs will take because of greed for gold) or stopping your mid push. If you do get mid tower you've just set yourself up with a pretty huge lead.\nI honestly believe if you take this to heart you'll improve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neckerei","date":"2014-10-17T06:25:36.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Untill you accept that objectives and win rate are better than having a good kda you will remain where you are and deserve to be there.","replies":[{"poster":"Camouflaged","date":"2014-10-17T06:43:22.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Untill you accept that objectives and win rate are better than having a good kda you will remain where you are and deserve to be there.\n\nYou don't understand kills get you objectives plane and fing simple. You wonder why pro games have low killing scores its because when the ahead team is going for a turret and the other team is behind it not stopping them its because they know they would LOSE the fight and the other team would get even more objectives. You could have a 0/0 kill game and win you might be like \"ok no kills kills mean nothing\" no the team with the better cs got drags/ maybe a baron but more so the team that got more drags/did better in cs would be higher in gold so better items and the behind team wont fight because they would get killed and lose even more objectives. it all leads down to the same thing kills fight and DIE and lose more objectives or try and defend but in the long run lose objectives or get lucky get a few picks aka caught out KILLS and be able to apply a little bit of pressure it all leads back to KILLS even if you're not getting kills","replies":[{"poster":"Neckerei","date":"2014-10-17T07:46:36.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"suite yourself i tried to help you but you cant change the bronze perspective.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Camouflaged","date":"2014-10-22T06:09:29.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And my penta kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camouflaged","date":"2014-10-22T06:08:31.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why am i in bronze >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camouflaged","date":"2014-10-18T01:19:33.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll go and play a match and post the lolreplay link here so y'all can finally watch how I play","replies":[]},{"poster":"ACGIFT","date":"2014-10-18T00:36:09.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it looks like you CAN learn some lessons...

If you want to get to silver before season ends i suggest you improve your csing atleast try to get 200cs by 30mins(if you can do it in 20mins its GG), help your team get objectives. just look at your win rate with champs with 60%+ avoid dying more then 4 times.

You never scored a single kill over in botlane.\n* You focused too much on scoring kills than actually helping to push objectives.

But it looks like he didn't get much support that he needed.\n* When the enemy only had three resist items (and nothing on Zed or Singed, the main issues) getting BOTH Abyssal Scepter and Void Staff was a dubious choice at best when finishing that Deathfire Grasp would've done far better for you nuking others down.
