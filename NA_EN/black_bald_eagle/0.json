Because its natural to take offense to that, no? If people just told you that youre dumb all day, you would have a natural reaction to that, wouldnt you? And i dont mean your friends.

No one wants to play with people like that. The fact is people have bad games so do you its why you was placed with them cause ur mmr is similar, you are no better then anyone else in the game and you have no right to be that rude and toxic towards them. If you see something you dont like be constructive dont say oh your inting or running it down, also stay out of all chat and do not tell enemy team to end or asking for ff from your own team, at that point you clearly have a grudge vs someone on ur team and are willing to lose the game and make everyone in ur team lose because your feelings are hurt.
