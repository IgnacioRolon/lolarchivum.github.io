Can never get through the promos into diamond with it.\n\n*Granted it isnt MY fault that i cant win those games, but as Jungle Leona i cannot impact the game enough to carry plat5 players vs Diamond players. So those promo matches are generally all losses.","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T15:44:58.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beg to differ with one trick Tryndamere Foggedftw currently in Challenger.","replies":[{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2019-06-26T17:01:10.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FQVBSina,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=e0V4z9Oe,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-06-26T15:44:58.186+0000)\n>\n> I beg to differ with one trick Tryndamere Foggedftw currently in Challenger.\n\nNot all off-meta choices are equal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-06-26T15:27:08.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see you're a person of culture as well\n\nbut yeah that being said off meta is generally ok as long as you are trying and communicate that you're doing something odd\n\nan off meta build on top of that though...that's when things get tricky\n\nhaving an off meta build on a champion you're familiar with might get pinged or questioned \n\nbut doing both an off meta champion with an off meta build","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-06-26T15:34:48.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this isn\n> [{quoted}](name=Nacommuii,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=e0V4z9Oe,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-06-26T11:58:43.598+0000)\n>\n> I've seen quite a lot of debacle over off meta picks.\n> \n> In my opinion, if you are going to play off meta in Ranked you better be confident in your playing abilities with the pick.\n> On the other hand for norms just do what you want, as long as your having fun ig.\n> \n> Or skip over this and play what you will!\n\nthe off meta thing has been conflating with trolling/griefing and people are too slow on the uptake to grasp that.\nanyone can play adc janna, no one will bat an eyelid unless you don't take lethal tempo or something, however no one will be on board with some griefer who chooses ignorance as to how the game functions ie. nubrac.\n\nlet's use janna as a yardstick.\n\ntop lane solo janna? sure\nmid lane solo janna? sure\njungle janna? sure\nadc janna? sure\nsupport janna? sure\njanna sitting in another lane other than bottom as a duo? hell fucking no","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-06-26T13:32:20.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off-meta is fine, as long as it's a good-faith attempt and you communicate it to everyone who it'll impact.\n\nMe going Leona top affects basically just me, and at most my jungler as well since they need to pick someone with decent damage now if they want to gank. That's it, though, and people go damage junglers all the fucking time anyways, so that's not really something special I have to communicate.\n\nWhen you start going to unusual strategies or picks botlane **in particular**, however, they *need* to be communicated. If you're going support Ashe I need to know that ahead of time and know, in general, what I have to cover for. If you're supporting some other lane than botlane that **definitely** has to be communicated, since it affects most, if not all, of the team, and I *have* to pick around that as an ADC.  You don't have to warn me if you're playing Kalista as an ADC (although it would be appreciated so that we can actually use your ult), but if you're planning to take her midlane to stay there that suddenly becomes a concern I have to pick around.","replies":[]}]}
