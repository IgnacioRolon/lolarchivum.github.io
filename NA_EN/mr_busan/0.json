The system first needs to scan your game files to prepare for an update, so I'd first suggest waiting a bit to let it do it's thing.  I don't recommend taking any steps unless you are getting any error messages.  If it does take too long though, I'd recommend using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure your PC is allowing access to game files.
