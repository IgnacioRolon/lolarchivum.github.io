Rather, gains health regeneration based on the number of units in an area around Namos. 50% of this regeneration is added to nearby ally champions’ health regeneration. This regeneration decreases the farther the champion is from Namos, down to 0%.\r\n\r\nQ – Calloused Skin\r\n\tCost: 5% of your current health\r\nDeals 5% of your target’s maximum health (capped against minions/monsters) in magic damage. 50% of the damage dealt to the enemy is converted to armor and magic resist for a short duration. (ranged ability, instant damage but delayed resists)\r\n\r\nW – Mend/Graft \r\n\tCost: No Cost\r\nPassive: Gains a percentage spellvamp\r\nActive: For the next 5 seconds, your basic attacks heal you for one percent of your maximum health on-hit (0.5% on-hit against minions and monsters, max 15% total healing). \r\n\r\nE – Flesh Rope/Grapple\r\n\tCost: 10% of your current health\r\nThrow a flesh tendril in a line dealing a small amount of magic damage aoe to everything it strikes and slows them significantly for a short duration. If the tendril strikes terrain, you have the option of pulling yourself to the impact point by activating Grapple (this will be a small windowed opportunity). **There is no additional effect for striking an enemy along the travel path.**\r\n\r\nR – Flesh Puppet\r\n\tCost: 15% of your current health\r\nSummons a controllable clone of Namos with health equal to 70% of your current health, attack damage, ability power, armor, and magic resist (attack speed and movement speed remain the same as yours).  It can intercept projectiles as if it were a champion, will draw aggro from turrets when striking an enemy champion, and its basic attacks heal you for a portion of the damage it deals and slows enemies on hit. This clone **does not** apply on-hit effects.\r\n\r\n*Notes:*\r\nThis particular champion will have ranged autoattacks, and I believe will offer players several different paths to build based upon their playstyle. Because of the kit given, it wouldn’t be unheard of to have the champion built as a tank or a bruiser, but at the same time could be used as an offensive dps provider based on the healing on w active Graft. Players will also be given the option of choosing to build the champion as a mage, as abilities can scale off of ability power/magic damage, or as an attack damage carry because of the on-hit healing provided through auto-attacks.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the passive, I tried to think of something a little more unique, but still allowed it to fit in with the theme of the champion. At first, I imagined just keeping health regeneration out completely, but realized this would be a horrible idea, because of the way the health items work in the current game-play. Rather, with Namos' health regeneration scaling with the number of units near him, this can cause a unique reaction with the increasing/decreasing amounts of regen. It wouldn't be set in stone as to how much you are getting per second; rather, you have to be aware of your surroundings in order to maximize your potential. The same can be said for the enemy, however, as it may become viable for the enemy to quickly dispatch all of Namos' minions to decrease his healing and his spell usage. \r\n\r\nAlso, I realize I have numbers in here. I am not saying these numbers need to be followed precisely or even at all. Literally, I put them in there to make a mental picture for myself in what I am imagining the results to be, and to possibly allow for others to picture it as well. Also, I am terrible with names, so if you have a better suggestion, I am open to hear it. \r\n\r\n**I will make edits where needed**","replies":[{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2015-01-13T05:52:12.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the whole capitalizing on HP regen from others around you. Also, does he act as a late/mid bame engager with his E then R? while earlier he is simply a regen survivability/ sustain champ? Always good to get some more HP based champs... then maybe we could see some more HP focused items that benefit them all, like zac, vlad, and morde, so hard to build them but the sustainn spell vamp and such solves that! good for you! hope to see Namos in the future on the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"TaricsFamilyGems","date":"2015-01-13T22:29:54.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, with this, I was primarily hoping for the champ to be more of a mid-late game initiator for fights using his e to force up fights. In the early game, it is all about survivability/farm to get essential items for team fighting. Because of his passive, the more HP/5 he can get, the healthier he can keep his allies; this said, late game offers the best utilization of this (more-so than the early or mid game).","replies":[]}]}]}
