There would be so few people at any given time that either matchmaking would be so off that challengers would be matched with unrankeds or hour-long waiting times for a game. By limiting their availability to only a few weekends per year they are able to keep them fresh and people's interests enough to have a healthy playerbase when they are available.","replies":[{"poster":"amadnoob","date":"2017-05-27T04:30:18.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then may  you please tell me why aram is permanent  ?? if you are going to answer cause many people playing it  more than x10 people who is playing aram play other modes when they come out  . and i dont think if the mode is permanent it will be ugly","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-27T16:00:29.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason that so many people play the other modes is exactly because they're temporary. If they were permanent modes the novelty would wear out fast and they'd get stagnant like Dominion was.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-05-27T19:11:55.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a side note, Dominion is a terrible example to use here because the situation was much more nuanced than simply \"the novelty wore out.\" The average League player wasn't interested due to the negative perception (and common misconceptions) of the mode. Meanwhile, Dom fans lost interest due to Riot not following through on promises of support and competitive features.\n\nSnowdown Showdown, Legend of the Poro King, or even URF would've been better examples.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
