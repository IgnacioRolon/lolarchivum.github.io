Since varus&#039;s lore has stated that he is a beautiful by darkin standards does this mean that Darkin were originally human shaped and are not the fleshy abominations that we see as rhaast and aatrox. Or is it that varus appears to val and kai as a beautiful man because that is how their minds interpret him ( Kinda like how spirits and magical creatures appear to humans as something they can comprehend or relate to). What I hope is that the latter becuase it would be kind disappointing to have Darkin true forms be similar to humans. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I wonder about is how all the Darkin are related. Because so far we know that varus has a &quot;sister&quot; and that rhaast and aatrox are &quot;brothers&quot; but to what sense? Do they all consider eachother siblings? or are they siblings through parents ( if they reproduce like humans do)? or are they &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot; through bonds they have formed?\r\n\r\nSo far in the lore there have been three ancient wars mentioned( that being the void invasion, rune wars and now darkin war). Are these wars one in the same? Since it has been established that the use of strong magic like world runes have caused a number of terrible things to happen such as the birth of demons and breaking the veil between the void and darkins world. Could it be that all these wars happend at the same time or did they occur at different moments? Are the darkin and void related or are they two completly different entities?\r\n\r\nIf a rioter would like to answer these or if someone with theories of their own would like answer these questions I would love to hear.\r\n\r\n{{champion:266}}  {{champion:141}}   {{champion:110}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dinopawz","date":"2017-12-01T17:20:31.878+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Good questions...\n\nA great many of the Darkin were humanoid in appearance (though not all...) and the forms they have in Runeterra, are the best approximations of their original forms they can craft with the crude matter of mortal flesh as a canvas.
