Now, Yorick is strictly a top lane split-pusher  (No support or jungle possible) that is subject to the fickle whims of the live balance team.  \n\nIf Meddler decides that he hates split pushing one patch, Yorick gets Olaf'd, the rework gets wasted and riot laughs at all the bandwagon people who bought Yorick for the rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2016-08-28T10:39:29.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dang, cage the adc then stun them would be like the nicest gank setup","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylvant","date":"2016-08-28T17:03:21.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played supp Yorick, it works ok for normal games to some degree, but it definitely doesnt work for ranked alternative. Yorick is mainly a selfish champion, with little to no utility. Playing him on the support role cripples the ADC, which requires farm, utility and protection. Maybe there is just a few ADCs which are partially exception to the rule and would endure such combo. Splitpushing on the other hand is far from what support should do.

Not raising ghouls takes a large chunk of power out of Yorick's kit. Outside of his circle (that is destructible) and his slow, Yorick brings nothing to support his fellow laner.
