In-Lobby CAPTCHA is a suggested solution.","subforum":"Player Behavior","embed":{"description":null,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/gahPoQJ.jpg","image":"http://imgur.com/gahPoQJs.jpg"},"up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So bots have been around for years. Players can quickly tell them from actual players IN LOBBY. LoL Hell is seeing Bots on your team (Even TWO) and knowing you can't exit the lobby naturally (without penalization), can't forfeit IN-GAME (bots don't vote), and 99% chance you can't out-play the humans on the other team.\n\nRiot Support can do nothing. I report them all day every day, both teams. So many of them. Riot hasn't taken initiative to use the methods that we can tell they are bots but HAS SUGGESTED something else.\n\nTLDR create a captcha in lobby to prove you're not a bot. If someone doesn't answer it they get removed from party/disband and no penalty for remaining players in lobby. Riot Support suggested I make this thread because tickets won't do a darn thing. (They said I had to make a forum post).\n\nSo that guy I was speaking with in the picture said \"Darn I wish they had a thing that said 'r u a bot' and they have to click it\"... well that's 2x I saw the same suggestion in action so HERE I AM posting it. These things run straight into enemy towers and players and completely throw a match from the get-go. You can't even forfeit and have to wait 15 minutes anyway even if you could... It's really abysmal.\n\nBetter image: https://i.imgur.com/OBEdd3M.png","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-09-29T19:37:32.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsF7enQY8uI","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-04T20:40:07.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arammus,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tTzx2b0I,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-09-29T19:37:32.924+0000)\n>\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsF7enQY8uI\n\nLMAO","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Namîste","date":"2018-09-29T04:41:42.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"HECK NO!

Worst is when you have bot(s) on your team and you're vs a 3 man party... it's so bad! I main TT game mode and it's sadly very, very common.","replies":[{"poster":"Namîste","date":"2018-09-29T15:16:49.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh so twisted tree lines only?\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nSo not every game...just Twisted Tree Line.

First game, each team  had a bot, Second game team8 took a hit for dodging instead of playing with a feeding bot team8. Third lobby ALL MY TEAM WAS BOTS. I dodged queue and got a 6 minute penalty... I guess it's shorter than a 15-30 minute \"game ends at mercy of enemy team\" ... Bots don't forfeit btw. Suffer, or suffer. LOSE LOSE scenario.\n\n'\n\nIn our next game. 1 teammate is a bot and we're VS a 3 man party (Zed, Udy, Pantheon)... This is the most common scenario. They immediately knew this and fed off the bot 9 kills in 4 minutes. This was an extreme advantage and enemy zed could now one shot any of us.\n\n'\n\nIn the following game. Both my team mates were bots. #RIOTWAKETHEFUCKUP\n\n'\n\nIn the next game both team mates and all 3 enemies were bots\n\n'\n\nIn the game following my 2 team8's were bots and we were vs a 3 man party. Woo hoo! THANKS RIOT! Nunu, Irelia and Teemo. They immediately knew my team was bots and smashed them like free food. At three minute mark Irelia was tower diving and could take 5 lasers without dying. Had 4 kills on the bots. At 6 minutes she had 9 kills. - Does riot want to say bots are not affecting games? I don't log onto LoL to piss my time on forced losses. 8 minute mark 16/1 and they would 3vX steamroll our team. Irelia would non-stop tower dive with 0 penalty. RIOT you are awful for allowing this to continue. ZERO excuse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-09-29T15:27:43.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably a way around captcha.","replies":[{"poster":"Dylor","date":"2019-05-13T21:09:05.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an automation engineer for application testing for years, I can say, Captcha is pretty damn effective(though AI is catching up). \nYou obviously have to weigh the annoyance of it against the benefit. I definitely think TT PVP needs it. The problem is, you put it only there and then the bots will move on to the next most beneficial mode. At the very least, provide an option for a player to demand captcha if things look suspicious in lobby. \n\nOr conversely require captcha at the end of a game to claim exp/rewards.","replies":[]}]}]}
