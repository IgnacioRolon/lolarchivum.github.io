Has Riot not figured out that there is a huge skill difference after 6 years between the Leagues.  Having your main account and then basically dog-****ing you other has honestly killed the integrity of the game.  Yes, I am a Bronze Player and I am sure proud of it.  I don&#039;t come into LoL with this crazy attitude that I have to climb the ladder.  I have fun just playing at the level I am, but then you have these higher league players who tanked their entire level 1-30 and also 10 promo games so they could end up in the same league as myself.  Does it feel good for them to just roll over lesser skilled players,  Maybe it does, I wouldn&#039;t know but this has got to be the worse for those players like myself to experience these types of situations, And then when have these toxic players who think they&#039;re gods gift to League that has done nothing but bad mouth players that actually belong in bronze.  When will this get fixed,  I could sit here all day and let these MOBO bro&#039;s come to WoW and any other MMORPG to watch them whine day in and day out on how bad it is to get rolled like a player like myself, but that&#039;s not me.  Come on Riot.  Just because we play at a lower skill cap in a MOBO doesn&#039;t mean when have to get trashed all day long.  It is very tiresome, listening to their complaints over and over on how bad we are.  If they earned a league then that is where they should stay to better improve their skills,  Not be able to tank a SMURF account so they can roll over new players for their EGO so they can make the new players basically wanna leave the game the moment they start.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-11-02T10:53:16.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Smurfs are the core problem with people getting boosted from Dynamic Queue.\n\nIt's the elephant in the room that Riot doesn't know how to take care of.\nThere are some legitimate reasons to Smurf.

Problems at high MMR, usually queue times, are the main reason.\n\nEvery time I see this argument, I immediately wonder how much the \"solution\" contributes to the problem.  There are two ways I can see that smurfing contributes to this problem.\n\n1) They aren't playing at high MMR as much while they level the smurf.\n2) Once they finish leveling the smurf, they are now taking multiple slots out of the limited pool of players that could be their competition.  (Using Challenger as the one rank with the a specific number attached to it, suppose for discussion's sake that half of the challengers have a smurf also in challenger, that goes from 200 actual challenger players to about 130 that could potentially be on at a time as competition to queue against them.  The principle extends to other tiers, given that they break down to more or less a percentage of ranked accounts.)\n\nHow much better would queue times at high MMR be if all the high MMR players only played their high MMR accounts?  I can't truly answer that, but I expect it has to be at least some better.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-11-02T21:45:33.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think queue times would improve for some, but not all.
