I was getting invalid username/password. So I opened a ticket, answered what questions I could, and filled it out like they said to do for account recovery. This was Friday or Saturday. They sent me an email to check the ticket but in order to check the ticket you have to log in, which I can't do. How long does it typically take to respond to a ticket? I'm not complaining about the time, I'm patient. I just want to know about how long before I make another request or whatever the next step would be.
