Again, it&#039;s not a large bug, but it can be a little confusing. To clarify, the mask is the only thing that does not change, and after about 4 seconds it changes back to normal.\r\n\r\nIf you need an example, let me know and I&#039;ll snap one in game. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only person with this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Teynir","date":"2016-02-19T04:50:58.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem! It's just something I've noticed. The other bugs that I have reported these past few days are way more important.

This is a larger issue that we're aware of, but isn't something that's a quick fix. D: We're still looking into it!","replies":[]}]}
