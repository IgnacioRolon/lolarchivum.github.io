Snow Day - Recall issue","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When Malz recalls in his Snow Day skin, he hugs one of his voidlings. The voidling featured in his recall is the color of a blue-screen of death, and was not like that when I purchased the skin. There is no texture to the voidling. It is a bright blue, and it is visually unappealing. Please fix this asap. It does not seem to be an issue with graphics, as I have tested this on 2 completely different PCs.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-19T18:02:21.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BWG Smexy! \n\nThanks for the report! This isn't a graphics issue - it's a missing texture. :] We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix. In this case, it wouldn't be a gameplay issue, but rather skins. ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teynir","date":"2016-02-22T03:06:25.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, sorry :(\n\nBut thanks so much for getting back to me!","replies":[]}]}
