Anywhosle, I own Union Jack Fiddlesticks and the animation stops during his dance and he freezes, he will get ghost when he stops moving for a minute. Whenever you click down on the map and he finally gets there, he stops all animations and looks frozen in time. Also when you recall the animations stop whenever you get to the fountain and he just stands there, MENACINGLY.
