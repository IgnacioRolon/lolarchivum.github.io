AFKs because of sudden real life issues can't be detected , but can AFKs because sudden blackouts or the internet turning off be detected ?

The lower priority queue only happens after multiple games as well, and not just one.  Your best bet is to help prevent whatever may be causing you to leave games, be it technical or other issues.  Good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-11-30T03:48:33.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFKs/leaves for any reason can get you penalized, so yes, you can be penalized after a sudden blackout or internet crash. However, you won't be punished if it happens only once or twice, unless you already have a history of AFKing.","replies":[]}]}
