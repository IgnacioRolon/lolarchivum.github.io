Currently I am** still **sitting at Rank 2. However, I feel like comparably to my friends and others I've spoken with, I should have moved up by now. I have played over 150 games, I frequently am honored by teammates, I've never been punished. It feels like something is wrong where I am not getting credit for my honors.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no transparency with this system for me to verify that there is in fact something wrong.
