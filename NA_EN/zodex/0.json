I&#039;m ecstatic that 4K resolution is being looked at finally, but the largest problem I have had with it is the Cursor sizing, which is the one thing that was singled out as still not supported. This is by far the biggest problem with playing in 4K, it is an extreme disadvantage when your cursor is so small. It took me until almost the end of Season 7 to notice how much it actually impacted my gameplay. I was HARDSTUCK in Gold 5 since I started using 4K resolution (last 2 seasons I have placed in Plat5/Plat 2). Once I shifted back to 1920x1080, I immediately noticed an improvement in my gameplay and started winning games again, nearly got back into Plat in a couple weeks. \r\n\r\nMy question is why is it so difficult to fix? Is it being given up on? I haven&#039;t been able to find ANY comments from Riot regarding 4K. If someone could provide me with some insight, or a link to any previous comments from Riot, I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2017-12-06T20:11:09.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I can commit to is looking into it.

I'm super excited. I put in a ticket on this matter and this is what I had gotten back. But hearing this, is a lot more encouraging. You are my hero Rayven!!!! \n\nThis is what the rioter Corndog said in response as of December 12th 2017.\n\n\"Unfortunately as you've said, League doesn't yet support 4k resolution. We hope to have it implemented in a later patch, but it's not something that can be discussed at this moment. As far as \"why not just make the cursor bigger\", it's a matter of how the UI scales as a whole. When the resolution is bigger than the game was designed for, it would be a matter of sizing everything about the game larger, not just the cursor to fit. You can change this in a way, by changing the game's video settings to play in Windowed mode at 1920 x 1080, which scales the UI to fit correctly. I understand that this makes the game smaller, but that would be the only compromise I would have to offer, aside from scaling your monitor down to 1920 x 1080, which downgrades your monitor's image quality.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sneakback","date":"2017-12-13T04:38:52.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only things you can scale are the minimap to 150% and the cursor.
