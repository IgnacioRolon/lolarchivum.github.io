I know that it's a high-pressure job and people yell at you a lot if you don't make the entire team happy, but I just want you to know that I'm super grateful every time you come through bot lane to serve us up a piping hot plate of the enemy ADC with a side of support (and if we're lucky, a dragon for dessert!).\r\n\r\nWhen I first started playing League of Legends, I learned how to play from a friend of mine who would pick jungle just to cover for my newbie mishaps in lane. It wasn't until I started playing frequently without him that I realized how much I had depended on my jungle to keep me in the game and let me focus on trying to win lane. Thanks, Louie!\r\n\r\nAlso, as a Thresh main, I'm extra-thankful for the junglers out there who blindly trust my ridiculous lantern dive gank attempts and are forgiving when they (inevitably) fail. Trust me, the five times I accidentally lead you to die under the enemy tower are worth it for the one time we pull off something out of a KR solo queue highlight video.\r\n\r\nSo here's to you, junglers! May your ganks be praised, your mistakes forgiven, and your Baron smites true. Everyone else, hug your jungler and tell them you're grateful for them (so that you don't have to do their dirty work :P ). Happy Ganksgiving!\r\n\r\nWhat are you thankful for this year? I'd love to hear some of your stories (League-related or otherwise)!","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-11-27T21:40:49.015+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thankful that we still have the few supports still in the game.
