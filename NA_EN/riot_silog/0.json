I loved video games, but I didn't have my own system  -- that is, until one memorable Christmas where my dear old dad took me to an Electronics Boutique, grabbed a Super Nintendo, and told me to pick out a game (I grabbed Final Fight). Now I work in games, and my dad reminds me every now and then that if he hadn’t done that I probably would have been a high-powered lawyer or something. Best dad ever. \n\nGifts are a great way to show someone you care -- and show them how you care. **So, tell me: What’s your favorite gift of all time, and who gave it to you (or who'd you give it to)?\n**","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2014-12-24T19:47:38.080+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think when I was about four I got an incredibly expensive remote control car from my grandparents.

For me, some of the best gifts I've received haven't been tied to a holiday. They've stemmed from someone's thoughtfulness or generosity, just for the sake of it. Like when my sister sent me a book, completely out of the blue, of the cutest French Bulldog photos you can ever imagine (I have an adorable, farting, Frenchie). Or when my boyfriend built me a computer when we first started dating, and set it up next to his so we could game together.  Or when he bought me frozen yogurt yesterday.\n\nThe best holiday gift I ever received is probably the guitar my dad bought me for a birthday a few years back. It led to me writing songs, forming a band, and discovering a passion inside myself. It changed my life. I think the best gifts do that. So I guess sometimes, the best parts of the gifts aren't inside the wrapping.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-12-24T19:26:07.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"froyo is best present XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-25T00:41:02.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love music, the best gift I think i've ever given was a song I composed for my mom when I was 10\nmerry Christmas Riot Neon and Riot Silog","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2014-12-24T23:14:00.809+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, uh... *thinks*\n\nI GOT IT!\n\nThis year, I got one of my gifts early.

Two of my brothers are autistic, and my older isn't too close to my family. My relationship with my mother, who lives in a different state, is shaky at best, and my Dad worked all the time when I was a kid... So I really never developed a huge relationship with my family. My friends though, I picked. They feel like family to me, and playing league is a sort of bonding for us, at least for me. I suppose playing over the holidays isn't much different playing over the rest of the year, but it feels like I at least have somebody to feel close to for the holidays.

Besides a Nintendo 64 (which I still have today after, I believe, 10+ years.

Now, I am awaiting for Kingdom Hearts 3, which, after 10+ years, is slated to come out late next year, or early year after.\n\nUnfortunately, that poor thing died to static electricity frying the mother board (my sister was very young at the time, and we made the mistake of placing it *on top* of our entertainment set. At times, it seemed like it enjoyed the floor more so then its respective place). I think maybe a year passed, and I got an Xbox 360 which my mother won off of a raffle (she paid $20 for it!). I still have it after, I think, 7 years, and it still works fine. Had to replace the disk drive on it though, but other then that, my Xbox was never a victim of the common Xbox problems.\n\nThis year, I bought myself an Xbox One. Although my old Xbox still works perfectly fine, I am such a massive Halo fan, that, in order to continue the series, I had to get the Xbox One, which kind of sucks.
