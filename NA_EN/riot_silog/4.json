I find that speech is most valuable when it dissents from the majority, albeit in a respectful and constructive manner (I don't disagree with you that those posting that this is \"dumb as f**k\" should simply keep their comments to themselves until they are willing to contribute some meaningful message to the conversation). I truly wish people would stop down-voting posts simply because they disagree; the down-vote system is intended to be a way to remove posts that are toxic or designed to incite anger rather than discourse. Also, your statement saying \"if you don't like it go read a different thread\" mildly upsets me; this is the same line of reasoning used by individuals stating \"if you don't like our country, move somewhere else.\" Is that to be our new stance, that we wish only to hear people who agree with us express their opinions, and those who disagree should go elsewhere and collude together? This mindset stifles the flow of information, reasoning, and directly hinders constructive debate and problem solving.\n\nYou also state in your initial paragraph that this class has merit because its something people would \"rather do\" in college; while I can appreciate this statement, I think it misconstrues the purpose of college _courses_. Yes, college can and should be fun and entertaining, but the subject material of the course itself should pertain to fields applicable to the students future, either in general or major specific. The problem with courses such as this are that they provide a significant distraction to students, legitimizing a recreational pass time as a scholastic activity, thus validating the off-time substitution of gaming for actual school work. Simply by offering this as a course with credits, rather than a club or student group, the college has given an implicit green light for students to dedicate large portions of their time to gaming. To clarify: i'm a gamer (obviously, as I'm posting on this forum), but games, on my list of priorities, are by necessity lower than productive educational pursuits; the inclusion of such a class in a college's offerings upsets this value hierarchy, blurring the line for impressionable young students.\n\nI don't hate the idea of this course, but I do seriously worry about the implementation of it, as well as the precedent set by this college in allowing a course of this type to be both created _and_ taught by students.
