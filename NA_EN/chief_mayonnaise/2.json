Sure, Lee Sin was the poster problem child because of his dominance in the jungle, but Zed was always being complained about. He may have taken backseat to other champs, but the fact that there has always remained a vocal distaste for him shows that he's always been an issue and will always remain an issue until they give him meaningful corrections to pull him in line with mana users.","replies":[]},{"poster":"INoble KnightI","date":"2016-05-26T08:43:54.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem was that this season Zed gets 2 fucking ults because of {{item:3147}} .
