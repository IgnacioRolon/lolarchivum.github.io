In a pure blind pick, banless environment, without it, there are team comps that simply can't do anything to a Soraka / Akali / etc. Since you removed wicked Hatchet/Executioner's calling.\n\nAlso, Luden's echo in general has kind of revitalized AP builds on every champ in the game, and often times high burst AP assassins now just out perform any champion that isn't stacking 2-3 MR items, and having somebody get Locket of the Iron Solari isn't enough of an augment to this. It creates a scenario where knowledgeable players get zoned away from all walls and fog of war when a Leblanc / Akali / Shaco /Ekko aren't accounted for because they have incoming attacks you can't avoid.  Maybe buff the MR aura on locket, or reduce the base damage on Luden's echo?

Possibly with a new twist, such as pulling 10% of incoming magic damage (before resistances) from allies buffed by the aura and redirecting it onto the item holder.  Perhaps also give it a bonus of providing AoE resistance (like Elise's spiderlings have) to minions so tanky bot laners can buy it to push more effectively against heavy clear.  Moving over the old MS aura from captain boots onto this item as well would enhance this effect.  Long live the tanky bot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-06-06T10:57:38.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC you nerfs all those auras some time ago.\n\nEsp. on TT it's unnoticeable","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-06-06T04:36:07.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally like the added cdr it gives to ADs who can go a little mana hungry (I like it on my hec).
