My post game client doesn't take four minutes, but it takes about 15-20 seconds to load. Everyone's usually done talking and/or already left. I don't really mind the chat, but the wait is a bit annoying, especially when I'm playing with friends who assume I'm done playing. This just started happening in this and the last patch. I've played this game for several years now, never had this problem before, or even when the new client was first released in beta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2017-03-09T04:59:31.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same.  it annoys the fuck out of me so much, it even plays the sound effects of people chatting while i watch the loading animation.
