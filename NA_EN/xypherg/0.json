The client didn't lock in and the campion selection stopped.\r\nAfter my time penalty I started a new game and I were not able to change summoner spells, runes or masteries and again i were not able to lock in the champion.\r\n\r\nBoth were ranked games and I lost LP because of those errors...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T16:57:08.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like an unstable connection reaching champion select,  losing sync and leaving you behind.  You should go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot towards a fix.  I suggest doing it in a custom too to prevent anymore penalties.  Sorry that happened.  :/  Let me know if you have questions about this!","replies":[{"poster":"XypherG","date":"2017-04-07T17:10:25.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I were able to chat and even got answers back from my teammates. I told them I am not able to change the summoner spells. \nAre you sure that it has to do with the connection?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T17:15:16.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm pretty seasoned here so I would hope I have some idea of what I'm doing.  :P  Yeah dude, your connection is probably unstable but it doesn't mean it has to disconnect you entirely.  You might be able to chat via pvp.net, but have other problems during champion select.  There could certainly be other factors, but that guide exists to help rule out possibilities.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"XypherG","date":"2017-04-07T19:21:22.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks anyway. Have a nice weekend","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
