Its the duty of players to help each other out when questions come up.  The question was asked in a developer discussion of how the new drakes work so it was very easy to miss in the sea of comments.\n\nMaster of Dragons could be a cool concept, have you seen his Dragon Knight skin?  Its legacy so it might not be in the store for a while.\n\nSubmit a world saver champ?  I think there was a post for it a while ago but I didn't look into it enough to find out anything.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
