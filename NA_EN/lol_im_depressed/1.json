(Mac)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing League yesterday, no problems. I woke up this morning and decided I'd try to get a game in. I open up the Launcher, and click the big orange button that says \"LAUNCH\"\r\n\r\nand nothing happens. The Launcher closes as if it's done its job, and I'm left here wondering where I went wrong. I've repaired about three times, and re-downloaded and installed twice. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"BluLotusSpirit","date":"2017-05-17T19:44:23.599+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the exact same problem as of todays update, tried reinstalling the whole thing, the kernel thing and even with the HextechRepairTool and nothing works… the client just don't open...","replies":[]},{"poster":"wawaweewa","date":"2017-05-17T19:21:49.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same exact issue since an update today.
