Thresh kept to his chambers beneath the island and wasn't intimidated by fear. There is no mention of aiding the Ruined King, and the only mention of a lantern was when he was in his chambers and after his death. The lore made a point that his most defining pre-death feature was his pale looks and the chains he wrapped around himself. \nYorick, on the other hand, is a lantern bearing wretch who would have reluctantly aided the Ruined King after the other guardians of the Isles were killed in front of him. Wretch is most typically used in reference to the deformed, which is what a hunchback is.","replies":[{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2016-08-26T00:17:03.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems I have miss read then :p.

In the Hecarim lore, he dips her in the water, she awakens as a zombie and he casts a spell to bind them for eternity, and his spell creates the mist. In the new Yorick lore, the moment he dips her, the water creates the Mists that envelop the island. \nIn one hand, the Ruined King's folly is casting a eternal bonding spell on his wife that gets amplified.\nIn the other hand, his folly is being so arrogant as to defile holy waters with the selfish desire to reverse death. The waters, which only have brought life and sustenance, experienced death for the first time and become twisted and the mist forms, bringing their new twisted interpretation of life to the Isles.","replies":[{"poster":"YouCantClickThis","date":"2016-08-25T21:55:01.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@OP\nIf you want a basic summary read \"Champion Insights\" section: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/yorick-champion-update\n\nAlso adding to what Sharjo, and GreenLore said. Yes, I also believe that this is what created the mist. The water becomes contaminated when placing something without life into the water, and when the king infused magic that bonded someone with natural life, and someone with unnatural life, along with the magic the island possesses as a whole, it created the black mist as a result. Kinda re-iterating what I said, but, I believe when the water initially became corrupted when the Queen was dropped in it, this corrupted water would turn people into a zombie when touched, rather then giving eternal life. But because the king used magic that bonded pure and undead life, the water had a nuclear reaction, thus resulting in the \"Shadow Isles\". This is my explanation on what caused the reaction. \n\nSometimes the black mist will re-emerge, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2FFGBPXNeU. I'm thinking it's basically a natural tsunami or hurricane that happens in these corrupting waters, so this \"mist\" would spread. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oIrtZT1j,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-08-25T17:42:31.648+0000)\n>\n> You need to read the two pieces of lore better.

It's not said that the mist immediately came about, it said \"the resulting black mist\" meaning the black mist could have resulted in the events that took place afterwards. There wasnt even a reference to the king using magic made, i don't see a reason why Riot would retcon that event, not like it contradicts anything so far.
