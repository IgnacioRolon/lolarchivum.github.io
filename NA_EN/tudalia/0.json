None of the champions loaded in the fountain, and I could not buy any items in the shop. I could type though. \n\nI exited out of the league client and tried to load it back up again but I did not get a loading screen. I tried several times.\n\nRiot gave me an automatic loss (my team ff'd at 3 minutes), AND put me in a low queue as a leaver buster punishment over something that was completely out of my hands. The client did not load for me despite trying many many times.\n\nWtf riot? Can you refund the lost provisional game. How is it fair that I getting punished over something that isn't even my fault?\n\nMy first attempt at loading the game back up: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/186376518\n\nMy second attempt &amp; leaverbuster punishment: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/186376701\n\nThe Bug Report that popped up: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/186376760\n\nI want to play my 9th provisional game. This is not fair I get a loss for it and lose MMR over a riot client error. I do not deserve to sit in a 20 minute leaver buster timer over something that isn't my fault!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T17:57:45.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey that really sucks, I'm sorry.  :(  We wouldn't be able to restore promos or adjust ranked stats, we literally don't have that ability because any modification could literally break the system.  Looking at your details and the videos, it looks like your network has become unstable and losing connection to our services like the game server.  Does this only happen while you're streaming?\n\nEven though we can't give back the promo, I do want to help.  I recommend sticking to custom games for now and going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, it does look clear that your connection is hurting right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Tudalia","date":"2017-11-01T05:42:08.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't streaming during that game. I opened OBS to record the screen so that I could have proof of the bug and of the client not loading the game. This has never happened to me before and my internet connection is stable. \n\nI have 10GB speed internet and it's hardwired to the computer. My internet connection did not drop during that time as I was able to access the internet, listen to spotify uninterrupted, I could chat in the actual game before i restarted (I just couldnt buy items in the shop and the champions didnt drop in the fountain), and I could login successfully into the client. If I had unstable internet I would not be able to do all of those thing. \n\nThat was 100% a riot client side issue. I am baffled that my punishment was not removed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tudalia","date":"2017-10-31T17:00:52.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The least they could do is remove my leaver buster punishment... none of the support staff even checked this thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AZ Frost","date":"2017-10-31T02:50:40.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what Riot did with this last patch, but I have seen (including myself) a LOT of issues with client, FPS drops mid game, and crashes that didn't happen like this before the last update. I don't know why the hell they are NOT widely addressing these issues. Guess they care more about having fun in China then fixing the game for the masses.\n\n(You know how hard it is to play a skill shot based champ and ur FPS (not ping/ms) goes from 70 to 11?
