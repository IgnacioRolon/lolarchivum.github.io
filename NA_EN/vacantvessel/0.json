That skin doesn't seem like it's currently up for sale in the store right now, but you can be sure to know when it is by checking the [**sales page**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales)!","replies":[{"poster":"vacantvessel","date":"2017-08-11T23:05:49.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply. I am not trying to purchase the skin 'on sale,' I simply want to buy it outright. I am in the middle of a patch download and will update afterwards.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T00:24:42.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Little clarification, the skin isn't available at all in the store right now.
