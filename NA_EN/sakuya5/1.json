When you see hom start to go for it throw a skill right where he will appear (right in front of you) and you will basically always hit him. Then move sideways for the Q, the first part will hit you but not the second. When you are far enough you can respond as he runs away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Minimac2000","date":"2020-01-31T17:14:46.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ibqbZT4J,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2020-01-31T07:02:00.529+0000)\n>\n> Most of his moves are pretty situational, his W requires a lot of prediction or setup by your team, his E leaves him vulnerable if he doesn't have ult or didn't predict his W properly, and his ult only does damage if you stand on the very clear indicator.\n> \n> His Q is his only poke and it doesn't do muxh damage and is very easy to dodge, not to mention it stops early if it hits a minion.\n> \n> He is strong but not overbearing.
