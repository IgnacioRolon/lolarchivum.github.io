Bernie Sanders was chosen by his party to fail. No one expected him to win because he was a socialist. The reason for why they essentially supported him was to get bad press off Clinton. What they did not expect was the hardcore outbreak of left wing college students advocating socialism.\n\nBernie legitimately became a possible front runner because Clinton actually took bad press off him. Republicans have been gunning her down with negative press. I get the feeling Clinton thinks she&#039;s smarter than she is, or she thinks the American voter is dumb enough to be fooled by her lies.\n\nThe Democratic party is at war with itself right now. Bernie supporters trying to give Clinton negative press, Clinton supporters trying to sabotage Bernie.\n\nI still expect Clinton to be their front runner, but she will have many, many less voters specifically because she will probably upset Bernie supporters and wont excite independent voters.\n\nAs a result, if Trump can just keep his head down he will inevitably win. He&#039;s letting things slip out of his mouth, and Bernie and Clinton are feeding off that like Vultures.\n\nThe only way either one of them will be President is if they can sway the independent vote by actually beating trump in a one-sided debate. They can&#039;t come out even, they have to stomp on him. The one who can do that... if they can manage that, they will become the primary and probably the President.\n\nTrump started playing it smart recently. He [declined to debate](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/27/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-debate/85051930/) Bernie saying &#039;why should I debate the second place finisher?&#039; Truthfully he did Bernie a favor by chickening out, but it also further divided the democratic party. They&#039;re not sure who can beat Trump. Trump already has an expected majority vote, he has nothing to gain in a debate and everything to lose.\n\n\n**TLDR;** Trump will win unless he loses a serious debate.","replies":[]}
