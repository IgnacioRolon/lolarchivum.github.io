So it been a while that I didn't touch lol on my computer and after the big update (the one with the new icon), I can't open it. It never asked me to update it and it is the third time I re-download it... The icon reminds like the old one (square) and when I clicked on it, it appeared and boom all black...Can't even see the \"x\" to close it... What should I do now? I've been trying several tips that I read but none of it works...\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T23:22:10.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen you're seeing can be caused by a connection problem that's failing to download assets.
