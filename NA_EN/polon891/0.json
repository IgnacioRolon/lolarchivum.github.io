I mean, just look at any reality show ever. You can control the entire narrative if you have the control of editing. Besides, players have no authority anyway. Its literally pointless to name and shame. Maybe YOU would be shamed by anonymous strangers and change your behavior, but if I was a troll and there wete people talking about me on a forum I would read it with a shit eating grin going look at these morons all outraged. Hell, only like 1% or less of the playerbase even uses the forums so most of the time it would just be a circle jerk of shaming when the person youre shaming doesnt even know about it, accomplishing nothing. Its just an entirely pointless endeavor.
