That somebody is logging on, or _has_ logged on without my acknowledge? Is there any way, to check this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T20:50:33.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can always check your match and purchase histories to see if anything looks suspicious.  You can also reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our account team can check for suspicious activity.  In general, as long as you have good safety practices you don't really have to worry about that.  I recommend reviewing our [account protection ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account)guide for good practices in and out of league.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
