Unless you straight up \"no life\" league you will get about 1 key for every 3 chests. The reason for this disparity is because you are guaranteed to get a chest for getting an S- or better(a very easy task), to get a shard you have to win and then RNG takes over. You CAN NOT get more keys than chests, but the drop rate for keys decreases drastically by the time you get 3-4 shards after the monther key reset. I don't know if there is a statistic out there, but from personal experience(I've never gotten all 3 keys for a month) i've won upwards of 30 games in a month and gotten only 4 shards. compair that to an average of 2-4 games(win or lose) to get an S- it's easy to see that the system heavily favors getting chests over keys.(which is why i have 29 chests currently) lol","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-03-17T23:59:18.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 keys per month actually ;D\n12key frags max per month/3=4","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-03-18T00:13:42.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh wow! iv'e never gotten more than 2 keys in a month even when i played a ton of league 60-80 games.
