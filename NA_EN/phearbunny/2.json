If the player is good he can negate plays from the opposing player.  A lot of people say to just bait his Windwall.  So, I have to hope that the enemy player is on the edge and makes a mistake? Yasuo has a high MS,he can even dodge some skill shoots.\n\nIn the moment he was revealed, I knew that his W would be a huge problem and powerful ability :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2019-03-14T02:10:30.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's just like Sheer Heart Attack, he has no weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2019-03-14T16:52:15.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Hand could've just erased it easily if Okuyasu used his brain for once.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2019-03-14T20:27:49.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"「N O  W E A K N E S S」","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2019-03-14T12:10:51.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"blue wind man bad!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-03-14T07:36:39.701+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"im surprised about 1 thing actually.\n\nsince...
