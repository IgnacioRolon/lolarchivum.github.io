TONS of room for playmaking/outplays/creativity.\n\nSo yeah thresh is super garbage if you haven't put any time into him.  He's not a champ you can just pick up and be like \"I'm good at thresh.\"\n\nYou and thresh have to go through some shit together.  You gotta wear the scars of battle together.

Don't take my word for it, just check out his winrate-to-games-played\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/thresh\n\nYou can be an absolute GOD on thresh if you put the time in.  Just like Lee Sin.\nor you can play him 4 times and decide he's garbage, which is fine too.\n\nBut don't you sit there and tell me thresh is a bad support when he's one of the most played supports in the LCS since his release.\n\nAlso consider he's not really meta right now, so many people who are playing him have no idea what they're doing, and shouldn't be playing thresh to begin with, since he doesn't really mesh with the way the game is currently played.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2017-12-19T20:35:14.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imho, what makes Thresh Support hard is communicating his Lantern combos.\n\nAllies who grab lantern are transported to Thresh. \nIf Thresh lands Q before an ally grabs lantern, Thresh can reactivate Q in time to transport himself and the ally to the hooked enemy. The number of times I've landed such a simple sounding combo is extremely low.\n\nIn fact- I find my ADCs putting themselves in harms way just to go grab a lantern I was using to safely collect souls. It's like everyone has a crack-like addiction to grabbing the lantern no matter what its being used for. \n\nI also see a lot of Thresh players building wrong: Starting Q and maxing Q first. I start E and max E first. I actually level up E,Q,E,W. The hook is your engage, but Thresh's kit relies on the soul buffer from his Flay (E). This is why Thresh sups can't utilize Relic Shield until around lvl 8- they haven't buffed their Flay attack.\n\nAnother issue I see is Thresh players not knowing exactly how Lantern works. \nWhen the lantern is \"used\", both Thresh and nearby ally gain a shield. So if an ally grabs lantern he dashes to you and you both are shielded. BUT- what people don't seem to realize is if Thresh walks out of the lantern AOE he still gets that shield- and if an ally is close enough they do to- which is a better mitigation technique is many scenarios than diving into the fray.\n\nI also don't see Thresh players using Q as an escape tool often. Q is a nice snare, which sets up a good Thresh grab, ult, and flay combo. But now you're down 3 abilities with just a lantern left. Unless you don't Ult the combo and try to use it as a buffer for an escape- you're pretty much a fish in a barrel. \nI max E and harass enemies with ranged AAs with fully charged E- and use my E more than my Q to engage. I like to save my Q for tight situation where I might need to hook a jungle creep and reactivate for a quick escape. \n\nBut- I don't like Thresh support because the difficulty of teamwork and proper use of combinations in the support setting. \n\nAs an ADC- Thresh's kit is amazing. He has slight range to his attacks- equal to Jinx's minigun. His Q,E, and R are great gap closers and CC options. Land Q on the enemy ADC, reactivate and use R before you reach them, use E to Flay them into a second wall- they haven't been able to make any actions bc of CC and have taken a decent amount of damage by now- plus Flay is fully charged and ready to chunk off the rest of their health. \nBecause Thresh collects Armor through the course of the game- then building AD itemization gives a slight advantage over your opponent- providing you natural defense against their Attacks that they don't have against yours.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vad Nova","date":"2017-12-18T07:39:29.248+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":18,"body":"*when you have one instance happen in a game and make a post exaggerating it into an epedemic it isnt*","replies":[{"poster":"JAGL Aqua","date":"2017-12-18T07:48:08.785+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vad Nova,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eheRY73u,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-12-18T07:39:29.248+0000)\n>\n> *when you have one instance happen in a game and make a post exaggerating it into an epedemic it isnt*\n\nAre you kidding me, have you ever played a tank support?
