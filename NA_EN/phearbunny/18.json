You were at 100%, so Dark Harvest and Electrocute are out of the picture, as the former requires 50% health, and the latter requires additional damage procs. This means the highest burst output possible would be Arcane Comet (118 damage at max level) + Scorch (30 damage). This totals -- assuming a level 18 Xerath -- 455 damage *before* resistances, which is not enough to 100-0 any ***level 1*** champion in the game.\n\nSo no, this is unlikely to have happened. Got a replay?","replies":[{"poster":"Zybertooth","date":"2018-11-24T11:54:14.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had scorch proc some 590 dark harvest dmg on a teemo poison lvl 8, I just think its bugging out even tho the math says it shouldn't behave so.
