Im tlaking about when you miss, and it becomes an AOE, if in the rare case a player AND minion occupy it at the same moment it ALWAYS latches onto the minion first.  It shoudl prioritize players, like many other abilities in game, like... i dunno... threshs hook that literlaly pulls towards players and can hit you through a wave becuase its coded to always latch onto a player first before anything else?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HungryAngry2SPP","date":"2017-11-27T17:02:25.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:53}}   {{champion:99}}\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2017-11-27T17:39:00.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}}\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQO_hFeH2a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQO_hFeH2a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQO_hFeH2a0 \n######rly tho fix this hitbox rito plz","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SarcasticShepard","date":"2017-11-27T03:21:12.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"These things happen when a company doesn't do QA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tzuyu Is My Bias","date":"2017-11-27T19:41:55.364+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've experienced it to be one of the most accurate zone hitboxes in the game so far. around 30-40 games as Zoe and against Zoe atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-11-26T22:22:27.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may not be bug but bad design decision.
