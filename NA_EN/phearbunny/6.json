Her laning phase is NOT the problem . \n\nThe problem is that her KIT , her entire KIT is designed to team fight and come back in the game even when you dumpstered her in lane . Because whatever happens , as behind as you can hold her in the game , she will pick up her Triforce , and she will last hit Q your teammates and she will get fed . every - single - time .
