I can not understand why you wouldnt want perfect balance. This game is in the worst state since like 4 years atm and that is only so, because of riots prejudiced balance and design team, aswell as their bias to certain roles/champs.\nI only hear riot crying about how bad the forum behaviour and overall feedback is and that they dont listen to their playerbase, because the biggest part of those are no good players and biased on their own, some are rude aswell. \nThe thing is all good and sucessful games listend to their community and tired to archive a perfect balance. tft for example needed no patch for like... 5 years? That id call balance. \nThe thing is instead of Riot denying all Request of the Community they should actually try to archive balance (for the biggest part of the playerbase) and they should try to listen to their Community (not only to the 0.002% challengers, funny is that they font even do that anymore....).  They are acting like emus hitting their head in the sand like : if i cant see the critic/problems it/they arent there. Seriously that is really tilting as player @Riot. and it is not helping anyone but you to lose players.

I said in another  discussion that the akali nerfs were the first \"good\" change since patch 7.2 and im serious if i say that. \nI think it has stopped ppl. from playing lol, but thats just my personal experience and nothing to put on everybody. \n\n> 2.

Sure there is a meta too, but you always have several choices. I think thats not the case with LoL, cause on the one hand there are many socalled \"unplayable\" champs (meta reasons) whereas on the other hand you have pick/ban or  \"instantwin\" champions. \n\n> 3.

Even a Gold player has a decent game knowledge these days, nothing to compare with season 2....\nSo why wouldnt you try to archive a decent game feeling for them aswell, especially because gold and below holds like 80% of all players. \n\n> 4.

Sure it may not look like it when they ignore some suggestions or disagree with people, but when you consider the utterly massive amount of people who play this game, it’s easy to understand why Riot doesn’t get to every idea.\n\nI dont think so, im of the opinion that riot only does listen to lcs/proplayers and only if Summoners Rift is buring, theyll do smth about it.  The best example was the - 5ms irelia nerf. Seriously that was like Riot sending a big \"f*ck u all\" out to the entire Community. \nSure they cant and shouldnt listen to everybody (at once) but if things like Duskblade, the ongoing dmg meta, akalis shroud, irelias rework, pyke, yasuo etc are beeing frequently criticised you cant tell me that they just \"didnt notice\" it. \nConquerer is the best example for how riot is not listening at all. Noone asked them to make a true dmg providing, massive overpowered, easy abuseable mastery.  What the Community was asking for was a mastery that helped especially bruisers. It could have been durability, mobespeed to stay close, defensive stats, or even offensive stats. But no some biased Riot employee likes true dmg more than his mother. Again noone asked for bruisers that oneshot you, while they are tanky enough to dive if they build one defensive item. Idk how it cpuld even go that wrong. \nSorry for the long Text but im really concerned about lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2019-01-31T17:24:58.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except people were asking for a bruiser rune and Riot delivered. The problem was that (imo) they didn’t do enough tests on the damn thing. \n\nYasuo is a great example why Riot doesn’t listen to lower ranks in the community. Yes, Yasuo is annoying as fuck, but he had clear weaknesses and abilities that tell people to play smarter around him. As much as people hate his windwall, good players can work around it. \n\nBut they’ll still hit Yasuo if he’s too much of a problem. When nocrit tank Yasuo was a thing, Riot killed it because it had no weakness. When warlords bloodlust healed off crit and gave Yas infinite sustain, Riot reworked that rune. \n\nThe difference between the boards criticisms and Riots reaction is that what a player may dislike might actually be something that works in the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2019-01-31T16:46:48.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're saying it's not the jungler's fault if I hard shove my lane into the enemy tower over and over then get ganked and die repeatedly?
