And that it doesn't go on cooldown unless she auto attacks. So if she doesn't auto attack someone/or can auto attack someone then her Q will be on a 13/12/11/10/9 second cooldown. \n\nBut lets list off the ways you can disengage from Vayne.\n\n- Any form of crowd control or displacement which the game has been heavily saturated with.\n- A heavy hitting spell like Brand W or Karma Q can easily get her to back off.\n- Just burst the squishy ADC with 550 range who is running directly at you. \n- Use your own mobility (Gosh its easy to forget that you have _your own kit_ with its _own strengths_ just like Vayne.) Anyways this could be a movement speed steroid, a dash, a blink, or some oddball like Bard portal and Kayn E. \n- Zone her off with something like an Anivia wall or Zyra plant. \n\n> She has no counterplay as does many adcs.\n\nThis isn't true because you can dodge her E from pinning you into a wall. Thats one way to counter her via playing the game, which makes your statement false. \n\nNow the statement that would be more accurate and I could agree with would be, \"She doesn't have enough counterplay.\" Which is fair and can be backed up.\n\n> Her only counterplay is burst her or CC her which isn't sufficient tbh since that never counted for statstick bruisers who got nerfed into oblivion.\n\nBecause statstick bruisers usually were not burstable/unharmed by crowd control. Yeah that Vel'Koz rotation is going to hurt like hell to the Vayne, but the Volibear might not care as much. \n\nAnd Vayne is supposed to be a hyper carry. Maybe her early game isn't weak enough, but she is supposed to be a hyper carry. Just like Fiora and Master Yi, Vayne is a super squishy duelist who's supposed to be weak to a team's focus/CC but will deal tremendous damage late game and when unchecked.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2017-12-24T18:49:45.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Umm if she is in a fight it is a 2 second cd automatically because she will auto u unless ur ranged, which is another huge thing anything melee without a gap closer even with a gap closer has a hard time against her.

Vayne trades her ability to kite for many other things. \n\nAnd you _can run from Vayne_. If she has her ultimate up, well its an ult.

If she chases anyone who isn't a juggernaut but melee, they probably have some sort of mobility or CC that allows them to disengage. \n\nOh and again, Vayne's strength is the ability to chase. Thats why her power budget dips into that department in both her passive and ult. \n\n_And tell me how the 550 range ADC with nigh nothing but auto attacks doesn't trade her ability to kite for her ability to safely siege and poke_. Vayne is going to have a real hard time against that Varus and Caitlyn if they out poke her.

She could use more counterplay tbh. I think a lot more ADC's should be like Varus or Jhin who have less reliable damage with more windows of power.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2017-12-26T04:50:52.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok? How was listing other champions with certain traits proving anything, you kept on talking about how her q wasnt as bad then completely switch as if point out other champions strength proves something. Regardless of what one says vaynes q is to much power for such a short cd, with the excuse being she is low ranged. \n\nReally flanking? This is only useful for assassins, for one by the time someone flanks the teamfight will be over especially  a slow moving melee fighter. Also flanking the backline means you not only have to deal with vayne but the backline mage and support. This is only an advantage depending  on the team you play against so is terrible and not even substantial counterplay. Also the point isnt even the stun for her e it is actually the knockback in general, because of it a flash must be blown, it is s must or you will not catch up.  Which is countered by the fact that most attack speed slows dont do much regardless and still doesnt change the fact her major dmg is uncounterable. Only two items really counter her effectively and are not enough{{item:3110}}  and {{item:3143}} both cannot be stacked one actually helps vayne abit too by giving health and the other is actually the only real item that can counter vayne but not even close to the extent of other adc's.\n\nDoes it matter when she penta kills your whole team, not able to do much because the supports has so much power. She does have weaknesses like she isn't as strong in teamfights and sieging, however that has changed. Towers are paper you dont need Cait to siege two ppl even one is fine as long as they have ad and attack speed. For teamfights vayne isnt actually as bad as other adc's she has very good peel with her ult and e and has crazy single target dmg she can 1v1 most adc's and ppl jumping on her will be bursted by the enemy team if attacking her. Mostly counterplay must be added in her w because it is just insane, she can burst tanks to fast much faster the regular adc's. Her range isnt even that big of a disadvantage considering her ult and kit ability.\n\nYes which is what ppl are complaining about we agree on this, and thats the problem with vayne. She is an adc who has the least counterplay out of almost all adc's, maybe comparable to lucian and kalista in the toxic but way less counterplay compared to them. When she is strong it is just toxic, her kit is toxic, to me worse then yasuo which i dont feel is as toxic.

They are either bad or good, rarely inbetween. She was designed in a meta where tanks/bruisers were the main problem so they made her to combat that. Now since that tank/bruiser meta was toned down, vayne began to fall off because of her inability to dish out any damage due to the \"range\" meta we see nowadays due to her small aa range. \nIf Vayne is able to get to your squishies (mainly your adc/support) then it's really your team's fault for letting her get close. You should be peeling your adc and keeping your support safe while they deal damage from the backline.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2017-12-24T13:37:07.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chewy Candy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Eg2u7ZQu,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-12-24T09:25:01.517+0000)\n>\n> Well you see Vayne is one of those champions who are difficult to balance, like Ezreal for instance.
