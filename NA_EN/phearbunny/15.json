You just remember times when you can't get her more, because she fills in the super-powerful Noble 6, and all of the others are either stronger before 6, don't *require* 6, or have Spatula items. Kayle's the only one that becomes the key last pick of a specific comp with no alternatives, so not having a Kayle feels worse than not having one of the other 5-star choices.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cr√§fty","date":"2019-08-02T00:46:02.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/LObAtPL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homeless Veteran","date":"2019-08-03T02:52:52.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle's only rare if you have 5 noble count lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"PikemanDim","date":"2019-08-02T10:03:46.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle is a good pick all around for a lot of comps to fill in the last spot.
