Assuming you play someone with level3 blitz with 2 {{item:1058}} based items. If that is not a case it doesn't even matter he hooks carry, he is useless unit that brings nothing to the team.\n\nI was trying to make compositions without carry with bow-based items to works but except perhaps Sorcerers who are extremely hard to build as they lack tank and assassins who needs BF-based items to work and are hard to win with in late, there is nothing that would work. Even if you want to base your comp around melee character the best option is to give him {{item:3124}} +{{item:3094}} +something instead of tank items. Bow-based items are way too overpowered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scazie","date":"2019-07-16T10:34:16.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PikemanDim,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=WsVWWK2M,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-15T21:32:06.973+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:53}}  Hello backline with bows.  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/453170053?filter=highlights&amp;sort=time\n\nMUH recurve\nMUH Shoujin\nMUHHH RNG\nPeople actually need to shut the fuck up.
