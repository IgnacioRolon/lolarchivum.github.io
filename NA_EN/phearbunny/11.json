The only time i dont is when im actually autofilled - to mid or bot.\n\n@thread\nWhen a jungler has an _average_ clear speed they actually run OUT of farm and _need_ to gank or waste time. \nJunglers need to tax because riot purposefully XP starves them. \nJunglers need to gank because theyre XP starved.\nWhen a jungler taxes you it isnt because theyre greedy, its because _they actually need the XP just to stay par._\n\nWhat you people need to realize is that if you _cant win your lane without jungle assistance, you need to improve_. It is not, under any circumstance, the junglers job to win your lane for you. If youre complaining about the enemy ganking you a lot - _its still ON YOU 100% because youre the one in an unfavorable position._ \n\nIf your allied jungler isnt ganking you _theres probably a reason_ such as wave position or the enemy laner might just not be very gankable.
