It NEEDS to be a CHOICE.\r\nLeona is another example. Leona is given AP, but AP has NEVER been useful on Leona, whereas AD has been, because her Q is a AA reset. Her most used rune page prior to this patch was a +15AD page even.\r\nWe NEED to be able to choose whether we are getting AD or AP.","replies":[{"poster":"NocturnalSheild","date":"2017-11-10T16:59:56.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't kat have better AP ratios? \n\nAnd doesn't every one of leonas abilities stack with AP?
