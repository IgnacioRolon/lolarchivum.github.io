One set for each side. First one to have all the pins knocked down loses.\n\nOr you could play a VIP style, VIP wouldn't be able to throw the ball at all, but would be able to shield him/herself unless he/she was the last one.\n\nPossibly add in a separately colored or marked ball that has a bonus effect of bringing a teammate back in if it hits or something.\n\n--- \n\nAnother idea is to move it more towards a challenge. Get all the campers lined up along a trail, path or some straightaway and have them all try to hit one 'challenger' as they hightail it to another end. There'd be some fine tuning naturally but the general idea is there.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2014-07-11T18:12:58.939+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think adding objectives is a great idea. One version we played back in 4th/5th grade did this.\n\nPlayed on a basketball court, with 3 large traffic cones set up on each side's baseline. You would win the round by either getting everybody on the other team out (standard dodgeball rules), or by eliminating all of the opponent's cones (by hitting them with the ball).\n\nIn order to protect the cones, you need to put yourself in the way of throws, so it's not all about dodging. Adds a cool extra element.\n\nAnd, since it was a basketball court, you could also try to score a basket - which gets all of your teammates back in the game! Of course, if you miss the shot they probably catch it and get you out, so it was a risky play.\n\n-------------------\n\nOne other option could be to do something like \"infection\" - whenever you get somebody out they join your team instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-11T19:02:28.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure exactly what rules you're playing with, so I'll go ahead and list all of the ones we used at a summer camp where I worked last summer, in case any of our base rules would be considered innovations to you.\n\n**The basic game:**\n\n1. Each team has a (soccer) goal, near the back of each side of the field. You start the game with everyone on your team touching the goal. Dodgeballs are lined up down the center line. On our signal, game begins. *Winning Strategy if you have the fastest guy: send him forward, and he tips all the balls onto your side of the field. If you don't have the fastest guy, just let them get all the balls and dodge the first onslaught.*\n2. If you get hit with a ball, you're out. If a ball hits the ground, it's dead. If you throw a ball and the other team catches it while it's live, you're out. If you block an incoming ball with a ball held in your hand, you are NOT out. If you throw a ball at someone and it bounces off them OR a ball they're holding and then hits another person on the opposite team, the first person is out via normal rules and the second person is also out. If that scenario happens but the second person catches the ball, neither of them are out and YOU are out.\n3. If you are out, you to go Jail - usually a tree to the side of the field. If a ball rolls or is thrown into the opposing team's goal, all the people on your side are back in the game! This keeps everyone engaged and rooting for their teammates even when they're out.\n4. You may only have one goalie. The goalie usually ends up having a ball in each hand. If other people on your team attempt to block the goal (note: this is more about babysitting the goal than hitting a stray ball out of the air), they are out. Your goalie can get out. if your goalie gets out, you may elect another goalie.\n5. If all the balls are on one side of the field, and the team on that side isn't throwing them, they are required to ROLL ALL the balls over to the other side, including the goalie's balls - so getting all the balls on your side and then waiting for the perfect shot, is not a viable strategy.\n\nIf this ever got boring (it never did, but we did this variation anyway), we could play **capture the flag dodgeball.** This is exactly what it sounds like: keep all the same rules as above, but add the following additional rules:\n\n6. You win the game by *either* getting the entire other team out, OR by getting their flag.\n7. You may free people from jail either with the goal, or like normal capture the flag.\n8. You may not be holding a ball when you are on your opponent's side of the field.\n9. When you are on your opponent's side of the field, you are immune to being hit with dodgeballs - you may only be tagged out.\n\nUsually the game is won capture-the-flag style, since it's really hard to get everyone out and much easier to sneak the flag out amidst the chaos of dodgeball. This combination allows for some really interesting strategies, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-12T00:59:45.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodgeball: URF mode.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, you can always turn to FPS games for inspiration. You can try some CTF or control points-style thing, where you have to get a certain number of balls to a point to win. This splits their goals between getting the other team out to get more balls, or saving balls to put on the point. RiotShadowStorm mentioned an Infection style game: another version is a FFA type where the zombies can only tag people, where others can use dodgeballs.\n\nAlternatively, you can try some other games, kickball for instance. I used to play a variation called Alaskan Kickball (or maybe it was Australian, I forget), where you play on a basketball court and instead of tagging someone with the ball to get them out, you had to score a basket.\n\nWe also played a game of CTF tag, where the field was split into halves, and if you got tagged (two hands) on your opponent's side, you were out and had to go sit in their 'jail' way in the back of their base. You could free your teammates by running all the way through the enemy base and tagging a person in jail. Also the area immediately around the flag and jail were safe zones once you made it there, allowing you to prep a sprint back to your own team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2014-07-11T03:52:23.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Throw some gymnast mats up and have them be able to use walls.
