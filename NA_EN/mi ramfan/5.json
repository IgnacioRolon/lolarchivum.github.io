Sure, the second thread got deleted by Pendragon, but not until six hours after it was made, and not by somebody who's actually on the job. \r\n-**Single downvotes killing well-written posts.** This is an issue with any voting based format. The ability to downvote something and make it less visible just enforces a circlejerk on popular opinions and makes it impossible for the other side of the argument to have their point of view heard. Imagine if, during a presidential debate, any person who was watching the debate on TV could instantly end either candidate's speaking time and give it to their opponent by pressing a button on their remote. That's what's happens every time somebody downvotes a good post because they don't like the opinions espoused within.\r\n-**Confusing formatting, with little clarification in the help tool.** This is a little bit less important, but there are so many tools in this forum set that we could use to make our posts more presentable that have only been figured out by Armalum and Rioters. When do you plan on opening the toolbox to all forum users in a transparent manner, instead of only those who have the time to source code Riot posts and figure out exactly how they got the formatting they did.\r\n-----\r\nRiot, it's nice that you're trying to reboot your community after the royal clusterfuck that was GD. However, you've taken absolutely none of the steps you need to to prevent this forum from becoming GD again. In fact, if the GD community was all forced to come over here at once, I guarantee it would be worse then even current GD, because the trolls could *literally prevent actual content from being visible* by upvoting each other and downvoting any legitimate posts that get made.\r\n\r\n**If you want Boards to not be GD 2.0: Electric Boogaloo, this is what you need to do:**\r\n\r\n* **Moderators must be REQUIRED to post in a thread when moving, deleting, or closing it, so that they can explain to the people actually using the thread for discussion why it had to be moved, deleted, or closed. **Additionally, the email addresses or some other means of contacting moderators MUST be made available, so that bans can be appealed and rules-related questions can be asked.\r\n* **Something has to be done about single downvotes killing posts.** We all agree that the community should be involved in getting rid of bad content; however, right now, people are abusing the system to get rid of good content they don't agree with instead of its intended purpose. Either scrap the downvote entirely, or require at least 3-4 downvotes in order to reduce a thread's visibility.\r\n* **All of the formatting tools should be made available on the bottom bar, not just the simplistic ones you have currently.** I know there's many, many more tools that exist for these forums then are down there, and I don't want to have to be a coding expert to put a little banner in my thread. \r\n\r\nRiot, please.","replies":[{"poster":"Pendragon","date":"2014-08-28T18:36:35.917+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"One fundamental issue to think about when it comes to us responding to players is that there's a difference between doing what you ask - and addressing your concerns (where appropriate).

We have a limited number of people on the team who can only do so many things at once. Sometimes it's really important that we get ahead of a problem because of the potential risk for it to become widespread and allow for exploitation. Sometimes though we have to acknowledge that something could be a problem in the future - and keep an eye on it. I think this could become a problem in the future, but is not a large enough problem now that it warrants a shift in development priority. The earliest potential abuse cases (downvote army, trolls, etc) can be handled through manual intervention, and generally right now I see the community self-correcting for this issue. I want to encourage people to vote more - the more players vote - and vote how they feel, the less potential for abuse there is. You have to remember that a single downvote is easily countered by a single upvote.

Not a single GD resident has even a milligram of trust for even a single moderator in your team. And that is a problem. You have a serious PR problem here, as no one trusts or respects your policemen to do their jobs, and as a result see any rules as more of a suggestion, and any action as tyranny. *If you want to fix this, you are going to need to earn that trust back.* Giving a face to these people can begin that process and, if they do more than just be moderation bots by sitting and chatting with us every once in a while, can easily solve this issue altogether.\n\n3. **Symbolism** - Having the moderation team step out of the shadows means that the good side of the community has someone to rally around. Tamat has proven not to listen, and you aren't even a part of that team, by your own admission. *If that has changed, feel free to let me know.* As a result, the better parts of this community can only huddle together and attempt to persevere alone. This has proven ineffective time and time again, and each and every time your moderators have been invited to join with them at the table to discuss how to make this better. Doing just that can help you utilize the community to help save it.\n\n4. **A Name to Call.** - In the early days of the tribunal, when someone claimed innocence, we called your name to smite them. When a person gets down to 0 RP, we call for RiotAmes. Even now, we call for Lyte when someone demands chat logs. This community wants someone to step forth when a thread need baleting. Any of your mods could be this person, with a digital \"Bat-signal\" in the form of private messaging when either further explanation is asked for or if there is pr0n on the loose. If the community is doing all the heavy lifting in finding these out of line threads, why wouldn't you give us a way to ensure that we can get this information to them ASAP? I know you said you wanted to have a way for this, but if they had names then that way *could be the game client itself*.

Only reason I get right now is for explanation, and as I said, the game client could very well be used as a private messager for these sort of things.

We called you as you smited the Trash that the tribunal kicked from our games, not because we wanted you gone, but because we applauded your actions. Similarly we do this with Lyte and Ames, and Ames has his fanbase simply for creating a culture all on his own. We want to cheer them on for doing good, but we can't cheer for a faceless machine.\n\nAs far as trust is concerned, the mods will not get it without a face. It really is that simple. They have abused and lost all trust that they once held, and they now need to work to earn it back. They won't be able to do that unless we see them and the actions.

Bad threads and abusive comments should mostly magically disappear. The vast majority of moderator actions are not closing a discussion that got derailed or turned toxic - it's deleting spam and banning abusing posters. The moderation team is not one or two people who are largely taking most of the actions. The hundreds of daily moderation actions are taken by a bunch of folks. It's a completely different team dynamic than your example.\n\n> As far as trust is concerned, the mods will not get it without a face. \n\nModeration should be judged by the net result - not indivudal actions.

You invidually continue to just be adamant that unless we bow to every request that you have we're failing the community and we don't care. You're abusing the relationship here. I've made a dozen posts in the last 48 hours about moderation yet you say there's no response.

I think the tactic you recommend is an ineffective way to create your desired outcome and would result in a substantially less efficient and effective moderation team. You should hold Tamat and I accountable for the actions of the moderation team in its entirety, be it praise or otherwise. I've said it a bunch of times and you continue to ignore the point that every single moderation action taken on these boards results in a notification being sent to the player with the rationale. I've said that as we add more types of moderation actions we'll add more types of communication mechanisms. It's not enough for you. It's not enough if the moderation is reliable and effective, if there there is no spam and bad posts. It's not enough for you if you have people to hold accountable who represent the moderation team and effort - the same way Lyte represents the dozens of people who work on Player Behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-08-29T18:08:39.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The best case scenario is that you don't feel moderation as an average boards poster or visitor.\n\nHere lies the crux of the issue.

This is something of a request that seems Pendragon automatically will fight tooth and nail, and the reason that GD is the way it is today.\n\n>#BACKSTORY TIME\n\nSo, back in S1, things were good. Yes, GD was where everything happened, and yes, Rioters obviously moderated in their spare time, but at the end of the day, there were a set of stickied rules, and because the rioters were there quite a bit, people followed and respected them.\n\nThen that fateful project, the one that has made Riot afraid to talk to us, happened. The Rioters began to leave the forums, and as a result GD began it's decent. There were many threads that called out, trying to get some help from the reds, even a sign that they were there. The Response? GD's rules were removed.\n\nThe change happened pretty fast after that, and people openly mocked Riot for doing the exact opposite of what the community asked for. I mean, the request was that the rules had someone to visibly back them up, and they decided to remove them instead. The only response as to *why* they were removed was from Penny himself, iirc, stating that we didn't need the rules to know how to act. *couldn't find this, I'll keep looking* I later found out it was due to them fearing Rule Lawyering, or people intentionally misinterpreting the rules to abuse them. Apparantly, Anarchy is better than rules that are misinterpreted, and thus GD's fate was sealed.\n\nWell, you can imagine how fast GD was falling at this point, but we still haven't gotten to the porn era yet. [Riot Ambassadors happened.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1461949) If you don't know what that was, Basically it was a failed attempt from Riot to use them as both a moderation team and a way to never talk to us directly again. This Ultimately Flopped when TheBeard closed a thread trying to get news on a certain rework, saying that there were other threads like it. *Not actually the case. He got sacked.*\n\nHowever, This was not the bottom, not even close. It kept getting worse. [Then the banning of Iaw happened.](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=30269057) This was the beginning of the end. While they claim he broke forum rules, *remember those things that they removed, lol*, no evidence was given. He simply was popular, and frankly I don't know if he did or not, but with how the mods acted afterwords, I'm inclined to believe innocence. \n\nThis is where the gauntlet was thrown down, where GD felt challenged. It started as a game, try and sneak the porn by, but eventually grew to just posting it whenever and *still* getting 60+ pages before a close *during day hours*. This, for some, feels like the depth, but it is not. Yes, it got worse. What follows porn? Gore, and while it was never as popular, it still happened. This sort of thing continued till Frosthaven stepped in.\n\nFrosthaven was the hero we needed, not the hero we deserved. Frankly, he kept his head above the garbage, and called to others for help. He picked up the FEK project, and got his moderators to help lead the charge for a better forum. While this is wasn't with any real power, it was working. Vamp used his smurf army to help close garbage threads, and things started to pick up. There was no hiding, and the whole team was very visible. The worst part was, it was working.\n\nThis lead to action. Vamps smurf army got forum banned, and Frost had been asked to keep FEK in OT by un-named Rioters. CB was announced, and flopped without moderators, as it was essentially a worse version of GD, especially when you factor in FEK. They got Frost to help them out, which he did, and the Boards are birthed. However, with \"ghost mods\" which apparently are as effective as the Riot Ambassadors, just more hidden.\n\n---\n\nThere is no tl;dr for all that, but the point is that this is redundant. We have seen visibility work better than anything Riot has tried, and they flat out refuse. Every other functioning forum has this, yet Riot refuses.

It is critical that we have a form of open dialogue as well as closed, and if there was an active Community Management presence, then the mods could theoretically not have to have that as an integral part of their job. Thing is, and this is the funniest part, Community Management used to be *Pendragon's* title. I no longer know who, if anyone, holds it.

We need more posters like you.\n\nAs for the attempt at rectification, I believe that I have opened many different avenues, but none have been listened to.

With the current level of moderation, I feel that GD could actually be better for discussions. It is logical, easy to follow, and I don't need to minimize things to figure out who is talking to who.\n\nThat said, I do think that the Boards have the *potential* to be better.

It's a cop-out for people who can't craft an argument and rely on the same poor articulation to get people who stop thinking at the last word of a post to agree with whatever's been said. Giving merit to the meritless should never be the default. But that could just be me.\n\nStrawman-nobody is saying that you should upvote everything except troll posts. We're saying that you shouldn't DOWNVOTE anything except troll votes. If you don't like a post, but it's not trolling, then not voting is always an option. \n\nIf the community is not mature enough to handle the upvote/downvote the way it was always meant to be used, it should go away.","replies":[{"poster":"GranspearZX","date":"2014-08-28T16:57:02.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Since you seemed to focus on the idea of posts and not threads, let me ask you this: how unhappy would you be if I downvoted your well written post, burying it near the bottom of this thread?\n\n>(I won't, by the way)\n\n>You'd be unhappy. You'd want to know what about your post merited a downvote. I, the downvoter, could just walk away from the comment, having safely buried a contradictory opinion so I don't have to see it again. \n\nSee, I'm going to have to push back on this one... because it's predicated on the notion that I'd be hung up on, for whatever reason, the idea that the worth of my opinion is measured in upvotes and downvotes. I'm not sure if that's a healthy position for anyone to take, let alone Riot. It doesn't help to dispel the illusion that pandering for upvotes is the only way to get an opinion heard.\n\nAs far as moderator accountability goes, I feel like the \"faceless cabal\" that was and still is GD moderation colors a lot of this particular discussion. There's been years of incidents that back users who feel a need for greater transparency. A better solution might be to put a PM system in place on the boards--for everyone, not necessarily just moderators--but that might be a little bit too much given the number of users that actually do and will use the boards... something to think about, I suppose.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-08-28T13:28:16.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People will just circle jerk for the necessary 3-4 down votes, it happened both ways with the two threads you mentioned; they spiked to like 20 up votes a piece then down to single digits again within an hour or so.","replies":[{"poster":"mi ramfan","date":"2014-08-28T13:46:27.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If 3-4 downvotes are required in order to reduce the visibility of a thread, then that means three or four people have to ALL read it and agree that it's low quality/trolling/pr0n in order to make it disappear. \n\nI would always prefer to err on the side of \"more difficult to make legitimate posts go away\", even if it also makes it harder to make pr0n go away as well.
