His designs are known for pushing the envelope and redefining just how much stuff can be packed into a champion's kit. \r\n\r\nFor the same reason, CertainlyT's designs have been highly controversial on the forums. Many of them are viewed as \"overloaded\" or \"toxic\" by players, and Yasuo, Thresh, and Darius have all been the victim of long series of nerfs at some point in their lifetimes. With all that said, however, CertainlyT's champions always have a completely different feel compared to other champions released in the same era, and question our assumptions of \"what can possibly be balanced in League of Legends\". \r\n\r\nCan we get the man himself to talk about his design philosophy and discuss the future additions and reworks of League on Gameplay and Balance sometime?","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2014-11-21T16:53:28.685+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the real problem is that champions like Yasuo exist in the same game as champions like Olaf.\n\nThere is a VERY clear level of depth/thought/*tangible* differences and what have you between the two champs, and this will always be present as long as CertainlyT's champions exist in the same space as these...less up to date champions.\n\nI imagine one day in the very far future that champions at least on the level of Yasuo are par for the course for League of Legends, and champions like our current iteration of Olaf wouldn't even be imagined to be in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Pvt Yong Tai","date":"2014-11-21T19:54:00.702+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, right here.

If all new champs are made with a lot in their kits, then old champs whose kits are focused on being very strong in one or two aspects get overshadowed.

It is a fact that LoL has grown and changed since it was born. What is a suitable degree of mindfulness for older champions. It seems to be your opinion that they haven't been mindful enough. If older champs are less fun, though, then limiting themselves to the same design constraints that resulted in those champs could be shackling themselves to the mistakes of their own inexperience.\n\nConsider Magic: The Gathering as an example. It took many years for them to figure out how to design with a consistent power level. Nowadays, there are cards from days past that would be considered completely unplayable. The game is better for the designers having recognized those cards as mistakes and making better cards, though. Likewise, as the champion roster grows, I expect new designs to reflect greater knowledge and experience. It would be awfully nice if older champs eventually get updates to benefit from that experience as well. Even if they don't, however, I'm happier to see the game grow and evolve rather than remain chained to its past.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2014-11-21T16:54:33.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly my thought xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-11-21T17:05:05.904+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's mainly he brings in the most noticeable new mechanics to the game.

However, I feel he makes two huge mistakes in his champ design (either that or the people who balance his champs make the mistakes): He undervalues mobility and seems to add random stats to his champs to make them 'good'\n\nSo mobility should be obvious. Kalista gets a dash after every auto, Yasuo is can have up to 7 dashes in a laning environment, Zed gets two gapclosers and can jump back to each one. However, I don't feel they particularly pay for this mobility in most ways. Kalista's relatively weak early game, when her auto is incredibly long, but as she gets attack speed that stops becoming an issue. Yasuo's squishy as hell nowadays, but that's because he has a personal shield that he doesn't have to do anything for besides 'move' and his windwall, which can completely shut down some champs. Zed can put down a load of damage on you and be out before you can kill him. (Though I feel Zed's a special case, in that he's even more binary than most assassins. Laning against Zed is incredibly painful after six if you can't counter-burst or escape from him, but when you buy a Zhonya's, you can completely shut him down.) That's not new for Riot, though, so I am loathe to apply that specifically to CertainlyT.\n\nMy major problem with CertainlyT's champs is that they get a lot of things in a single kit. In addition to a vision spell that's about equal to Ashe and Quinn, Kalista gets % max hp magic damage. Zed gets free AD, and runs off of energy. Thresh has one of the only ally reposition spells in the game, plus a stun, plus a minor knockback, plus a giant slow, and can get to much higher levels of armor than a normal tank support can. Darius gets all three damage types and armor pen, for some reason. Yasuo gets two passives, one of which is the stupidest in the game, plus free bonus armor penetration on his ult (which isn't that hard to activate, in a game with as many displacements as League.)\n\nBy themselves, either of those things is annoying, but manageable.
