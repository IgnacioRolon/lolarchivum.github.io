I sit there dazed for a minute as I thought to myself \"Wha... I forgot I even had that opened.\" Then another popped up... and another... Then I realized the client kept relaunching itself and kept constantly crashing. I wasn't even able to log in or do anything...\r\n\r\nI would do the in-client repair service but I can't even get past the client loading without it crashing. I've tried Uninstalling and Reinstalling but that didn't help either. I used the Hextech Repair Service and it's basically the same thing. The only thing that It really did for me was give me a folder of logs... What am I suppose to do? I need my fix of League man... {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDJBooty","date":"2017-09-23T00:51:35.603+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is bug with Discord causing clients to bugsplat. I can't confirm the real cause of this.
