I queued with two friends I always play with. Bard and poke ADC Varus went mid for a quick tower takedown, while I went lux bot lane. Any seige mage would do, like Ziggs comes to mind, with poke and wave clear. With friends, this worked well because in between jungle ganks, I would get Bard ganks. So I wasn't alone that much. With Lux, I could poke Caitlyn safely under my turret, kill minions, and got 3/0 in laning phase before taking their turret. Mid went down fast due to the almost constant 2 v 1, with 3 v 1 ganks, and Bard wandered bot and top, giving lanes twice the ganks. \n\nWent well one game, needs replication to see what comps are it's strengths and weaknesses. It will, of course, go badly some games but you have to repeat it to find out what it works against, and use it on those comps.

Ability to invade/counterjungle.\n\nIf you don't have number 1, then you cannot have number 4 or 5 at all, and number 3 becomes near impossible because you fall so far behind from not clearing fast. Number 2 (which is all Bard has reliably as a full jungler) is just not enough to qualify him as any reasonable choice. As a roaming support, however, which is his intended role, he can coordinate ganks with the *actual* jungler and pull off some really cool stuff, and doesn't need to worry about being able to clear buffs at all, just getting vision down and looking for opportunities to set up fights or save allies.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-03-17T01:51:15.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes i know his damage is pitiful, but he has mobililty that allows him to get to places fast, he can put down health packs before starting a camp for sustain, and his E and R allow him to set up ganks really well.

Bard has one bit of damage and a little bit of short range, hard to hit CC, not solo gank material. He is better suited to being the jungler's support than the ADC's support, so maybe pulling off a hard core carry duo jungle with Bard could become a thing (like take a hyper scaling/snowballing assassin with pitiful early game survivabilty) because Bard loves to roam and he could just tag along through their clear giving a little extra damage and supplying for their lack of sustain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-03-17T18:43:52.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the time he gets through his first clear, the laning phase has already finished.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lozier","date":"2015-03-16T20:59:47.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DON'T DO IT, DON'T GO JUNG AS BARD OR RIOT WILL NERF THE JUNGLE..
