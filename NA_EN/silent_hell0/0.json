Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the reinstall option checked to make sure you have a fresh install of the game. \n\nIf your settings aren't saving, it might be that your config settings have gone a little wonky. We can try manually resetting that as well to force it to save again.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\nLet me know if those steps weren't able to help and we can take a closer look for you!","replies":[]}]}
