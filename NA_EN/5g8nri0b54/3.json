Or to put it another way, she is spending more time STRENGTHENING HERSELF rather than WEAKENING HER OPPONENT--- **\r\n\r\nCassiopeia is not {{champion:134}}. She is not {{champion:101}} or even {{champion:121}}. She is not an upgrading cyborg like {{champion:112}}. So with ALL those champions you decided to give this evolving Passive to, why do you give it to the **SOLE champion in the game where such a power literally works against the champion's theme?**\r\n\r\n**There is an inherent disconnect when you have a POISON MAGE channel poison onto her opponent...so that she can make her biceps grow bigger. **Common sense itself should have told you that the act of introducing a harmful agent into your opponent should work to **weaken** them over a period of time. Instead of permanently granting her strength, her poison should do the opposite of that, but to her opponents instead. THAT is the poison fantasy you claim to understand.\r\n\r\nFor reference, go watch the final episode of Season 3 of Legend of Korra. Look at how that mercury poisoning ****ed her up real good. Zaheer didn't grow a bulge just because he watched Korra get injected by poison. Korra herself got visibly weakened and ****ed up even after the fight is over. THAT is POISON.\r\n\r\n** --- 2) It supports your plan to make her into a Hyper-Carry, which is NOT the direction she should be going in the first place! ---**\r\n This is just logic. When you have something that is bad...the last thing you need to do is to make something else that supports that which is bad. \r\n\r\nYour problem is that you made her a hyper-carry --> making her Passive support such a direction makes your problem worse.\r\n\r\n** ---3) Your claim that her Passive is supposed to reflect her CURSE comes off as flimsy after you look at her as a champion.--- **\r\n\r\nFirst, you only gave this explanation out several weeks after the rework came out and you received more and more criticisms over the rework. Secondly, you keep calling it \"Cassiopeia embracing the curse\". So...*what is there to embrace*? Cassiopeia isn't a champion slowly being cursed into what she is, she IS the cursed being already. Your argument that she is letting the curse slowly consume her, yet in return she grows stronger doesn't hold any grounds at all because she already let it happen.\r\n\r\nIf this is a curse, WHAT is the harm in the curse that makes embracing it so difficult? All I can see is that she gets her badass snake-tail, and if that really was the punishment of the curse, guess what, that speaks against your idea to make her Passive a \"embracing the curse\" because **she begins the game as she is.** She doesn't start off as a human with human abilities, she starts off as a lamia with all her poison-y torso-sized fang-throw-y powers.\r\n\r\n**4) The very fact that it's based off milestones is painfully unsatisfying, period.**\r\n\r\nShe has 500 stacks, and among those 500 stacks,** 497 of those stacks do not do jack!** Unlike Thresh, Sion, etc. where each stack brings something to the table, it is VERY unsatisfying to build those stacks when they don't do a thing for her. When confronted with the possibility of making each stack give her something, \r\n\r\nyou said this:\r\n\r\n> When the rewards are unnoticeably small, do they still feel rewarding?\r\n\r\nand I said this:\r\n\r\n> You bring the point where if unnoticeably small rewards will do anything for her at all, but let me counter with this.\r\n> \r\n> What is more unnoticeably small? A very miniscule bonus...or no bonus at all?\r\n> \r\n> Because this is what really stinks about stacking her Passive. She has 500 stacks. 497 of those stacks are unrewarding and disappointing. \r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n> But if you're still so crazy about making her an unfun hyper-carry, atleast make her Passive less unsatisfying by giving it TWO separate aspects.\r\n> \r\n>         **The first aspect are your milestone rewards that comes far and few inbetween.**\r\n> \r\n>         **The second aspect is a per-stack aspect where each and every single one of her stack will do something like make her poisons stronger or something.**\r\n> \r\n> I should add that I am against the idea of her having a stacking Passive because it enforces her hyper-carry identity that you are forcing onto her. No matter how you look at it, items aside, a full stack Cassiopeia will always be stronger than a no-stack Cassiopeia. But this is one direction you could have brought to make a poor direction less rocky at the very least.\r\n\r\n** ---5) This Final point is something you actually acknowledged. It feels like a shackle while other champions with stacking or evolving Passives do not feel shackled.--- **\r\n\r\nThere is two aspects to this point here.\r\n\r\ni) NOTICE, how many of those stacking Passives HAVE NO LIMIT to their growing power! Sion, Thresh, Veigar, Nasus. Their power is limitless! When you cap a champion's stack at a fixed amount, that makes it feel like a shackle! It makes it feel like their ceiling is what they SHOULD have been from the start and any point below their max stacks is just you artificially gating their laning phase (refer to: -[the inherent fallacy in reworking her for being an \"oppressive lane-bully\"](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Xciv57U8-we-reworked-cassiopeia-for-being-an-oppressive-lane-bully)...)\r\n\r\nii) Kha'zix, Syndra, and Viktor have a feeling of being shackled too, trust me, I play those champions, I know them, I MAINED pre-rework Viktor. Shackling is ESPECIALLY relevant to Kha'zix whose abilities are genuinely crap without their evolutions. But do you know why those Passives work for those champions and not for Cassiopeia?\r\n\r\n**!!! Because unlike Cassiopeia, shackling powers make perfect sense for those champions !!!**\r\n\r\n{{champion:112}}  and {{champion:121}}  are starting off \"infantile\" and weak, they are growing in power through their own unique means. {{champion:134}} is **literally** shackled by her douche of a master. And guess what? Even WHEN such a Passive fits them, they can still fail in gameplay. Look at Syndra's Passive, it's boring, not a lot of people like them, there is little in terms of decision making. It FITS her perfectly unlike Cassiopeia, but it's not a FUN Passive that really adds anything substantial to her kit at all. I'd argue Viktor is edging towards that too because all Viktor's are the same in the end just like how all Syndra's are the same. The ONLY successful case imo is Kha'zix.......................on a theoretical basis. Kha'zix can be quite different based on what he evolves as he has limited evolution points. I say theoretical, because who are we kidding here? Who's not going to evolve his wings?\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain just like in my previous threads. 1) is my core and more pressing issue that you seem to be ignoring. The others are certainly problems, but solve #1, and all the other issues would not be nearly as bad.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI want to add that NOBODY HATES YOU. Nobody wants you to resign or all that bs. Nobody denies that her old kit had it's problems that needed fixing. It was your job to fix those issues. **What we DO hate however...is the rework.**. Are we passionate? Yeah of course, just LOOK at what the rework did to her. Is still doing to her! Your rework is the One Ring. Cassiopeia is Smeagol. Except we don't have any Fellowship of the Ring.\r\n\r\n (the fact that you never asked Cass fans what they think she was or SHOULD be prior to starting on making her rework, however, certainly didn't help)","replies":[{"poster":"Sweetie Brella","date":"2014-12-02T13:42:47.472+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"How many Stashus does it take to change a lightbulb?\n\nNone, he just refuses to admit that it's broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-12-03T17:47:47.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's pretty low man.\n\nAlso, personal blows like that just makes riot even less inclined to take our complaints seriously.

But speaking in terms of League, he's utterly destroyed a champion, literally made up reasons for doing it (the \"oppressive lane bully\" argument is so bad it's downright baffling) and has yet to interact with us in a meaningful way.

(seriously, a 20% slow is nothing. grabbing an early rylais gives her a stronger slow on her E than her W provides at rank 1)\n\n* she still lacks a solid method of power farming like most of her competition in the mid lane\n\n* and finally: she has a kit that screams \"I'm a lane bully\" but is nerfed so that she can't be a lane bully.\n\nI think that final point is probably one of the worst. Riot wanted to prevent her from being a lane bully, but gives her -all- the tools and the *incentive* to be a lane bully, but slap her on the hand with dmg penalties when she tries to do that with the excuse that she is supposed to be a hyper carry late game.\n\n\nI think the main issue here is that with riot's mantra about counterplay they are overlooking some fundementals about how the game operates.\n\nHyper carries -don't- want to interact with their lane opponent. They are too weak to trade early game, so they just want to farm farm farm.\n\nLane bullies tend to fall off late game, or (at best) are just run-of-the-mill in power with better alternatives. But the main reason to pick a lane bully is because they have an extremely strong early/mid game where they attempt to shut down their lane opponent to allow their team to snowball an advantage.\n\nBut with the current cass, she scales like a hyper carry (both early game lack of dmg and late game power spike) but is compelled to play like a lane bully because she can't scale without doing so.\n\nIt's this comflicted nature that is truly hurting cass atm.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-03T18:16:43.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hyper carries -don't- want to interact with their lane opponent.

Instead of permanently granting her strength, her poison should do the opposite of that, but to her opponents instead. THAT is the poison fantasy you claim to understand.\n\nI like the vision and the feel.  Very fluffy.  I don't understand how to translate that into gameplay.\n\nMechanically, this feels quite likely to be a thing nobody notices, because minor debuffs aren't readable and major debuffs can't really come from a passive.\n\n> ** --- 2) It supports your plan to make her into a Hyper-Carry, which is NOT the direction she should be going in the first place! ---**\n>  This is just logic.

When confronted with the possibility of making each stack give her something, \n\nI feel considerably better about Cass stacks than Thresh's +0.75 armor mechanic.  I feel like pushing to get to the next breakpoint and then forcing a fight is really natural gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2014-12-02T21:28:21.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they just wanted to make a steroid mage.
