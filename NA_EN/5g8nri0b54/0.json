So quick reactions can get somebody away from the pool you set, like you've noticed. To get around that, I generally try to \"fish\" with my silence, and either bait their mobility to dodge it, or just get them while they're silenced and can't dodge.\n\nThe harder thing is when they have delayed CC, and get it off during the cast (which then interrupts the channel). I always hate laning against Annie because of that - if we both try to go in on each other at the same time, it's likely her stun will connect after I've started my ult.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-02-23T04:46:52.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Would some sort of super-quick missile animation showing his eye beams shooting from his eyes towards his enemies make the cast-time a little more clearer?
