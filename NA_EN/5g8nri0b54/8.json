Everything about him encourages him to dive in, kick his target's butt (sometimes literally) and make a clean exit. He also has several tools to avoid or mitigate damage (his shield, his dashes and his get-away-from-me kick), which he should be putting to full use. If he messes up and takes too much damage, that damage should stick. His current lifesteal/spellvamp steroid messes that up by allowing him to heal back up extremely quickly no matter how much pain his opponents inflict on him, and I think his sustain should be slashed in favor of, say, a better shield (which would allow him to block more damage and stay healthier when he uses it right).\n* **Recovery after burst.** Lee starts out with twice as many abilities as anyone else, and can use them all in pretty much one go. Ideally, he should have to choose between spacing out his abilities in order to make the most of his energy restoration, or blowing everything at once and having few options afterwards, but currently the difference is not as pronounced as it should be. Lee can currently dive his opponent, blow all of his abilities, and still always have enough energy to dash out of a fight whenever he wants (one of the biggest reasons why people dislike him). Escaping a fight should be a larger investment, and one Lee can't just make regardless of how many abilities he's used already.\n* **Combat outside of using spells.** Lee's abilities are massively powerful, and are the best and most interesting part of him. When Lee's abilities are up, you should be scared because he could make massive plays at any moment, but conversely when his spells are on cooldown, that should be your window of opportunity to make him pay. As an AD champion, Lee needs to blend autoattacks in between spellcasts, but he should only be doing so to further enable future use of his abilities, and not to deal any major part of his damage. Effectively, he should be the weakest AD champion around when just autoattacking. His AS steroid, however, goes against this, and makes him a threat in the early game even when his abilities are on cooldown. I think Lee could afford to have even stronger or more frequent spellcasts if he lost his AS steroid and became a truly weak autoattacker.","replies":[{"poster":"Lavantant","date":"2014-12-14T01:25:19.839+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2014-12-14T04:34:36.112+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with this.

A tank should not deal 340 damage with a single spell.

His kit even reflects this all in his passive. After every ability, you gain 15 energy off your next two attacks (30 total). His passive is supposed to tie into a mentality of either trading blows and spacing your abilities out so you can regain energy to keep up a steady pace, or going all-in but blowing your entire kit with no safe way out. In turn, this should lead to having poor auto-attack capability and needing to weave the two together for the most damage output in a fight. I see Lee as a champion that should theoretically be very weak to burst champions that can punish his all-ins or force him back in a quick exchange, but be very strong against sustained damage and be able to slowly keep a drawn out fight in his advantage before going all-in and blowing his load.\n\nThe problem stems from a multitude of issues. For one, Safeguard's cost is too low. Lee Sin's entire rotation costs him 160 energy total (Q costs 50 then 30, E costs 50 then 30 and R costs nothing) so one auto-attack between three abilities will get you past the threshold of 50 energy to cast W and get out of the fight. On top of this, having an attack speed steroid on the passive doesn't help matters. Being able to get that energy back faster once you've gone all in certainly helps keep Lee's costs negligible at best.\n\nPossible solutions? Maybe reserving the order of Safeguard and Iron Will. If Lee's dash was on the second cast it would bump his safety up to a total cost of 80 energy. I'm not sure how much it would effect his rotation to have his lifesteal/spellvamp on the first 50 energy, though, so numbers might need to be messed with a bit. You could also just increase the total cost of having to cast Safeguard. Another solutions would be to remove the 40% attack speed buff from his passive so that you need to invest in the energy sustain by getting an item that would weaken other aspects you would focus on when building items.\n\nOverall, I think Riot just has other fires they want to put out before tackling Lee Sin. He's a very sensitive topic, being the culmination of many years of development as well as having an entire story line and in-game event revolving around him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2014-12-13T21:03:44.095+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blindness.

Lee Sin players can still see anywhere the team has vision. They don't generate champion vision, so they can't necesarily see around them. In order to start camps, they have to use vision granting abilities. Taking damage reveals the source of the damage for 5 seconds, so enemies can't just kill him while he can't see. \n\n\n\nIn light of Rek'Sai, I would now add that he see's enemies close to him they same/similar to Rek'Sai.

Usually Lee gets his jungle item, sightstone, and maybe one intermediate attack item (ie. Hexdrinker, which is also sort of a tank item) before going full tank (this is professional play, people do all kinds of stupid stuff in yoloqueue). When people say Lee Sin falls off late game, it's more to do with the fact that his build doesn't allow him to deal as much damage as a carry, while also not being a true tank. Lee Sin derives most of his utility from his kit, and less from his items, and in that sense he's not a late game champion since he isn't as reliant on items as say, and ADC. Compare him to a more tank/utility-focused jungler like J4, or a more damage focused jungler like Kha'Zix; half of Lee Sin's utility comes from his damage, since he doesn't have low cooldown AoE hard CC like J4, at the same time, Lee Sin doesn't have the damage potential of Kha'Zix, who is more of a late game champion and benefits a lot more from items and levels than Lee Sin does. Lee Sin is sort of a hybrid where he's able to provide some damage like Kha, and some utility like J4, while not being as good at either. At least in theory.\n\nEDIT: imo this is actually why Lee Sin, Orianna, Thresh, arguably Lucian, have been such consistent picks in professional play; it's because they are incredibly flexible and offer a ton of utility and therefore can fit with a lot of different team compositions. In some cases, though, they aren't as stand-out as other champions; for example, Orianna does a ton of damage, yes, but she doesn't exactly one-shot someone as quickly as say, Veigar or Brand. The reason she often gets picked over these two is because she isn't as vulnerable due to her CC and shield; professional players are perfectly capable of playing around her comparatively less damage. These champions are less prone to rising and falling with the meta because if one aspect of their kit is less emphasized, they still have other areas where they can contribute to their team. If tanky, utility junglers become the meta, well, Lee Sin can still be decently tanky, but he's not J4. If damage junglers become the meta, Lee Sin can also deal decent damage, but he's not Kha. If you need vision control and counter jungling, Lee Sin can also do that pretty well, but he's not Nunu. At least in theory.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-12-13T21:28:32.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":21,"body":"Except that isn't what happens.

That's why his high AD scaling keeps him relevant in the early and mid game but seems to fall off in the late when other melees have built much more AD than he has.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-13T22:51:20.152+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"To put it another way, less is more on Lee Sin. If you put, say, a Shyvana and a Lee Sin both with a Hydra, Lee Sin is doing more damage from how much more he's getting out of that same 75 AD compared to the Shyvana. As a result while the Shyvana has to build another item, assume it's a BotRK, Lee Sin builds a Randhin's Omen. With a second damage item, Shyvana is now dealing comparable damage to the Lee Sin who has only one damage item, but she doesn't have as much defense built up so while they're on about even ground heading into the mid game in terms of damage, the Lee Sin has the upper hand as he's dealing similar damage but can continue doing so much longer due to the damage mitigation from the Randuin's Omen.\n\nFast forward to the late game, and Shyvana, after building her own Randuin's Omen, is now significantly more durable and has decided to build a Maw of Malmortius. Lee Sin meanwhile has built two more tank items to Shyvana's one tank and one MR/AD item with a Spirit Visage and a Banshee's Veil. The Shy Ana and the Lee Sin are almost evenly matched in terms of armor, with the slight edge to Shyvana, and Lee Sin has slightly more MR. However, with three damage items to Lee Sin's one Hydra, one of which gives her more AD depending on how low her life is dropping, Shyvana has the edge in damage as well as armor while Lee Sin has lost his lead in damage potential in favor of much more health from the additional two health items he has. \n\nAt the end of the match Lee Sin has built a Warmog's, trying to last longer in teamfights where he loses his ability to target single specific champions as easily, while Shyvana has also built a Warmog's so she can wade through teamfights in dragon form with relative impunity. At this stage of the game Shyvana is doing much more damage because she is on about equal footing with Lee Sin, minus about 600 health or so, in terms of durability due to the armor/MR she has above him in dragon form, but is dealing a considerable amount more damage while absorbing more than enough to survive.\n\nIn this manner it appears that Lee Sin has fallen off in terms of damage while Shyvana is lasting about as long in teamfights, and is also providing a much wider array of damage through AoE abilities, rapid Hydra procs, and bursts from her E marked targets.\n\nHowever, should Lee Sin and Shyvana both build nothing but damage items ending up at, just a random number, 300 AD at the end of the match, Lee Sin is hitting much harder. His ult is dealing 1200 damage alone, and his attack speed after using abilities is putting out several more hundred over the course of the next moment. Shyvana meanwhile lacks high damage single target abilities, and the best she has is her AA > Q which will apply about 1000 damage between her first auto attack and the Q hitting twice for bonus damage. This doesn't take into account Lee Sin's other high scaling abilities, and actives from the items each have built have no impact on their ability scalings. \n\nTo simplify the concept, a straight damage Lee Sin outscales the straight damage Shyvana. A Lee Sin who builds as a fighter will eventually lose his edge, and his function, during teamfights once other fighters catch up in terms of damage but can last about as long while dealing damage that isn't focused to single targets.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2014-12-13T21:24:39.810+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"His passive also gives him 40% bonus attack speed","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Topline","date":"2014-12-13T20:54:35.590+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't take my word on this because I don't play Lee Sin or the jungle in general, but from what I've heard, Lee Sin falls apart pretty hard late game.

The issue is that at every single point up until that point, he still deals absurd damage building tanky and he still never dies when building damage.

Armor Pen will only do so much (it's useful and Brutalizer is actually pretty cheap, but you're highly overpraising it), his damage falls off way more than you claim.\n\nEDIT: and who in heaven builds TF on Lee any ways??
