How is that deceptive?\n\nIt's deceptive because it wasn't a sudden barrage of high numbers. Instead, it was a trap. A few small ticks that built up over time; it **punished** people who underestimated the player or simply didn't pay attention to their health. That's what poison should be. Discreet, but there. Instead, we've been left with a costly skillshot that deals less damage than an auto attack.\n\nAs for Veigar, his infinite AP stacking is tied directly to his character. He has always been about stacking Q and building up his own power. Cassiopeia's by comparison, just came out of nowhere. She has never been a hypercarry and she never should have been made into one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-19T21:52:01.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"fyi, 3/4 of your abilities being useless shit only to spring out a single overloaded ability isn't being \"deceptive\", that's just bad champion design.\n\n\n\nIt'll be like creating a champion with a bunch of abilities that are intentionally undertuned and does jack all damage, but possess a single point and click ability that insta-kills the opponent.

That doesn't mean that the rework has to be trashed, if she can play perfectly fine afterwards then what is the point of changing her more?\n\nI like the deceptive nature of her play; you poison your enemies in lane and tick their health down, lulling them into a false sense of security as they see \"oh she can hardly hurt me\", before you rip them apart.\n\nPeople don't seem to understand that the passive is *not* a hindrance - her early game was nerfed but not to the point of uselessness. You're wrong that I would like her just as much without the rework, seeing as how I used to play her very infrequently and found many things that the passive offers to be a great boon.\n\nThe free spellvamp is great and I get it very early in the game, but the mother of all bonuses is really the 25% CDR IMO. With it, it means I do not have to build a single CDR item so long as I use the correct rune and mastery set-up, still having 40% CDR around 20 minutes in without spending *any gold* on it.\n\nI don't think hitting her in her mana costs is the right idea because that makes her much worse in her late-game fantasy, but she is undoubtedly strong and her passive is definitely a part of that. Could it be more interesting? Definitely, but that doesn't mean it has to be scrapped. \n\nI would be very angry if the rework was undone, honestly. I've spent a lot of time fine-tuning my Cassiopeia play and I'm beginning to get into the swing of things where only the dreaded Katarina can put me off my stride.\n\nThe real question is, why don't you like this Cassiopeia? If it is because you can no longer kill or push out of lane your opponent without committing at all, then I am glad to see it go.\n\nEdit: I would like to see her Twin Fangs restore more mana if she kills a champion, something like Kassadin's W, so that this mana nerf does not destroy her late game and so she can be a continued presence in team fights.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-17T22:36:34.451+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay, so basically you described all the things people dislike the rework (shitting on her with a passive), while describing a bunch of things that was present pre-rework.

She's a snake, I don't know if you're aware of what a Spitting Cobra is, but all the spit does is blind - doesn't actually kill. Thematically it works perfectly - I don't get why you would think otherwise. She also still poisons; late game a well-placed W in a teamfight will do over 1000 damage and provide free poison.\n\nI'm sorry to have to tell you this, but people who are enjoying themselves playing a champion who was reworked are not often the ones who come to the forums. Just because your echo chamber threads seem to come up with the same ideas repeatedly does not mean that these are the opinions held by most Cassiopeia players.\n\nYou think that the CDR restricts her build path? Valid complaint, but I am much happier that in a late-game scenario I don't have to stock myself up with CDR items which do subpar damage in order to keep important enemies poisoned. The real issue here is that there aren't enough AP items without CDR to pick from. Besides, depending on your rune page, the only items you are actually dissuaded from purchasing are Athene's and Morello's, which is much better than the likes of manaless APs who have to avoid a whole slew of items.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that Riot does not want the old Cassio - that is why she was reworked. In lane, her low Q CD was completely oppressive and with the CDR it becomes so again. Her old cadence was overbearing early game, there is a reason it was changed.\n\nHer AoE is not the best but it certainly isn't shit as you call it. Plus, have you stopped to think that the non-committal AoE with a slow and a speed boost was too much for somebody who could burst down just about anyone?\n\nWhy am I not allowed to like both Old and New Cass? Why do I have to choose? Oh, right, because you're on some crusade to see Stashu fired for his rework even though many people enjoy it.\n\nYou're vastly underestimating the value of the E heal, too. There is a reason sustain isn't added to a kit lightly. After scoring a kill in lane, farming up a minion wave will fill my mana to half and my health somewhere up there as well. Her lane damage has been nerfed but her lane presence is still there; I'm unsure why you seem incapable of accepting this new Cass.\n\nI think you are just mad, and having made so many threads about the topic you have now convinced yourself that nothing about this Cass can redeem the issues you see with her.\n\nWhy don't you just play the game - Cass is still the same champion, at least, unlike some others.\n\n(R.I.P. Karma)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
