Unique in that he does literally everything with his turrets. Should he level up his rockets first or should he level his signature turrets first?","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-13T02:36:22.428+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"assassin donger: missles\ntroll donger: turrets\njungler camp me pls donger: grenade","replies":[{"poster":"Nakawaka","date":"2015-01-13T21:02:06.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeagueSrsBsns,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=koGR9xh1,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-13T02:36:22.428+0000)\n>\n> assassin donger: missles\n> troll donger: turrets\n> jungler camp me pls donger: grenade\n\nI love the way you put it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-13T02:31:37.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All depends on you and what you're facing. \n\nIf you're vs someone who can easily take your turrets out, rockets may be better as first, or wave the two.
