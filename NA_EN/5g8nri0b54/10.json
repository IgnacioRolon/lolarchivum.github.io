Or have additional rules in place for premades.\n\nBut the SECOND scenario where strangers/premades gang up on a single person to leave...I find hard to swallow.\n\n**Where is the precedent?** Have there ever been any game 100% like League of Legends where you managed to get the data to find out that, indeed, in a 5v5 or 3v3 MOBA where there is such a harsh penalty for leaving, that if you implement such a function, people will immediately abuse the hell out of it?\n\nAs far as I can tell, League of Legends may not be the first MOBA, but it's among the first out there, and *I have a hard time believing you managed to gather enough data to actually be confident in your second scenario happening* considering you're not likely to find a game 100% like LoL with the perfect environment to test such a hypothesis.\n\n\nSECONDLY...you do know that forcing players to put up  with such an unfun lop-sided match, and completely taking all agency away from their decision to do something about their predicament...**also produces toxicity right?** Especially when the enemy team are the type prone to spam laugh and taunt animations near the fountain as they super minions slowly hack away at the nexus...\n\nAnd unlike your *\"people will abuse it\"*-scenario, I have multiple firsthand experience that this toxicity, the behaviour of both the winning and losing team, are something that is commonly replicated whenever a game becomes a 4v5. I'm not 100% discounting that you may have a point there that people can abuse it to cause even more toxicity, however.\n\n*  I don't know where you pulled that hypothesis from considering there hasn't been many games that are 100% like LoL\n\n*  Forcing players to trudge on is pretty damn toxic in a competitive game anyways. Even if you agree to Surrender, it takes a ludicrous amount of time for the right to call for a Surrender is enabled. *And you can get a person ragequit from as early as getting executed by the first jungle camp.* Therefore even if it turns out you are correct that such a function does cause some abuse cases, are you sure it will cause more harm than good when the current \"screw those following the rules\"-model is already producing ample toxicity?","replies":[{"poster":"Aurelius Maximus","date":"2015-01-01T01:59:18.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Learn to play to improve as a player and not care about winning or losing and you will end up winning mroe with a better attitude and you will see less of this stuff you hate","replies":[{"poster":"The Annie Christ","date":"2015-01-01T11:11:11.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"But winning is fun in all games.

Extend the duration and it would be strictly superior to the League way.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-01T02:11:36.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually I explicitly remember asking the question and Lyte responding with this \"people will abuse it\" a little before DotA2 was even a thing.

Solo que is  random ... and as such will always give a random result .
