Giving him some more utility, and in a team focused way, allows us to give him power without him being as effective in a straight head to head fight.\n* A group teleport is an ability we've wanted to do for quite a while. First time we tried it, at least while I've been at Riot, was on Lulu. It showed promise, but we concluded it would work better on someone who could do well even if no allies went with them (we were still assuming Lulu would just get support play and not outduel a huge number of champs if solo, whoops).\n\n\nThematic rationale:\n\n* Ryze is a ancient archmage who roams Runeterra searching for World Runes. He's been doing so for an extremely long time (centuries?). Some form of transportation magic seemed like a really strong fit for an eternal traveler as a result.  \n* Unlike many of the other mages in LoL Ryze has time to master his craft. Annie or Syndra for example have a lot of innate power and raw talent. They're not yet very refined about it though, so tend to do one or two things really hard (burn stuff and smash things into other things respectively). Ryze however's got enough practice to have a broader mastery over his magical talent, so he's adept at doing a range of different things with the power he's got.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2016-07-24T03:16:41.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey, the last Red post I had before going on a year hiatus was you.

Is this something you guys are ok with, or is it something you want to look at at some point? \n\nI know design suggestions usually aren't super helpful, but personally I think it could be cool if Essence Reaver built out of a sheen, maybe even scaled Sheen proc damage with crit instead of scaling CDR up?

I honestly think the issue is, like many other people here have said, Youmu + Duskblade. Back when I built IE + RFC first, I probably have to crit 2 of the 3 non guaranteed shots to 100 to 0 someone even if I landed all my spells barring my ultimate. With the new build, I don't have to crit and I prob 100 to 0 someone with two autos and a w with the ghost blade active and duskblade's delayed damage.\n\nNot to mention the fact that ghost blade gives an immediate and huge power spike compared to IE. Even if Jhin scales better with IE, it makes 0 sense to build because ghost blade just offers so much more. I hope you guys take into consideration of the itemization when balancing. With that said, if you guys do plan to nerf ghost blade, I'm curious how you guys will do it since it will affect a huge amount of other ad casters that are balanced with the current state of ghost blade","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-07-25T02:47:25.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you considered that adding armor to turrets increased the value of armor pen, hence incentivizing the yommus on adcs trend?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkiece","date":"2016-07-25T01:10:13.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that I'm a little late and the chances of me getting a reply are probably slim, but I've loved Jhin ever since I picked him up, he just feels really good. My problem with him right now is that the armor pen build is even viable, let alone optimal on him. \n\nI say this because saying you are going to nerf him makes me think it will be outright numbers reductions, and I don't think that's the way Jhin should be handled in his current state. His current problem is his armor pen build. Personally I think an itemization balance for marksmen in general is not a poor idea, as so many champions who in theory shouldn't be building youmuus are, simply because it is a strong item and IE/ER are, early on, weak. On someone like Lucian, the theoretical build for him should be Essence Reaver; but for Lucian its not too bad that the armor pen build is viable, it still makes sense with his kit, as he applies black cleaver fast and is an early game based champion so the cheaper/earlier impactful build makes sense.\n\nBut for Jhin it shouldn't be the optimal build. He's a champion DESIGNED around building crit and attack speed items to augment  his AD. Ignoring those stats should not be the best way to build him. It shows how IE/ER itemization spikes too late. Regardless, I've said that already, so if re balancing the power curve of crit builds vs flat ad/armor pen ones is not the route you choose to balance Jhin, at least consider making it more optimal for him to build crit and attack speed. I think that reducing the bonus ad he gets per level, but buffing the bonus ad he gets from crit and attack speed, and maybe reducing his base MS back to 525 but buffing the MS he gets from attack speed is an obvious change, that would shift his spike from an early game oriented armor pen build, to one that is less impactful and more vulnerable early game, but deals similar damage, just later in the game, with more potential mobility from more crits per auto and more MS per crit. This would make it feel better to build the more expensive, late game oriented items I BELIEVE he was designed around (maybe I'm wrong). I feel like this change was really obvious, to the point that maybe there was a reason it hasn't been publicly considered or put on pbe yet? If this was thought of and rejected for some reason, or if there is some flaw in my reasoning presented in this comment, please tell me. I just had to present my thoughts because Jhin is arguably my favorite champion, and I don't like the state he's in just as much as anyone else, but I don't want to see him become yet another armor pen cheeser that so many ADCs are becoming, nor do I want to see his original build nerfed indirectly as you guys at Riot try to tackle a problem caused by a separate build and playstyle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaloDragonX","date":"2016-07-24T15:13:10.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Classic Buff Corki before worlds\n\nMAKE TRISTANA GREAT AGAIN\n\nNo just rework Kalista.

A simple stat buff on demand isn't very interesting (especially when it basically has no cooldown) and he needed some kind of utility on an ability slot for Ryze, so they had to design a new ult from scratch.\n\nThey also changed his lore and they drew on that for inspiration for a new ult that could fit the new character and hopefully make his state of balance less binary.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-07-24T04:51:01.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I completely agree.
