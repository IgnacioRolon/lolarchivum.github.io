That means that MF will need to run barrier and rush BT now; If you couple this with a Support that shields, she could have her passive up for a REALLY long time. My only concern is that, from experience, MF benefits from really aggressive, lockdown type of supports so....this narrows down the pool of champions she's effective with in the bot lane if you want to keep Strut active. The only supports that have decent shields that could go aggressive as well as peelers are Karma and Lulu from the top of my head, Thresh's lantern is so squishy it won't count in my book.\n\nMaybe I'll have to rush Targon's and Locket to keep my babe strutting in teamfights ;-;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2015-07-11T02:19:07.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=siwrf0bf,comment-id=00080000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-11T02:07:39.695+0000)\n>\n> I'm not saying it wont help her at all, and I'm not asking for a dash or a blink.

I mean...Vayne is and she's fking retarded, but outside of her...\n\n2) I mean, Zap roots Jinx and Volley roots Ashe. Remember that both of them are MORE immobile than MF, even if they have more range. The point is escaping, which MF technically can do better than them, especially with the incoming changes.\n\n3) Dropping it on them means they have less time in it if they're chasing you. Dropping it right in front of yourself means once they walk in, you out-pace them. Then you just throw on Strut and run off, never to be seen again. That's exactly how someone uses traps to escape: you don't drop it on them, but rather in front of you so they walk into it or lose time using alternate routes. This doesn't just apply to Jinx, either.

Ashe has a stun. But even if you discount those two hard CC's, their slows have superior range.\n\n\nEven if you ignore their hard CC's, you're also forgetting the fact that Jinx and Ashe don't need to escape nearly as often as MF does. The difference in their effective ranges are huge. Jinx, Ashe, and Varus are capable of contributing to the team with reduced risk. That is HUGE for an ADC since safety is objectively one of the best _\"stats\"_ on an ADC, even more than their DPS all things considered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-11T02:41:18.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=siwrf0bf,comment-id=000800000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-11T02:19:07.869+0000)\n>\n> 1) Dude, EVERY ADC hates assassins. Adcs aren't meant to beat assassins from 100-0 or feel comfortable when an assassins are around. MF isn't a special case. I mean...Vayne is and she's fking retarded, but outside of her...\n> \n> 2) I mean, Zap roots Jinx and Volley roots Ashe. Remember that both of them are MORE immobile than MF, even if they have more range. The point is escaping, which MF technically can do better than them, especially with the incoming changes.\n> \n> 3) Dropping it on them means they have less time in it if they're chasing you. Dropping it right in front of yourself means once they walk in, you out-pace them. Then you just throw on Strut and run off, never to be seen again. That's exactly how someone uses traps to escape: you don't drop it on them, but rather in front of you so they walk into it or lose time using alternate routes. This doesn't just apply to Jinx, either. I do this with Caitlyn's Yordle Trap too when I use her (although more to save other people than myself...I use the net more for myself).\n\nI'm not talking about assassins, I'm talking about anything with a gap closer that can sucessfully negate your Make it rain's slow field. but anyways. Jinx is extremely safe and has two self peel tools she can use before flash, Dashing through her traps still roots you, and zap's slow is crippling and hits like a truck? Make it rain's time reduction so her damage is more consistent means her slow's duration got reduced as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Myozthirirn","date":"2015-07-11T02:50:34.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not a panic button like flash or corki's fire thing.\nIt doesnt work as an escape tool because its not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shiiiro","date":"2015-07-10T04:23:05.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Make her E stack Impure Shots pls.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-07-10T13:15:21.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would completely remove the stacking mechanic of impure shots.","replies":[]}]}]}
