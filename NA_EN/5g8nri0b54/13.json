Your signature style really does not compliment either of these two champions, and I will go into detail in this thread.\n\nBefore I begin, I guess I should point out that I have no personal problems towards you as an artist. In fact, I'd even say your artwork is often times really good, hell, give me a pencil and paper and I won't even produce 1/60th of what you can do. However, if you consider yourself an artist, you should understand one golden rule of art, art exists to be criticized! And as this is a video game, a second rule is brought forth, art exists to take in feedback! And this is exactly what I am here to do.\n\n\nThis thread's main focus is a discussion of the signature style that many fans of LoL have identified you with, that style that you appear to have picked up AFTER you finished designing {{champion:103}} . To be specific, I am referring to your *\"asexual utilitarian genderless design\"*, or as some members of the forums have taken to calling it, the *\"yay she's not a slutty whore stripper!\"*-design. There are problems with the idea of calling any champions that do not hold your signature style a stripper, namely it's horrifically slut-shaming, but that's a topic for another thread. This signature style of yours have a place in LoL, but the problem here is, it doesn't always work. And I may be wrong here, but I get the idea that you feel the obligation to apply your trademark design to every single female champion you work on after {{champion:103}} , and the problem here is, **there are many instances where your style is not appropriate.**\n------------\nYou have been associated with several champions in LoL, many have nothing to do with this topic, namely {{champion:91}} , {{champion:104}} (he has different problems aesthetically!), {{champion:72}} , {{champion:101}} , etc. No, what this thread focuses on is your girls that you have applied, and will apply, your *\"asexual utilitarian genderless design\"* on. They are {{champion:89}} , {{champion:131}} ,{{champion:133}}, !!{{champion:113}}! !, and much to my worry, !!{{champion:51}}!!'s VU.\n\nLet us start in where your signature style works! Where you succeeded at varying degrees!\n\n{{champion:89}} , {{champion:131}} , and {{champion:133}}. Or to put it another way...**Demacian and Targon**(with one exception (2)) champions in general *'hint' 'hint'*\n\n\n-\nThese champions are what you can say, *\"Soldier\"*.  By that, I mean they find their place within an** organized ranks within a civilized western fantasy society**. Take medieval Europe as the prime inspiration for these champions. Knights, sleekly armoured warriors that value the protection of steel! As far as personality goes, these champions are orderly, they, whether explicitly mentioned or not, follow their own form of chivalry. The types of fighters that associates with these are... \n\nPaladins\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KZJTno6.png\n\nTemplars\nhttp://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/038/5/a/hellgate__london_templar_by_dragbody-d4oz7xq.jpg\n\n\"Generic Knights\"\nhttp://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/33400000/Claymore-claymore-anime-and-manga-33467744-2560-1600.jpg\n\nArmoured Foot Soldier\nhttp://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130506203624/dragons-crown/images/5/5e/DC_-_Fighter_-_02.png\n\nDuelists (so I can't find a better image, sue me)\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fEwl9s8RF7o/TwOh0hsRObI/AAAAAAAACoM/coxBoE-0Fhg/s1600/11128.bwduel.jpg\n\nIn the world of Dark Souls...\nhttp://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130924154325/darksouls/images/2/29/Solaire_is_a_bro.jpg\n(yeah I can see why Leona is popular to some)\n\nThematically speaking, your design is good for CIVILIZED characters.\n\n**PRIDE: **These warriors pride lies not with their prowess in battle, not their amazing bodies, but rather their representation of their faction In this case, they wear the symbol of alliance, or wear an attire that is identified to their cause. Be it Leona's association with the Sun, Diana's obsession with the moon, and Quinn's ranger uniform. These champions are distinguished and identified by what they cover themselves with. \n\n**VALUE:** To these soldiers, formation and strategy is valued. You wear your armour not just to show your affiliation, but to protect yourself from your enemy's steel. You raise your shield to block your foes' attack. If your attire is flexible and lightweight, it reflects your role's need for stealth. If your attire is bulky, it reflects your role's need for defence. You are rigid and conservative.\n\nTo that end, Leona, Diana, and Quinn succeeds. FANTASTICALLY SPEAKING(1), they are functional. Quinn's ranger outfit is dark and allows for maneuverability, although her overall design is kinda unorthodox Diana and Leona's armour leave no area open except for their heads(1). Yet luckily, IronStylus managed to make them identifiable and distinct from one another. Granted Quinn could have been done better, buuut...eh. Demacians were never that visually interesting to begin with, can't blame him. Quinn's design is kind of a black sheep as far as Demacians go.\n\nIronStylus. Your *\"asexual utilitarian genderless design\"* works well in these situations because these character archetype matches the values you instill in your female champion's design.\n\nNow let's see where your signature style DOESN'T work.\n-------\n{{champion:113}} ...luckily this is literally the only champion where you screwed up in. Unluckily, HAVE YOU SEEN MY ATTEMPTS AT DISCUSSION IN GD?! Holy hell slut-shaming(*\"she looked like a stripper slut!\"*) and ignoring details that don't support your views ahoy! But forget about that for now, let me analyze Freljord for you, or to put it another way, let me help you compare and contrast **Freljord**'s designs, with **Demacia** and **Targon**.\n\nHere is a list of Freljord champions relevant to this discussion. {{champion:113}} ,{{champion:22}} , {{champion:23}} ,{{champion:48}} ,{{champion:20}}(blacksheep with his own mountain of design problems!) ,{{champion:201}} ,{{champion:2}} , and {{champion:79}} . Finally, we have the exception among Freljord champions, {{champion:127}} . She is a very special case and I will explain why later.\n\nAll of the melee champions except for the blacksheep are **Warriors**, NOT \"Soldiers\". Unlike the Soldiers above, Warriors are fight-hungry berserkers to their own degrees. They find their place not in evenly organized formations, but rather raid bands and clusterfucks of screaming axes, swords, and animal fur covered in blood. The best possible representation for these are perhaps the pre-colonial Aboriginals, Vikings, Mongols, and in general, SAVAGE BARBARIANS. Unlike the civilized soldiers above who fight for a cause greater than themselves, Warriors fight for THE FIGHT!* Barbarians hate cowardice*. They hate anything that may hinder their ability to fight. To them, the organized soldiers who hide behind plates of armour are a disgrace for they hide their true selves beneath protective steel. To these Barbarians, glory is in the act of fighting itself, not in the cause of the fight. \n\nTo expose your body to the elements of your surrounding is not a sign of poverty and suffering, but a test of your mettle. Nature's way to make you strong!\n\nHere is what constitute TRUE Warriors, Barbarians, fighters born in Freljord's Savagery\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FdV7eD7.jpg\n\nhttp://cdn.mos.totalfilm.com/images/r/red-sonja.jpg\n\nhttp://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2011/154/2/9/old_red_sonja_cover_by_nebezial-d3hz6t4.jpg\n\nhttp://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140216204211/dragons-crown/images/5/52/Dc-amazon-epilogue.jpg\n\nhttp://d1vr6n66ssr06c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dragons_crown_dwarf_header.jpg\n\nIn the World of Dark Souls...\nhttp://i1.minus.com/iFfKFUcw7E4Ux.png\n\n**PRIDE:** Your bodies! Specifically, how well toned and amazing they are! A Soldier's body serves only to wield weapons of war. A Warrior's body IS their weapon, enhanced by their weapons of war! \n\n**VALUE:** To rely on one another is to be a coward! To hide behind your armour and shields is a sign of weakness! Expose yourself to your enemies! The true test of a warrior is to overcome all with just your strength alone! Do not borrow the strength of steel, for your body should be all you need to protect yourself! If you have an extra arm to wield a shield, grab second weapon instead coward!\n\nNotice the power of Tryndamere's bare body. Notice Braum's gargantuan exposed pecs. Notice Olaf's exposed limbs. Notice Gragas' unprotected lard................................................................................................\n\nNow notice your bland over-protective full-plate of armour you just covered {{champion:113}} in. Her companion Bristle is completely exposed to the elements. But the savage barbarian queen who trained herself buck naked in the blizzard to the point where she no longer feels the cold? The savage barbarian queen who have the protection of a gigantic boar, unlike the warrior on their foot Tryndamere and Olaf?\n\nTHIS, is where I criticize you IronStylus. Your signature style worked for {{champion:89}} . It worked for {{champion:131}} . It worked for {{champion:133}}  (...you could have done a bit better tho). But it did NOT work for {{champion:113}} \n\n**IronStylus. Your visual update of Sejuani is uncharacteristic. You applied Demacia and Targon's ethics into a Freljord champion. Your signature style, while great for Paladins and Knights, have no place on a Savage Warlord.**\n\nI am not a fan of Sejuani's VU. But if you must justify Sejuani's armour, you must\n\n-explain why Tryndamere is more exposed than chain-mail bikini Sejuani who rides atop a gigantic boar to take all the hits for her anyways\n-explain why Braum is more exposed than chain-mail bikini Sejuani who rides atop a gigantic boar to take all the hits for her anyways\n-explain why Olaf is more exposed than chain-mail bikini Sejuani who rides atop a gigantic boar to take all the hits for her anyways\n-explain why Gragas is more exposed than chain-mail bikini Sejuani who rides atop a gigantic boar to take all the hits for her anyways\n-explain why a woman who mastered control over the winter storms fear the cold she mastered so much that she needs to cover up\n-explain why Ashe have no need to dress in warmer clothing despite living in Freljord just like Sejuani\n-explain why a proud savage warrior such as Sejuani would be so cowardly as to hide behind such a protective plate of armour\n\n> Armored with absolute faith in her destiny, Sejuani pushed herself to extremes that would have killed anyone without her will to endure. She walked into blizzards without food or furs and trained while frigid winds raked her flesh. She clashed with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs gave out beneath her. When she assumed leadership of her tribe, Sejuani commanded her warriors to follow her example. Under her rule, the tribe grew stronger than they had ever been. \n----------------------\n**THE FUTURE OF YOUR DESIGN!!!**\n\nSo I heard you've been talking of doing {{champion:51}} 's VU. I've heard talks of people wanting you to apply your design sensibilities on the spoilt rich daddy's girl of Piltover.\n\nSeeing what you did with Sejuani, it worries me. Caitlyn is neither a Soldier nor a Warrior. She certainly isn't a utilitarian type either. She isn't like Vi who crashes into every fight, rather she's a dainty girly-girl who hides behind cover and snipes her enemy from afar. She has no need for armour. She has no need for long-coats. She has no specific attire she needs to wear.\n\nRather, **Caitlyn is a girl**. Caitlyn shouldn't wear officer clothes, she should wear girl clothes. Or if you are so insistent of her wearing officer clothing, make her wear FEMALE OFFICER clothes.\n\nhttp://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2011/4/8/1302273115993/Female-police-officers-th-007.jpg\nhttp://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/29/article-2381052-1B03F65C000005DC-523_634x428.jpg\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01785/Czech-Republic_1785190c.jpg\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/xhwci6wx7/Twitter.jpg\nhttp://englishrussia.com/images/lady_police/10.jpg\n\n\nThey're officers, yes. BUT they're also women! Please keep that in mind when doing Caitlyn's VU!\n--------------------------------\nIn Conclusion. I respect your artistic talent. I acknowledge that you have skill. I acknowledge your signature style have a place in League of Legends. BUT, I must criticize your application of it in {{champion:113}}'s case. I want to let you know the weaknesses of your visual style before it's too late! Before you do to {{champion:51}}  what you did to poor {{champion:113}} .\n\n\n**TL;DR** - \n\na) Your signature style have a place among rigid societies, namely, the world of knights. But it has no place in a society of proud savages! Imagine comparing the Orc Horde with the Human Alliance in Warcraft 3!\n\nb) I have **NO IDEA **who the heck is in charge of how skins are released. But I bet you hold more sway than I do! PLEASE convince the person in charge of skins to make ALL Traditional skins be available to all! I already explained my dislike of Sejuani's current look, and why her Traditional look is much more in-character. But I bet you that other people would love to have Traditional Karma's Yin-Yang dress, Trundle's rotten look, etc.!\n\nc) Please keep my criticism of your style in mind when you do Caitlyn's VU! Whether you intend it or not, her mini-skirt has become a part of Caitlyn, just like {{champion:44}} 's FABulosity or {{champion:41}} 's orange-addiction.\n\n\nDo you at the very least UNDERSTAND where I am coming from? What I am trying to get across? If so please do let me know. Do you disagree with any of my analysis? I'd be happy to further explain my position. More importantly...convince the skin-guy to make Traditional skins be available for all and becareful how you re-design Caitlyn. :(\n\n\n**PS** - why do I have this weird feeling that you're a Claymore fan?\n--------\n(1) - notice how I say fantastically speaking? Remember that LoL is in a fantasy setting. So yes, everyone is quite well aware of how unrealistic and improbable it is for women in that outfit to fight in wars in real life. We all know how impractical Leona's armour is. We all know how unusually masculine Quinn's chin makes her look\n\n(2) - wtf is up with {{champion:80}} 's design?!  He's a Targon champion just like Leona and Diana, but he holds a completely contrary value to what Leona and Diana holds. Double Standards? Sexism? Ridiculous 300-fanboyism but unable to fit him anywhere? See the discrepency there?! \n\n(3) -  despite being in Freljord, Lissandra's armour fits her because she does not hold the same values of the barbarians. Notice how her very movements reflect one who is unused to battle. She makes little movements, like a queen in a long dress. For her, despite being a Freljord champion,","replies":[{"poster":"Irongrinder","date":"2014-09-30T06:02:09.923+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":12,"body":"Sejuani's VU was largely for practicality's sake if you ask me.

She's not as much of a girly-girl as you or a bunch of other people always seem to want to make her out to be, but she's certainly not a masculine woman in any sense of the word. However, while she is indeed a feminine woman, I don't think it's right to use that as justification to put her in an unpractical skirt. Officer clothing is not clothing you wear while on duty, or out on the battlefield, it's clothing you wear to formal events, or while in command and NOT actually fighting yourself. It's worn as a show of status, so to speak. \n\nI agree she's not like {{champion:254}} , she doesn't get into the middle of every fight and she doesn't really need armor, not as a sniper (plus it wouldn't make sense thematically for her as a Marksman, who are supposed to be squishy anyways), but she STILL needs to wear something *practical* for combat, and a mini-skirt is *not* on the list of practical combat attire.\n\nShe's a woman through and through, and she has a thing for being fashionable. It's part of who she is, and IronStylus knows this and has acknowledged this nearly every time he's involved himself in conversations regarding Caitlyn's VU. So, I can only conclude that when her eventual VU comes through, it **will not** have her wearing a mini-skirt of any kind, it **will** have her wearing something more practical to move around and fight in (yes, even from afar), and it **will** be something less dull in style than the other Piltover Champions ({{champion:81}}, {{champion:126}}, {{champion:254}}) and will actually in fact be something considered to be a mixture of \"practical combat attire\" and \"high Piltovian fashion\", because Caitlyn just seems like that's the kind of outfit she'd need to wear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2014-09-30T07:58:05.088+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pantheon doesn't look or act like Leona or Diana because he's part of the Rakkor Tribe, which is a different section of Mount Targon entirely.

He-Man is meant to appeal to boys while She-Ra appeals to girls.\n\nhttp://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/he-man-she-ra-christmas/22.jpg\n\nIt is true that SOME boys and SOME girls like the character meant to appeal to the opposite gender, but according to the sales at the Toys-R-Us I used to work in, there is a strong link between character and genders who buy them. Of course, overall He-Man enjoys much more success than She-Ra, turns out beautiful warrior lady, or any warrior lady in general isn't the best seller...which leads to the next  comparison.\n\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img27/9633/lyth.jpg\n\n\nI should point out, despite the name \"POWER Fantasy\", a more accurate name should have just been \"Fullfillment Fantasy\" instead if you want to talk about genders in general. Simply put, females in fantasies are depicted differently. They are depicted in such a way to appeal most to both genders, and the same goes for male.\n\n\nThis is a bit of a **generalization**, but overall, the buxom thin bodies bombshell is desirable for both genders. For women, it's something they want to strive for however unlikely. For men...fanservice! The rippling alpha-male ogre is the same, something men strive for however unlikely, but also fanservice for females(hence why the girls in my Uni's anime club are crazy over shirtless Goku...).\n\n\nDon't believe me about attractive females appealing to women? Go to a shopping mall and pay attention to the type of images used to advertised female products. It's practically soft-core porn depending on which section of the mall you go to. Victoria's Secret, Sears, catalogues for women's clothes in magazines, etc.\n\n---------------------------\n\n{{champion:113}} , for her part, was no worse than {{champion:23}}. But unlike {{champion:23}}, {{champion:113}} actually finds herself **MUCH** more justified.\n\nJust think about the circumstances the two champions faces in a battle.\n\n-one fights atop the safety of her trusty steed vs the other fights on foot\n-one has some modesty armour to guard herself(even if it's just to lower ratings) vs. bare-chested savagery\n-one have a gigantic furry arctic mammal generating as much heat as a real life polar bear vs nothing but the cold hard snow covered ground\n-one have mastery over the winter storms vs. the ability to get really pissed off\n\nFeel free to apply that comparison with the other Freljord warriors.\n\n(now if only there was a way to bait IronStylus so he can understand, or atleast try to see this pov!)","replies":[{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2014-09-30T11:47:42.389+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Flame me all you want but I wholeheartedly disagree with your point of view.

And I can see myself agreeing with you to an extent that a decent solution is to cover-up Braum, Gragas, Trynd, Olaf, etc. to be more Sejuani like.\n\nBUT...can you atleast see **a very sexist double-standard that just happened?**\n\n\nWhy do you think people are so ready to come up with stupid cop-out excuses why Tryndamere, Gragas, and Tryndamere are so totally allowed to bare their bodies, but the mounted savage warlord Sejuani needs to cover up? Why does she get a full VU almost immediately after her release compared to other champions?\n\n\nWhat do you think it implies about the people okay with Tryndamere being as he is, but downvote spam if a person suggests that the other sex should get equal treatment?\n\n-because Sejuani is a WOMAN, she needs to be covered up because her body is shameful\n-because Sejuani is a WOMAN, VU's oughta prioritize to cover her up first even though Tryndamere has been around for as long as League existed\n-because Sejuani is a WOMAN, arguing that she be held to the same standard as male champions makes you worse than Hitler\n\nNOW, if that new armour of her fits her thematically, that it fits her personality...then it can be justified. But...except it's not. It's not even well-designed or memorable. It's just really generic and tacked on....maybe if her armour was made to look like it was made from Boar-hide, or maybe she was drenched in blood, perhaps. But then you'd still have to justify why Sejuani gets special treatment.\n--------------------\nWith that being said, while I respect your opinion, I lean more towards the \"they should all be more bare\" side of things for thematic reasons.\n\nYou are correct that it is utterly ridiculous that Gragas and Tryndamere is all bare, you can not deny that. But that is likely Riot's intention here. LoL isn't a direct reflection of real life, it is an idealization, a **FANTASY**.\n\nThis is why all the argument that Sejuani must be covered up in armour and protected from the cold is a whole load of bollocks to begin with. Asides from the sexist double-standard going on, there's also the fact that you are talking about a wild-woman with the power to control ice.\n---------\nOf course, if I had to choose between this ridiculous double standard or ALL Freljord champions being covered up, I'd choose the latter.","replies":[{"poster":"John Berserk","date":"2014-10-01T08:20:53.349+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know, Tryndamere and Braum, while mostly bare-chested, are pretty well covered-up everywhere else. \n\nLet's look at all the Freljord Champs one by one (at least the relevant ones, so no {{champion:34}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} or {{champion:106}})\n\nI highlighted the exposed skin that would be greatly affected by the cold weather in light blue.\n\n**Ashe**\n[](http://i.imgur.com/9vYHcRY.png)\n\nIt doesn't look like a lot is exposed, but it's easy to tell how thin her clothes are, so it's pretty hard to imagine anyone wearing this in the Freljord. I put the blame of this design on the fact that when they gave Ashe her VU, they weren't updating her old design, merely her model and effects and such. I think she needs a minor redesign.\n\n**Braum**\n[](http://i.imgur.com/j2NSFyU.png)\n\nYes he is bare-chested in the Freljord, but everywhere else really, he's pretty tightly covered up. From his abdominal area down, he's protected from the cold. I think someone used to living in cold weather would be alright with this much exposed. It should also be worth noting his giant shield can help with the biting cold winds. Not entirely practical, but not entirely impractical either, not like Ashe's.\n\n**Gragas**\n[](http://i.imgur.com/vGIskrR.png)\n\nHow is he not dead\nGragas is a mess of a Freljord champion, but was he even from the Freljord when he was first released?? I can't remember, but either way the blame for Gragas' design is on the old Champion designers, whose designs...weren't really the best. He needs a VU, for more than just his design.\n\n**Olaf**\n[](http://i.imgur.com/hY0nkio.png)\n\nOlaf needs pants. If he just had some pants, I think he would be, well, not necessarily fine, but way better off.

But unlike Braum, he doesn't have a big shield to help block the biting wind, nor does he have any furs on his upper body to help hold in some body heat. Though I guess he can stay warm from all of his anger and his blood rushing through him at such high rates?? Like Ashe, Gragas, and Olaf before him, his design is based off of an older one. Even so, however, he's not in too bad of shape.\n\n**(Traditional)Sejuani**\n[](http://i.imgur.com/GZeCoyh.png)\n\nShe was almost as exposed as Gragas. The only parts of her body NOT exposed were her feet, hips, upper arms, and head. Everything else was just out there. I think she was designed visually at a time where they had yet to transition from their \"old\" ways of designing and into their \"current\" ways of designing, if that makes any sense.\n\n_____\n\nThere is a bit of a double-standard going on with the Freljord champs, if you compare them as if they were all designed with Riot's current design philosophies, which they weren't (I should have mentioned this in my previous post, but I was more focused on Caitlyn). It's obvious a lot of Riot's Freljord champs are overly and unrealistically exposed, but that's because they were designed a long time ago, and are due for a VU (for some of them ANOTHER) anyway. \n\nI highly, highly doubt Riot would ever design these Champions the same way today as they had back then. I say wait to compare and judge until they're all designed under more or less the same circumstances and philosophies as each other.

Real-life female warriors dressed exactly like men, in practical armour (whether that armour was full plate or furs and leathers).\n\nExamples would be these:\n\nhttp://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/36/d6/2e/36d62e573d6a95b4662ae5a2daa1ef0f.jpg\n\nhttp://thumb7.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/181309/181309,1214305265,1/stock-photo--ethiopia-unknown-female-tribal-members-wearing-traditional-attire-stand-together-in-this-14200099.jpg\n\nRather than the bikini-clad women you posted in the OP.\n\n3) The use of skirts and high-heels among the women in the police and armed forces is a matter that is hotly debated. It is not a thing that all women agree upon. A lot of women prefer the comfort and practicality of pants and traditional shoes, while others prefer the skirt and heels. It strikes me as disingenuous to cite one side and conveniently ignore the other.\n\nIn short, I completely disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-10-18T17:56:43.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This^ Referencing other fan service styled art does not make styling Sejuani like that any more valid than how she is depicted now.

Those may be officers, and they may be women, but they are not combat-ready. Maybe a woman officer working a deskjob or participating in a formal parade may dress like that, but I can guaran-damn-tee you, when a female officer is actually going out on an investigation or into a combat zone, *they wear pants*. Proper shoes too.","replies":[]}]}
