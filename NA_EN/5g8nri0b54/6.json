This included abilities that many would describe as sustained damage. It was a clear lack of understanding from stashu himself of what DoT really means.

It attempts to make her a late game monster when previously I would argue that early game was where she shined. WIth this transition the abilities themselves are more lenient if we fixed the passive to start. I think personally Cass should be that early game bully that scales ok into late game with a focus on AOE damage. Which to me means making her the opposite of what she is right now.

Yes it's true that a mid range character is going to have lower range than most mages, since most mages are long range (or ther're assassins, in which case I'm not sure I'd classify them as mages in the first place), but that hardly makes them Rambo =/.

We told you we wanted a subtle and manipulative venom mage, you made her a skirmishing short-range machine gun hypercarry. We told you her E was unsatisfying, you made it the focus of her kit. We told you that her new passive is hobbling, you gave it minor tweaks and decided it was a fine idea. We told you that your rework needed more significant changes, and you just tossed on some buffs.\n\nWhat is your angle here? Why aren't you making changes?

Besides, she's fighting champs like Yasuo and Syndra, not Vayne and Trist. Big difference.

Shifting power into the poison amp is not increasing the power of Q or W, it is just a different way of cramming power into E. I will give you that it does something for the theme of poison, but it does absolutely nothing to address the deleted gameplay Cass used to have when she had meaningful Q and W spells.\n\n> We're not done looking into Cassiopeia, and I know these changes won't entirely fix the problems you have, but I do want to point out that we share at least some of your concerns, and I think it's clear that we're in the process of addressing them.\n> \n\nYou aren't addressing our concerns. Absolutely nothing has changed with the 4.21 changes. She is still the inverse of what she has been for years, she is the inverse of the reason I played Cass and spent my real world money on her. She is still single target, still late game instead of early game, still only has one meaningful spell outside of the ult, still only has one valid play pattern of go rambo all-in, and she most certainly hasn't regained any of her fun tempo from Deadly Cadence or feeling of a poisoner who is in control and wants to keep her distance until she manipulates the situation into her favor.\n\n**To me, her biggest fantasy/thematic elements translated into actual gameplay is the dichotomy of Cass' former life as a cunning/deceptive/manipulative courtesan and her new form of a monster that can't wait to strike hard and fast and RIGHT NOW. The play pattern of skirmishing with Q and W being powerful spells in their own right represented Cass' ironclad will holding back the inner monster to keep everything in control and manipulated into her favor as a remnant of her old life, and the \"turn and burn\" hitting R and spamming E represented her finally giving in to her new bestial nature. Both playstyles were satisfying and valid, but the truly satisfying plays were always the ones where both playstyles/natures were utilized.**\n\nPost-rework, she only has one play pattern -- that of a magic damage \"autoattacker\". Completely ignoring balancing, numbers, inverting everything about Cass' strengths and weaknesses, or fundamental reasons why Cass' kit is not ideal for a mage \"autoattacker\", this total loss of all choice in play pattern is why I absolutely disdain this rework.\n\n\n> Cassiopeia has always had two combat ranges (Q/W range and E/R range). Q/W are long range, and E/R are medium range-- I don't mean to be super controversial here, but E/R have never been 'Rambo' range. It's true that they put you at much more risk than the Q/W ranges, yes, and the update makes this her primary combat range, but 700 range is simply not Rambo range (is Ashe rambo range?), so I think that's a little unfair.\n\nIt is true that Cass' E is longer range than Ashe's autoattack. But Cass isn't going against Ashe in lane. She is going against other mages, or one of the many champs in league-of-dashes-and-burst-damage.\n\n> \n> In recent versions, Cassiopeia functions most effectively at mid range, towing a very delicate line. Yes it's true that a mid range character is going to have lower range than most mages, since most mages are long range (or ther're assassins, in which case I'm not sure I'd classify them as mages in the first place), but that hardly makes them Rambo =/.\n> \n\nA great deal of common mages have equal or greater range than Cass' Q as it was. This made mid lane interesting for Q maxing because it basically came down to who lands skill shots more often, and dropping Q and W did not require/enable enemy to force an all-in engagement. Since she will always lose the poke war now with the meaningless damage Q and W now provide, her only choice is to close to E distance. But SURPRISE, every single mage in the world will be able to CC and splat Cass before she lands more than an E or two.\n\nA similar scenario happens against assassins in that her Q and W used to give her an option in how to deal with these champs as they are long enough range that she can farm and poke without getting caught by a dash or CC. If you landed a few Qs and got a timely W off, you could whittle them down enough that you could risk an all-in. But now that she has no damage in Q or W (I have legitimately seen people stand in Miasma for the full duration and passive health regen + a last hit or two + lifesteal kept them full health), she can never whittle down the assassins enough to where she can risk an all-in. This problem is exacerbated since her initial release with the addition of so many champs with insane mobility.\n\nAdditionally, she previously felt good hitting a timely hourglass, because her poisons were still chunking the enemy for meaningful amounts. This let you outplay the Panth that would otherwise splat you  because you could Q him as he approaches, drop a W on yourself, and hourglass as soon as his stun wears off. Then when hourglass comes off pop your ult and go ham with QW+E spam. If you timed and aimed everything right, you were rewarded for outsmarting your enemy. But now that all damage comes from E, it isn't a valid play pattern anymore to do this. Q and W don't chunk them enough while you are hourglassing, so you are now the one getting splatted even in your best case play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2014-12-04T23:45:16.526+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just want to state that her range is too short for mid lane anymore, she is outranged and/or outdamaged by so many other mages that its ridiculous.

Not even mentioning assassins because there's so many and they all destroy her in lane now. She still offers nothing to early and mid game team fights and late game her range is too short and her damage is way too inconsistent. Not to even mention her lack of mobility or build options, her lack of a passive until late game, or her complete change from an AOE mage to a single target mage(which isn't something necessarily positive or negative but is something I truly disapprove of.)

On live right now, you can't get away with maxing Q because E's damage in the early levels is total garbage. With the amplification factor going live, Q max will be viable because that amplification will significantly increase her damage in short trades.\n\nIn regards to assassins, I speak out of personal experience playing against Master/Challenger tier mid/top laners including a lot of one-trick pony assassin players. Cassio's damage is NOT negligible early game. She out-damages the old Cass at every point in the game if she is kiting properly if you are maxing Twin Fang. If you have 2 Doran's and a Catalyst no assassin is going to be able to kill you in a full combo and you will either blow their summoners or straight up kill them in retaliation. She's actually a better pick into assassins than most mages because of her insane ability to duel and once she gets 75 stacks she can also sustain in those fights as well. \n\nAdditionally, because assassins basically have to build glass cannon to stay relevant late game, Cass winds up killing them in like 3 Twin Fang casts as she starts taking off.

Honestly, my early game wasn't effected heavily (very early game) as I ~did~ rush pure spell pen and tankiness and focused on Q. The only issue was how absolute mana hungry new Cass is and how E had to be utilized for last hits.\n\nI dislike the New Cassio because its thematically unpleasant to play and doesn't have much of what I ~liked~ about the old Cassio as a champion. Her design feels unappealing and her identity feels stripped away to nothing.\n\nI'm going to agree though about her having an easier time on assassins. Honestly my issues with her aren't fighting assassins, its other mages. She's kind of like Anivia in that respect. Anivia can royally shit on numerous assassins as she has her damage linked to a point and click chunk of death and CC that becomes more dangerous and more reliable the closer they are to you.

So, seeing as you play Cass often, what is your opinion of the overall rework? I know it's not yet finished, but how do you think it compares to old Cass? I simply want to hear your opinion because you seem informed and logical (and highly skilled, according to your rank).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2014-12-05T03:29:38.193+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":10,"body":"I think the rework takes Cass in the right direction towards viability while retaining familiar gameplay patterns etc etc. Is it there yet? Probably not, she is definitely a tiny bit undertuned on live. However, I feel like a lot of the problems are going to solved by the set of buffs that are going through. Issues that I expect to be resolved are: Q feeling a bit clunky due to the high delay, being able to max Q if necessary, and smoothing out her very rough early game.\n\nCompared to old Cass, I think with the coming buffs she will be a much more reliable carry. The Twin Fang reset is much more generous and her Q will be easier to hit. Additionally, she can get her full DPS out at max range. There is no arguing that old Cass had a stronger early/mid game simply due to ratios and her passive, however I think the reworked Cassio is MUCH more potent once you have your first/second item. \n\nI will say this. There is one thing that I dislike a lot about the rework and that is upping the Q CD to 4 seconds. I REALLY dislike the fact that she can't seamlessly string Qs together. I think it is one of the most satisfying and core parts of Cass being Cass and by preventing her from doing so until she hits 200 stacks, you make her feel very unsatisfying until that point.\n\nTo clarify, one of the biggest complaints about the passive is how it feels like shackles. I think the 25% CDR is a large contributor to this because once you get it, you FEEL like old Cass again with the 3 second CD on Q. \n\nThat'd be the only change I'd make - revert the nerf to the Q cooldown, give her ult scaling CD with rank, lower Miasma CD with rank, and then put something exciting in place of the 25% CDR. I don't know what could go there that wouln't require her to suffer elsewhere for the sake of balance, but it would be cool if it was something appreciable like the sustain you get on Twin Fang.","replies":[{"poster":"Stez007","date":"2014-12-05T04:23:52.061+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"At my level (Gold), assassins play extremely aggressively. They tend to be in my face more often than not, and take what might be considered balls-deep risks to get early kills. Even with a fast Catalyst I've been struggling to survive against most assassins that play this way (and the ones that don't tend to be weaker players) thanks to needing to Q and hit several Es to match their trades, which are usually a lot faster and hit a lot harder early. It's slightly better on PBE, but not nearly enough to make me comfortable playing Cass against an assassin. \n\nAs for the rework overall, she's too E-focused. The passive is still junk, though, but if it *must* stay then how about this:\n\nScrew the CDR. Replace it with Deadly Cadence on rank 2. By that point in the game, she needs mana for teamfighting rather than laning anyway, it's not hidden power (it's a clearly-visible buff), it restores some of the fun of old Cass and it wouldn't feel nearly as shackling. Fuck the AP bonus, though. That needs to go back into her kit. Or, failing that, have some added effect that would provide that value through gameplay rather than pure stats (rank 3: more spam=more damage? deadly cadence adds %damage per stack?)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-05T03:38:23.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are right.

The scaling on her R is pathetic considering the low base damage and the fact that it has so much counterplay in comparison to others. I tend to forget it actually does any damage to anyone, it's essentially just \"use this and safely get off a few more Twin Fangs without taking damage\" when it goes right. A cool ultimate in terms of theme, and the visuals/audio are so cool, but the sheer lack of impact is so underwhelming. You turn someone to stone and all that happens is you get to bite them a few more times. Obviously you'd use the stun timeframe to E in the past too but at least you felt like the R was contributing to the damage, not just buying you time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-05T01:39:59.784+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well atleast you saw this.
