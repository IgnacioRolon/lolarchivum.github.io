Luckily you understand some of them, sadly, you are completely unaware of the other ones. Let's start with the blindingly obvious one first, the one you *look* like you understand.\n\n> 1) **UN-SUBTLY making it clear this Passive is intended to be a shackle to make sure she is shit early game is NOT FUN**\n\n In short, those \"free stats\" aren't so much free stats as they are power locked away. \n\n-*\"Free\" 20% CD*  - Look at her Q. It's not just un-satisfying because it does little to no damage without E, but it's also un-satisfying because of how badly it flows now that it's cooldown is LONGER than the poison duration. So how do you get her Q to return to it's original state (CD-wise)? By getting stacks for her Passive to get that arbritrary 20% CD, with that extra CD, her Q becomes slightly more like how it once was.\n\n-*\"Free Deathcap\"* - I'm sure you've heard this a thousand times already. But having **thousands of AP doesn't mean jack if ALL of her AP ratios are complete and utter trash.** In fact, it comes off as manipulative, tricking gullible players into thinking getting all that AP is so \"super special awesome\" when all you achieved was **make her closer to what she once was.**\n\n-*\"Free lifesteal on her E\"* - First of all...have you read my multiple threads on the criticisms of your choice of making her E powerful? There's that. But there's also the fact that you balanced Cassiopeia around the fact that she will have a little heal in her E, meaning if her E doesn't heal her, she is incomplete...hence, garbage. You need to work so hard just to turn an incomplete champion into a complete one. *Now why does this not work for Cass but for {{champion:121}}  and {{champion:112}} ? More at the end!*\n\n**COMPARISON:** Notice how none of {{champion:121}} or {{champion:112}} 's Passive gives any free stats. And their ratios are not complete trash to downplay the stats they do get. {{champion:112}} 's Passive is NOT free stats despite what some may think. {{champion:112}}  sacrifices an item slot AND he pays gold to upgrade his Passive.\n\n> 2)** You gave a short-ranged high-risk mage with garbage early-mid game............an extra set of hoops to jump through to become viable**\n\nYou can say how much your 4.21 changes flattens her curve. But you never denied the fact that she is STILL a hyper-carry even if less extreme, and this is a problem. Why is it so important for you to change Cassiopeia into something she's not supposed to be from the start?\n\n**COMPARISON:** Look at {{champion:121}} , {{champion:112}} , and {{champion:134}} . THEY ARE NOT HYPER-CARRIES! They aren't shat on early-mid game, in fact, {{champion:112}}  dominates his mid-games. So while they are \"shackled\" *somewhat*, **they can live with it**.\n\nNOW...here's a few less obvious ones that hurts your Passive.\n\n> **!!! 3) Thematic Inconsistency: The act of POISONING an opponent achieves the goal of doing jack damage and...makes Cassiopeia stronger? !!!**\n\nThis Passive is what made me doubt your understanding of the Poison fantasy in the first place. Why is a POISON champion spending much more time BUFFING herself than she is DEBILITATING the opponent? The little bit of debilitation she inflicts (slow, the most common CC, and a very conditional stun), are extremely brief and doesn't fullfill the Poison fantasy. Pre-rework, fine, her poison actually mattered via damage. Post-rework? It exists purely to enable her most hated ability and to...make herself stronger instead.\n\n**COMPARISON**: tl;dr - being shackled FITS these champions. {{champion:121}}  is your generic \"The Thing\" type monster, only less scary and more fantasy. He starts off as a small bug, but as he consumes, he continues to grow non-stop. {{champion:134}}'s entire identity revolves around an old fart literally shackling her powers. {{champion:112}}'s is very well done. He is the first of his kind, his own prototype. In his case,** he treats himself like an item** and upgrades HIMSELF as though he is an item. To further solidify this theme, he even loses an item-slot to accommodate a piece of himself. {{champion:112}} is the perfect example of such an evolving theme working.\n\n> 4)  **AGENCY**\n\nThis one kinda explains itself doesn't it? Notice how Cassiopeia can't choose when she evolves, she can't choose what she evolves. They just...happen.\n\n>  5) **Cassiopeia's Passive is a chore in part because it is STACK BASED, yet in the worst way imaginable thanks to her mile-stones**\n\nI hinted at this before in point #2. But Cassiopeia's early-mid game is garbage. Even if you flattened her curve, she isn't {{champion:18}} whose early-mid game is clearly far too effective for her god-like late game. Cassiopeia genuinely struggles to not get stomped...so you decided to make her work at building her stacks while struggling to avoid getting {{champion:105}}ed or {{champion:61}} 'd in the face?!\n\n**COMPARISON**: **{{champion:112}}  {{champion:121}}'s are not STACK-BASED** These champions have evolving Passives, however they are not jumping over the hoops inherent in a Stack-Based mechanic (working to build up stacks...while also laning against another opponent). In this case, you may be wondering why I'm not comparing Cassiopeia with Stack-based champions instead. Well...\n\na) Character limit :p\n\nb) You don't tend to read awfully long threads, and this thread is long enough as is. : /\n\n------------------------\n**ALTERNATIVE POINT OF VIEW:**\n\nYou ever notice how {{champion:107}} technically has TWO Passives? One very powerful and meaningful jumping Passive integral to his identity and gameplay...and one **completely optional Passive** for those feel like playing the stacking game? Yeah, I'm not saying you should give Cassiopeia her own \"Bonetooth Necklace\" (\"Snakefangs Bra\"?). However, consider making her rather unfun and overly-limiting Passive a pure and OPTIONAL bonus and give her a Passive that actually works.\n\n\n**PS** - and I also feel the need to re-iterate that her rework has multiple problems, her E-centric focus being the top problem. Her Passive...is just one of her problems.","replies":[{"poster":"eyes wide shut","date":"2014-12-08T01:26:06.042+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's always fun to end the game with 900 ap with a void staff and feel like I'm doing the damage that I could do with a 300 ap ahri.

All of these could contribute to the dissatisfaction with the passive, and perhaps some more than others. One that stands out to me is that aside from the surrounding system, the rewards themselves just don't feel very satisfying as say, Kha'Zix's evolutions.

I truly think it is the biggest reason she feels weak in the early game. Much like when Twin Fang was bugged to 0.7 seconds, the increased CD on Q really interrupts the flow of her spell patterns and it's something I'm still not entirely used to.\n\nHowever, in regards to the heal on Twin Fang - I think that's a pretty cool 'extra' perk to get and it really doesn't change her overall game play pattern. It's strictly a boost in sustainability - Cassio can fight people without it all the same. This is my favorite passive boost because, to me, it FEELs like a reward.\n\nI also think the AP boosts are fine. Whether you agree with the direction they took with Cass or not, the ratio on Twin Fang hasn't been touched and with 1000 AP they're hitting for ~800 damage every .5 seconds. That's like an ADC critting with every. single. auto.

Cassio's late game E damage isn't high, but that's irrelevant when Stashu is trying to make a late-game single target hypercarry, while a tristana can do everything better than Cassiopeia at a much earlier point in the game with just two items (IE and Shyv) AND push towers AND is alot safer with W and her ult, Im not saying she should do what Tristana does, but** if Stashu is going to call her a late-game single target DPS champion, she needs to compete with similarly labeled champions.**\n\nIf a team on the LCS puts in Cassiopeia mid, the other team would go with an ADC, why bother putting in an assassin that might get fed off of her, when you can put in another DPS champion who will scale faster than her and do the same things better. Cass will try to go late game, they will push turrets and win at 25-30 minutes.\n\nIn the discussions with Stashu I've seen him read, acknowledge and propose various interesting to great ideas; but he hasnt implemented any of those because he's too stuck up on his Passive which goes hand in hand with nerfs to come together in late-game for a functioning champion.** He didnt make a champion, he made a perfect scenario.** \n\nEvery serious post, that says what they like and dont like in a constructive manner, says they like the E lifesteal. Every. single. one. Unique, non-stat bonuses like E lifesteal is THE direction Stashu needs to go and **he knows this**... But he can't, he's in too deep.\n\nExample: \n\n * Miasma starts off at **14 seconds** why? so it could get 7 seconds cd = 100% uptime at late-game combined with 25% (passive) and 5% (masteries).** That's at level 18**, W is always leveled last.\n * Noxious Blast gets a 3s CD with passive CDR, so she can get a 100% (theoretical) uptime on her speed boost, which is** 10%, ten percent!**, until level 8, 30% at level 13, seriously looking at her wiki page makes you sad, like dead puppy sad.\n\n**This is how he designed her: on a spreadsheet** *(that sounds weirdly dirty)*, with a complete focus for this ideal late-game scenario and he cant let go of it.  I love Spreadsheets as much as the next guy (probably more, I LOVE spreadsheets... they make everything so clear, organised, you can calculate stuff, put colors on them an-- ok. I- ...
