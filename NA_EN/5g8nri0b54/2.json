The loss of the ability to link with allies, the loss of that SATISFYING AS HELL heal/damage wave she used to have.

It will never be enough.  It's fundamentally an intractable design problem -- you have a kit that has inherently broken stuff in it, and the broken stuff is what attracted a ton of people to like the champion in the first place.  Compare Olaf or Skarner.  Same basic issue.\n\nWith Cassiopeia, the thing that attracted many people to her is her strong lane bullying, centered on maxing Q first and popping anyone who gets close to the minions.  Q cannot be that strong, whether it's DoT or DD, and have Cass be a healthy addition to the game.\n\n> There's a reason why** there was a link there**.

In other words, the problem was both her Q and her E. And after all that talk of being a lane-bully, you know what Stashu never acknowledged? The inherent counter-play built into DoT. How it's just like any other spells, except it's full impact can be reacted to unless said champion also have a spammy E button to counteract those reactions.\n\nAnd as I explained in the other thread, nerfing her for her lane-bully was stupid.\n\n> I'd seen it before. tl;dr you have a thematic direction complaint, and it's valid.

Certainly not you or me. Who is to say that a Twin Fang-centered Cassio is not what she is supposed to be? I can argue that she was originally designed to be a fast, sustained DPS version of Anivia, and her Twin Fang is the 'fast' version of Frostbite and thus she fulfills EXACTLY what she was meant to be. It doesn't matter if she's a snake or a woman or a dog or a cat. The intent was to have a champion with a  kit similar to Anivia's (where a majority of the damage comes from a single ability - her E) and that intent is entirely met. \n\nFurthermore, I don't see and never saw Cassio as a poison mage. I saw her as a snake woman that was 'cursed' and now has magic powers. Again, who the hell is to say how that magic manifests itself? If it is in the form of magically conjured large fangs then so be it, she's got magic powers now and it fits because she's half snake. \n\nUltimately, my point is that arguing for her kit to be pushed in a certain direction over another entirely due to thematics as you have been is just a horrible path to go down because every single argument and counterargument that is thrown at you and by you is going to be entirely opinion-based. Why is going down the route of AOE poison mage a better choice gameplay wise and design-wise than going down the route they have chosen outside of thematics?\n\nRiot doesn't see Cass as a champion that should deal massive AOE poison damage. Why should the people who like her as a Twin Fang spammer - which falls in line with what Riot sees her as - have to switch over to a new champion? Instead of trying to petition for them to change Cass, why not petition for a new champion that has a kit specifically around poisoning/crippling people? If you don't want to because you like Cass then why should the people who like Twin Fang-centered Cass get shafted and given a new champion to satisfy their desires?\n\nTo clarify, your argument frustrates me to no end because you're basically saying \"Hey you alienated us who liked Cass for her AOE poison but really you should alienate the Twin Fang lovers because they don't know what Cass is really all about.\" It's an incredibly selfish point of view, imo, and what is worse is that **Cassio's playstyle has not changed significantly at all**. Seriously, she plays out lane the same as she did before the only difference being that her Q does less damage and her E does more. While I admit I liked to max E pre-rework, realistically I wound up maxing Q just as often as E (actually I usually maxed both not taking W until 13). The playstyle is largely the same, the only difference is that you actually have to interact with the opponent now for literally 1 second to fire off two Twin Fangs.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-02T02:40:34.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Who is to say that a Twin Fang-centered Cassio is not what she is supposed to be?
