But it's my favorite mode, and the recent changes to the jungle in SR have had a negative impact on the 3v3 mode.\r\n\r\nWhat was so cool about 3v3 before was that there were two very viable metas. Teams could either run a support comp or a jungle comp. Vs. a jungle comp, a support comp has the early advantage thanks to having a 2v1 lane. But in the longer term, the jungle comp will have a gold and experience advantage if the support comp doesn't effectively push their advantage early. This variety made the game more fun, but the recent jungle changes have swung the balance much further in favor of support comps.\r\n\r\nBecause the creeps are harder to kill and do more damage, clearing the jungle takes longer. And now jungle items are more expensive, meaning that 3v3 junglers can no longer buy a level 2 jungle item at the start of the game; they've got to back once before they can even get that. The end result is that junglers need a longer time to be relevant in the game than ever before, and that means that the support comp has a bigger advantage than ever. \r\n\r\nIs there any chance we could get some TT-specific tweaks so that we can return to a place of balance? At present support comps have a huge advantage, and the game mode is more boring if everyone plays the same meta like they do on SR.","replies":[{"poster":"Learnding","date":"2015-01-30T19:52:03.209+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3v3 is probably the worst since they changed the map to what ever it is currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zushakon","date":"2015-01-29T21:21:04.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe if they increased the starting gold to 850 or reduced the price of the jungling item to 825 for TT?","replies":[{"poster":"Tyrannoscoreus","date":"2015-01-29T21:34:21.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either would be an improvement","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2015-01-30T20:53:13.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TT needs a whole new re-work... and more jungle camps added...\n\nOLD TT was better in many regards... the circle bush was one of the most fun things I ever got to have in this game.\n\nHealth relic replaced with a mob is a must... even if it is just a turtle crab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icy Auron","date":"2015-01-30T17:10:15.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with the 3s jungle is they tried to match it to SR's, which is ridiculous.
