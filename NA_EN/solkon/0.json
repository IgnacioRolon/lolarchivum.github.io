I have an issue, sometimes my computer is immiediately getting bluescreen and shutting down for no reason. It happens so fast I can only read \"creating sump memory system\" or something like that. It isn't really a problem cause it is very rare and as Iread it is caused by having too many programs installed or in need to cool down the processor (it is probably the second thing in my case). Anyway, I wanted to send to Riot my computer bug report from the action log, but i Cant even post here even a single file to prove that I didn't go AFK. The situation lokked like that: i chose to get the \"fill\" position when i started a game and I had no reason to go afk, because I got any lane as I earlier chose. Then I chose my champion and waited for the game to start, but before even all of us chose champions I got this bug and my copmuter got restarted. It's very stupid issue, because if i was in-game, then I would be in-game again in 2 minutes. But now i have a 20 minute waiting queue for 5 games and it's really not cool when I try to be as chill while playing as I can and afking doesn't happen in my case. It is even more frustrating, because I waited actually 3 years after my earlier computer broke and didn't play it on the second really bad computer (cause I didn't have fun in 10 fps at lowest settings, that one was really shitty) and now, when I finally can play games from early 2000 I get bans for these stupid bugs and can't even send them. Please Riot, respond.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-20T19:47:10.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to a dedicated tech support forum, riot cant do anything about your computer being broken.","replies":[]}]}
