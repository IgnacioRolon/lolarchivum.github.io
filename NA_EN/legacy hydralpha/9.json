They both look fun to play and I wish to have both of them in my champion pool eventually. Then, where&#039;s my issue with them.\r\n\r\n**They function _too_ well with each other.**\r\n\r\nNow the idea of having champions with synergy is awesome, and it&#039;s happened before with champions&#039; kits working well together, such as {{champion:236}} and {{champion:412}} as well as {{champion:96}} and {{champion:117}}, but there may be specific issues with having champions with increased potential and power when they&#039;re working with another champion not because of synergy, but because of specific gameplay elements that only work when they are together. So far, when working together Rakan and Xayah gain:\r\n\r\n* A paired recall, which can allow them to recall at the same time and causes one of them to not have to channel their recall. This is HUGE for a lane where the support and ADC may want to go back to lane together, and they can (technically) recall faster if they hop onto someone already recalling.\r\n* Rakan gains an increased leap distance to Xayah when using his shield dash ability. This is also a really good synergy because it technically lets Rakan be more mobile.\r\n* Xayah gives her W bonus to Rakan as well, giving the support some damage. This isn&#039;t as big a synergy, but I think instead of having it where Xayah&#039;s W works only on Rakan, make it so it can be cast on an ally to give her and the ally the bonus.\r\n\r\nSo because of their synergy Rakan and Xayah may end having problems if they become OP. They could end up only working well together and perform poorly solo, or end up not having a massive synergy with each other. I prefer the latter, while thematically having the champions work together is really cool, I feel that since Rakan&#039;s playstyle already benefits Xayah (Rakan can protect Xayah and CC opponents into her line of fire) they don&#039;t need massive synergy. I may be wrong about this, but that&#039;s just my thoughts on the situation. We&#039;ll have to wait until people test them to find out.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\nRakan and Xayah&#039;s potentially amazing synergy with one another and weaker synergy with other champs may cause them to have balance issues in game. Other than that, love the champs.","replies":[{"poster":"ImJustASuppTwT","date":"2017-04-20T05:52:23.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xayah's W gives Rakan attack speed. Whenever Rakan attack enemy with his spell or AA, the CD on his passive reduce for 1sec, which means it does not only give him a little bit dmg boost, but it boost his survivability by refresh his shield faster.\n\nSo basically, when they were together, Rakan can recall faster, attack faster, move further, and survive better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dafckingman","date":"2017-04-05T05:34:08.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Exactly! more than the empowered abilities though,\nI think the recall is easily the most OP part of their kit. It means one of them could dive the enemy team while the other start recalling in the bush. The diver can rush back to the bush and be almost INSTANTLY \"teleported\" home. That is CRAZY OP!\n\nOn a sidenote I'm a little sad about Rakan's kit. I'm a fan of playing off meta picks and playing every champion in every lane but it looks like he can only be played as a support. I mean shield, heal, no-dmg knockup, and a MS boost + charm. He wouldn't be able to 1v1 anyone. The guy has 0 dmg. Even Janna or raka could be made to go mid/top because they at least have SOME dmg. Taric top could even work cuz at least he has his passive and E dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2017-04-05T06:17:55.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Btw his knockup has damage. his ult has damage. his q has damage. look up some info before you open your mouth XD","replies":[{"poster":"just OK jungler","date":"2017-04-05T14:45:03.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think he mean's one High damage ability","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Swollwonder","date":"2017-04-05T05:58:07.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh no someone fitting in a lane he's designed for\n\nBard has one damaging ability, his Q, and once upon a time I would play on hit effect bard top and it was so good. \n\nRakan also has one damage ability. \n\nIf you want to play them off meta go ahead but don't complain and say you can't because of their kit. Kits are by definition designed to work with a meta. You don't have an adc with a scaling shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Dafckingman","date":"2017-08-13T15:12:30.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with \"Kits are by definition designed to work with a meta.\" which is why I am \"A little sad.\" That's very different from \"complaining.\"  Don't assume everyone on the internet are whiny kids mate\n\nand \"Adc with Scaling shield\" made me lol haha.

I was really worried when I heard about these champions that there would be mechanics created that only benefit them as a pair, and that is exactly what has happened. In theory, as you said, I love the idea, as it makes these characters really interesting. In practice, I worry that this will make them both impossible to balance and either make them to strong together and/or to weak apart. This would mean that they will be permabanned or that they won't be worth playing desperately. This sucks because, as a support main, I am really looking forward to playing Rakkan, as well as playing other supports with Xayah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirFur Bear","date":"2017-05-11T00:09:58.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't think Xayah and Rakan synergies really well.

I don't see a lot of people acknowledging this point because they just got revealed, but the built-in synergy seems inherently flawed from a design perspective. It's too early to tell since we don't have numbers yet, but we'll likely end up in 2 scenarios where the synergies aren't noticed enough to warrant putting them into the game, or they make a difference and become too powerful in coordinated play. We could conceivably have a third option, where it makes a difference in play, but not overwhelmingly so, but I'm not too sure this will happen given the info we have so far.","replies":[{"poster":"Nordenadler","date":"2017-04-04T23:16:09.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Think this will be another Kalista situation, where she sucks in soloQ but in coordinated play she's broken.
