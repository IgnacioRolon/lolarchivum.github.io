I&#039;m sure there&#039;s been worse but that was when I was a total noob. (Not like I have the memory to remember anyways) Not only is damage creep starting to rear its ugly head (Oh look the ADC has a Bloodthirster I guess I&#039;ll die), but bot lane towers are made of wet paper. We&#039;re in a meta where 4-manning bot is an actual strategy, not some throwaway cheese.\r\n\r\n* Bot lane towers die fast due to no extra resistances (like other towers)\r\n* Towers give first blood gold now, pushing whoever destroys them ahead\r\n* Junglers are now based off faster and healthier clears with smite changes, and gank sooner (4-man)\r\n\r\nThe main issue is just high damage and high snowball. If some of those got fixed and toned down, maybe we wouldn&#039;t be in this hell of a meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2017-01-18T00:12:28.283+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss season 4 (BUT NOT FERAL FLARE)","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2017-01-18T00:18:47.334+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season 4 jungle tank meta where Sejuani and Gragas were the top junglers, but also every single type of jungler was viable and it was the only time when Lee Sin wasn't in nearly ever game.\n\nI miss that time.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-18T01:25:52.980+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"season 5*","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2017-01-18T01:42:17.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They start to flow together after a while...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2017-01-18T03:32:06.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that one very small time when the perseverance mastery was still %missing health regen and warmog's regen still counted in combat\n{{champion:14}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-18T01:14:32.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i miss devourer, all champs who took it could carry but could also be dealt with with a little hard cc, that and i especially miss the little ghost dog.  the devourer days were the funnest i had on the rift","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-01-18T19:38:55.335+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am playing since season 1 and I can tell you that this is objectively speaking the worst meta ever and gameplay is totally ruined, there is not a single positive thing curently, however it suits me since I dont play ADC and mostly play tanks and mages, but as I said game is ruined and the only hope I see right now is to completely revert everything they did to game mechanics and items since early season 5 which was great in terms of balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cronofuge","date":"2017-01-18T11:24:10.016+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every season has its ups and downs.

After the outliers were brought into line, the game was rather well balanced (with each role/class filling their own niche).\n\nThen, one day, the Juggernaut reworks (along with Fiora and Gangplank shortly afterwards) appeared just in time to completely screw over Worlds due to GP and Mordekaiser being P/B.  As a result, red-side had to ban both options (leaving them with one ban) or leave both open (with both teams taking one).\n\nAlso, the mastery system had the Offensive and Defensive trees rather well-balanced.  While the Utility tree was somewhat subpar, it wasn't horrible and saw use by certain champions (i.e. Ryze).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MFTORANK1","date":"2017-01-18T19:27:29.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the worst meta since I've started playing this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Slothy","date":"2017-01-19T01:28:46.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there have been worse","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slazll","date":"2017-01-19T00:11:34.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well couple big problems main 3 unbalanced champs/positions eh eh jungle, very linear map progression cause it's clearly best to gank bot every game easiest turret dragon and the most kills for ganks, http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/UA1YhFzw-adc-possible-fixs, and finally the very linear build paths for most mid laners, adcs and supports atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soraka Rules","date":"2017-01-18T07:44:29.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been here since S1 and every season has had its cry babies.

You need to know that adc has supp with it all the time and is usually at the backline. The main issue is that junglers are too OP in this meta and they make bot laning so much more difficult.

Quite frankly, the main victims of damage-creep are squishy champions since it tends to change the damage they receive from threatening to insta-kill levels.  \n\nIf every champion has rather high damage, then that pretty much removes the need for burst-focused champions; why bother picking a champion who is focused on bursting down a target (i.e. Brand, Zed, Akali) when others are capable of doing the same with more durability/utility/safety?\n\nThere is no point picking a champion who can deal 150-200% of a champion's health in burst damage if another option deals 100% of their health in burst damage while providing more options.\n\n> Second diving bot has always been a thing because there is more people there along with a dragon so its just a much more valuable lane to focus.\n\nIt has always been a thing, but it is pretty much the only viable strategy at the moment since a successful gank bottom lane will provide two kills, a turret (with First-Blood gold) and Dragon.  At this point, the team which orchestrated the gank will have a massive lead and their bottom lane will be free to roam and pressure elsewhere on the map.\n\n> Third people have been bitching about how Cait and Twitch are op but then bitch about how ADC's are trash.\n\nADCs, as a role, are weak at the moment because they lack influence on the game.  They are late-game carries and the game is often decided long before they can make an impact by the performance of their allies and enemies (primarily, the mid-laners and junglers).  While they can be rather oppressive when they are ahead (i.e. on the winning team), they are at the mercy of their teammates (and opponents) to reach that stage rather than having control over it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BahdHinny","date":"2017-01-18T07:10:04.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I miss Ice Born Gauntlet, Sunfirecape Ekko","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2017-01-18T01:21:17.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED RECENCY BIAS","replies":[]}]}
