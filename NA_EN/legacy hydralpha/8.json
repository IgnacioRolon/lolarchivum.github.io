What kind of buffs/changes are you looking into for him, and can we expect them in patch 7.7?  Because right now, you still seem to be ignoring Aatrox.\r\n\r\nSome changes could be:\r\nPassive scaling off of bonus AD, or having a high base with no scaling (think Darius)\r\nAttacking jungle monsters while in Hellbent will give Aatrox 10 blood so the passive can last a bit longer. The numbers could be changed or just give him the full refresh on large monsters, but I sort of agree with Riot and the idea that if Aatrox could get his fully passive easily in the jungle, his clear would be too good. (Probably less than {{champion:64}}, though)","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2017-04-02T10:22:21.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alas they didn't decide to buff him in 7.7 lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tranoze","date":"2017-03-26T18:14:48.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think {{champion:266}}  need more tenacity. \nJust one stun in ~~teamfight ~~ anywhere and his passive + his ult + his W become useless.\nHe need to AA alot to charge up his passive, but all the bonus AS is only when his passive activated, he cant build both tanky and attackspeed at the same time.\nHe recover 5% missing health, and it complete useless for him in both jungle cuz his heath always keep stay lower than 40% and he cant gank with that much heath. He is an AA champion, who need certain heath before gank to actually have enough time to attack enemy, and with low heath constant in jungle, he cant gank. (he cant bust, so the amount of heath he have will effect the amount of damage he goin to deal.)\nIn laning pharse, 5% missing heath per 3 attack is trash cuz during that 3 attack enemy can take half of your heath bar anyway.\nI play him in ARAM recently, and holy, i cant even rerive once, even once. Either they bust me so fast that i just Q in, E, then i die. Or i got the charge then they just stun/root me for 3 fking holy seconds and i lost the revive.","replies":[{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-03-27T01:39:05.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zephyr, but Riot in their infinite wisdom removed it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahegao Bunny","date":"2017-03-26T17:03:21.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad but true... when you already play an niche hero with unreliable strenghts and riot just comes and takes the few strenghts from your hero.

Was always frustrating because you are so easy to kite and the dmg was too low. And don't know why he should have it harder against lane bulies. Was already pretty hard. But now when you play vs pantheon or renekton you wont get to use your passive in the entire early game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
