So why would we have Omega Squad skins for {{champion:45}}, {{champion:18}}, {{champion:29}}, {{champion:105}}? Aren't they supposed to be dead? (And why are Twitch and Fizz in a yordle-only squad?) Well, take a close look at the splashes if you haven't noticed something before:\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M6JvikaNkbs/WWSS3PCufuI/AAAAAAABEb8/FVyx0lzIUeEewFiSGtv0HSUSgla1HTAEQCLcBGAs/s640/fi.jpg\n\nhttps://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8832735/omega_squad_twitch.jpg\n\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v0fmmkf8AcA/WWSS3FTuGAI/AAAAAAABEcA/DfQLPSAVHPglI9OPXZ0Tmge-QWJfiNeaACLcBGAs/s640/twst.jpg\n\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vmT9ti3o7gI/WWSS3Tw1r-I/AAAAAAABEcE/TZj8FhmuOYMLvMHAWIdIsft4qxbI1bVsQCLcBGAs/s640/ve.jpg\n\nAll these splashes have Teemo (pre-mental breakdown) in them. People have probably figured out that the champions in the Omega Squad skinline (excluding Teemo) are already dead. But this little easter egg shines a bit more light on the lore of Omega Squad.\n\nFor those having trouble finding Teemo in the splash arts:\n{{champion:105}}: Teemo is riding the shark/dolphin/etc. in a scuba suit on the right of the splash.\n{{champion:29}}: Teemo is swinging on a rope in the top-right of the splash in the background.\n{{champion:18}}: Teemo is cowering under his helmet in the bottom-left of the splash. (Look under the tip of Tristana's cannon)\n{{champion:45}}: Teemo is in the bottom-right of the splash. (Look near the end of Veigar's weapon and the knife nearby)","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-07-28T11:38:21.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Spooky when long dead threads come back from the grave!\n\nWhile the art of thread necromancy can be useful in some cases, this unfortunately, is not one of those times.
