I selected whoever it was and waited......\r\n\r\nThe reconnect screen popped up and an error (unfortunately i didn't record this).\r\n\r\nI didn't think too much of it so I re-downloaded the game and thought it would go away. It didn't.\r\n\r\nA new problem arose. \r\nNow i don't even get an error or the reconnect screen. Just nothing after Champion select. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what it could be?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T00:52:07.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sound an awful lot like your connection to the servers is unstable, causing this issue.
