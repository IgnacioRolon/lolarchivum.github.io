I like the role. Helping people and stuff, it&#039;s pretty chill. To better play support I occasionally play ADC to get better with different matchups. This is where the problems start. 2 days ago from when this post is made, I was tilted in a game. I was playing ADC and I had a support bard. In this game, my support was trolling and jungled with our jungle Viktor. I don&#039;t know if they were in a party or what, but they ruined the game. I got stomped in lane by a duo and 15 minutes into the game, my Bard hasn&#039;t been bot once. This is when I break and flame everyone and start sarcastically commenting on all chat about the duo queue being pro material. I was at honor level 3 checkpoint 3 before this game. It is because of this one toxic game, I was demoted to honor level 1. I guarantee the trolls or the shit-talkers on the other team didn&#039;t receive any such punishment or even a warning for their griefing or toxicity. While I talk shit in one game and get demoted for something I had nurtured for so long. I promise anyone reading this, in comparison to any average League player, I am one of the least toxic players I know, but because of one game where I tilt, I get demoted to honor level 1 for reacting to a troll. This sucks being on the receiving end of an honor level injustice, but truthfully I&#039;m slowly getting tired of this game and the people I have the misfortune of getting as teammates. Rito plz, am begging you.  Fix the honor system or implement a better system for punishing players. I wasn&#039;t around when the player&#039;s tribunal was around, but that sounds infinitely better than the automated robot throwing people who banter into concentration camps at with honor level 1.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-28T01:53:25.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand how this can be devastating especially with honour not tracking your progress, but we have to remember that you are punished for being toxic, its never right to be toxic because someone else is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Resolution","date":"2018-04-28T04:11:58.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have fun being unable to participate in Clash or get any end season rewards. \n\nHonestly, that was 30 minutes out of your life that will potentially have multiple consequences on your gaming experience all season long. It may seem like a good idea to retaliate at the moment, but once that game is over you will most likely never see those players again.\n\nThe moment you start flaming other players (Even if they deserve it) you become just as much as a problem to the community as they are. The chat restrictions in place to prevent people from lashing out at teammates. It also takes multiple games for the first chat ban to kick in, so my guess this isn't your first offense. \n\nIt's very easy to blame another for your own actions, but this is 100% on you.","replies":[]}]}
