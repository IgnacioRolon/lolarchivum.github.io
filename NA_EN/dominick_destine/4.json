You can review these terms at http://www.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\n&gt;Due to the severity of this violation, your League of Legends account has been banned until Thu Feb 22 22:22:22 UTC 2700\n&gt;If you have any questions, contact our Player Support team at https://support.leagueoflegends.com/home\n&gt;Riot Games Player Support\n\nNow further evidence (when the zero-to-permaban was finally rescinded);\n\n>Shaky Today at 11:03\n&gt;Hi there, Looking at the account I am not seeing any signs of compromise or unauthorized access. **This ban was placed on your account due to rude behavior on the account**. . It seems insulting others, being passive aggressive, and having a negative attitude is a common thing in your games. This kind of behavior is looked down upon in the community and that is why action was taken. However, **we like to give players the chance to improve behavior before they are permanently banned. Since that is the case I will reduce your ban to two weeks**. Please take this suspension seriously seriously because if this behavior continues, a permanent ban will be placed on the account. As long as this type of stuff doesn&#039;t happen again, you won&#039;t need to worry.\n\nThis was the final response I got when the permaban was rescinded after several back-and-forths with support.\n\nRiot Tantram however [Yes, I am naming names even if that gets me punished] said the following;\n\n>You were never hit with a perma-ban. You were hit with a &#039;shield&#039; ban. \n&gt;You were punished by MANUAL REVIEW. **You were also given a 14-day ban, NOT a perma-ban**.\n&gt;You didn&#039;t get a &#039;zero-to-permaban&#039; like you post.\n&gt; [etc.]\n\nNotice how what Riot Tantram has told me is completely at odds with the original facts of the case. None of these facts are doctored and I am positive Riot has a record of all of this that coincides with the information I have provided. \n\nSo I want to know two things;\nWhy have I been lied to ?\nand\nWhy was my punishment so extreme if my toxicity was not worthy of a zero-to-permaban punishment?\nDO NOT TELL ME THAT IT WASN&#039;T THAT BECAUSE THAT&#039;S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS BASED ON EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE AVAILABLE.... I say this without irony, exaggeration or dramatic effect; Riot&#039;s betrayal completely changed me as a person, I trusted them so completely.... \n\nHere are the chat logs that were provided to me long after the original incident occurred;\n[6:42] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): Come on ziggs...\n[6:52] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): you were WAAAAY overextended\n[10:55] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): Far tankier than I expected.\n[12:11] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): Wukong, you have ZERO damage.\n[12:21] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): Just going to farm, bot has no damage, top has no damage, mid is basically afk.\n[12:44] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): counter ignoring janna\n[13:27] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): I did 65% HP of Galio&#039;s max HP\n[13:28] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): you did noithing\n[13:50] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): you have no damage\n[21:16] Dominick Destine (Evelynn): Yes.

There's some life advice from an actual adult as I think you're somewhat young and naive, based on your constant hunt for pity and sympathy. The older someone gets, the less they do that.
