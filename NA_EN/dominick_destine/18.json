I KNEW RIOT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEMSELVES.\nThis is the third time that I am chat restricted that has led to me making this thread , except this time there were a few games in between. It was meant to lull me into a false sense of security so I would stop updating the last thread, but I will not, they were wrong. I will continue dauntlessly.\n\nWhy the fiddle sticks does Riot have it in for me anyway?\n\n\n\nEdit:\nTo clarify; I do not claim to be innocent, only that the punishment is disproportionately harsh for my crime. Permanent chat restriction is far too severe for what I have committed.","replies":[]}
