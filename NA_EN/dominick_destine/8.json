If you teleport from A to B your actual relative velocity never actually increases. Same with time travel, getting there before you leave requires negative time, but from an actual intuitive standpoint you're never necessarily moving faster than perhaps an average walking pace. Aurelion Sol you could definitely make an argument for, though I've not heard any specifics on that.\n\nOtherwise if you count Valor, either he or Shyvana is likely the fastest that I can think of given that they both literally fly. Not sure if a bird outpaces a dragon, but I'd imagine probably so. I may be forgetting someone though, I haven't really run all the way through the list.\n\nI suppose you'd also have to clarify, by fastest do you mean fastest distance traveller or fastest burst of speed? in the latter case perhaps someone like Yi/Kat would take the cake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-08-30T13:18:20.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if we exclude champions who can teleport, bend time, and have essentially space bending powers.
