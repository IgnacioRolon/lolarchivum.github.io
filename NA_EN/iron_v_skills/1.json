Point and click Q easy to hit w and you can't miss E if you are in their face. \nAlthough it might take skill to be FAKER level, doing her combo is not skill, it's easy and cheap. Same with yasuo he is easy to play. To play him at a god-tier level that's skill. Picking up a champ that's already easy enough isn't skill. \n\nRight now leblanc 1 shot is so straight forward its easy, maybe doing other things requires skill but not her combo. I'd say she does require great \"skill\" in the higher elo where things are harder. But that doesn't me she is hard to play at lower elos or hard to perform is braindead combo. You can't say a champion is difficult when you aren't doing the difficult part, you are doing the easy part.\n\nIf it looked like you needed more than 2 brain cells to execute her 1 shot i'd be fine with it.But it's the easiest combo.YOU NEED FLASH TO COUNTER IT, unless you have a dash or something to get out.  Lastly I get that she is an assassin but when she is fed you can't make 1 mistake or half your health if not all gets deleted. While throughout the whole game lb can make 50 mistakes and take it all back with a push of a button, Her passive or her ult and if all fails she will probably still kill you since her damage is absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Cravin Ur Cheeks","date":"2018-11-11T07:57:05.240+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":9,"body":"shes easily the most braindead ap champ and one of the most op ones. oh let me press w and r insta kill you then press them again to teleport escape with nothing you can do.. oh not to mention the shaco clone because of course right.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-11-11T12:21:24.900+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":10,"body":"Peak Circlejerk Boards on this comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-11-11T16:09:59.990+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"Volibear is the most braindead tank champ and one of the most op ones (don’t ask for stats). oh let me press q and e and run at you then bite your hp bar to zero with nothing you can do (kiting doesn’t count).. oh not to mention the mundo ult on his passive because of course right.","replies":[{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2018-11-11T17:57:53.711+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're being sarcastic, but it's disgusting to compare  Volibear's counter-play to Leblanc's even with sarcasm.
