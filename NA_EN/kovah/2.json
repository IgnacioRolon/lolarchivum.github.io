I play a LOT of Renekton jungle. Is he the BEST JUNGLER EVER? No. I never said he was. But he is viable, and I play it a ton. I am good with Renekton and ALWAYS do well when I jungle him. I get harassed every single time I pick it. People think I don&#039;t even want to win because of it. What? How does that even make sense. I play this game for fun while also enjoying the competitive side of it. That being said, I like trying to win WITH Renekton jungle. If it was an actual troll pick, like Varus jungle, then I understand because thats just simply not viable. But its not. I actually think he does amazing in the jungle.
