Just came off a chat restriction (I&#039;m not toxic but I defend myself when people are being toxic to me which = me being toxic according to lol). I take 30 seconds at fountain at the start of the game while 3 of my teammates invade. All 3 of them die. I get blamed for them all dying, and proceed to get harassed for the ENTIRE game. Kept telling them how rude/immature they are, to calm down because its a game, and that them being toxic makes other people not even care to play that game anymore. Him and his friend both reported me at the end of the game. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get some sort of punishment because riot doesn&#039;t care what the other people had said to you, they just look at your chat logs and assume you are being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-11-05T16:42:35.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"they don't assume you being toxic, the system verifies that you are toxic. \n\nfalse reports get thrown out, and counter attacking them is not defending yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Kovah","date":"2016-11-05T16:48:46.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not counter\"attacking\" anything.

IDK, doesn&#x27;t seem fair to me.\n\nI'm so glad that you're a nice person and I support the fact that you stand up for your teammates. However, you need to do it diplomatically, both when defending your teammates' actions and your own. Think about what you're saying; would a report for that be considered legitimate by the system?\n\nI honestly don't know how you respond to your angry teammates and I don't want to make any assumptions, so how about we roleplay?\n\nIf I were to say about your teammate, \"ashe so stupid cant group[ to teamfight]\" \"pushes top instead\" \"go back to bronze ashe,\" how would you respond to me? (I said I was a diamond smurf at the beginning of the game, and am doing appropriately well.)\n\nOr if I said, \"kalista picks trash champion and expects to win gg\" and then the Kalista goes 0/3 in lane, \"kalista feed twitch and annie lol gg\" \"kalista trash,\" how would you respond? (I'm 0/2 in lane.)\n\nOr, I spam missing pings on your corpse and say, \"f**​​​*ing retard\" \"so bad,\" what do you say to me? (I'm the jungler and have been farming the whole game.)\n\nOr, you're top lane and I, the mid laner, get dived and say, \"TP YOU IDIOT WE COULD HAVE TURNED.\" How do you respond to your grey-screened teammate? (This is my first death.)\n\nOr, \"I hope you and your family get cancer Ahri. you've ruined this ranked game.\" \"Ahri would score less on the IQ test than a vegetable.\" \"Oh look, Ahri's dead again. Piece of f**​​*ing sh*t.\" What do you say to me? (I'm the jungler and I haven't died yet. Ahri's only kill is because of me.) (You can be Ahri or your teammate can be Ahri.)\n\nI know you're not not under any in-game stress, but I want to hear what your response would **honestly** be to one of those situations (or all of them, if you want). Also, if you're going to do one, respond to the one that would make you the most angry.\n\n---\n\nKnow that when people act maliciously towards you or your teammates, they're bringing themselves down. If you respond honorably, you keep your dignity. If you act maliciously back, you're bringing yourself down to their level. Maybe you're not quite as mean, but you're still being mean.\nDon't let these people bring you down to their level. You're the better person than them, but you need to _show_ that by not letting them get to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Kovah","date":"2016-11-06T11:41:01.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know those are all different situations for the most part, but honestly I usually just respond the same way each time:\n\n> Or, I spam missing pings on your corpse and say, \"f*​​​ing retard\" \"so bad,\" what do you say to me?

That's you being assertive, not aggressive. That's the kind of response I would give too.\n\n> None of what people say makes me upset in itself, what bothers me is the fact that people are even saying it in the first place, you feel me?\n\nTotally understand. It doesn't help from a gameplay standpoint to flame teammates; are people expecting that their teammates will do _better_ when insulted and put down? It also doesn't look good on them as people for getting angry in a computer game and attacking other people. Like, can they not just be nice people? It's so much more fun to be in a team with friendly people and maybe get an honor or two after the game. \nAlso, after thoses responses I got, I'll say that you're not bringing yourself down to their level.
