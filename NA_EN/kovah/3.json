Just like, 20% or so. The reason I say this is that it offers more counterplay in almost any situation. The longer a fight lasts, the more likely the better player will be to win the fight. I don&#039;t care how good you are, getting 100 to 0ed by an assassin as an adc is kind of unfun. Or as a tank, building 5 or 6 straight up tank items and getting melted in seconds. IDK if im the only one who has noticed the damage creep as of late.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I mean I shouldn't die to a team composed of AD champs that quickly with the build.

I often enough have seen a 6 item fulltank shyvana die within ~2 sec from full health after ulting into the backline.\nIf you look at winrates, you'll notice that all tanky dps champs have a rather low winrate atm, and those that look stilld decent have a massive earlygame winrate and drop hard as the game progresses, since 'tanking' doesn't work later on.\nEither you have nice hard cc on your engage so your team can follow up befor your opponents have the opportunity to focus you down, or you are usless outside of splitpushing, and the main reason for that is the overabundance of damage in the game.\n\nAlso, the major issue with the high damage right now is that makeing any mistake ends with an instantanious death, which results in a low-(or even no-) risk meta where playing as save as possible is the key. This makes for rather stale and boring games, as well as the tank meta top that we see in proplay.

It's so hard to set up proper vision with no stealthwards to buy, nerfed trinkets and nerfed wardstone.\nAs a result, you nearly always have to expect a gank as you never really have enough vision, which means you either play champs that have rediculous escapes(hello ekko, again) or you sit underneath your tower and bite your time, especially vs junglers like kindret or nida that can easily solo kill you if your dare to get close to the middle of your lane.\n\nAl this contributs alot to the current snowbally feeling of the game.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"NakedGranny","date":"2016-05-31T18:54:35.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">If you look at winrates, you'll notice that all tanky dps champs have a rather low winrate atm, and those that look stilld decent have a massive earlygame winrate and drop hard as the game progresses, since 'tanking' doesn't work later on.\n\nThat's not because tank champs/gear are underpowered, it's that assassins are too powerful.\n\nAD assassins get all the benefits of their items stacked into their abilities while also stacking it into their auto-attacks which they get no cooldowns or resource gates on. Marksmen also benefit from this specific situation, but they're held back by a general lack of free \"escape\" and defense abilities (for example, Zed can just nope out of a fight at any time and Yas has Windwall and basically infinite dashes with a huge area knockup and free shields on demand).
