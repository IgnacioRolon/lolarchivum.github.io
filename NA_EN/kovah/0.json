I don't play the akali/kats etc. Lately its been udyr/sion/viktor, things like that. I never had a problem in plat, always able to carry my team even if all 4 were not doing well. I cannot do this in silver. was 8-2 as Udyr last game at the end of lane phase. I had fantastic map presence but it did not matter, all 4 teamates fed, top malphite ended lane with 10 kill somehow, and I proceeded to get gangbanged at every teamfight because I was the only threat. NOTHING I could do at that point. I even tried to split push but they were able to easily 3v4 my team and come 2v1 me. There are a lot of bad silver players who deserve to be where they are, not denying this, but for the people struggling to get out, I completely understand the frustration.\n\nNot only is the skill a factor, but the attitude of people down here is atrocious. I find it so hard to keep steam from bursting through my eye sockets because of the things people say. One person will say something, and then EVERYONE is screaming at everyone else, and they no longer play but just focus on typing to each other. \n\nCould I play a champion that is designed to stomp people in lower elo? like Kat, well yea sure... but it is frustrating and a little boring to have to play certain champions to hard carry. Basically, I am not saying im stuck and cant get out, but any standard good play will not carry you out of this. You either have to stick to your guns and play 30+ games with a pub stomper, or get extremely lucky. I feel extremely bad for the people who are having a hard time getting out.\n\nEdit : So my first game of the day today, I decided to play nasus. I won my lane even though I was against Lissandra (a hard counter for nasus) and proceeded to help team with every dragon, and still did not lose my tower by the end of the game. Our corki got pulled by enemy blitz 3 teamfights in a row. We had a morg mid and needless to say in a 4v5 with no adc and a morg mid we had no damage. I could tank 3-4 of them for 15 seconds or so but, it didn't matter. Corki spams \"I CANT DO ANYTHING, YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA, I GET PULLED BY BLITZ AND JUST DIE EVERY TIME, OR I GET ULTED BY WUKONG\". I tried to tell him to stay in the back so he doesn't get pulled and wukong wont be able to reach him. Well it didn't matter, he got pulled at baron, they stole baron then aced us. My hands were tied, couldnt give advice, and couldn't carry any more. I had the most damage dealt AND taken on the team. My point is, unless you are playing certain roles/champions, the game is uncarryable. Why should I not be allowed to play Nasus top? Sure, I can, but I just lose with nothing I can do to stop it. My team would have capitalized on how tanky I was and how I was zoning their backline every fight. These players refuse to adapt to thegame and listen to advice.\n\nI realized the adaptability is a huge part of what makes players good. In higher elo, if one strategy/style of play did not work in a teamfight, they will change tactics until something works. In silver elo, the players will NOT change. They will do the same thing, every single fight. I guess that is just something you have or you don't have, being able to adapt that is.","replies":[{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2015-02-10T16:03:28.146+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"You actually do carry quite well on a lot of champs. You have good scores on Sion, Xin, Yi, Hec, Skarner, Riven, and Renekton. You tend to lose out when playing ranged+Udyr and Diana. For ranged, you basically die too much. Part of that may be lack of supporting teammates, but even so, your death count copmared to kills+assists is a tad high for ranged champions. Might have more success carrying if you worry a tad more about keeping your self alive. \n\nUdyr you tend to do really well early(sometime insanely well) and then contributing nothing for the rest of the match. Take a look at the match you mention in the OP. You start out 8-2, rush Warrior>Trinity, and do the least damage(to champs) and had the lowest kill participation in the entire game. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Kovah,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3gaLkn6Y,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-10T02:45:21.117+0000)\n>\n> You know that is another thing I forgot to mention. People will NOT LISTEN to you. Advice, calls, builds etc. it doesn't matter. You are a noob and they are a god. I have had so many people tell me to \"shut the fuck up\" when I simply gave them a piece of advice.\n\nAs far as that goes:\n\n1) Frozen Mallet is really gimping your Udyr. The only defensive stat it gives is HP, which is the worst defensive stat for Udyr. (Aside from \"enough HP to not insta-die\") And you get it after Warrior+Trinity, you do not need the small damage it offers. So your basically getting the slow, which again, with Trinity, you kinda don't need.\n\n2) AP Varus is fun, and you get decent-good scores. But you really do gimp your team with the pick in a lot of cases. Your damage is almost entirely absorbed by the opposing team's frontline. Look through your AP Varus games, even when you crush your lane opponent, they end up doing either competative damage, or more damage than you.\n\n3) Your warding is bad. Really really bad. Ward-score tends to be a bit biased towards people who play support (or Lee) a lot, but even so, your rank in the bottem 3% of all players for warding. Your Udyr game you placed literally zero wards. You have a Nasus game where you sat on a yellow trinket for 40 minutes and placed 2 wards total.\n\nOn that note: split-pushing, especially when you are fed, is so much more effective when you have ward coverage. Your team can't do anything but sit at tower if they learn there are 3 people going after you only when you are dying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-02-10T03:37:45.435+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate playing as pubstomper champions.

Not-so-small-side-note: I've had a much 'simpler,' or shall I say, 'normal,' time, climbing through silver, in previous seasons vs current.  I also main jungle/sup, but can dominate a mid/top/adc game if necessary, due to the versatile champs that I main. Now, I certainly don't claim diamond-status, but it's been proven, time and again, that I can throw down in high gold/low plat teams w/o being carried, at all.  60% of low/mid silver games have people in it, that are first time ranked (post placements) or fresh off the bronze boat of hell, waving their troll banners.  I thought that this would balance out, perhaps, as the weeks went on, but it hasn't at all lol I feel placement requirements, for new players, has a higher handicap, than previously, and though I like the new promo-system (so many seasons have I been on game S1: 2/5 and dropped back to 0 lp, or lower div, from troll matches) there are just SO many people who flame harder than the Olympic Torch, that I can't even get back to a promo match.  I have literally have had to walk afk's off the ledge of no return, SO many times, because kids are arguing, to the extreems, with each other. There's been dozens of matches where we've had to play 3v5 (not skirmishes, but the ENTIRE game) due to afk's/trolls at 0-5 minz, sitting in base.  Now, some, of said 3v5's, we actually won (most exciting games to date, actually. Wukong + Yasuo wombo combo + 1 support mage ftw) but ffs can a brudda just gtfo of Silver already, so I can actually enjoy the game and progress! Please, feel free to check stats, I certainly don't mind research and positive criticism.  I'm not here to just vent, but this post caught my attention, and I had to support it, because the struggle is truly real.  Cheers all. GL to those in a similar situation. I've felt your pain for the past few seasons, now, and it is truly frustrating. Congrats, to those that have enjoyed a good promo and breached the Golden shores of Narnia.

If you do a good enough job with peel and cc then you will carry. You will create enough opportunities to let your carries carry. Also most cc and peel is extremely easy to notice and take advantage of as long as your teammates are Bronze 1 or higher.... \n\nJust saying I have had games where both carries are 1/9 and the rest of the team is good enough to win. It's not impossible. You just have to adjust your play with bad players. For example if you use thresh hook and jump to the enemy carry and start your combo but your adc doesn't react. Don't do it again. Some carries need their hand held and as the jungler and support that is your role.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2015-02-10T03:24:19.343+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain.

I let people rant on here though because we've all been there.  I've had a lot of bad games in the last two days to nonsense and afkers.  I know that after having it happen repeatedly you just want to vent.\n\nWhat makes carrying hard in low elo is not can you take out enemy champs.  That part is easy.  It's that low elo players don't do what you expect them to do (and I'm not even like gold 1 or anything previously).  They will go for baron at odd times, suddenly retreat from team fights when they get scared leaving you up front, or push team fights with a missing person and low hp.  So, it helps to pick champs who have steamroll capability.  That way you can at least take out 2-3 people and hope that the rest of your team is good enough to mop up.\n\nSometimes there are just bad games or sometimes people feed too much even doing that.  Basically you're hoping that if you play well enough your good games will outweigh your bad games (unless you get bad luck of the draw and have a bunch of afkers in a row, which does happen).  For example, I had a game recently that I went something like 11/5 and by end of game was like 16/10 and we lost because too much of our team fed and the enemy team had a ton of cc.  I could usually jump in and kill someone, but then I got jumped on and cc'ed for like 5 seconds straight with everyone focusing me.\n\nYou just do what you can, learn from your mistakes (and wins), and try your best.\n\nWhen you're seriously on tilt just play team builder or find another game to play for a while.  Better yet take a walk or don't play games at all.  It sounds obvious, but it helps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A KissLike Smile","date":"2015-02-10T13:11:00.536+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet when a person who has only ever been in Silver (due to placements) claims it's impossible to get out they are blamed and told they obviously belong there, regardless of how well they play.

The enemy is better, more clever, and more mechanically skilled. Carrying in Plat is much harder because the people you face will be much better. In Bronze your team might (will) choose to take Baron at the dumbest times, but think of all the times you did that and *got away* with it because the other team didn't bother to check.\n\nIt doesn't get *easier* in higher ELO. I have a few friends in Bronze. They all claim that Silver is easier. In my experience? Not particularly. You have less trolls on your team, yes, but you also have less trolls on the the other team. Your team feeds less and the other team feeds less. People who ROFLstomp as Akali or Yi run into a brick wall in higher MMR when the other team just stuns and instabursts them instead of running away in blind panic.\n\nThe level of challenge, the skill of both sides, and the lack of trolls tends to make games a lot more *fun*, more competitive, but definitely not easier. The idea that high ELO games are *easier* is a myth created by wishful thinking. This is my experience with Silver versus Bronze, and I'll bet the change from Platinum to Bronze is even more pronounced.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that you can carry better with a good team is sort of an *ipso ergo facto* fallacy. Obviously, if you have the full support of your team and your team doesn't make huge, glaring errors, you're going to do well, provided you aren't a moron (and judging by your scores, you don't appear to be a moron :P). But likewise, you doing well in lower ELO is also partly the result of your *enemies* being less skilled and not helping whoever is carrying on *their* team.\n\n**TL;DR**: Higher leagues tend to have *better* games, not *easier* ones. Saying you could carry in Plat is what everyone says they can do. The reality is that people are in Bronze or Silver for a reason. If you say you can carry against a team of people as good as you, but not against a team pretty inferior to you, then you might want to reexamine your assumptions.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-11T01:35:47.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He clearly stated that he carries game's in plat regularly with non steamroll champions.\n\nI am assuming he got put in silver thanks to the reset, and now he HAS to play steamroll champions to get out.\n\nThat is not fun to him, and takes away from the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-03-29T15:21:23.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The OPs post is still true. \n\nThe kind of champions and tactics you need to carry silver is completely different.
