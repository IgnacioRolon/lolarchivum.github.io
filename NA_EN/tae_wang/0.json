HOWEVER, there are times when the screen simply freezes but I can still hear the background sounds. In fact when i click around randomly. i move according to where i clicked despite the screen still frozen. Usually if i wait a good 10-15 seconds, the game returns to normal. However in game that is very frustrating, and i find that tabbing in and out of the game resets the screen. I was wondering if my graphics card is simply too shitty or this is a problem league could resolve.","replies":[{"poster":"Pemphigoid","date":"2017-01-27T00:49:45.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having this same problem. The game runs perfectly on my 2013 MacBook Pro, but it's unplayable on my 2016 MBP with touchbar, which has an upgraded dedicated graphics card. Really hard to understand. The only \"solution\" I've found is to put it in borderless or windowed mode, but that just causes issues with my mouse movement. It's really frustrating and I'm hoping for a fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"snoochyp","date":"2018-02-17T17:21:23.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,  \n\nI have the same issue. I found a fix for it. In your system Preferences set your screen resolution to the middle scaled option. I have had no issues since doing this. \n\nFor some reason even when I set the resolution in the game the Mac is still trying to scale it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PandaGank","date":"2017-10-15T01:42:47.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.

Some of those players reported that the following steps were able to resolve the issue for them. I'd like you to give them a go and let me know if they also worked for you.\n\n**1.** The first step is to disable a feature called **Hot Corners**, as it's been contributing to freezes and has caused erratic mouse movements in some cases. [**This guide**](http://osxdaily.com/2016/08/10/disable-hot-corners-mac/) should help you complete the disable properly.\n\n**2.** Next, we'll need to complete a reset of your configuration files, as previous settings from another computer can sometimes cause conflict or issues in these files. You'll want to log into the League Client then complete the reset with the following steps:\n\n>- Select your 'Applications' folder on your Dock\n- Select 'Open in Finder'\n- Right Click on 'League of Legends'\n- Select 'Show Package Contents'\n- Select 'Contents'\n- Select 'LoL'\n- Delete the folder named 'Config' (Right Click, then select 'Move to trash', then empty your trash)\n\nAfter deleting the Config folder, I recommend hopping into a custom match to confirm the change went through and to test if your symptoms still pop up. Please let me know if this resolved the issue for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tae Wang","date":"2017-01-27T10:45:15.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for replying so quickly however just like.
