By changing this banning system the company can have way more players and there fore make more money but that is just my opinon.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-11T06:56:54.607+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"This idea is suggested on Boards _very frequently_ and the answer every time is that the punishment system used to give out stacking chat restrictions as well as multiple suspensions, and the result was that players who couldn't chat just inted/trolled instead while people with more than one suspension just kept on getting them without ever reforming.
