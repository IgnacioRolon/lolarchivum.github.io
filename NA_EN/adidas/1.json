Actually she is a lower % as far as how often she is suppose to talk compared to base Ashe, but what I think is happening is I added more hooks for more VO to trigger to spells and other things...this is now feeling way too chatty. Revisiting her VO trigger % should help with that amount of VO that is kicking off!\n\nThanks again for bringing this up, this helps a ton!","replies":[{"poster":"MiIf Fortune","date":"2016-08-22T23:50:06.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey sound bear, random question but its bothered me so for long. Why does project fiora randomly have 1 line in her vo that all her other skins dont? \"Let them eat swords!\". Ive found this very weird since release and i see no explanation why her and leona have some extra vo other skins dont :(. One last thing, thoughts on maybe making older champions not repeat their lines 3 times in a row? ive been playing nunu recently and i think his voice is really cute but hearing \"lets make tracks!\" twice-times in a row is not good :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackfootedfox","date":"2016-08-21T19:38:00.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"T.T but I enjoy chatty champions, hence my love for the Sol {{champion:136}} \n\nAlso I thought Procject Ashe VO wasn't too chatty","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-21T14:33:10.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sharing that's interesting I didn't know that's how VOs were called , based on a percentage chance","replies":[]}]}]}
