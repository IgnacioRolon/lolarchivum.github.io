So let&#039;s check out how Riot&#039;s support tickets work in order to SUPPORT the player. I wrote KYS which I meant as &#039;&#039;Keep your salt/Keep your saltiness&#039;&#039; But Riot won&#039;t look in the game to see that it&#039;s taken out of context and just permabanned me.\r\n\r\nHeres the conversation after I got in touch with a support &#039;&#039;Specialist&#039;&#039; I hid the name since yeah why not.\r\nTo make things easier I just write 1 for the supporter and 2 for me.\r\n\r\n1) https://gyazo.com/5cda8a72cd936a860d56c4b04aa7980a \r\n2) https://gyazo.com/20c566016593f94a60ae3ba12dc8dfc4 \r\n1) https://gyazo.com/f7a4cd58e494301ccb35c1a3ca673d1a \r\n2) https://gyazo.com/3a812092e90feec7bba9e01b04089330 \r\n1) https://gyazo.com/ece4b61270dd0c5cf663f80056ae9d15 \r\n2) https://gyazo.com/6be1d979f590bbe7419e694ec829b06c (Pardon my english here, had class)\r\n1) https://gyazo.com/0df61aafa6fa3e2949ec704a96e196bf\r\n\r\nAfter that, the supporter ended the conversation. Is this called fairness? I haven&#039;t been doing any real flaming since then, but I&#039;ve used the term &#039;&#039;Kys&#039;&#039; in a lot of games to toxic people but this is the first time I got punished for it? So I just kept writing it to toxic people and I didn&#039;t see any people being mad at me for writing it so I really thought people knew it was &#039;&#039;Keep your saltiness&#039;&#039; But oh boy was I wrong. After a flamer kept on raging at our team for all reasons possible this is how the chat looked from MY writing perspective only.\r\nChatlog:\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: u ok?\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: report urgot\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: rank kata?\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kys\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kys\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kys\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kys\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kys\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kys\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: ask yourself\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: didnt see\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: ;)\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: didnt see\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: np\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: UrTrash\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: Ur trash\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: urgot saved zilean\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: report\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: ll\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: Kat you fed me like hell why talk\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: I hit 100% Q&#039;s on you\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: lul\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: xd\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: Oh yea I still hit 100% hooks\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: 5-13\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: If I played a one of my mains I would prob be done winning already\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: I gave you a chanc e\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: and took blitz\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: see your adc\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: see our adc\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: does not make her build shit\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: kata you are bad\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: idk if you dont know it\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: 15 deaths and a dream\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: Kata whats your rank? Silver 1?\r\nEasyDieEasyPie: 18 deaths and a dream\r\n\r\nSo the most toxic thing in this game would be when I said Kata was really bad but is that considered flaming? I guess I take the chat log from the start. First few mins of the game Urgot got mad at our jungler, where I asked if he was okay, he began to flame on me as well and I said report urgot. The game went on for like 10 mins. I then asked Katarina&#039;s rank, cause she was feeding/having a bad game. Urgot then bursts out into flames when he got ganked by their jungler, and every time he wrote something I replied with &#039;&#039;Keep your saltiness&#039;&#039; This kept going for good 5 mins. He then asked why I was so bad so I replied with ask yourself. Then Urgot got ganked close to my lane (I played mid lane) He asked me why I was blind and spammed pings in my face. The last really toxic thing was when I wrote &#039;&#039;UrTrash/Ur Trash&#039;&#039; This began when Urgot wrote &#039;&#039;Bitchcrank&#039;&#039; to me, so I wrote &#039;&#039;UrTrash&#039;&#039; The rest is kinda kata flaming her own team when she is like 3-18 or something close to that.\r\n\r\nSo, in all fairness, is this enough for a permaban or wouldn&#039;t a warning be enough? If I got a warning that the word &#039;&#039;Kys&#039;&#039; is not acceptable by any means I would never have used the shortened sentence? Wouldn&#039;t it be better as they say to &#039;&#039;Educate&#039;&#039; players as they call it when they permaban people? Why wouldn&#039;t they listen to me at all, is it because you can&#039;t get a wrongful permaban revoked? (Maybe not a wrong mute idk how toxic you need to be for that?) Whats your thoughts on it? Oh and if you are wondering if the other flamers in that game got banned, I can tell you nope they did not.\r\n\r\nThe game stats:\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/6eb0f2bb407e38844fd6c0cc3718d900\r\n\r\nSo the open question for all forums readers, is it fair to get banned for a word you used out of context and because of a misunderstanding? I do not really wan&#039;t to &#039;&#039;Cheese&#039;&#039; it and say anything thats not important like my hours, money spent bla bla. But any thoughts? What would you do if you had this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-01T15:54:47.136+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know damn well what you used it to mean.\n\nIt is not bad customer support to leave you banned.
