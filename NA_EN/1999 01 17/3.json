Most AP jungles switched out their Magus for something far more useful later one to begin with. Magus was a piece of crap and buffing it would've made AP junglers too strong because it's 2250g and huge AP on a 2250 item is TOO scary, especially since they're nerfing Zhonya's and Luden's to 100 while buffing others to 80 finally, yet still making them more expensive to compensate for more AP. This item is GOOD and with the buffs coming up, it will CONTINUE to be good while making the AP Ez's a little less common since it won't proc Luden's.\n\nYou guys all need to take a chill pill and realize how garbage Magus was to begin with.
