Sometimes all it takes is a brisk walk or another activity to cooldown and try again in an hour.  If you have two rage-filled games back to back that's a sign that you should take a break from league for the day.

Riot has said on several occasions that permanent ban situations are reviewed by a person.\n\nThe ban hammer falling on a first offense is rare.  But Riot has said that in extreme cases, they will do so.  There was a post yesterday from a player upset that they were banned for only one incident.  Riots response informed the player that they violated all three categories, slurs, harassment, and death threats, and was deemed removable.  The OP must have done the same and warranted the same.\n\nIt's too bad the OP's shame didn't kick in earlier and keep them from even thinking that typing out such crap was a good idea.

You know you messed up and you even admit that you messed up so why waste time trying to shift the blame to others instead of just trying to improve your behavior for the better? I've been active in the LoL boards community for years, and the majority of people who try to make up excuses like \"Riot caters to children who can't handle my insults directed at them\" are the ones who have been punished. It's not that people can't handle being called bad names, it's that we shouldn't have to put up with your name calling and insults whenever things don't go your way: that's what a young child does (young children and immature people who refuse to accept the fact that their poor behavior wasn't acceptable).\n\nYes being trollled constantly is annoying, I've experienced it myself. However, just because someone else is being a jerk doesn't give you the right to act like a jerk yourself. From the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\nI'll keep this one simple: those other players in your game that you thought were worse are probably also banned. Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on.\n\n>We strongly believe that it is not OK to retaliate. If a player refuses to cooperate and says something negative, then players should ignore the player and report them after the game. Players can ignore or mute players by pressing the “Mute” button on the Scoreboard [when you hit TAB] in the game. \n\n>If a player retaliates and says something bad back, then the two of you have made a negative experience for potentially the other 8 players in the game. Rarely do teams start working together better when players begin fighting back—great games only happen when players cooperate and don’t make the issues even worse by fighting back and forth.\n\n\nIf you've had a string of bad games in a row then, as hard as it may be to do, consider taking a break to cool off and calm down.
