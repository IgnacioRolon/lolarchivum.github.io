I am hoping that someone can help me out. \r\n\r\nThis did not start till the 7.1 update. It never happened prior to that. \r\n\r\nBut whenever I open the LoL Beta Client and if I click outside of it to browse the internet or go into iTunes, the screen goes black for a second. Almost like it is changing resolutions. This happens at all three different resolutions you can set the Client to. I even found that if I hide the taskbar, I can make 1920x1080 appear and I thought that would have done it, but it still continues to do that. \r\n\r\nWhenever I am in-game, I can quickly switch between my desktop and game without any disruption. \r\n\r\nI have a BENQ Zowie XL2411 if that would make a difference but I highly doubt it. I tried researching this all over and could not find an answer. \r\n\r\nAlso to add, if I use the Legacy Client, this does not happen. When I am in the home screen, I can easily switch between any program on my computer without my display going black. So I have no idea why it is happening on the Beta Client.\r\n\r\nThank you and I hope that someone can figure this out for me.","replies":[{"poster":"T2JGPfs1tx","date":"2017-06-06T19:51:33.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just ran into this issue with the exact same monitor and fixed it by uninstalling the benq/zowie display pilot software. I hope this solves your issue or anyone who comes across the same issue. It's not a LoL issue as it happened to me in CS:GO as well. It's an issue with the monitor software.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T23:45:39.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which browser are you using?
