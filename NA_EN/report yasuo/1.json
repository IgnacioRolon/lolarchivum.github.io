Its not that League of legends is a bad game. Its honestly a great game. But know what else is a great game? CSGO. Its playerbase has started to die. Sure its plagued by issues like cheaters, but this doesnt change the fact that at some point all good things must come to an end.\n\nNow you say dead. But Dead can mean a lot of different things. League of legends boasts over 1 million people playing at any given time. This is a HUGE number. DOTA 2 for example barely gets 450,000 during peak times. So if league were to go down to 300,000 at peak times.. that would be dead in comparison to what it is today.\n\nSo I dont think league will be completely dead by 2022. But I dont think it will still be played at the rate that It is today. By that point im expecting DOTA 2 numbers. Definately by 2030 though Riot will have either moved on to bigger and better things, or go under.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-04-09T00:52:00.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a game being popular for 14 or so years is a pretty big accomplishment.
