How many years later?\r\n\r\nYou guys don't even know what it means. You just slap the tag on someone you don't like, and use it to report people.\r\n\r\n\"report so &amp; so, toxic\"\r\n\r\nDo you know what it means??? It means they're unhealthy for the game.\r\n\r\nGuess what? If you're playing ranked and you have no idea what you're doing - and I mean truly, no idea what you're doing, no concept of timely objectives, where to be and why, think you can afk shove a lane all game and you're doing your part, things like that - then YOU'RE toxic. Not the person flaming you for it. The person whom you ignore, because you refuse to accept your mistakes &amp; learn.\r\n\r\nYOU are the toxic player. NOT the frustrated person who's going to lose a game just because of your actions &amp; not pulling your weight, and basically unintentionally griefing 4 other players every game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeague has this ass-backwards mentality that you're allowed to do WHATEVER you want in-game and it's Ok because it's just a game, but the moment someone gets mad about it, they're the toxic ones.\r\n\r\nObviously some people ARE actually vocally toxic. But I GUARANTEE everyone reading this thread has reported a false-toxic player because YOU, THE READER, were the true-toxic one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nThe most abusive kind of person is the one that can make you lose games AND get you silenced because you became frustrated at them. It's too much power.","replies":[]}
