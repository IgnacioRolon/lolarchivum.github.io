Basing him on the mythical Jackelope would be a great fir for his theme and his bouncy animations already complement the idea. In addition, his Mega Gnar form could give him some full heavier antlers like a moose. I am not a competent artist, but here is a picture of a Jackelope that already looks like Gnar.\nvia Pardoart @Deviantart\nhttp://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/050/c/8/jackalope_by_pardoart-d7741eh.jpg\nFull photo credit here: http://pardoart.deviantart.com/\nCheers, Summoners! :)\n\nEdit: added art link.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-26T00:50:16.050+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"O___O OMGosh.
