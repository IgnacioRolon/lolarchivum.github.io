Why is there only a pool of around 20 champs that the best players will choose in these games?  I realize that the way the game is there is always going to be a pool of champs that are played more than others but it would be awesome if they could get that number up to 30 and even 40+ in the long term.  The games are still entertaining but everyone gets so exicited when a wild card pick comes in because it adds so much variety to the game.  \r\n\r\nIs this something Riot is aware of and working on?","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-30T14:22:48.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, no diversity.

He considers all Champions Viable but when a player comes to him saying they want to play a champion, he asks them what they bring to a comp. If they don't fit the role for the comp the player says that champion fits, he tells them to think on it more.

I mean i can release 10 patches all buffing and nerfing every champs and LCS players will then choose the new buffed champs. \n\nDOTA 2 is still still 10x better than league in terms of balance.
