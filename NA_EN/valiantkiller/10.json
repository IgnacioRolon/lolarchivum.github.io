When you don't have boots you can't just walk away, when you do have boots, he has boots, and again, if you're a champion who needs to be on top of someone to deal damage to them, this falls flat. You can walk away all you want after he's Q'd you, but you can't get out of the range of his E, and you can't fight him back because your abilities are completely unusable.\n\n> \n> E lasts 3s, Silence lasts 1.5s.

This is the exact reason Yasuo's Q duration got cut. It's not about the fact that he can Q me, it's about the fact that he can bully me away from minions by threatening me with that Q for an entire 6 seconds before he decides to Q a minion.\n\n> LMFAO wow, except for just about EVERY CHAMPION. \n> \n> {{champion:103}} Charms you, you EAT everything else for free.\n\nI've been hit by Ahri charm's and still dodged the pull back from her Q. She also has to ult in and LAND the charm on most occasions, unless you just walked into it.\n\n> {{champion:22}} Ults you, you EAT everything else for free.\n\nAshe uses her ult from a far away range to initiate fights for her teammates, and she doesn't have 4 frost shot stacks from her ult, meaning she can't do everything else JUST from her initiation ability.\n\n> {{champion:12}} Combos you, Well u just took everything for free.\n\nAlistar isn't a damage dealer, his combo can be messed up and missed, and you can get away before he uses his entire moveset.\n\n> {{champion:32}} Bandages you, you EAT everything else for free.\nAmumu is a DoT champion, he's not intended to deal a bunch of up-front damage. His Q>R>E is all he has, but it's not gonna kill you, or likely even do close to a large amount of damage. Amumu needs to follow you afterwards to actually kill you, or do any significant damage because of his W. This is nowhere near the same thing.\n\n> {{champion:34}}  Stuns you, you EAT everything else for free.\n> \n\nIt's a slow skillshot stun, that again, has to be landed, and you can get away from Anivia before she has a chance to E you.

Some don&#x27;t even need CC to force you to eat a large part of their combo. \n> \n\nNo, it doesn't. The closest champion that has a CC that can force you to eat their combo is Cassiopeia, and you can counter that with more movement speed to get out of her ground faster. The best thing you can do against Garen is build merc treads, and those only help vs his CC, and do absolutely nothing else to him. It's almost like buying Ninja Tabi to stop an Ahri.\n\n> {{champion:35}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:107}} \n> \n\nIn all of the cases you mentioned, you CAN FIGHT BACK.

If you get hit by Garen Q when he has any kind of lead or is even, you're gonna die, unless you're a tank, because you can't avoid the rest of his kit, and you can't fight back.\n\n> The reason Garen is strong is because of the LACK of knowledge people have about Garen, about their own champion, and about how to play said champion vs a Garen. Not Cause of Garens Kit.\n\nYeah that's why Garen is the number 1 top laner in Korea right now, because people don't know how to play against Garen. I never said he is someone I cannot beat, but his gameplay pattern is not about fighting him, it's about outlasting him and impacting the map elsewhere. He has no interactivity in his kit, because you want to stay away from him at all costs unless he's used his Q, which starts at a measly 8 seconds and only gets smaller. Fighting him is like a fighting a bully with your hands tied behind your back and your feet tied together because of his silence. Sure, the only thing he can do is run at you, Q you, spin a little bit, and ult. But the sad thing is that if he hits his Q and has all of that other stuff up, you're dead, or half health in the laning phase, again without being able to fight back while he backs off to heal. They removed Talon's Silence, they removed Leblanc's silence, they removed Kassadin's silence, they can remove Garen's and give him something else to make it actually worthwhile to interact with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2018-09-01T00:03:41.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your hopelessly lost lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2018-08-31T19:54:44.236+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think specialist like Yorick add a lot to the game.","replies":[]}]}
