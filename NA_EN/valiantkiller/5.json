Please man, they killed Mordekaiser for no reason. They went at him like the men from Office Space went after the printer. I don&#x27;t think ill ever see a champ get curb stomped as hard as Morde. And worse, nobody seems to care.\n\nMordekaiser at least kept most of his abilities recognizable, though they did utterly fuck his gameplay and some of his identity by trying to shoehorn him into botlane for no reason. Aatrox's rework, without looking directly at the character design (which even then looks more like a different Darkin than Aatrox) and just looking at his abilities, most people would think it was some weird rework for Riven or that Riot had decided to try making another new champion that was way too similar in its design and would immediately be overshadowed by what came before it. \n\nMorde, while his rework was fucking terrible, could still be considered Morde because while his abilities were fucked around with in major and horrible ways they still were the same kind of abilities at a very basic level, and his personality and design were already left alone. His passive was still a shield gained from damage, his Q was still an empowered auto, his W was still a magic damage AOE that you could place on people, and his ult was still a DOT ability that brought back spoopy gosts to fight for you. \n\nAatrox on the other hand, had his revive passive moved to his ult and replaced with an empowered auto attack, had his Q, a delayed and short-ranged dash that knocked up enemies in a small area, replaced with a three hit AOE knockup in a small area in front of him, his W, an ability that either gave him empowered autos at the cost of health or increased life steal at the cost of damage, replaced with a single target delayed pull, his E, a thin skillshot that slows enemies and does decent damaged replaced with a short range dash and AD steroid that stores two charges, and his R, which was previously an AOE nuke meant to enable his massive burst and give him extra range and attack speed to make him a more effective duelist was replaced with a movement speed and AD buff that slowly charges his blood well and revives him if he dies. \n\nAt best his ult could be considered a worse version of both his old passive and his old ult, but literally nothing else in new Aatrox's kit is even close to what old Aatrox did, and on top of that they turned a calm and collected war demon who remained in control no matter the situation into another CAPSLOCK MCEDGELORD WHO WON'T SHUT UP, gave him a death wish, and removed all of his most unique features from his character design unless you're ulting. \n\nI wasn't even interested in old Aatrox, but this rework is just insulting.","replies":[{"poster":"Ch1efBeefQueef","date":"2018-07-04T19:14:00.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look man, im not denying that Aatrox had his identity completely 86d but at least he is still playable. Aatrox is actually really strong right now if you know what you are doing with him. Morde has never seen a spec of healthy gameplay since his abomination of a rework. Riot couldn't care less about us Morde players, and when we complained on the forums, people generally ignored us and told us to shut our mouths. I warned everyone about this on the forums way back then that if we dont put our foot down on these terrible decisions, that one day it will be the champ that they love that gets dragged under a freight train. \n\nAnd if you played Morde for any length of time, the flow of his abilities, to their usefulness have been completely ruined by his rework. His mace of spades was removed in favor for an ability that requires you to be in melee range on a champ with no mobility for three autos to fully use. His shield is dogshit unless he is buffing an ally champ or maxes it out for the health. His E cast time is longer and no longer instant with the bulk of its damage completely removed, and his ult is weaker. They also removed all of his ad ratios and bonuses from ghosts because (\"makes no sense to me, better remove it\") which took away creative and strategic game play from him. \n\nWhat was all this for? Because Riot removed spell vamp items like Will of the Ancients and then eventually spell vamp in general and it hurt Morde's performance greatly. All they literally had to do was buff his sustain and he would have been just fine without the god awful rework.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-07-03T19:10:17.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Soda Popinski,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hGusAHLJ,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2018-07-03T15:16:55.984+0000)\n>\n> Worst rework riot ever released?
