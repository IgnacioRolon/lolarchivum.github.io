I have been trying to provide certain feedback since the Yorick rework and have had several moderately popular threads regarding my feedback, but I have never been able to get a Rioter to engage with me about it. \n\nI used to be a dedicated Yorick main before his rework, and he even still remains my highest mastery champion even though I dropped him after his rework.  I think his rework was well made, but it had the side effect of alienating me from the champion.  The issue for me isn't that he changed too much overall in the rework or that he's too weak overall.  I think reworked Yorick is/was objectively stronger, but he has lost essentially all of his role flexibility, which I doubt was an intention of the rework.  \n\nI personally played him mainly as a support and secondarily as a jungler prior to the rework.  I think he could be tweaked relatively easily to regain some of his role flexibility and even have improved strategic decision-making as a top-laner without increasing his net power in top lane.  Yorick has a very small playerbase and is at risk of falling to his pre-rework popularity rate if he is continually neglected.  The statistics seem to show that his play rate tends to only rise in relation to his power budget, suggesting that he isn't sufficiently fulfilling to play for many people or he lacks wide appeal for other reasons.  \n\nBy improving his off-role viability, you can broaden his appeal, allowing him to be appropriately balanced around 49-52% winrate without his popularity dwindling to <1%.  I think that with minimal tweaks, you could keep his top-lane play rate near its current 0.7-1% while aiming to attract an additional 0.3% jungle Yorick playerbase and 0.2% support Yorick playerbase, giving him a healthy and completely reasonable total presence of 1.2-1.5% pick rate.  If this were successful, it would even likely be possible to slightly tune down his power in top lane (let's say 49-51% win rate) without his top lane playerbase declining since having role flexibility makes a champion more desirable to main in total and more total Yorick mains translates into a more stable top lane presence without requiring overtuning.\n\nI can offer insight into what made his support and jungle off-roles attractive before the rework and what specifically changed that makes them feel less playable.  I have specific ideas on how he can be tweaked.  We can chat on the boards or privately somewhere else such as in the game client.  We can keep our discussion between us in case you are concerned about something being taken as committal that Riot will actually implement any changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2018-10-27T04:33:09.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I certainly didn't know you could play him in the jungle or support pre-rework.....and being an ADC main that was once a top main and had to fight against pre-rework Yorick several times......I dread to think of how that lane would have played out.\n\nBut as of now, I can certainly see some appeal for pulling him those other roles. However...\n\nIn the jungle, if they do give him tools to survive it, he may become as oppressive as like season 4-5 Elise, where he can stay so healthy in the jungle, that any time he invades, he would be unmatched. It would also make his ganks super easy, and without much risk involved, which is essential to having a balanced jungler. So, I doubt we'll see him in the jungle due to how much of a potential problem he could be.\n\nAs for support.....I don't see why you can't play him support right now. If you're pretty good at landing his W and E, you could likely play him like a tanky Zyra. Not to mention, since he is melee, his Q should work quite well with Relic Shield. Also, due to how his ult works, you can send it down a lane to help out another laner, or just slow push a lane that doesn't have anyone in it, and go back to being a front line for your team. He has enough utility in his kit that, honestly, I could see him as a support right now. He'd likely be really weak to poke supports, like Brand or Zyra, but against the current hard engage, tanky supports we're constantly seeing right now, he'd pair up against them quite nicely.\n\nJust my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2018-10-28T00:55:58.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was a strong enough jungler that some pro players used him in the jungle. Here is a game with C9 Meteos playing in the jungle:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJghqBuQfkM\n\nHis support was much rarer and more off-meta but it still worked surprisingly well.  Compared to the pre-rework Yorick, his supportive options are extremely lacking.  The rework has introduced all of these cons:\n\n* He no longer has on-demand ghouls (w) to reactively block skill shots.  This was a big part of the learning curve of support Yorick.  It made a good support Yorick a strong counter to Blitzcrank, Thresh, and Morgana by blocking their hooks/bindings.\n\n* His ranged harass potential is much weaker.\n \n* His ultimate does not offer anywhere near equivalent supportive utility to the pre-rework version.  Before the rework, it worked as a pseudo-Zilean-ult that also amplified a carry's strength because the revenant scaled with whoever it was cast on.  This ability was a perfect fit on a support and had a lot of different ways in which it could be used.\n\n* His sustain in bot lane is much less reliable and weaker unless if he constantly pushes the lane by frequently casting Q on minions.  Even disregarding the negative repercussions of being forced to push his lane, it is often too risky for Yorick to expose himself by going into melee range of minions in a duo lane and this is usually all the more true against the kinds of poke lanes where he really needs sustain options.  His Q is balanced around being a spammable last-hitting tool designed with only top lane in mind.  Previously, he could cast his E on an enemy champion to poke and sustain without disrupting the wave flow.  He went from being quite good vs poke lanes to being bad against poke.\n\n* He can hardly use his ghouls at all as a support because they've been pretty strictly gated behind last-hitting and relic shield alone doesn't allow him to last-hit often enough for his kit to function well in laning.  Also his ghouls don't often offer a great deal of value in bot lane since they will often just disrupt your carry's ability to control the waves which will tilt them.\n\n* He can no longer brush check with his (w) ghouls and provide continuous vision on targets with his ghouls.\n\n* He can no longer clear traps with his (w) ghouls on-demand.\n\n\nWhile the only really benefit to Yorick's supporting that I see coming from the rework is:\n\n* His W is more useful against certain matchups, mainly for caging Leona when she dives in.  It also tends to be slightly better than his old W for peeling ganks and punishing tower dives, but it really depends on whether the enemy has the ability to dash out of the cage or has mobility to evade it before it closes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Necro Warrior87","date":"2018-10-27T13:15:24.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to main him in the Jungle, you barely took damage because of the ghoul spam + blue buff","replies":[]},{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2018-10-27T05:49:55.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle Yorick is pretty viable.
