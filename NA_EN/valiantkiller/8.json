I've been getting a string of games where people feed, first time their champs and generally play like they're bronze. I've played ranked for several years and it's never been this bad, even the year with dynamic queue where I was waiting 10 minutes for a game. This season is so frustrating, people play anything bot and just dump on us while my team is still playing weak adcs.

I think that you should really focus on yourself because from what you stated about your mates, they are the reason you are not winning. I understand what you are saying and how tilting it might be, but Solo Queue is, imo, a good way to see what you really deserve if you play a good amount of game. I used to be B3 2 years ago. Now im plat 1, so close to diamond. \n\nYou'll climb if you start to understand that sometime it's not your fault if you lose a game, just go to the next one AND don't tilt because of that game, we all get  people who sometimes go bad in lane or are on a bad streak. But it is also the same case for  the other team (someone with a 39% wr on the ennemy team). You don't get to choose with who you play. All you get to choose is if you want your team to affect the way you  play (if you tilt, you will probably lose the game (from my experience with the game)). \n\nAlso, how can you say they want an S? Ez needs to farm a lot to get his core. Farming is way better than killing someone (more xp + gold) but after, it all comes to ''Macro'' plays. An adc can't farm all game. He also needs to fight when it's the time to. \n\nFinally, you might want to ask yourself ''What could have I done better this game to climb?'' in order to learn and be better.
