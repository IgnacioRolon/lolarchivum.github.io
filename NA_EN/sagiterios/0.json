In the case of Definitely not Blitzcrank, he was badly disguised as something he very obviously wasn't. Having udyr dressed up in turtle/bear/bird/tiger mascot/onesie thing is still, well, udyr. His \"theme\" didnt change at all, it isnt an attempt to \"hide\" his identity, he just got fluffier.\r\n\r\nI really dont know what he should be called. Maybe call Him \"cuddle time udyr\" or something. (Im sure basically anybody could come up with a better name than that one)","replies":[{"poster":"Ariaflux","date":"2015-03-12T07:48:23.549+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Definitely Udyr\"","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-12T13:44:10.434+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes more sense and it's about twice as funny.\n\nIronic skin is ironic","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pastramka","date":"2015-03-12T15:23:24.992+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most Definitely Udyr","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOVND","date":"2015-03-13T02:09:48.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mascot Udyr?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-03-12T23:50:41.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes please.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-03-12T09:23:06.035+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"His clothes look like pajamas, so Bed Time Udyr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2015-03-12T16:39:24.925+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solution, slap a pair of glasses and a mustache on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Earthpine","date":"2015-03-12T17:30:57.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem, He already has a mustache (and beard).","replies":[{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2015-03-12T17:49:52.331+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solution, two mustaches","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-03-12T20:36:31.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Genius.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zock3y","date":"2015-03-12T16:57:26.804+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Udyr Udyr\n\n(Like Mundo Mundo)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuki Akuma","date":"2015-03-12T08:43:20.080+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of Definitely Udyr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-03-12T10:59:47.993+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mascot Udyr.
