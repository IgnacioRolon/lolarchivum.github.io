During this time, your patcher is trying to scan your game files and prepare them for an update.  Something with your pc settings could be blocking that from happening, which would result in the unspecified error.  I suggest running over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that access is being allowed.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Ornns Hammer","date":"2017-03-18T09:38:20.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help! Pretty much I updated windows and tried clicking launch again which didn't work but then I went to. Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/league client/releases/0.0.0.57/deploy/ then found the league launcher and when opened it updates the client icon on the desktop and gives me the new client when opened I'm pretty sure that was the issue but I'm no expert the patcher said it was updating my client but didn't. Hope this helps, thanks for the time!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
