I have to sit here and waste my team for something that is not my fault at all. It gets me mad because then when I have an emergency or something and I really DO HAVE TO dodge, now I have strikes that I myself did not create and therefore they stack on my account making it worse for me. When will you guys fix this? I mean, I don't want my account to be banned (if it's possible through this) nor do I want to have a bad reputation for things I HAVE NOT done. Yes, I have tried reinstalling, Yes my computer is new, Yes it can run the game at max settings, Yes I have high speed internet. It is not a problem on my part, it is your client. It is a new bug that has been out for about 6 months (in my opinion) and it keeps getting worse. Every patch I hope that it is fixed, but no. That is all for now, I hope that you guys can fix this as soon as possible. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T02:55:27.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes during champ select are usually caused by your client dropping from the matchmaking service entirely.
