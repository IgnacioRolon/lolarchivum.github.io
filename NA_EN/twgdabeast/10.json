Why not have his attacks and spells, or when an enemy attacks him, get slowed by all them spikes?\r\n\r\n kinda hard to run when your full of holes and getting hit by a big thing a metal about the size of your typical yordle.\r\n(\"cough cough, {{champion:111}}'s  anchor , he knocks the daylights out of champs with that anchor passive of his.)\r\n look what happens when a champ is hit with a big' ol' thing a metal...\r\n\r\nIf your gonna make him take on more of a tank role, give him some cc, otherwise ill probably chose another tank who has multiple forms of CC. \r\n\r\n{{champion:82}}  can farm like no other! cool! \r\n\r\nbut how do you beat a {{champion:82}} ? you can simply run away, or CC him, he can never catch you. He can kill every minion between the both of you, buy he can never catch any champion he chases.\r\n\r\nI dunno, I'm not a developer, just a player so maybe none of you will read this...\r\n\r\nBut even I can see, no, EVEN {{champion:64}}  CAN SEE that {{champion:82}}  needs SOME FORM OF CC, or he is gonna go hang out with {{champion:6}}  in champion update LIMBO.\r\n\r\n\r\nno offense to {{champion:6}}  mains out there, if they are out there...","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-02-07T21:11:25.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow, I never knew that Morde didn't have any CC or mobility boost.
