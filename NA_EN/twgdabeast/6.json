A crow like Swain&#039;s would be a dead giveaway that Noxians were about, but this bird would look more commonplace, or champion specific? \r\n\r\nMaybe the champ has a noxian banner/spear pole it comes and lands on?\r\n\r\nAnyway, what normal birds or animals do you think look or represent Factions from Runeterra?

I'll stick to birds because that's my specific area of special interest.\n\nBilgewater - Scarlet Macaw, obvious choice for both mascot and scout bird. Of course we all know what those look like.\nIonia - There are a lot of possible picks for this one, but my vote for a mascot would go to any of several species of bird of paradise, because they look borderline magical. As for scouting birds, I'd go with a White-throated Magpie-jay - it's almost like a fantasy version of an ordinary blue jay! And it's a corvid, which makes it quite an intelligent bird. \nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JsmW2B0k19Y/T1gHIIw1NNI/AAAAAAAAB9E/08bm0v1P5-0/s1600/WhitethroatedMagpieJay2CostaJM.jpg\n\nNoxus - While Red-winged Blackbirds seem to scream \"NOXUS,\" I'd expect the empire to pick a bird of prey as its avian mascot, or as a scouting bird. Falconry is just one of the innumerable respectable military disciplines in Noxus, of course, so Quinn probably has quite a few counterparts on the other side. Check out a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk: \nhttp://www.schmoker.org/BirdPics/Photos/Raptors/RTHA_DkAdFly9.jpg \nSide note: I've seen some fan art of Darius as a bird and he looks uncannily like one of these.\n\nDemacia - They've probably already selected the azurite eagle (Valor's species, which isn't a thing IRL) for both tasks, so it's harder to pick a real-life bird for the job.\n\nShurima - You might think of ostriches when you think of the desert, but it's probably more feasible to select a bustard for a mascot:\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Ardeotis_kori_Etosha.JPG/1280px-Ardeotis_kori_Etosha.JPG \nScouting birds would probably be hawks or falcons, just like in Noxus, but of course different types. Something like this Red-necked Falcon could do nicely: \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Red-Necked_Falcon.JPG\n\nFreljord - None of the three tribes would go with a bird, I think. If they did? Sea eagle (this one is a Steller's Sea Eagle): \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Haliaeetus_pelagicus%2C_Rausu%2C_Hokkaido%2C_Japan.jpg\n\nPiltover/Zaun and the areas uninhabited by living humans are harder to work out. Aside from those mysterious manta-like creatures in the Zaun artwork, I feel Piltover and Zaun would probably select mechanical birds as mascots.\nAnd I'm gonna just agree with A Swarm of Koala about Bandle City!\n\nPerhaps I lean too much toward birds of prey, but they're appropriately fierce mascots while also being intelligent enough to do scouting and perhaps even combat maneuvers with their handler - multipurpose! \nAlso, it's not just me: many major league sports teams in North America have chosen a bird of prey as a mascot: Hawks, Falcons, Seahawks, Raptors, Eagles...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2018-07-03T03:08:29.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shurima would be like a hawk or eagle or something","replies":[{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2018-07-03T03:19:08.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CauseSCIENCE,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=04qgagYc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-03T03:08:29.253+0000)\n>\n> Shurima would be like a hawk or eagle or something\n\nMaybe it has claws for burrowing under the sand?
