Lower half and gun are sort of the obelisk stones from dark star thresh arena mode. Ult is a black hole, other ideas scribbled while drawing. Left arm could be a tentacle? Not much thought on that apendage.\r\n\r\nI hope my crappy drawings come through sharing my ideas and weird concepts for him.\r\nWould be awesome for Urgot to get a proper VO with this skin like dark star thresh. ({{champion:6}}  likes to monologue)\r\n\r\nI think you will find this useful: \r\nhttps://www.camscanner.com/share/V7dol/0/w105s112orf14\r\n Shared using #CamScanner\r\n\r\n(The Trapezohedron is from darkest dungeon, I&#039;m just using it as a reference. Spooky alien stuff and all that jazz!)\r\n\r\nAlso would be the 5th dark star, and top laner for the skin team I think? So makes a full skin team!!! \r\n\r\nAs in the paper notes, anyone can use these ideas and expand or criticize or, I dunno, make it real and put em in a video game we all play.","replies":[{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2017-12-31T23:56:09.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got no idea if the link worked, oh well, maybe I'll check back on this, tomorrow?
