I see it as his heal and passive proc in skirmishes so you can smack so guys a bit, but its mana cost apsolutely drains my want to stay in a fight. I feel its the fastest way to passive and Q, repeat when in a fight, to be that battle cleric, but it costs more than his ult by the tiime its maxed... and its a spell that feels like you sould spam it in a fight to keep the passive and Q combos rolling.\r\n\r\nWith {{champion:412}}  and {{champion:53}}  i see why their Q, an essential part of their kit, their hooks, have a lot of power and have high cooldowns and a hefty mana cost of 100, the same as their ults, but never costing more.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that {{champion:44}} &#039;s heal and hit combo costs so much more and you can cast it so much more often? \r\nShouldn&#039;t any champion&#039;s basic abilities never cost more than their ult? It doesn&#039;t feel like a strong heal and even if it was weak it costs a ton of mana to spam it in combat. Do they not want him healing while fighting the whole fight if he can or cannot afford to do so?\r\n\r\nOr what tips and compensations do I need to do when playing the fabulous Protector?","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-07-10T19:30:32.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of my observations when playing Taric:\n\n- I think maxing his Stun first is much better than maxing his heal for 2 reasons:  1. The mana cost on his Q scales up immensely for very little benefit and 2. His stun duration scales per level up. \n\n- Weaving Q in often during skirmishes will net you more procs on his passive but keep in mind that his Q becomes more powerful the longer you hold it, giving you better reward for mana spent. \n\nI hope this helps you out a bit. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2017-07-10T19:34:04.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3SheetsTotheWind,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=47RNuKsM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-10T19:30:32.307+0000)\n>\n> Some of my observations when playing Taric:\n> \n> - I think maxing his Stun first is much better than maxing his heal for 2 reasons:  1.

So he's more there for his cc with his bastion duo... ok. ill play him more around that next.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-07-10T19:31:33.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that was his nerf to balance him out if I remember. He was crazy strong on his release and he saw some heavy mana costs as a nerf. Though I could be remembering it wrong. I do remember they wanted to put more focus on max stack healing, but right now heal just feels terrible to use with it's horrible mana cost and weak heal. There isn't much to really fix that problem. He just kind of needs a buff is all.","replies":[{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2017-07-10T19:36:07.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kloqdq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=47RNuKsM,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-10T19:31:33.558+0000)\n>\n> I believe that was his nerf to balance him out if I remember.

I could be wrong, but I believe that's what they did. I wish they would buff him but I know Riot is scared of him becoming a bit too good. He was really strong on launch.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
