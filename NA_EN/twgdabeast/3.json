I could still talk and hear friends over curse. Are there any fixed for when this happens in a game? The audio in the game is very key, such as alert pings or other big stuff.\r\n\r\nThis is the third instance this has happened to me over the 2 years i&#039;ve been playing. Could it just be my computer or does this happen very rarely to  some players? It pulls you out of the game and when I tried disconnecting the client froze, then i couldn&#039;t reconnect at all to the game.\r\n\r\nAny solutions? or just a minor random bug?","replies":[]}
