Amazing music and video!!! Loved seeing Pentakill back in action!\r\n\r\nI have been mesmerized by the idea that if {{champion:82}}  gets a vgu of any sort down the line, at least one ability, or a combo of abilities has him smashing the earth like he does at 2:58, followed by an eruption upwards, that goes til 3:08 in the video.\r\n\r\nBase Mordekaiser skin could be the black mist or dark magic summoning the pure that he was killed in.\r\n\r\nOh, but Pentakill {{champion:82}} , when he does it he has the Pentakill  stage (from the end of the video we get a great look at it) erupt from the impact instead! (Also all his Penta skin sound effects be shreds from his guitar ax.\r\n\r\nI guess it would be like an aoe slam, then a long delay, but a big knockup aoe. Great for teamfights when everyone&#039;s atop one another. \r\n\r\nFantastic Job with the video riot!!!! This is how I&#039;ve wanted others to see {{champion:82}}  as, and now I can show them!!!\r\n\r\nHope anyone likes the idea! And watch the video if you have not already, your missing out!","replies":[]}
