I thought maybe there was a chance it made a duplicate and I'd have to find it and change it but there was no duplicated pages.  I checked my purchase history and it shows I purchased and my IP dropped so is there some place I have to go before it shows up?\n\nEDIT: I just joined a game and it shows rune page 15 but right before game I checked and it wasn't there, so maybe after game I'll be able to set it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-22T17:04:13.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and see a new page as of today with a gibberish name.  Have you relogged since the purchase?  Sometimes it can help to make sure everything is in-sync.  Let me know if everything is okay!","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Ragerrrrrrrrr","date":"2017-04-22T17:36:54.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I just restarted the client and now it shows up, not as a gibberish name :P, but as Rune Page 15 with a yellow dot by it, thank you for checking","replies":[]}]}]}
