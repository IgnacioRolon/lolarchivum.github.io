He gets SO much free dmg from his kit its kinda crazy. When he ults he gets 50% armor pen. He then can increase the dmg of his dash by dashing. It increases up to 50% which does alot of dmg level 2 playing into a real squishy champion like {{champion:34}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:69}} . And then his passive is two different passives. He gets double Crit AND a shield. That just sounds like an overbearing kit.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-07T04:45:43.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of those champions have to get into melee range to deal damage, while Yasuo most definitely does.

If you look at my match history you can see that I dont play them anymore unless its for teams. Either answer my question or don't post in the thread I made. Its that simple.
