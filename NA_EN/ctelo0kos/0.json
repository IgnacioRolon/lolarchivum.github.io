This is a reason as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we're unable to remove or modify Leaverbuster penalties.\n\nAdditionally, a 5-game penalty can never occur from a single disconnection and would only show up on your account after a **recent and consistent trend of disconnections**. If your modem or router are having issues, you may want to reach out to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) so they can help you sort that out before playing any more League matches.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
