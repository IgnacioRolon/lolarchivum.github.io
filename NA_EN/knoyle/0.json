I'm a programmer. When I was about 7 years old, I wrote a kind of platform shooter something, inspired by games like Mario. It didn't have fancy graphics. I used simple ASCII characters to construct levels, enemies and players. Anyways, it had replay functionality and this is EXACTLY how I implemented it. \n\nThe first thing I did was record the random seed used for the particular session that I was recording. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers are generated. The random numbers are the basis for random events that take place in game, for example, when enemies choose to attack or the actions they choose to execute such as whether to jump, shoot or whatever. Using the same random seed ensures that every thing that happens randomly in the game will happen the EXACT same way.\n\nThe second thing I did was to record each time the player sent input to the game. This was followed by a duration code. The duration code was basically a number that says how much time has passed before the next input was sent. \n\nThe recording of the random seed, duration and the sequence of inputs allowed me to reproduce the entire sequence of events that took place EXACTLY as they happened at the time of the recording. However, these recordings are only valid if certain parameters in the game engine remained unchanged. For example, if I changed how much damage a certain enemy does and try to play back a replay from before that change, the replay would desync at the first point where change in damage becomes relevant. If I my character does 20 damage and at some point I was shooting an enemy with 40 HP and I killed him. That would have taken 2 shots. But lets say I buffed the damage my character does to 40, then in the replay, the enemy would die in 1 shot instead of 2 and that extra shot might hit another enemy and kill him earlier than he was killed in the original playthrough. This would create a domino effect where the replay starts looking like the player is taking a bunch of random nonsensical actions like walking into walls or enemies, ignoring enemies etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2017-09-17T18:04:06.793+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be nice but considering it took them 7 seasons to get replays working I have doubts they can in reasonable time implement dynamically repatching the client to fit the patch a replay is from\n\nalthough blizzard does it pretty well with starcraft 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joseraph","date":"2017-09-18T12:45:21.218+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replays don't work after patches because they aren't traditional video files. Instead, they log the code of every action that happens in the game, and play it back. This way, it takes up a TON less space. Other games like Sm4sh and Brawhalla work the same. The problem with playing an old replay in a new patch is, if the code says \"Veigar hits his W on Ashe and Lux\", but in this new patch Veigar W now does 700% AP, and Rabadons, which Veigar rushed, now has 225 AP, the replay isn't going to be the same. \n\nI also assume that if something changes too much, like Lux being coded to Ult and kill 3 people, but now being dead, the client would crash, or start doing weird shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-09-18T14:06:55.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember how a year after Rengar's rework I watched an old replay from LoLReplay back from when Rengar had his bola point'n'click and guess what...\n\nIt worked exactly like it worked back then and LoLReplay replays are fundamentally identical to those we have right now.\n\nReplays contain all actions and results, possibly skipping all server-side calculations, so whether Veigar's W has 1.0 AP ratio or does physical damage with 7.0 AS ratio is meaningless.","replies":[{"poster":"Joseraph","date":"2017-09-19T12:54:04.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm not mistaken, LoL Replay actually had you download that patch's files (Excluding things like skins and splashes to cut down on space, but it was still a weird and bulky way to backpatch replays)\n\nEdit:\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Rainslight,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BWAMypXV,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-09-18T19:11:11.780+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll take a stab at this even tho I&#x27;m in no way qualified to answer. \n> \n> So with how we do replays now: No, this is not possible\n> \n> This is a problem with how replays are done as a whole.
