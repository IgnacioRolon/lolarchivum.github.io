Yeah, normals are all about good fun and whatever and I can get behind that all day everyday. However, there is no fun to be had when you go 0/8 before the 12 minute mark simply because you don&#039;t know how the champion you are even works. I get that first timers will always have flaws and make big mistakes adepts won&#039;t but if you are losing horribly purely because you don&#039;t even know Jhin has to stop and reload every 4th shot or Teemo&#039;s W isn&#039;t an attack speed steroid or maybe that Kindred isn&#039;t easy af to jungle with because she is inherently squishy, (Stop getting executed by gromp!) I really think you NEED TO PLAY A BOT GAME FIRST. You have nobody to blame but yourself because you are too proud to use a bot as a practice dummy for 5 minutes. Yes, it&#039;s norms but that doesn&#039;t mean people don&#039;t want to at least ENJOY the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-05-20T15:38:40.348+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I do it whenever I start a new champion:\nCustom game first\n1 or 2 bot games\nPvP\n\nThis lets me get a pretty good feel for the champion before I actually have to put it to the test","replies":[{"poster":"Asyde","date":"2016-05-20T19:22:24.731+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AvantelWings,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=17U4zU8r,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-20T15:38:40.348+0000)\n>\n> The way I do it whenever I start a new champion:\n> Custom game first\n> 1 or 2 bot games\n> PvP\n> \n> This lets me get a pretty good feel for the champion before I actually have to put it to the test\n\nAgreed.

It's to learn the basics of your champion before being 0/3 at the 4 minute mark. You can easily go to a TT beginner game, learn the kit and the combos, and be done in 10 minutes or less.

It's one thing if it's an easy champion and you've played similar stuff (e.g. I got my champion pool banned out one game and had only practiced J4 jungle on bots but was going top, I went J4 top anyways and won the game because I was a Hecarim main and J4 is pretty darned similar and easy to play).
