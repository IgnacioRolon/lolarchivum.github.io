Needless to say she in effect made me too weak and low on gold to even offer any help against their bot lane.\r\n\r\nNext match I hard carried my entire team through the early and mid games as the jungler, but instead of continuing to listen to me after I've proven that doing so means we win my team against my pings tries to baron FOUR TIMES while the enemy team is ALL up and completely out of sight.  It also started at the 20 min mark so Baron at that point was strong enough to fck up a team trying to kill it so that made it easy for the other team to come and kill the rest of my team.  I mean how often is it a good idea to try and rush a 20 min baron when we have no vision, the entire enemy team is up, and your jungler isn't the one to start it?  NEVER.\r\n\r\nThe game after that I went top as first pick and didn't ban blitz, cause I'm not awful at this game so I know how to dodge a grab, AND my teams supp was a Morgana, like the hardest blitz counter.  Well Morgana gives up 1st, 2nd, and 3rd blood cause she can't dodge a hook or blackshield it for some reason and just starts hard raging at me for not banning blitz then starts to feed on purpose by constantly running into the enemy towers just to give them kills.\r\n\r\nFinally I was top Nasus this last game and I'm winning my lane by a mile so the Sion starts to roam and so I start to take free towers, cause Nasus with good stacks is amazing at that, obviously.  But even though I ping my team off every single time and always explain to them either to give up a drag, just wave clear, or anything like that cause I can either get a free tower in top or don't have TP to come help, they continuously try and 4v5 over and over and over again!  And not like one of them gets caught, by 4v5ing I mean they engage on the enemy team repeatedly!  So I start to group cause I'm strong as sht and my team can't not teamfight cause they have a very single minded and bronze level train of thought, but after catching my team up they then for some reason stop grouping and start getting caught repeatedly, which eventually gives the enemy team their 5th dragon and they just steam roll us under our towers and win the game.\r\n\r\nIn all these games, I don't think there was anything more I could have done AT ALL to change the outcomes.... simply getting paired with these imbeciles sealed my fate.... I just wish there was some kind of in game formula that made it so you didn't lose as many points when you perform very well and lose cause your team is idiotic.... will never happen, but would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T20:23:29.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze feels. But when shit like that happens you have to adapt to your team. If they don't listen to you, do what they want to do. No saying its smarter, but its some kind of teamwork. You'll keep losing though, but each time you should pick up some tips for yourself as a player","replies":[{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-03-11T00:43:47.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doing what my team wants 9 times out of 10 means teamfighting against a team that's stronger then us and has a better teamfight..... won't help in the slightest.\n\nThe ONLY times I've managed to win these games is split push hard enough to make the enemy team start to scramble so they don't just push into my idiot team who probably won't wave clear under the tower their defending anyway and just attack the enemy team and die... again... but the enemy team is usually bad as well so controlling them like that is easy as long as I have time, which my team doesn't usually like to grant me, everyone's so freakin impatient.\n\nAlso it's silver feels, once again, I always do quite well in my placements and usually play against plats and diamonds in all 10 of them then get deranked back into silver for some reason, no joke.","replies":[]}]}]}
