Just had a game as Aatrox jungle and I got two kills bot lane as soon as I hit lvl 3 and then went back and got one for my ADC.  Meanwhile mid is losing 1v1 and top gets ganked cause he&#039;s literally at the enemy tower with no wards.\r\n\r\nBot then somehow goes like 2/12 together in under 10 mins without the enemy jungler having to do anything.....  I go top some more cause my top laner is crying non-stop for ganks... and mid keeps losing 1v1 then ganks ganked twice ina row and claims he&#039;s been ganked 8 times.\r\n\r\nGuess what, we lost cause I played Aatrox, not cause bot got crushed even though I got them ahead, not cause my mid laner kept dying 1v1, and not cause our top laner is a blind bat.  Nope, I picked a non-meta champ so it&#039;s my fault.........\r\n\r\nLesson to learn form this?  Fuck crybabies, mute everyone, and do your best anyways, cause only playing the meta is boring as shit and I&#039;ve climbed to plat a number of times without relying on it and I will again.

They know the champion so well they are usually able to compete with the stronger champions, although I do think this has a limit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-01-22T16:11:22.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate those people too. I was playing Nasus ADC a few months ago for fun in normals, and despite me killing the enemy Jinx twice my Tahm Kench support flamed the entire game and started trolling. We probably could have won that game too, but Tahm's trolling meant that we had no chance, even though I actually didn't do too bad. It's happened when i played other things like Brand jungle, Maokai support and crap like that.\n\nThe thing that pisses me off the most is when they say \"I told you it doesn't work\". dude it's 1 game, maybe the matchup was bad, the build was wrong, etc. There isn't a single meta champion that wins every matchup so the fact that people like that think Off Meta picks have to dominate every time is just stupid. Strangely enough the high elo players i meet in normals seem to give off meta stuff a chance while low elo players are the ones flaming me hardcore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-01-23T16:15:55.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their reasoning must be something like, \"If he's that good with Aatrox, surely he could carry our sorry asses with a better champion!\" And they go on to ignore the fact that this is a team game.","replies":[]}]}
