No matter how many times I pinged she&#039;d never actually help, and only once were her minions actually on her tower so that can&#039;t be her excuse for the other two times.\r\n\r\nBecause of this utter lack of an attempt to get back into the game, when she pinged &quot;OMW&quot; to the second blue I told her, &quot;no, I&#039;m taking this cause Skarner not only has decent mana problems but you&#039;re just going to give it up right now, Nidalee will take it from you, sorry.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe responds with &quot;k&quot; then walks over to the blue wall so she can burst it down, since Skarner doesn&#039;t really have any burst, so I smite it!  I literally told her I was taking it, so I have no idea what she was expecting.\r\n\r\nAt that point for about 5 mins she just followed me around the jungle trying to take every little bit of farm from me and when I tried to take advantage of her immaturity and bring her to a gank on top lane she just started taking all of our Jayce&#039;s farm while the two of us killed Hecarim.\r\n\r\nI told her at that point that since it was only a team builder and I was just playing to try out the new Skarner skin, which is awesome btw, that if she was going to deliberately hinder the game for us I&#039;d just afk and not waste my time on her.  So in response her duo Q partner Ezreal started to follow me around as well, so they were both taking all the jungle farm for no reason.\r\n\r\nSo I apologized to everyone in all chat and told them that Ahri and Ezreal were deliberately trying to ruin the game for me cause I took the blue buff, then quit the game.  Did I get reported?  Probably.  Was it warranted?  Yes, I admit that, but honestly I&#039;d rather take a report then waste 30-40 mins of my time in a game where a duo Q was spending their time exclusively trying to ruin the whole thing for me cause I took the second blue buff from a feeding Ahri.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story here guys, the BLUE BUFF DOESN&#039;T BELONG TO THE MID LANER!  It&#039;s up to the jungler on who gets the blue and if he doesn&#039;t give to you, especially if you&#039;re losing your lane really hard, that doesn&#039;t mean you can throw a hissy fit and ruin the entire game.  To anyone who does this or think it&#039;s ok, you need to grow up and get over yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"DoFr","date":"2015-04-28T13:14:18.425+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"all of you NEED to understand that the jungler puts SO MUCH FAITH in the midlaner by giving her/him blue\n\ni can give you a little of that faith, but you need to understand you're wasting some of MY exp and gold.\n\n\njust think if i taxed your lane and then died to a krug","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renaille","date":"2015-04-28T03:53:32.654+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Blue buff belongs to anyone who can outsmite a jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-04-28T04:51:31.380+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or who keeps better track of the timer :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-04-28T04:06:45.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buffs belong to the jungler (I'd say whoever has smite but with the current toplane meta...)\n\nMids truly need to stop thinking it's automatically theirs, because it's not, even if they're doing well. \nI personally put my faith in the jungler that if he no longer needs it, he will offer it to me.
