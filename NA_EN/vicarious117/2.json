Most notably, Kat timing the resets and jumps, Yi dodging skillshots with Alpha Strike, and Riven's AA canceling and jump tactics. Pantheon could even be in that category with the Aegis timings and stacking.\nBefore anyone goes and says anything about me only saying this because I play them, I don't play any of them much outside of OfA.\n\ntl;dr Easy champs are easy, but some have skillful mechanics hidden in their kits.","replies":[{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2015-10-22T22:12:29.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"None of those things are even slightly difficult though, Kat's \"timings\" are easy as shit since you get them so quickly that timing anything is kind of irrelevant (outside of basic game knowledge, nothing to do with her kit specifically), timing an Alpha Strike is easier then side stepping an ability cause it's more instant and completely removes any kind of counterplay for the duration, so the \"intricacy\" of using Yi's alpha strike is literally just the game being easier for him when compared to other champs, and Riven's aa canceling was surprisingly easy to get, first time I played her I was doing it just fine, I had honestly thought it was take some practice but turns out you don't really need to.\n\nSo yeah they add uniqueness to each champ and gives each of them something different to think about, but that doesn't make them any less simple to use, I play Pantheon and saying that timing his Aegis is an \"intricacy\" sounds ridiculous to me, he's basically a \"zero skill champ\" and I still love playing him.

To master a champion, you must have timing, focus, and know your CD's perfectly. Usually getting down your CD's are the easy part, but knowing when to go in on champions like Riven, Kat, Yi, and Tryn is so intensive. You have to know 100% that you can take a specific target for either your reset or put out the needed damage. If you're just going to say \"Kat is easy, she's so freelo\" and then a noob picks her up, notices her kit is mechanically easy, then tries to dive the backline before her team has done anything, she's going to die and be worthless. If she waits, watches the fight, chooses a target, then PROPERLY goes in on it for the kill and actually gets it, then she's a good Kat. She's able to choose her fights wisely rather than doing what Darius does and walk into a fight, get low, press Q, and not... really do anything mechanically or skillful. \n\nTiming, Prioritizing, and Patience are all part of a champions skill cap. You won't see many Rivens actually doing well if they don't know their champion inside and out unless their opponents are complete idiots and don't know anything about Riven. Same goes for Kat, really. It's why you'll see Rivens beat Olafs and Kats beating LeBlancs. If they have more skill, they'll likely win. It's just how it is. Almost every match up where a Riven or Kat get fed it's because of the enemies not understanding the champ or not dealing with it.\n\nA good example of a team not dealing with Riven was recently in World's! ROC vs. Fnatic. Huni sat top with a free lane against a Rumble. Rumble is a poor champ against a Rumble and Huni was ignored so hard that he had an inner turret at 2 minutes in as RIVEN. ROC had a team to deal with Riven and just ignored her completely despite her being 100 CS above her lane opponent on top of having 2 turrets down, plus getting ganks from a Rek'Sai and a TF on a number of occasions. If ROC had ganked Riven like Fnatic ganked Rumble, Riven would've fell off and Rumble would've dominated in team fights, but instead she was ignored and allowed to get two towers and a number of kills. Huni's Riven wasn't even good either. He played super cocky and would've been destroyed if he didn't have a free lane and two fricken turrets for free.","replies":[]},{"poster":"azrolator","date":"2015-10-23T02:57:39.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the OP meant \"simple mechanics\" and many are hearing \"easy to do well and win with\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"azrolator","date":"2015-10-23T02:49:50.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite champ has been Garen. When I was hitting level 30, I realized I still didn't know a lot of champs and probably played too many lanes to get a good in depth knowledge. Decided I would just play Garen top, not sure what made that decision. Or Xin jungle, that speed boost plus innate heal on hit made it easier without runes. I learned a lot by playing what I realized was a champ with easy mechanics. That gave me time to get better at last hit, strategy, learn other champs and how to counter, how to build to counter, etc. I can be pretty good with Garen, better than I am with stronger, but more complicated champs. He had low floor, low ceiling, which was okay with me. His ceiling is higher now, so is his floor. But I still mostly play him the same way as before. Nothing wrong with easy mechanics, understanding how to engage and escape with simple characters and to make the most of them I think gives a pretty good understanding of the game. Getting older and my hands don't respond so well since a car accident awhile back, so I hope Riot keeps some simple champs around for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gusicles","date":"2015-10-23T01:00:44.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why is because whenever someone brings this up, 99.99% of the time it's in a mocking or deriding manner. Such as, \"Oh you play X? You must be bad because that's an easy champion.\"\n\nThe problem with this is that it's all in perspective. For example, you noted Riven as being an easy champion. Her kit is pretty straightforward, but I think she's a difficult champion to master, and I'd wager most people agree. (Numbers needing tuning aside.)\n\nEven the term \"easy\" itself is almost inherently derogatory. It seems to imply the superiority of whoever \"plays the complex champs\". I'd rather word it as \"reliability\" and \"higher reward\" champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-10-22T05:11:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vicarious117,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ddEdWEpE,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-09T00:12:28.857+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:5}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:55}}  {{champion:20}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:31}}  and so on and so on....\n> \n> Why do people who main these champs not just admit how stupidly simple they are to play?

Is lying to yourself about their difficulty make you feel like you&#039;re better then you really are or something?  Admit it, &quot;yes I play an easy champ, and I like it!&quot;  It won&#039;t change anything, but you won&#039;t be lying to yourself.\n\nI don't disagree with your point, but I do disagree with some of the champions listed.\n\nLike Cho (yes I'm a Cho main but I'm not biased I swear) is very immobile and reliant on one of the least reliable skill shots in the game. He's strong, but harder to play than, say, Garen, another champion I main and fully admit is easy to play (which is why I think he's a great starter top laner). \n\nYi and maybe Wukong (yes I also main Wu stfu) are examples of low skill floors, but medium to high skill caps IMO.\n\nIn essence though yeah, some people play easy champions. The reason people don't like that stigma is the way people phrase this statement though. It's never a civil pointing out that, mechanically, the champion someone plays is easy.\n\nIt's something like a butthurt feeding Yasuo player crying about how his champion actually takes skill and that the only reason I'm winning is I'm playing Darius (has happened to me before). I've also had a Riven player whine about me stomping her skull in with Tryndamere top, saying that I'm just playing a noob champ. I've also had a Riven player (yeah...) say that I would have fed with any other champ and had to play an OP champ to first blood her and crush her in lane. Who was this champion? Poppy. I dominated a Riven in lane as Poppy (the Riven was awful).","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-22T23:35:34.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How often is Poppy played to even know what to expect?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-10-22T23:02:30.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of those champions you listed some of them have a few subtle techniques they make or break champions at certain elos.
