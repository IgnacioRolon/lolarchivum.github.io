I want to throw Goldenglue in, but even since the very first week it&#039;s had the teams mid lane points split between the two as if they plan on switching it up &quot;on the fly&quot; or some shit......\r\n\r\nSo does Liquid like, make any sort of announcements before the fantasy teams get locked in for the weekend?  Only other mid laner options I have are Pobelter, who&#039;s been playing like ass, and Ninja, who&#039;s team has been playing like ass lol\r\n\r\nJust curious if I missed something.","replies":[{"poster":"BlamesTheJungler","date":"2017-02-09T01:54:52.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to follow up with my previous post and state that it is highly unlikely that Link will play.\n\nLiquid will no longer split time between Goldenglue and Link, and will have Golden as the starting midlaner. \n\nLink, however, is moving out of the Liquid house. However, he will remain a substitute for Liquid.\n\nhttp://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/18648557/team-liquid-makes-change-mid-lane","replies":[{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2017-02-09T04:18:20.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually exactly what I was looking for, thnx so much for the information!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-09T00:33:35.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're better off putting pobelter or ninja in there.","replies":[{"poster":"Vicarious117","date":"2017-02-09T00:39:05.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean Goldenglue has averaged higher then the both of them every single week, so he's a better choice especially with his match ups being better this week as well.
