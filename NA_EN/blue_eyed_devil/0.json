I turned on my computer today and a small Discord window pops up in-game. It won't allow me to click on it, I tried clicking on it to click the gear/settings button, or at least move it out of the way, but it's no use. I removed League Of Legends from my Discord, and it still pops up on League. And it's only in-game.\r\n\r\nIt is very frustrating because it blocks out a huge chunk of the screen and I can't get it to go away. Hopefully someone can help me or at least knows what is going on. I'd like to fix this problem asap.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-21T19:36:44.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Discord has some overlays that can cause issues with the client.  Previously, it was crashing players trying to login.  ><  You'll want to go to your Discord settings and disable overlays or uninstall the app.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
