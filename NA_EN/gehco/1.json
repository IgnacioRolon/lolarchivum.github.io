I love the new champs Rakan and Xaya, especially because I love birds, bird hybrids and such. I had a question. Which I was wondering if it is possible. We know how Quinn tamed Valor and all and how successful it went, she got talent, heck I can&#039;t even tame a wild animal even if I tried. So my question is, if quinn &quot;whistles&quot; (Like in her ingame recall) at rakan and xayah the way she does with Valor, will those &quot;taming&quot; skills work? I know they are bird hybrids but, will they react to how a normal bird will react? Will they follow Quinn&#039;s hand gestures and respect her command? Or no? Will they follow Quinn?","replies":[]}
