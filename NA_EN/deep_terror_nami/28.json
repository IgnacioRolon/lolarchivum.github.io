They sit just on the edge of breaking the rules so they can&#039;t be reported. They are pretty obvious, so stacking up Trolling reports from different people could flag them to get looked at by a moderator for bans. Please add this so they stay in GD or  go away entirely.\n\nEdit: I'd like to thank the troll who arrived specifically to prove the necessity of this. Thank you, you've been a huge help.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-06-25T19:39:55.222+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Doesn't most trolling fall under offensive, spam, or harassment anyway?\n\nOr if the troll is starting their own threads, incorrect board usually suffices if they're not posting an actual topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-06-25T19:48:14.496+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"You see how I already hooked a troll that makes an effort to not get reported but be as annoying as possible?","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-06-25T19:59:32.465+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You mean the guy insulting you, me, random people for no reason and downvoting us out of spite?\n\nAlso, considering how obvious this guy is being, you could report him for harassment for feeling the need to respond to everyone who dared to comment on this thread.

Most of what is identified as trolling usually falls under some sort of harassment or spam in my opinion, but others disagree and wish for more reporting options. More power to them, I welcome them sharing their ideas and whatnot, I just felt like giving my two cents on the matter.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"tonzillacrayon","date":"2015-06-25T19:55:23.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"The only think you hook is yourself in the eye.
