It can be found by going to the top of this page and clicking **Support**, going to the **Billing &amp; Store** section, and is under **Promotions &amp; Store Prices**. You can also go to **Support** and do a keyword search.\n\nIf you see a \"promotion\" or \"free RP\" or free anything from Riot that wasn't announced on the front page or found on the Promotional Content article, then don't go doing it unless Riot verifies it *first*. They are nearly always phishing scams that take your information and use it to either steal your account or send you spam.\n\nAlso, do not *ever* go to the forum and provide links to these sites. It doesn't matter if you're asking if it's true or if you're reporting it for being a scam; it does more harm than good by exposing people to it that otherwise never would have known. You can submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you need to ask Riot about a link.\n\nCurrently the only free skins/champions Riot offers are Riot Girl Tristana, Unchained Alistar, and Dreadknight Garen.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-09T17:34:08.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for posting this! ^-^ \n\nThe support page is an excellent resource when it comes to determining which promotions are valid, versus scams. \n\nAs a friendly reminder, all old skin codes have been deactivated, which means there is currently no way to obtain skins such as PAX TF, Championship Riven, etc. Anyone claiming to have valid codes isn't telling the truth, so please don't attempt to buy skin codes from third party websites. As Valkyrie Witch stated,  **currently, the only free skins/champions Riot offers are Riot Girl Tristana, Unchained Alistar, and Dreadknight Garen.**\n\nWhen we hand out new skin codes at events, such as Riot Kayle or Dragonslayer Pantheon, please also be aware that these skins expire shortly after they're given out.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2015-07-09T23:07:54.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we sticky this... forever?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-07-09T17:52:19.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://sfdcinsea.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/were-not-worthy.gif","replies":[]}]}]}
