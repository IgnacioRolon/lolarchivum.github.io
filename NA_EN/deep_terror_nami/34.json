Seems OP with what you have described though. I could see this being used by a support while minions are taking aggro as a duo sieges their tower and it focuses the aggro back onto the champions instead, and both of them at that. Would highly contend the exhaust pick which 95% of supports use right now. Can really make dives a lot more risky and sieges more rewarding if you are on the offensive. A lot of other great uses in its utility, but I wholeheartedly support this. Could protect a top laner from a jungle gank while under tower if they are trying to use their minions to get close enough to land a combo and get out. To be honest, I could see 2 or 3 people with this on a team which would be kinda game breaking though since it takes away from diversity (but flash is already 99% mandatory on most champs, haha).\n\nThe global range might have to be nerfed already though. Make it so you have to be within the towers range, friendly or otherwise. So you would have to tank one hit if you plan on using it offensively without minions still. Potential bug could be it cancelling out the turret auto (which i've seen when the missile is halfway to the target and the turret is destroyed before it lands and dissapeared; is that normal?)","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-20T16:55:23.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sure it is potentially OP as stated.
