Blue line shows what the pathing was going to be after the 0:16 second mark when it happened. It's understandable that some would miss that and think I'm a cheater, but understandable as it might be, it's annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"PerishSoftly","date":"2014-11-16T17:39:54.760+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enemy team: WTF this Soraka is a god!\nYour team: WTF this Soraka is a god!\n\nYou: O.O...
