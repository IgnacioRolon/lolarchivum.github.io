She doesn't really bring anything except guaranteed burst with a stun. Take away the guarantee, and you immediately kill all reason to potentially play her.

You have to give her something very nice if you're going to start taking away the only things she has.\n\nEven if you give her extra range on the ultimate, that still doesn't provide her with anything actually unique. Plenty of characters have unreliable but powerful CC initiation ultimates. Why would I take Annie if she's just got another version of what they do while also only having damage to contribute? Annie doesn't have anything unique besides the guaranteed nature of her kit. \n\nIf you want to give her a more substantial redesign and have that redesign include a thrown ultimate, then great, that would probably be good for her and for the people who play against her. Do anything short of that, and you just end up with another Zilean.

In fact, Corki's Q used to be instantaneous, which left him in an incredibly oppressive state. Since they gave it a travel time, everyone - Corki included - have been the better for it. The fact that a lightly farmed Annie (something she is able to achieve with the support items) can obliterate an ADC 100-0 after a stun, it boggles the mind that this hasn't been done already.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-07-15T20:13:56.796+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like you're suggesting that because giving the skill a delay worked for Corki, it would also work for Annie. If that isn't what you're saying, I apologize for misunderstanding.\n\nCorki was a much better candidate for the removal of the instant damage than Annie is. Corki already had a lot of value outside of the instant guaranteed damage, and the instant nature of his Q caused Riot to heavily gate its damage. He suffered heavily outside of lane from the Q having no AD ratio, which severely hurt his scaling as the game went on. He had problems that could be adequately fixed once his Q was no longer instant. Annie doesn't have those same kind of problems.\n\nI think when we examine everything Corki was given to make up for losing the instant Q, it actually serves as good evidence for why we couldn't do the same for Annie. He was actually very bad the patch when the Q was made into a skillshot, even though that patch contained mana buffs for his Q and W, and a ratio buff for his ultimate. He stayed bad until a later patch when they added a 50% AD ratio to his Q. He needed all of these changes, even though what he lost was much, much less significant than what Annie stands to lose if her ultimate.\n\nAnnie doesn't have the same problems Corki did, and she can't get the same buffs Corki got even though he lost less than she did. Annie already one-shots people, so we can't up her ratios. She doesn't need and won't benefit significantly from mana cost buffs. She doesn't have alternate avenues of power we can build up if we remove this major source of power from her. There just isn't enough room to buff her enough to make her good while remaining even remotely healthy if we remove the guaranteed ultimate.\n\nThis is why I say she needs a full and comprehensive redesign, not a small change. We aren't going to be able to make her work if the only major change is giving her ult a delay.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-07-16T01:36:03.465+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a very good point.

The only thing about her that isn't extremely plain is that she spawns a controllable minion.

Annie is a child who goes toe to toe with the most powerful mages and warriors from across the world. Other mages use hat tricks or combo mix ups they learned through years of combat experience and training in their art. Champs like Leblanc and Syndra use their spells in whatever order the situation demands, while Lux and Xerath focus their energy to fight from range. Annie fights back against that kind of experience the only way she knows how, with raw power.\n\nPut simply the kit doesn't work thematically with an inexperienced child like Annie. She wouldn't rely on creative use of her spells and tactical evaluation of the situation, but instead the simplicity of her powerful destructive spells. A quote from her lore puts it best.\n\n''Annie may be one of the most powerful champions ever to have fought in a Field of Justice.

A champion based around raw damage is extremely numbers focused. In an isolated situation, the champion only wins if they have enough damage. Otherwise they lose, because there is no outplay potential in their kit at all. \n\nYou have every right to feel that my rework idea would be too creative, and too tactical, for Annie to realistically have a grasping of. However I encourage you to give Annie the benefit of the doubt. According to her lore, she bound Tibbers to a teddy bear at the age of two. Creating an easily transportable and inconspicuous way to carry around her extremely powerful guardian that allows her to summon it at will to protect her is extremely creative and smart. Annie is truly a prodigy, and while she may not be the type who maps out a battle in her head, she certainly could be capable of instinctively adapting her spells in different ways to respond to situations. \n\nEven if it is too much for such a young child to handle, Annie's been out for quite a while now. Maybe it's time she grew up a little.\n\nThanks for your feedback. I hope you can see some reason in my claim.

I do like it, and I think the core concept of having different effects and making her more reliant on the effects of her passive is a good idea. It's overall a pretty nice rework concept. I just want to make it clear that I do like it, even though I'm about to spend time focusing mainly on the few problems that I have.\n\nFirst off, while I do think the passive sounds pretty interesting, I think that the large disparity in the effects Annie can get would actually feel a bit limiting to the players when combined with her cooldowns and the large number of stacks needed. There are going to be situations where I really, really want to get certain effects (largely the stun, and rarely but sometimes the movement speed), but I'll have to sit on long cooldowns to actually achieve them, and the 7 stacks will be up rarely enough that this may be punishing. I'll have to wait on an important cooldown for a long time to make sure I can use it with the bonus effect. Redesigning her Q to be spammier (lower damage, CD and manacost) to help build up stacks easily while in range of an enemy might be a workable solution. Having a low duration but low CD E could work too, although I'm not sure if that really fits her design. This problem probably isn't particularly hard to address.\n\nThe Q pyromanic design seems kind of odd to me. I'm not sure about the idea of having her Q someone to apply a permaslow and DoT so long as she isn't CCed. Seems a bit odd, and potentially unfair. What is the idea you're going for here? I could see the idea of having her slow people down for the bear to chase them, but my objection there would be that a Rylai's on the Tibbers aura is going to do that anyway. I'm just not sure what exactly the point of having this is. I don't really know what you'd put here, but I do think that something else needs to fill this slot.\n\nI'd also argue that having Tibbers stun is still going to be pretty important to her kit, and should probably be included in the ability. A lot of her utility her is based on a teamfight stun, and given that there will be less immediate burst, fewer stuns from her passive, and the bear will be dodgeable, I'd say that she's really, really going to need that stun.\n\nAside from all that, the concept is pretty interesting. I like having different effects on her abilities, I like the E being a more useful part of her kit and it does seem a lot more fair to play against in general.

A mobile champion is expected to dodge and avoid many of the skillshot or delayed versions of stuns and roots that an immobile champion might not. They're balanced around not taking the same kind of damage and not being subjected to the same CC as an immobile champion would. That expectation falls apart when instant abilities come into play. An instant or targeted stun might have the exact same numbers as the skillshot or delayed version, so it's nothing special to an immobile champion who is built to take some hits and eat some CC, but it will actually hit the mobile champion 100% of the time. Just hitting them and applying CC to them is something the mobile champion may not be equipped to deal with, and it easily cause them to get popped like overripe grapes.\n\nI don't agree with HAAAAAAAALP that instant and targeted stuns are necessary to deal with mobility (there are obviously some design concerns with these abilities), but they absolutely do hurt mobile champions more than immobile ones.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-15T17:01:39.575+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"What if they made tibbers a Zone Trap.

Sometimes you need to play well to get out of a bad situation. Sometimes the point is in not being in the bad situation in the fist place. Sometimes the counter is dodging, and sometimes the counter should be doing something before your opponent's combo even begins. Sometimes it's buying an item before you even get to lane. Bottom line: skillshots make mobility better, make the game more chaotic, and when they're *your* kit instead of some champion that you don't even play, you'll notice planning and set up are less important than reflex and sometimes even luck.\n\nThis philosophy *destroyed* Veigar.
