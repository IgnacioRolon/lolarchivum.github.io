While it's great to see things being updated, and it's certainly a step in the right direction, I don't really like not being able to honor the enemy team, or only being able to honor one teammate.  There are games when you will have exceptionally positive players on the enemy team, players who are perhaps managing to not give in to any sort of tilt or still managing to be cheerful and positive even though the game is not going in their favor, or players who go out of their way to give an enemy pointers on how to better play their champions.  That sort of behavior should be rewarded, and this set-up won't allow for it.  Nor will we be able to honor more than one teammate, even if the entire team deserves recognition.  \n\nAnd I'm also wondering whether the honors that have been earned in the past will be removed when the new system goes live, or if they will be rolled into it.

I've had matches where there has been a duo that was just really funny, positive and made a point of keeping the rest of the team from getting too down if a play went badly.  They've ended up on my friend's list after the matches, but I also honored them for their behavior.  \n\nFunny you should mention ARAM, as that's actually one of the places where I use honor the most often now.  While I do give out honor in normal matches, there's something about ARAM for having a team of 5 players who are being laid back, silly and just working together.

Otherwise, more levels of honor isn't necessarily an improvement.\n  \n2.  Linking key drops to honor is an interesting idea.  I got the impression that plenty of players reacted to improve when punishments prevented them from earning loot (when the loot system came out).  So I think that key drops with honor definitely provides a strong motivation for many players to be honorable in game.\n \n3. The way they are going to present the honor selection post game is also interesting.  Although, not really necessary, I think really puts honor in the forefront of players minds post game.\n \n**The real test of the honor system is going to be how it actually feels to players.**  If players feel like honor they achieve reflects their effort to be honorable, then I think we will see an improvement in players overall.  But if players don't get a sense that the system reflects their efforts to be honorable, then they are going to ignore it.
