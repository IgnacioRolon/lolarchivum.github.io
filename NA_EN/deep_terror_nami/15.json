This is causing them to obstruct gameplay if you go in to fight early, especially in ARAM where you frequently immediately get in to fights within the first minute.\n\nI think the display time is 1 minute (was too busy fighting to check when it disappeared). I recommend reverting this change entirely.\n\nAdditionally, is there a way to make the game mode tips on the right stop popping up in ARAM? I know you can&#039;t shop after you leave, and I know you heal allies for 50% (or whatever that other tooltip is). I have newbie tooltips disabled so that isn&#039;t it; if there is another option for that I&#039;d like someone to let me know where it is, and if there isn&#039;t one please do something about that.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/6824c81ed437c979312f4dccb25c7ff0.png","replies":[{"poster":"pasta mama","date":"2017-07-28T18:16:43.841+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey hey, we are aware of this one - when we updated the time they stuck around in the loading screen, they were updated in game as well. should be fixed next patch!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-07-28T18:31:12.662+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear it, thanks for the reply :3\n\nDo you know anything about those game tips/info that show up on the right though?
