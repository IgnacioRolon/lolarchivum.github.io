I&#039;m using Gimp 2 and could use a basic tutorial to perfect the outline and color it in, *or* just commission it for a Mystery Chest :3\n\nThis is the mess I left when I gave into inevitability;\nhttp://i.snag.gy/vc5zJ.jpg\n\nEdit 1: Progress. Still don't know what I'm doing, but things happened.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/2f1ca3ad0ced3952cf084d41e113a369.png\n\nEdit 2: Ok, this is the best it's getting. Done.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/03997f1f589b3111fbf6da216055f8db.png\n\n[Oh, also, head over here for an easy comic contest for a Mystery Skin!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/w0VUrhjY-take-this-and-create-your-own-captions-for-a-mystery-prize) .

If I were to offer any advice, it would be to cheat more!  I took a partial try at doing the icon myself, taking the original Slayer Jinx icon as the template to trace over:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XKkQJ07.png\n\nWith Nami's eyes, she looks pretty creepy :D  But you can see that I just put the image into an editor, scaled it waaay up (easier to work big and scale down) and then scribbled the differences in the shapes as best I could.  Don't know if my scribble will be of use to you, or if you'd be better starting over yourself (probably the latter) but I hope you have luck with your drawing!
