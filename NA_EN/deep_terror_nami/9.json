While they may not indicate whether you may actually be punished soon or not (because it's based on report volume and not a review of those reports), it may help indicate to a player that other people aren't enjoying playing with them and can steer them in the right direction before they do get punished. I received one of these notifications back when I started, and it immediately indicated to me that the players here did not tolerate the same behavior as some other toxic gaming communities, and I immediately changed my tune and never had to be punished; I think this would greatly benefit some players, and the community itself as a result.\n\n> 2) Muting or mitigating pings per player.\n\n* Everybody knows ping spam can be annoying, and that there is also no way to stop one offender from abusing it without cutting off ping sound from everyone. Just put a Ping button next to the Mute button in the scoreboard. I understand that it can be harmful to the team if you're cutting off all communication with them, so I recommend something like clicking it once to *mitigate* their Pings, limiting how frequent and how loud they are to you, and clicking again to squelch them entirely.\n\n> 3) Self-imposed chat restriction.\n\n* I think this is an extreme measure which should be avoided, but a few players have significant issues with abusing chat if it's available to them. I don't think it's a bad idea to let them limit their own chat by force before they get into the game. I recommend having an option in your Settings that imposes the standard chat restriction limits on you, but during champion select you'll always get a popup notification which reminds you and allows you to disable it right then (no checkmark to not see this popup).\n\n> 4) For chat related offenses, 25-40 games of chat restrictions on top of a 14 day ban (not a separate punishment tier).\n\n* While I don't necessarily disagree that a permaban should come after a 14 day ban for chat offenses, I do think there should be some sort of buffer in between to help promote reform in the player's chat behavior immediately after the 14 day account ban. I often see someone slip up just a little bit after a 14 day ban and go right to a perma, and I think still being on a chat restriction for a short period will help remind them they are still treading on thin ice, and the additional chat limitations may help them improve the behavior they were punished for. I do not suggest this additional chat restriction for gameplay related offenses.\n\n> 5) Better Intentional Feeder and Trolling Detection.\n\n* Just what it sounds like. Obviously we want the system to be perfect, and while I realize that isn't possible, I do think it could be much better. Just do what you can there, please. I'm still baffled when I see someone share a match history which is 15 games of Zeal stacking and Mobis; that really should be caught with a single match without them admitting their malicious intent in chat.\n\nWhile this isn't *everything* I or others want to see, some features (like champ select reporting) may entail much more work with the client interface or under the hood, so I'll leave those for another time.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-05-03T17:15:12.166+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thoughts on these in very few words.\n\n1.

Good ideas!\n\nWhat about addressing the issue of players holding their teammates hostage with troll picks in order to force others to dodge when they get a role they don't want?\n\nPlayer perception is that there's nothing really done about this. To report somebody you have to get to the end of game screen which never happens if you dodge. So it feels like these players are never punished.

You have to consider that A) You can't have the reporting happen *in* champ select because players have limited time and need to focus on preparing for the match, B) where will the reports be happening then? If you must leave your queue then you're still taking a penalty, if you don't then it can just be done post-game anyway. If it's done in a separate area outside of the lobbies, it must display at least the players in your champ select lobbies, but should it also include a copy of the chat there so you remember who you needed to report? What if the issue was a pick and not chat? Then you have to simply remember 30-50 minutes later and not mix up the names. What it was the first of 4 dodged champ selects? You are unlikely to remember who it was. So on and so forth.\n\nThere is way more that needs to be considered here than people want to admit, which is likely why Riot hasn't addressed it directly with the solution people request. Most players who are toxic jerks in champ select are also toxic jerks in game; it's most efficient to simply compromise and play the match out and report afterwards, even though that really does suck and nobody wants to hear it (including me).","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-02T20:54:33.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean.

If there were an option to report people after a failed champ select then you could remove yourself from queue to report someone, and then restart your queue without penalty. \n\nThe summoner report area would list players you've had an interaction with in any capacity followed by how you interacted with them. \n\nSummoner A - top lane darius previous game banned khazix\nSummoner B - jungle lee sin previous game banned cait\nSummoner C - mid syndra previous game banned gragas\nSummoner D - adc jinx previous game\nCool Friend A - exchanged chat via mobile\nDouchebag 0 - exchanged chat via club chatroom XYZ \nSummoner i - failed champ select banned teemo picked nunu (person who threatened to feed for whatever reason before someone dodged)\nSummoner ii - failed champ select banned rengar picked lee sin\nSummoner iii - failed champ select - no pick\nSummoner iv - failed champ select - no pick\n\n... etc.... \n\nClick the person you want to report to see their chat that you were part of and report accordingly. \n\nIt would need the chat that you were part of, as well as picks and bans if from a previous champ select or successful game. This also gives the added benefit of being able to report someone if your client crashes out of the post game lobby (which should have been a thing with the new client imo). It also doesn't limit it to players you've played a game with, allowing you to report people who are inappropriate in personal messages or club chat rooms where there is currently no avenue to punish them. Sure they can be kicked from the club or you can block them but that isn't a punishment, its equivalent to the mute function in game. There is no feedback for the offender if you simply block them. \n\nAnyway If you dodged because of someone in champ select then at least filling out the report gives you something to do while you wait out the few minutes to requeue.

Because Say you're in a ranked game. your mid laner picks a champion that is either a champion that he has no skill with, or is countered by the opponents mid laner (assuming that their team chose first.)  He then proceeds to get FBed under the enemy tower within 30 seconds of the game.\n\nAfter being asked polity not to do that, he continues and ends the game going 4-25-2  in a loss.. where as their mid laner goes 21-1-14 because they got a lead on the constant intentional feeding of your mid laner. \n\nWhat's Riots response to something like that right now?  \"Oh, he's just not playing well, too bad his intentional feeding made your game experience terrible.. better make it up in your next game with our shitty LP System and our shitty matchmaking!\" \n\nAfter 2-3 games of this happening in a row, even the most purest player can slip up and say something toxic or hateful. Because RIOT is showing that the behavior they have been the victim of (trolling/intentional feeding players) is not being punished. In fact, I am going to go as far as to say that riot is promoting this type of behavior. \n\nHow you ask? Because of the lack of punishment, and the lack of dev responses on the matter on the boards. Hell, the intentional feeders don't care. They've already done their damage and caused you negative playing experience, negative LP(if ranked) and they get off scott free.  They get punished? Oh well, they'll just hop on one of their other accounts and troll away (Tyler 1 example with the 12+ accounts banned, who btw is STILL playing this game despite riot's \"perma ban\" ) \n\nAgain, the fact that it's almost like riot is promoting this type of toxic behavior is the leading cause of other people becoming toxic.\n\nIt's very easy to determine if someone is trolling/intentional feeding vs someone who sees a build and tries it out (example, lucian jungle from Anklespankin) because there's actual effort and seeming apologies that come with it. Like for example, a person trying out something will usually try and play safe after the first or second death, and not try and continue the behavior. They will try and safely farm where they can.  \n\nNow, I bet you that if riot started to crack down on even warning players when they've developed a pattern of trolling, the toxicity in games will also decrease. I know my behavioral punishments have come because I finally snapped after several games with trolls and feeders on my team.   Hell, a 10 game chat restriction came earlier this year because after 3 ranked games in a row with the SAME TOXIC FEEDER (note, solo queued) I finally had it and told him off after the 3rd game in a row of trolling. \n\n\nOn a related note. I wish riot had an option at champion select to report players who are toxic from the get go (telling a top to K Y s when they refuse to switch, or they pick an obvious champion to troll because they didn't get their pick etc). it's sad that they basically FORCE you to have the negative play experience before allowing you to send a report..

Trolls will evolve to abuse every system so every system is going to need some kind of shut down to avoid those people.\n\nSo yeah Riot whenever You actually wanna care, You should be able to mute individual people's pings.

With ping spamming, maybe we can have a button that just limits pings from a certain player to 1 every 4-7 seconds, increasing in time depending on frequency.\n\nI was thinking about the notifications of high report frequency. I think it could benefit players and increase reform rates; on the other hand, it could allow players to momentarily reform before becoming toxic again.

One of the main reasons they took it away was because it tilted people. And gaming the system based on whether you got the warning message would be difficult because. \n\n*You could have been \"toxic\" but no one thought it was bad enough to warrant a report. Or your team /muted all at the start.\n\n* the popup ideally would not show up every game you were reported. \n\n* a rioter could decide to punish you manually if they think you're trying to game the system. \n\n\nI still say simply being reported shouldn't trigger it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SUPERX4PANDA","date":"2017-05-03T00:57:55.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number 3 I would absolutely use, as sometimes I just can't help but flame.

Kidding, couldn't resist :D.  I do like these ideas and hope that some of them will see some light in the future.\n\n1)  Yes.  Far too often do I see threads on PB&M along the lines of \"WTF RITO X BAN FOR THIS?\" and defend the fact that they had no prior warnings.  With some form of better warning system I honestly think it would give players a chance to reform (especially if it's their main account with tons of time and sweet skins).\n\n2)  For the love of all you believe in let's give this some attention.  Even if we can't completely mute pings for communication reasons, being able to limit hearing the pings from someone that's \"?\" Pinging 6 times every time their cooldown is up would be invaluable.  I've had many games that were completely winnable and fine where teammates would simply Alt+F4 out after seeing a teammate spam pings on them.\n\n3)  This would be great as long as the players don't have ANY method of being able to reactivate their chat during the game.  I like the ideas you proposed here, as it will help those that feel the need to spam \"??? GGEZ U SUK KYS\" every game stop from doing it, or be able to be reported more swiftly when they decide to use their limited messages for only the most egregious offenses.\n\n4)  I rather enjoy this idea, it gives players that little reminder of \"Hey unfriendly player, you're already escalated up the punishment tier, try not to slip up again - remember you're in our system already and we're keeping a close watch on you {{item:3348}} .\"\n\n5)  I feel that this would be great, however I'm not sure how it would be accomplished honestly.  Sure, building 6 tears or 6 boots is pretty easy to see that someone is beyond the point of caring, or 10 deaths under the enemy mid tower in 5 minutes with 0 pathing or interaction, however on the flip-side I don't know how it would account for actual \"new\" players to the game that are either having a bad game or trying an off-meta build (and learning ADC-Ryze or something else similar doesn't do so hot).\n\nThanks for bringing these issues to light and hopefully they will get some positive attention and move things in the right direction!  I do agree that there are a few outlying issues (such as pre-game lobby reporting, as you mentioned) that could definitely be implemented to prevent the whole \"MID OR FEED\" sort of mentality.
