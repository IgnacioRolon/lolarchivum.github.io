Riot looks to trash systems and features that aren't being used by a large portion of the community, so the only way to prevent that is by proving to Riot we actually do want it. Simply saying you want it doesn't mean anything.\r\n\r\nFor now, this is about the [removal of Normal Draft Pick](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/how-rank-2017-season). Right now it's for all regions *except* NA/EUW/BR, but they want to take it away from us too.\r\n\r\n#If you want to support Normal Draft Pick, I recommend anyone that plays Blind Pick start using Draft some or all of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-11-09T07:17:21.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dude, it' s not like Riot is happy to remove features where they have spent manhours to work on. if they do, it is because it is trash. There is nothing to \"protect\".","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-09T07:55:57.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you haven't read why they are doing it. They are removing it on those other regions because not enough people play it. If those regions used it more Riot wouldn't get rid of it.\n\nThe same for Dominion. If only more people played it, Riot wouldn't have taken it down and remade it as a RGM. Protecting these things is precisely what players would be doing by using them.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-11-09T08:05:37.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maaaaaaybe you misunderstood what did i just say, or i explained myself badly.\n\nRiot is **not happy** to remove stuff, because that's stuff they have spent developing hours in. Even more, draft is something that gets supported to this day, compared to how it was dominion.\n\nIf Riot has to remove a thing, it is because it does not work and/or is derimental to the other features. **There is nothing to protect from Riot** here. Sure, players could play more a certain feature but then again it would mean they play less another feature. it is a cycle. And i don' t see why players should play a feature they like to play less just to have it not removed.\n\nTalk less about other regions that are not of your concern, please. If someone has to knight for those features, then it should be the players of that same region and not externals.\n\nAnd yes, it is not of your concern not only because NA is not considered into that, but because the reasons for the queque to be removed does not intrest NA. EUW as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-11-09T02:12:41.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think alot of people don't use draft pick because they dislike sitting through 20000 year champion select just for a normals.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-09T03:10:48.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But people can actually do their homework while waiting for a queue. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-11-09T08:08:44.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they remove it because they need numbers to pad their ranked queue when they fork it in two - solo queue and flex queue\n\nthey are even that shameless that they admit they \"in the ideal world\" would remove normal draft on all the servers\n\ndunno about you but i personally refuse to be used to pad for their stupid decisions, if the flex queue failed this season they have to remove it and leave us with solo/duo queue ranked like it was back then","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-11-09T07:24:54.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no they should get rid of both for the betterment of ranked queue time","replies":[]}]}
