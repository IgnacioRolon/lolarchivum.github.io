Supposedly this is because you want people to buy both Ardent Censer and Mikael&#039;s Crucible without a loss in efficiency. However, what really happens is that they just stack 5 Censers and a Deathcap or something like that. I have not done the math but apparently it&#039;s too much.\n\n* Problem - Ardent Censer stacking is OP!\n* Solution - Make Ardent Censer&#039;s +60 AP Unique!\n\nWhy does making Censer&#039;s AP unique help? Because then you only get +15% Heal/Shield Power, +10% CDR, and +50% Mana Regen for 2400g, not only making it lose a lot of individual efficiency, but the less AP you have the worse off your base heal/shield is so the % isn&#039;t working with nearly as much.\n\nIs it a good idea? Who the fuck knows? I didn&#039;t do the math on this, either!

When I played using only Heal and Clarity last year, I stacked AP only on my Soraka. The best healing I achieved was like... 700 per W.
