It's quite simple, and he's created an infograph with directions;\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/267154390849290244/307295060100382720/BETA_Client_-_How_To_Block_Players.png\n\nFor text instructions I'll just repeat it here;\n\n> 1. Go into your Profile page from the tabs on the top left of the client\n2. On the top right side of your profile, enter the Summoner name\n * You can go to your own if they were in your recent matches\n3. Go into their Match History tab and select any match\n4. Find the player you wish to block, right click, select **Block**\n\nThere you go, the player is blocked! To view your Block list, just hit the **Settings** button on the top right of your client, the list is under the **Client** section.\n\nKeep in mind that Blocking does not prevent a player from being matched with you. It only prevents them from sending you messages or requests, and automatically mutes them in lobby and in-game chat.","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2017-04-28T00:27:16.892+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i like how you used doublelift as an example. that's great.","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2017-04-28T02:11:09.291+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he ever goes back to TSM, I'll make a new infographic.
