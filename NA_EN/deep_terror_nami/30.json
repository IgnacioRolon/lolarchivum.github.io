Difference is that this gives them the ability to play around the wards. It's more like a cloak to help ganking.\n\nAs the guy I replied too said. You're often forced to chose between giving up on the gank and taking the 30g from the ward or try the gank anyway. It's also very iffy as a buff. \n\n- Low MMR - Players probably didn't ward anyway.\n- Medium MMR - Probably when it's most effective. Wards are more often enough though their attention to the map isn't as strong in case it gets cleared. \n- High MMR - Players know how to work around the jungler and the jungler mainly uses it to know if there is a ward so the gank is doable more than making the gank possible. \n\nI just don't think it works that great. Lower players don't really effect it much. Middle players use it the best because they're not all that great yet. Higher up players mostly use it as a \"can I gank\" check than making the gank possible. \n\nWith all of this in mind. We could give a really good buff to Poachers Knife, additional smite effects if it kills the target(or if it just dies by your team).
