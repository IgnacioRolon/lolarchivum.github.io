It took me about 10 minutes to get back in the game, and I knew from there I would probably have a low priority queue. So I have been having to wait 20 minutes but how many times? I have waited in a low priority queue way more than 5 times, and I'm just wondering how long more will  have to wait to play a game of LOL?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T15:48:27.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The timer as well as the amount of games requires to be played will continue to escalate with consistent interruptions.
