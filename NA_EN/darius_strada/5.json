Buying this with a Riven or a Rengar or Kha&#039;Zix meant you aould sucessefully gank early or go agressive early and get a kill. Maybe it would be cool to have it back to kill those hyper arries ADCs and prevent them from getting to that state but then again, the game has already so much damage and CD that it probably wouldn&#039;t solve anything. But I miss it tho.","replies":[]}
