While her cannons are perhaps among the more striking silhouette breakers for lasses with this body type, along the lines of Vi's gauntlets, Bristle for Sejuani, and Cassiopeia's snake arse, she also does very little within her non-shoulder cannon design to differentiate her from the other lasses. \n\nWhile in another game she might befairly unique, in League she's generic as hell.\n\nAnd it's hella disappointing after we've had lasses like {{champion:164}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:203}} (Half of them anyway) {{champion:421}}  {{champion:163}} {{champion:142}}, who did break design moulds and stand out as unique in the roster.\n\nThis wouldn't be as much of a problem is League wasn't inundated with sexy women, but it is, and seemingly they just kinda decided to not factor that in when making Kai'Sa?

Yes, Riot can make what they want. It's their game after all. I'm not dictating shit about what they do with their creative process, I'm expressing disappointment at the sameyness of it all. I'd personally rather Akali be unique in terms of silhouette cuz of some cool aspect of her design rather than the fact she crouches for the entirety of the game, or that Syndra had more unique elements to her clothing than just a big helmet. \n\nYeah we've had \"unique and diverse\" designs for the past 3 seasons, which is still covers less champions overall than were released prior. There are ways in which conventionally attractive champions can be made to differentiate from eachother, but Riot's historically done a poor job of that, to the point of, in one case, changing the release skin of a lass to keep it from becoming to confusing to tell apart from their new champion (Dark Valkyrie Diana and Syndra respectively, for those who weren't aware). \n\n> Not to mention that most of the \"30+ lasses with the same face and body shape\" are old champs, who will be VGU'd at some point. We may end up with LESS conventionally attractive females than we have now.\n\nBullshit, quite honestly. When Riot even ATTEMPTED this with Fiora the boards caught on fire. They're never gonna make their conventionally attractive champions anything less than 100% pristinely perfect, lest they incur the wrath of the masses, because apparently having slightly more defined cheekbones makes someone look like a 40 year old transvestite.\n\nI focus on her being a pretty white girl because it feels totally counter to the idea of her being a survivor in an alien world of horridness. Mostly the pretty side of things than anything else. I focus on the indistinct face because it's hard to get attached to characters when they might as well be a prior character in a new costume. Her being bad arse changes very little because the champions she's similar to are ALSO bad arse.\n\nThe argument here centers around the idea that, for me, Kai'Sa being so much like the majority of the other lasses in League makes her much less interesting to me personally. It doesn't sit right with me for her to be beautiful given where she comes from. I'd expect something far different, and yeah maybe that's on me, but at the same time folks were badgering on about Taliyah's eyebrows being too fucking big when she came out so I don't feel like my argument is nearly as bad as it could be. To me, Kai'Sa is indistinct and thus boring. I like my monsterish champions and visually atypical champions. I like things when there's a high amount of variance such that even among things that are similar they still stand out. Kai'Sa doesn't show that to me. Again, maybe it's all just my own fault for this, but we're debating opinion here and at the end of the day no one's wrong in this debate; there's nothing actually wrong with Kai'Sa's design objectively. Subjectively it just disappoints me greatly. I don't expect everyone to feel the same; fanart already exists of her so she definetly resonates with folks, just as she resonates with you. But for me, and whoever else is upvoting me, that's just not the case.\n\nIt's actually doubly so now because her personality seems like something I can dig, but it's wrapped in an appearance that's so bland to me that I can't enjoy her as a character for it. I'll take the Taliyah's and Illaoi's over the Kai'Sa's any day to be honest; I'm good for conventionally attractive lasses with Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"1Free Hong Kong1","date":"2018-02-21T23:59:42.346+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH, most characters in league are bad asses.

This is a VIDEO GAME, it&#x27;s about killing people/monsters and destroying things, who cares if the badass chick you&#x27;re playing to do that is pretty?  A good example is Borderlands.  All of the playable females are conventionally attractive, but it&#x27;s a secondary to the fact that they&#x27;re badass.  Maybe you play a character based entirely on what they look like naked, but I care a hell of  lot more about what they can do fully armed.  MF is a pretty girl with a huge rack, but she&#x27;s also a total badass.  When I play her, it&#x27;s not because she has big tits, it&#x27;s because she&#x27;s a fucking bounty hunter who took down a pirate king.\n\nAll of you people who are saying something along the lines of this statement are missing the point of why some are disappointed. It's two fold.\n\nFirst and foremost the Void isn't the most fitting location for an attractive champ when people were expecting a monstrous champ and when compared to attractive female humans there's much less of them hence the dissapointment\n\n2nd they see design as safe/ generic\n\nThe main point is there nothing wrong with another attractive female, it just shouldn't have come from the void without either an accompanying monstrous personality, or theme of using a pretty facade to hide a true monster within\n\nA good example of a facade would have been Eliza from Skull girls, she has an attractive exterior with a monstrous interior that can seep out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2018-02-21T23:23:03.605+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":13,"body":"Its been years.

Maybe Pre-rework Evelynn, but I'd have to say she looks more like Ahri with the body of Sarah Kerrigan and the outfit of Nova. (Starcraft)\n\n2.) The problem is that she doesn't really have her own base 'look', and her adaptations don't affect the way SHE looks. It's just another outfit when she looks like this. She has a few face markings, but there was pretty much nothing done with the base design of the character itself. From the sounds of it, she has ties with Icathia, which should give her a bit of a Persian aesthetic. From there, they should work around the effects the Void would have on a person. Keep the survivalist mentality, perhaps make her socially awkward, and if you go from there, you'll have a full character.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lightwellian","date":"2018-02-21T19:17:24.757+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Eh. The Runeterra seems kinda small.

I mean, she looks a bit too much like Ahri. Maybe if they'd headed just a bit closer to Kerrigan or some sort of re-imagining of Zagara, they might've had something a bit better. \n\nAnyways, is that the standard profile for Icathians?

I don't really see anything interesting with Kai'sa's design when we have a good dozen+ female characters that are highly sexualized. Riot took the cool concept of a woman bonding with an alien being of another dimension and turned it into \"a woman, but like, in a latex suit with a big cleavage window\" I've been pretty happy with their character design of women lately, and I'd felt like they'd come a really long way since the release of Nami and Elise (oh look, two other characters with big ol' skin tight clothes (or scales) and cleavage windows for no reason...) but this honestly soured me a lot. I feel like this is the least interesting place to take this design because \"a hot girl in skin tight clothes\" is done flipping to death in video games and even specifically in League of Legends. Considering her character has nothing to do with being sexual (unless somehow she was seducing void monsters) I don't give a flying heck about any justification Riot can come up with for why she looks like this. It would just be a Thermian argument anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-02-22T04:00:16.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Magic and corruption in leage makes women sexy while men mutate horribly.
