I dont mean honor form teammates but the amount of honor that you get passively for playing.\r\nI know that you get less IP and mastery points and while this should not affect honor I just want to make sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T21:47:05.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK you still get the same amount of relative Honor exp from playing ARAMs that you would by playing Summoners Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"heprea","date":"2017-07-14T19:15:13.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=rMab5gZa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-08T21:47:05.964+0000)\n>\n> AFAIK you still get the same amount of relative Honor exp from playing ARAMs that you would by playing Summoners Rift.\n\nGood to know, I was starting to lose hope here :P","replies":[]}]}]}
