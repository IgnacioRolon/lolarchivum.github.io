The only reason i play this game is because i have played since season 1 on multiple accounts and ive seen the game change over the years into the garbage we have now. I still hold on to the faint hope that one day, ill have a queue session where i dont get bots on my team. \n\nI only play about 2-3 games a week, and thats usually on weekends. I'd probably have a brain aneurysm if i tried dealing with matchmaking more than that. I simply get so annoyed that i HAVE to stop playing for the week or i risk slamming my fist into my desk. \n\nThis game is the only game on earth ( and i play multiple MMO's and other games) that turns me into this type of person. After 1 death on my team, i get tilted. If my jungler is doing bad, i get tilted. If my team is playing a meme pick like teemo top, i get tilted. \n\nThe reason behind this is because i know that the enemy team will always pick actual good champions which are better at their respective roles like darius. Ahri. Other broken OP champions. If my team doesn't perform well, it is a 90% loss, 10% EXTREMELY hard comeback which requires the enemy team to disconnect and/or let us win. \n\nI still hold on to that feeling of winning a game where my team does well. Where we dominate our lanes. That, unfortunately, is an extremely unlikely occurance nowadays unless you duo queue and both of you are 100% on your game with zero lapse in decision making.","replies":[]}
