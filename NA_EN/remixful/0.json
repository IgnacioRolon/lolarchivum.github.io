If you try walking and laughing it will play the classic Maokai&#039;s laugh. It&#039;s very strange and I hope it&#039;s fixed. (Not sure if Riot will notice this anyways :c)\n\n**Update: might be a clientside bug since one of my teammates said they don't hear the classic Maokai's laugh.**","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-19T01:12:26.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Remixful -\n\nThanks for the report!
