The fact that you guys had buffed his shield by giving it a mana ratio was pretty radical and I figured you guys were going to leave him be with that buff until his eventual rework(Maybe he will be better, but it will still be a sad day for me, like a parent having to let a child leave the nest)\n\nAdding a fear is definitely something that is thematically awesome, because fear, no, Urgot is the mind killer, but if it requires a tradeoff, I'm not sure if it's worth it in the end.\n\nHis ult is definitely weird when it comes to teamfights, but Urgot isn't alone in that regard (Jhin ult will get himself killed in the middle of a fight)and I think it is something that should be used smartly, preferably duels.\n\nUrgot has a weird identity as an \"anti marksman marksman bruiser caster anti assassin assassin\" but I think nerfing his W and passive will make him weaker to assassins, and a part of me feels that this is partly motivated due to the release of the new Duskblade item to promote people to play assassins like Talon and Zed and get rid of an annoyance who may get in the way of that. Am I wrong here? \n\nUrgot isn't a free win against an assassin, but he has lots of outplay potential that makes it worth it so it makes me a little sad to see that dampened , even if it means more power for teamfights.\n\nThank you for the reply though, nice to see time taken for old Urgot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EliseOP","date":"2016-02-13T09:56:17.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These changes will help urgot greatly in mid/lategame teamfights.\nTime his ult correctly and it will be super strong  (combo with malph/ori)\nAdding power to his ult and cutting some of his binary e q combo is a good way to go ! \n(Everything of urgots power is in his q)\nAnd after all he got a 2 ad base buff ;)","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2016-02-13T16:42:17.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, as someone else mentioned, a lot of his power comes from his low cooldown shield combined with his distanced spam to keep him alive","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kholdstare13","date":"2016-02-16T16:42:21.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, deleting the one map that he dominates is going to be a HUGE nerf for crabman's numbers.","replies":[]}]}
