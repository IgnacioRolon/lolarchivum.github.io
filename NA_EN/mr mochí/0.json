It adds that touch of illusiony confusion without massive frustration keeping her unique and fairly skill based. \n\nWhat failed was her current passive Sigil of Malice. Yes it added wave-clear, but it created an awkward window forcing a pseudo-counter-play: kill her or escape with in the next 1.5 seconds or you die. This lead to nerfs because of the toxic nature of this pseudo-counter-play ultimately ending up with a subpar assassin that gets out shined by literally any other champion in her class and forcing a build path with an item that she doesn&#039;t even gain full benefit   from {{item:3146}}. \n\nI would strongly propose that LeBlanc gets changed in the following ways:\n\n- Remove Sigil of Malice\n- Add back the dual damage from her Q (initial hit, followed again when the target gets hit with another ability) \n- Add a passive on her Q stating that if the target is killed by the first instance of her Q damage, the cooldown is partially reset and nearby enemies take residual damage. (Think Tristana&#039;s E passive but activated by abilities and not an auto attack)\n- revert damage nerfs on her full kit \n- remove RR clone and revert it to her old passive \n- Pre-rework key configurations (for purposes of her combos)\n- Keep clone use on her mimic&#039;ed abilities\n- Possible &quot;Ethereal Chains&quot;(E) rework into a 90% slow and not a root. \n\nI know that the balance and rework teams aren&#039;t currently looking at making changes to LeBlanc, but her current state is especially painful to Pre-rework LeBlanc mains knowing that her old state, while it did have a couple issues, was not as terrible is this current iteration.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-01T21:25:32.449+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know that the balance and rework teams aren't currently looking at making changes to LeBlanc\n\nWe are.

Her kit forced you to build a certain way in lane but we see that still with many champions, Zed being a primary example.  She had distinct weaknesses in having to choose between cs/waveclear and kill pressure.  Any control mage with good waveclear could force her under turret and keep her there often ending with an early tower.  If the enemy built early MR (much like you are STILL forced to build early Zhonyas vs. lethality Zed) her kill pressure went way down until 2-3 full items.  \n\nShe also was distinctly disadvantaged in teamfight situations.  I've only played her a handful of times since her rework but she feels much less rewarding for much more work.  These days I find very little reason in playing pick comp champions.  Its easier to just early snowball and pressure with strong teamfighters.  It also is one of the few comps that gives the opportunity to turn the early enemy snowball around with a ~~good~~ lucky teamfight victory.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Endless","date":"2018-03-01T15:47:15.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"First of all i'd like to say that Le blanc was at a very good state before she got reworked, and no i'm not saying that because i like leblanc, Le blanc is a high skill champion, in order to get to the point where you one shot the enemy ADC then something went awfully wrong in laning phase, or something went awfully wrong in the positioning. Pick champions w/ hard CC (morgana, alistar) then Le blanc is trash. If you had no follow-up or peel,  it was almost impossible to carry the game as Le blanc. Anyway that's besides the point.\nWhat currently sucks about Le blanc is the fact that she's _not really _ Le blanc anymore. She doesn't benefit from her itemization (hextech + lichbane? wtf) , her abilities have been adjusted so many times to the point where it's just not fun to play her anymore. \nYou can't compare old le blanc to the current meta, a lot of changes have occured ever since her rework. e.g league of shields, new runes, items.\n\nWhat really needs to be changed w/ Le blanc is her passive and her ultimate. RRing twice is just bad, even though it gives you an outplay potential, it's just pretty useless most of the time. \nPassive is really bad due to the fact that it gives the enemy so much window to harass you / punish you. \n\nWhat really made Le Blanc special and fun to play with, was the ability to dive into a teamfight deal the most possible dmg you can, proc your mimic passive which also gave you invisibility for a small amount of time and then get the hell out. People who say that her old image mirror passive was bad, literally had no idea how to benefit from it or how to use it. There were multiple scenarios where you could just outplay a gank.\n\nRevert her Q & R.\nGive her a new passive or something similar with her old one.\nInstead of reducing W's base damage and giving her a fancy bouncing Q to wave clear which you've reworked a thousand times, just revert it back.** IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.**\nInstead of increasing Q's AP RATIO and reworking the bouncing DMG revert it.\n**Revert her initial combos** e.g There's no reason to press R and then W again. When you could just W + R(w) . Pressing W + R + W is not rewarding at all. \nOh and by the way it's Sigil of Malice, not \"ShAtTeR oRb\"\n\nZoe another champion with such a unique kit, I don't even bother playing Zoe,  i'm calling it now, this champion is going to be reworked in a few years, mark my words. \nImo you can't just create a champion with such a unique kit and then just \"rework\" it so badly because there's a minority of people that are complaining about it. Same thing happened with rengar, ryze and fiora. Everyone stacked tears so badly about her ultimate but that's another story for another time. Bare in mind and remember that many of us put so much time into champions & reworking them for \"the greater good of the rift\" that turns out bad, is just sad.","replies":[{"poster":"SinSkar","date":"2018-03-06T18:49:57.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol R RR is useless ?\nIt's the only ability according to me which helps LB in late game.

Useful but definitely doesn't feel rewarding or deceptive enough imo.\n\nThe R+R clone is an immensely useful tool for scouting and tanking, though bare in mind that these don't contribute to LeBlanc's deceptive nature nor to her burst mage / assassin playstyle. Due to it being uncontrollable I rarely get to deceive anyone with it. The most consistent trick is to make someone move from one side of the lane to the other (to where you are sitting in a side bush). A neat novelty but something I would be glad to replace with more deceptive tools / more burst / more fluidity in combos.\n\nFocusing her damage on her W, like it used to be, is the best way to keep LeBlanc in check. They can enable her the quick burst that she used to have without allowing her to wave-clear at the exact same time. Being able to W onto a minion wave + the enemy laner and hit both with a Q > AA for Electrocute is way too obnoxious. Making her primary damage a hitbox ability rather than targeted is also healthier for enemy targets to counterplay / dodge, albeit in a very brief window.\n\nI think my opinion follows that of the majority when I say that the new LeBlanc's kit (not numbers) is way too strong now making it a nightmare to balance effectively. This has led to forced delays on abilities and a reliance on an item that should never have been core on LeBlanc and that the player base hates to build. Buying your first item should not feel like a chore.\n\nHer \"toxic\" lane phase is what we I personally loved about her, I also disagree that it was toxic at all - someone has to be the best laner and that used to fall to LeBlanc which was balanced by her immense lack of teamfighting ability. A high risk high reward playstyle that meant you either demolish the game and take it over early, or you lose.\n\nNo one is arguing that this LeBlanc doesn't have her merits, but most players picked LeBlanc because she felt fun. I _can_still have fun on her because her mobility is still nuts, but I despise the opportunities missed due to the reasons I've mentioned.\n\nJust wait for the rework. I'd also be upset if a champion I had just started to enjoy was being changed, but there's a reason we are all excited for it - it will be better and I'm sure you'll agree when the time comes.\n**\ngl&hf!**","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SinSkar","date":"2018-03-06T18:56:24.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not completely but 80% compared to old one.\nOld lb was made for late games this lb seems like for mid game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-28T22:55:39.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not a LeBlanc main here, but I think it could help her immensely if her innate could be popped at any moment to deal damage, even if it would be reduced damage. The absolute worst impact LeBlanc's rework brought to her flow is that it categorically forced her to sit around for 1.5 seconds, without really allowing her to cash in earlier for a reduced payoff. It feels tremendously arbitrary and artificial, and creates a whole bunch of situations where LeBlanc just feels weak or even powerless, even when being played properly. Shifting her innate from a hard gate (i.e. 100% after a mark, 0% before) to a soft gate (i.e. continuous ramp-up from 0% to 100%) would offer her much more flexibility while still letting her keep its counterplay.\n\nI also feel another problem with LeBlanc's rework is that it basically did the exact thing it promised to avoid, which was to turn her into a kite mage. When LeBlanc gets to use her W defensively, let alone both her W and her RW, she's unhealthy to play against, because it ends up becoming far too easy for her to escape from any situation at little cost. The fact that her E can currently single-handedly apply all of her passive damage worsens the matter. Giving her waveclear is okay-ish, but making LB this E-centric, kite-heavy champion wasn't a good move for anyone involved.\n\nBecause of this, one potential solution I think would be to change her innate in the following way:\n\n**I - Sigil of Malice:** LeBlanc's spells mark affected enemies with a Sigil of Malice for 4 seconds. During this time, her next spell against a marked target consumes the mark to deal **bonus damage equal to 0 - 150% of the marking spell's damage**, based on how long the sigil was left to charge (fully charges at 1.5 seconds). **Sigil of Malice has no cooldown, and spells that consume a mark also apply one themselves**.\n\nAssuming her other spells have their damage adjusted accordingly, what this means is that LeBlanc would be encouraged to use _all_ of her damage against her opponents, including her W, because every application of it would count. Moreover, this would offer both her and her opponents more options: if LeBlanc doesn't want to wait for the full charge, she could sacrifice some damage for an early detonation, and if LeBlanc's target takes the bonus damage, they can still outplay her subsequent spell applications, and not just get chunked from a single ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Headbutter","date":"2018-03-12T01:46:11.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a person who mained LeBlanc since this game started, the rework was probably the biggest failure in the history of league.

The ultimate itself with any other ability was a complete travesty, I can't tell you how many times I press R + something and it fucks up internally somehow and ends up costing me a kill or getting me killed. \n\nThe biggest failure of LeBlanc is this: she is a high risk high reward assassin, and with the rework you could not even kill an ADC. Your whole kit pretty much revolves around landing chains, and late game the ADC just heals up with autos before your passive even goes off and kills you.
