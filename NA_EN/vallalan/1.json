Well that means starting at fundamentals right? so I go into shiny new practice tool, lock XP level, turn off damage to towers and go bot lane to practice. over time I noticed myself missing more and more and thought I was just off. Then I noticed I couldn&#039;t last hit under tower anymore with the normal fundamentals. (two hits for melee, hit once for ranged &gt; let tower hit &gt; hit again after). Then I did some research on the LOL wiki. Basically every 90 seconds minions get stronger. Whether or not this means health I&#039;m not sure, but assuming I was able to last hit under tower at the start of the game and could no longer do so later makes me believe so.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great change to lock MINION strength as well for practice tool so you can just stay bot and keep practicing without having to reset the game every 10 minutes or so. re teleport, spawn minions, etc. This way you could truly endlessly last hit. \r\n\r\nJust a suggestion!","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-04-27T16:21:34.560+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":55,"body":"that would be nice, but for now you can make a custom game","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-27T17:04:36.533+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":2,"body":"how- how does this help?","replies":[{"poster":"abbbez","date":"2017-04-27T20:20:37.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":16,"body":"since if you want to learn how to last hit you want it to be realistic??","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-04-27T22:28:36.102+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't really see how practicing with tools makes it less realistic.","replies":[{"poster":"abbbez","date":"2017-04-28T09:21:10.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"that would be nice, but for now you can make a custom game\" is not a bad comment he gave you and alternative that works at the moment.

Well that means starting at fundamentals right? \n\nSort of - but be careful -\n\nwatch this in full - \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MIKWbtp8zE\n\nI will now explain - when we learn, think of the RPG. if we battle something hard we collapse. we are not strong enough. if we battle something too weak, progress is slow. but - if we stay within a level or two of our current level, progress is at a healthy pace. \n\nin this way We should look to the fundamentals - wherein those are what are just below our current level - for when we need to practice easy - and we also should look to the challenges - AKA what is right above our level - for when we are prepared to learn with a faster, but tougher, pace. \n\n\nBut there is one thing more - this is the Jigan. the ally who is so strong compared to us, that they just impress us with their might. They are like an entirely new dimension, when we practice with them we open ourselves to the opportunity to skip up in levels faster than we ever could alone. \n\nAnd now imagine how that ally could also be an adversary - outside the RPG, failure is not death. so if we balance steady growth with the occasional challenge we cannot surpass - this is just as powerful in lack of a supporting ally who is more prominent than our current level. \n\n\nSo to summarize - should you go back to the basics? yes, but don't overdo that. return to ranked regularly too, to apply the basics in a challenging, volatile environment. The basics when overdone, will trap you to sluggish growth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2017-04-28T12:47:40.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is a reset game button in Practice Mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2017-04-28T03:03:33.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH, their will never be a situation where you level will be locked... plus there is an easy reset game button, although inconvenient for you purposes, still works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonManSquid","date":"2017-04-29T02:14:23.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You also can't lock enemy xp level which is kind of annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH1","date":"2017-04-28T13:34:55.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many of the replies that are critical of this post suggest that the person replying has never actually used the practice tool.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissCha0s","date":"2017-04-28T12:56:08.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Defiantly hoping to see practice tool continue to be expanded on more, being able to have more control.
