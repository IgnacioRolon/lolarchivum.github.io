I know a lot of adc mains like old graves and say he was fun, but I&#039;m not one of those kids. I&#039;m just genuinely curious what the balance team thinks of Graves. As a plat 3 player about to hit plat 2 and I can confidently say that in the right hands Graves is completely busted right now. I  am not entirely sure he is ever going to be balance-able either. \n\nthat said, old graves is basically just a burstier Lucian, but current graves is basically a tanky ranged marksman, who builds sustain, but can also burst. I mean with enough attack speed (either zerkers or PD) the reload mechanic is hardly noticeable compared to how much he can heal with warlords/a lifesteal item. \n\ncurrent graves honestly just scales too well and has no real drawbacks. He&#039;s a range bruiser basically, he has sustain, he has wave clear, he has burst, he has sustained damage, he&#039;s tanky enough, he&#039;s mobile, he&#039;s got utility in the form of his smoke screen. \n\nI mean his kit is entirely too good. He&#039;s got way too much going for him right now. There&#039;s no reason not to play him when he&#039;s up if you are a competent player. \n\nSo what do you guys think about Graves? do you think he will need changes, or is it just a numbers thing? do you actually feel he&#039;s balanced even for higher elo?","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-09-19T12:16:32.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't heard any notable high elo players complain about Graves at all and the games I've seen suggest he is fairly balanced in higher elo. He is a strong pick almost anywhere but he also can get shut down pretty hard if you know how to play against him. As an old Graves player, I dislike his new playstyle completely though and wish they'd bring his old self back so I could play him again.","replies":[{"poster":"Vallalan","date":"2016-09-19T12:26:38.792+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"what are you talking about. he is perma ban the higher up you get. in plat where I am he is not quite perma ban, but banned often enough and played quite a bit. hes very popular. the number one ranked player was complaining that he cant play graves at all because its perma banned so he is stuck playing olaf jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-09-19T13:30:31.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cute Boosted ADC,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xc67clV3,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-09-19T12:26:38.792+0000)\n>\n> what are you talking about. he is perma ban the higher up you get. in plat where I am he is not quite perma ban, but banned often enough and played quite a bit. hes very popular. the number one ranked player was complaining that he cant play graves at all because its perma banned so he is stuck playing olaf jungle.\n\nThat's not true.
