For the purposes of feedback I&#039;m going to separate the pros and cons as well a section for things I feel could be improved but aren&#039;t necessarily &quot;bad&quot;. (we&#039;ll call this potential.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**PROS**\r\n\r\n1.) Visually Clean, impressive, sleek. Super easy to navigate and the animations don&#039;t seem to lag me out or slow me down. it has the bells and whistles, but those don&#039;t seem to be too loud or obnoxious.\r\n\r\n2.) Friends list, chat box overall improved. when you have a new message, i greatly enjoy that it pops up as who on your friends list messaged you with how many messages they sent that are unread. it doesnt take up a huge amount of space in the bottom and is fairly easy to navigate. only gripe ish, is that it can get cluttered with old messages fairly quickly.\r\n\r\n3.) Champ select very sleek, super easy to navigate with role selection to instantly filter champions is nice rather than having to type it out. \r\n\r\n\r\n**CONS**\r\n\r\n1.) has persistent bug that pops up every time you enter a game and if you click ok it closes out the game and makes you reload but it pops up again endlessly looping. the only way around this is to ignore it and load the game anyway. however, if you click in the same spot on your monitor where the pop up is while playing you will click it and close it anyway even if you were in game, thus crashing your game. the only solution is to have a second monitor and move it completely off screen so you cant click it while playing. Very annoying bug, hope its being fixed.\r\n\r\n2.) While friend/chat box is an overall pro, its alerts outside of the bar itself can be hard to see. (meaning the friend who messaged you is lower on your friends list you wont see them) the bottom right it will flash the chat logo icon, but the icon is quite small and hard to notice sometimes. My suggestion is when you get a new message to have the entire client flash around its borders a few times before resorting back to only being the flashing bottom right icon. this will give you an initial &quot;oh someone messaged me&quot; but if you don&#039;t care to read it right away it won&#039;t keep flashing to annoy you. and if you don&#039;t know what I mean, I mean an INNER border highlight. or alternatively you can have it do the mac thing where the chat icon bounces up and down a few times before settling into what it currently is. \r\n\r\n3.) Lacking some decent/major features of the old client. Not sure what happened, but my clubs disappeared altogether and I was in two of them. You cannot change your account username from the client either with RP or IP (feature literally does not exist or is at the very least not under &#039;account&#039; like it is on the current client. there is also no &quot;recently played with&quot; section. you can only add friends who you recently played which is not always what you want. sometimes you simply want to see what the other person you played against usually plays, is ranked, etc. be nosy ya know? bonus points if you guys can make it to where you can click on a username in match history and view their profile directly. Also cannot see what champions you have or have not gotten your chest for on the season. minor complaint there though. \r\n\r\n4.) Lack of customization on profile page. beyond your icon, you cannot customize your set up at all. Being able to choose a background based on your FAVORITE champion/splash art (hello headmistress fiora, arcade MF) would be super cool. Hell I&#039;d even pay a small amount of RP for the right to use special splash arts that are unique to the client. Wallpapers are something that should always be personalized imo, and the client is lacking there. Not being able to further sort your match history is kind of a bummer as well. its not a feature of the old client, but being able to sort by ranked, aram, etc. would be nice. or just filter out certain types of matches you don&#039;t want to see with little check boxes would be cool. \r\n\r\n5.) changing masteries is really clunky and slow. gotta click them one at a time and you can no longer clean sweep click them in a couple seconds like you can on live, which is actually incredibly useful before a match.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**POTENTIAL **\r\n\r\n1.) No suggestions here, but match select feels weird. it defaults to your last match which I dislike and I also feel like choosing your type just feels weird. its not hard to navigate persay, but I think it could use a more streamlined and quick approach. its not too slow, but its not as easy as the current client which I feel is a slight drawback.\r\n\r\n2.) Spells Tab in &quot;collection&quot; feels entirely out of place. I understand this is probably for new players, but  I think past level 10 this is pointless and should be placed elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-20T05:29:24.413+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cute Boosted ADC,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=mYKrcEho,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-20T02:28:11.245+0000)\n>\n> So I&amp;#039;ve used the client for a few days now and I want to give my feedback since that&amp;#039;s the entire job of us being in Alpha to begin with.

There is nothing definitive that I can share right now, but we are exploring the possibilities.\n\n> 3.) Lacking some decent/major features of the old client.

The end goal is to reach parity with the legacy client of course.\n\n> 4.) Lack of customization on profile page. beyond your icon, you cannot customize your set up at all.

Maybe you'll experience that too or maybe not and that is fine. As we start to open access to more and more players, we'll have more feedback and decisions will be made if needed.\n\n> 2.) Spells Tab in &amp;quot;collection&amp;quot; feels entirely out of place. I understand this is probably for new players, but  I think past level 10 this is pointless and should be placed elsewhere.\n\nValid analysis, I would argue that it makes sense because reaching to lvl 30 will take up to one year for some people. So, having it there is convenient for them and doesn't really get in the way of more experience players.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to test the client update and post all of this awesome feedback!

I personally have just been dragging it to my 2nd monitor and leaving it there. when im done i click ok a bunch of times since it spawns one one every game even if the message is already there.\n\nand if it helps im running 64 bit windows 10.","replies":[]}]}]}
