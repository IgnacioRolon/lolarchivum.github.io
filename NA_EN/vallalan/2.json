Using minions to obstruct his blockable ultimate seems like a reasonable play for opponents to make, but I feel like it's mostly denied by this mechanic on his R. Also, I'm pretty sure the 4x modifier on this allows him to get massive healing off Death's Dance when used on minions (which I believe is a build starting to pick up in popularity), but I'd have to double check that.\n\nBoth of these could hit him in the feels, but they don't really affect his top end case, so they seem reasonable to me.","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-05-07T21:16:31.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":18,"body":"What about nerfs to {{item:3071}}?

Who use it better because they're ranged with better target access and get peeled for.\n\nLucian isn't gonna drop Black Cleaver just because you choke his mana costs a bit.

Then your next W+auto benefits completely, as well as the second hit on your E doubleshot.\n\n> Master Yi&#x27;s has better scaling, too. Even after Riven maxes it - since his applies on-hits a second time and can crit. Also, Jax gets far more attack speed out of his passive than Voli does from his E and doesn&#x27;t lose it all at once when he stops attacking, Nasus&#x27;s Q grants him extra range, has a lower mana cost, and scales endlessly when Jax&#x27;s W does not, and Renekton&#x27;s R doesn&#x27;t cost anything unlike Nasus&#x27;s R, despite him having two dashes and quite a lot of early damage when Nasus is as bulliable and immobile as it gets.\n> \n> As it happens, similar abilities don&#x27;t have to be equal. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re similar, not the same.\n\nYeah, and Riven's is worse. I'm not complaining, that's just a fact. I'm not saying she's less powerful, it's just a fact that her passive is not as great. First, I was talking about how Lucian's passive wouldn't be meh even if it lost onhit. Then you said that Riven wouldn't care, and I told you how she would, from instant Tlords with W+auto to doubled Fervor stacking to doubled Cleaver stacking.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-05-09T11:47:14.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cant Hold Me Now,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O7ep4Vg1,comment-id=0001000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-08T19:04:45.147+0000)\n>\n> And Lucian also stacks it insanely fast?

I'm talking about if Riven's passive was a doublehit as well. Not if it applied onhit twice. Oh, and actually that's completely wrong. She'd be able to apply 2 passive stacks, for an extra ~55% AD on her auto. Yes, it works, because it works with Rageblade.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-05-09T19:41:17.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cant Hold Me Now,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O7ep4Vg1,comment-id=000100020000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-09T19:10:08.991+0000)\n>\n> So what?

If the ability itself worked like that, I would imagine it would apply _all_ the stacks, because:\n\n1. The attack would land, causing on-hit effects and activating the Runic Blade buff.\n2. The Runic Blade buff adds additional damage to the attack, subtracts a stack, and applies on-hit effects ... and activating itself, if it still has a stack.\n3. Additional damage is added, stack is subtracted, on-hit effects are applied ... and once more, the buff is activated if it still has a stack remaining.\n4. Additional damage is added, stack is subtracted, on-hit effects applied, and at this point, it's not possible to have any more stacks.\n\nSo that's 75% - 150% of your AD as bonus damage, on-hits applied _four times_, and a very hurt or very dead target. 'Course, there'd be ways to code it to avoid that, but it'd actually be kinda interesting to have a charged on-hit effect that applies on-hit effects again, effectively looping until it was out of charges. It'd easily fall into the same pitfalls the 5.0 attack speed Kog'maw did, of course, but still.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-05-10T18:11:16.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atanchan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O7ep4Vg1,comment-id=0001000200000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-09T19:41:17.530+0000)\n>\n> ...

I realized that after I replied...\n\nAlthough, instead of being super convulated, if it were implemented, it would more be each stack adds %AD and applies onhit, as a separate source of physical damage, casting an ability gives one stack, all stacks are used in 1 auto. Basically use all your abilities (or cap stacks), then auto for a shit ton.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-05-10T19:46:39.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, aside from the on-hit stuff and maybe the additional damage instance, isn't that basically just that Edge rework she had on the PBE previously that didn't go through?","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-05-10T20:02:00.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atanchan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O7ep4Vg1,comment-id=000100020000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-10T19:46:39.268+0000)\n>\n> Y&#x27;know, aside from the on-hit stuff and maybe the additional damage instance, isn&#x27;t that basically just that Edge rework she had on the PBE previously that didn&#x27;t go through?\n\nNo, the Edge rework gave her a %damage increase for however much Edge she had.
