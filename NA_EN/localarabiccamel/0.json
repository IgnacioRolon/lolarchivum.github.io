New record for slowest update/installation for me. Past record was 3 Mbps. Major problem because my average is 15 - 25 Mbps. I tried to relaunch league, run as admin, switch to EU, and restart my computer. I even did a internet speed test at Speedtest.com and got 187 Mbps for my download speed so it sure ain't me. I decided to keep updating at 150 kbps against my better judgement. I got bored after an hour and I opened steam and proceeded to install both **_Skyrim and Skyrim SE. SKYRIM AND SKYRIM SE FINISHED DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING WHEN LEAGUE WAS AT 56% DONE UPDATING!_** I would like to point out I've been updating since 10:15 pm and its 2 am. Finished both Skyrim games at 10:40 and we are stuck at 85% for updating league. \r\n\r\nReally want to play this game because I haven't played in a week but I can't spend my life updating this game. For now I'll stick to Skyrim since the 13 Gb each games installed faster then the 5 Gb game. \r\n\r\nGet back to me as soon as possible please so I can fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T19:14:29.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You may be having some hiccups holding a steady connecting specifically to the patching servers, even if other network access seems fine.

I'm updating LoL at 120kbps. My speeds hold for anything and everything other than LoL. For crying out loud, I just downloaded ~35gb of RAW video files from a client's server in Australia faster than this update is going. There is no conceivable explanation on my end other than:\n1) - I am running software produced by Riot Games.\n2) - I am trying to connect to a server maintained by Riot Games.\nSorry. Rather frustrated. Kinda wanted to dust off LoL after a long workday.

I was trying to update after not playing the game for like a year, the launcher app updated fine- i have gig internet and i live in chicago probably less than a 10 minute drive to their na servers so it took like a minute tops- but when the game was updating i was getting like 500kbps. i was like thats not right. sure enough, redownloaded the game, the update took like 5 minutes to finish. \nI have a few theories about why that worked- the weirdest one being that if they use the history of your previous games played to try and route your connection... i moved to a new place. so maybe it was trying to route to my old house or something (the reason for this theory is because somewhere in their connection troubleshooting it mentions that you should sign in so they can see a history of where you played)\n\nidk. either way redownloading it and saving it in a different place worked for me.\n2014 Macbook Pro\nOSX latest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GasHs mama","date":"2017-06-25T09:04:25.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Installed Dota 2\ndl speed starts with my original net speed (5 Mbps) after 4 sec it gets down to 4 kbps you guys really want kill this game","replies":[]}]}
