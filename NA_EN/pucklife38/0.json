(please note that i pay for very good internet and usually run 20 ms) when in loading screen for game i need to close league and close the background process of league because it freezes, also id like to state that ive never had to close a background process of league until the new client. also when it comes my time to ban in lobby sometime i can click a champ sometimes i cant but then i cant even lock in my ban and i get kicked for \"dodging\" and then i get punished. i wasnt going to say anything but it just happened again, i went to ban hecarim and i selected him and it didnt let me lock.id like to also say that i dont run the program in full screen because it would cause more problems imo. Riot please incorporate something so i dont get placed in low priority que because your client decides to fuck up on me....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T00:41:44.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, so it's okay to continue your ranked through the legacy client for now:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIt sounds like you're having a connection problem that's failing to communicate what's going on in champion select, and leaving you behind.  You should go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network to the server and stay in champion select and in-game.  You should test it in custom games to prevent any penalties and be sure.
