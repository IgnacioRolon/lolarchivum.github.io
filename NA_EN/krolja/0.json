My experience is from 5+ years ago when things were a bit slower and I, personally, felt like bot lane had a dance to it on how to properly trade and CS without falling behind.\r\n\r\nNow it feels like if I don't have a Mage/Assassin (Were they drunk when they made Pyke?)/Thresh then I may as well not even try to CS. Brand support seems to just have no mana costs does nutty damage and just spammmms spells. Zyra support, too. Then there's Pyke. Holy moly Pyke. Interesting kit? Sure. Insane scaling? Yup. Becomes an assassin with a kit with stun/mobility/execute? Duh.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a culture shock coming back after so long with how heavy the damage is on \"supports\" and just how much more bursty everything is. I know the traditional supports still see some play, but in a lot of my games lately they've just all been dominated by Mage/Assassin supports and the matchup just ends up being \"Who's support deals more damage?\"  Maybe balance is wacky, maybe not. Either way, I miss my slower bot lane (probably not a popular opinion). Definitely a new learning curve this time around.","replies":[{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2020-01-04T14:45:20.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"blame riot. they nerfed support item incomes so only damage/hard engage oriented supports remain relevant after their item fully upgrades.\nalso league is all damage now. they have added lethality and many other things like runes reforged, dragon stats, dragon soul, elder buff.\n\ntrust me it isnt an isolated case with botlane. but since the dragon changes and addition of dragon soul + elder there is a lot of action happening bot lane all game. it's hard to lane in peace anymore... and did you notice the exp difference between botlane/jg and mid/top? jg and botlane were nerfed in exp which exacerbates these and many other problems even further.\n\nand yes pyke is stupid as hell. he has invis, dash, slow, hook, self sustain/gray shield, gives himself a lot of movement speed, and does damage that bypasses armor thanks to the addition of Lethality items. same as aphelios and senna... the new champs completely outclass the older ones, like do you remember sona e giving movespeed? senna's E does the same thing: +MS to everyone in it but she also gives camo to everyone inside (your teammates appear as wraiths** that cannot be right clicked** until they are revealed by getting close to them or if they attack). pyke's R is an auto execute with moderate range that lasts for a set duration where he can basically execute everyone on a team during that window if their hp is kindof low (1/4 or so). If he misses he can just try again during that window. Oh and also he and another teammate get gold from it called \"your cut\". given that supports were recently nerfed in gold income with preseason 10, pyke having this bonus effect is actuall very busted and really snowballs the ever-living hell out of a game in no time if he gets any kills. his map pressure is insane.\n\nthen you have champs like Qiyana which is an assassin with an aoe stun ULT that does massive damage as well along all connecting walls where she ults, including the outer map wall and it literally goes all the way around the map and can kill someone in fountain. it also includes a knockback/knockup before the stun that displaces everyone. Assassins are not supposed to have this kind of CC yet here we are. Riot's design and balance team are driven only by sales and making the LCS look as explosive \"OMG let's see that replay!\" as possible. They want 'huge' plays where people blow each other up from level 1 to level 18 instead of small chess-like plays here and there leading up to bigger teamfight ones later on. I really don't know what else to say about it because they haven't stopped creating these kinds of champions since they started (certainlyT champ designer liked making these snowflake champs that have very small counterplay: aka Yasuo, Aphelios, Akali's new rework, etc) and it's only getting worse. If a champions only counter is to gang up on them and pray you land CC there's a problem. that's everyone's counter. For that to be the only singular counter to a champion .... it's just really bad, unfair design. seriously.\n\nthen you have new items like sanguine blade which boost a split pusher's effectiveness to the point that you literally just can't group up anymore. it takes several players to answer to them.  also umbral glaive, an ad blackout item which gives triple damage on wards while also revealing wards every 40ish seconds for roughly 8 or so seconds (aka 1 shot normal wards, take 3 health from control ward in one hit). no ap equivalent. seems fair, right? the class that has all the mobility and 1v1 damage potential gets to dash and zoom around erasing all of your vision meanwhile vulnerable, immobile enchanter supports have to sit completely still for several seconds per ward on just sweeper lens.\n\nthe game is heavily biased towards lethality and AD champs right now. damage oriented champs in general, to the point that even tanks rarely build as tanks anymore. it's now a game of instantly delete or be instantly deleted. People complain about mages but let me tell you it is not the case at all. the majority of mages rely solely on their burst as they should but now everyone else has burst + something mages lack: mobility. i stopped playing ranked for my own mental health. this game is literally going in the worst possible direction that does not reward diversity or fun anymore. There are champions that force you to back off from lane even under your own turret if they are in pretty good hands (Yasuo, Akali, Fiora) so you just don't get to play the game. feels terrible to play against.\n\nedit: i OTP zyra. she cant spam abilities. you know who can tho? Lux. Brand. Xerath. Morgana. Lux is horrible to lane against with her long range huge aoe slow, shields, q, and ult. She does crazy damage and is also still viable midlane. Zyra isnt even viable midlane in high elo anymore because of the assassins and champs like yasuo + riot reworked her specifically to be a support only. they nerfed the hell out of her plants which can now be 1-2 shot (1 by melee, 2 by ranged) even with enraged by her ultimate. but that all goes back to riot having this false sense of diversity when in reality they cage champions into specific roles now via reworks and nerfs and new champ additions that make olde rones irrelevant. old champs like zyra are completely neglected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Disco Swiss","date":"2020-01-04T14:41:06.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youre not alone. I try to stay as far away from botlane as possible. Riots intentions with Pyke was to make a \"play making support\" so they slapped him with things an assassin would have. \nNot to mention when he kill someone with his resetable execute he gives 300 gold to one person who assisted him with the kill.\nYou didnt mention that, and since you just came back you might of not known.\n\nAlot of talk about the new champs Senna and Aphleios if you haven't noticed.\n\nWhat else.. Since 5 years ago there has been a mobility creep. Its rare if a new champ comes out without some sort of mobility..\nYou missed xp funneling, that was an odd time.\nYou also missed out on the time when adcs sucked so bad that people just played mages bot..\nThey reworked Mordekaiser again and made him an autowin lane champ.\n\nOh yeah. Elder Dragon passive... So damage executes champs at %20..\nGet dragons.","replies":[]}]}
