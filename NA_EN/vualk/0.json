The extended delay you're having with low ping suggests that you're having a packet loss issue.  On the other hand, coming to a grey screen could mean FPS issues due to a hardware or software problem.  I'd like to recommend some steps to help rule out some possibilities.  \n\nAs a first step, run a [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to check your network's connection for packet loss and other issues.  You'll receive a series of troubleshoot steps should any problems be found.
