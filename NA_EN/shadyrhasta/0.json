While there are several potential causes, typically these connection issues are caused by overzealous firewalls or anti-virus programs. Even if you have no active firewalls that you know of, many firewalls are installed automatically with Windows, so you may have as many as 3 and not even know it.\n\nAdditionally, many Firewalls have processes that run in the background after disabling them, which still cause significant interference with our game.\n\nWe have a detailed guide to help you configure your Firewalls to work properly with League of Legends:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#jwq2\n\nUnfortunately, even when properly configured, the disabled modes or exceptions lists often do not function properly for third-party firewalls. It would be much quicker to temporarily uninstall your firewalls from your computer. This would allow me to quickly rule them out as a potential cause of the problem so I can help you get back into the game faster.\n\nIf the problem persists or if I need to clarify something, please don't hesitate to contact me. When you do, providing me with this information will allow me to help get you back into the Fields of Justice as quickly as possible.
