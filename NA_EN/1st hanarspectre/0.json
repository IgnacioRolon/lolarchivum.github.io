When they make changes it's only to placate and they are typically the wrong changes anyway.  It's like what we were seeing with Microsoft when Steve Ballmer was running the show, 10 years of indecision/bad decisions.\n\nAs for your specific complaint, I agree.  If they can't figure out how to work it into the game they need to strip it out and replace it.  They are wasting a lot of their content on characters that are left intentionally dormant.
