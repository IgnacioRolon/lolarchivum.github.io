Dread Nova Darius ended up being that skin. Although now with the new patch out I went to go and try and unlock him and he is not listed as an option and I was hoping someone could explain to me why that is.  I just hope i don&#039; t have unlock one of the hextech exclusives first in order to make Dread Nova Darius appear as an option.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-06T19:28:56.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello hello! \n\nDreadnova Darius hasn't been unlocked yet.
