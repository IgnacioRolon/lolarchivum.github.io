The only way I have found to beat Lucian is not mechanical or items, but that the Lucian has to be somewhat stupid, and you have to catch him doing something stupid.\n\nThat being said, Lucians get away with doing stupid things very often, and it is merely the properties of the champ that saves them, not individual skill or knowledge of the game.  I mean just getting a flash out of the guy is a victory in itself.\n\nLucian is so strong that, when he is played, there is just a complete dominance of the lane.  If you are a superior player, you can still easily get screwed over by his insane burst.  However, when you have the advantage and attempt to use it, he simply dashes away.\n\nThere is no beating a good Lucian in lane.  I, myself play Lucian quite often and I am constantly calling BS with most of my OP maneuvers.  I literally feel bad for the other adc.  The skill level to play Lucian is so low, yet he has so much mobility and can make plays very easily.  I mean, there is such a skill gap in my mind between a good Vayne, for example, and a good Lucian.  Vayne requires so much more practice and skill than the champion that simply dashes to you, autos, Q's, autos,  and by this time, over half of your HP is likely gone, and you've only been able to reply with maybe 1/4 of his health.\n\nI have played countless games against, and as, Lucian.  Many of which as his hardest \"counter\", Vayne.  There is no counter to this guy, he is BS.\n\nEither he needs to be nerfed, or virtually all other Marksmen need to be buffed in order to keep up with this new game.\n\nEDIT: For a nerf, I would suggest a slightly longer reaction time for his Q (even with 90 ping, it is nearly impossible to dodge), that his passive does not crit, and even perhaps that relentless pursuit does not go through walls (this guy escapes too well).  If you can't do the last one, at least buff Vayne to be able to tumble through walls...","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2014-10-13T15:30:07.934+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"His overpowered passive needs to stop critting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2014-10-13T23:26:51.714+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always felt that his burst damage was oppressively high.\nSo, they tried to fix that by reducing his range, and giving him a lot of extra buffs to compensate.

This is why we are discussing this.\n\n>Far as I can tell, nothing but pure domination by way of incredibly skilled/lucky adc/support and heavy ganking.\n\nI don't do ADC often, but from what I'm told, out ranging his basic attack can allow for heavy poke against him, it also helps to have a support with strong disengage to keep his support from locking down the AD while Lucian goes ham.

To have enough range that you can reach from outside a turret's range to near the other side of its range with nothing but a skillshot?

Of course, unlike Lucian he can build mana right from the start, sapphire crystal builds into items that Malphite will use.  I'm not certain Lucian can do that without building a sheen item.\n\nSure, but let's look at the effectiveness of those skills. Malph's Q is his only real range, and does decent damage. His W's not bad, but is really only good when you've gotten close enough to your opponent to actually land multiple AA. E is a pretty limited range and can rarely secure a kill while the opp is running. Malph has no disengage, no chase... nothing even close to Lucian's kit. For the skill/situations required for Malph to be effective, those mana costs are too damn high.\n\n> I don't do ADC often, but from what I'm told, out ranging his basic attack can allow for heavy poke against him, it also helps to have a support with strong disengage to keep his support from locking down the AD while Lucian goes ham.  I don't see many Lucian though lol, then again I loathe ranked games.\n\nI'm not a big ADC player either, but I play enough support to hate the living crap out of Lucian.

Good timing can help most champs side step most skill shots, it's risk/reward.  It can be argued that range or speed could be too good, but you've still got to go through Riot for that lol.  Skill shots are also very good for sieges, stay out of range of the targeted stuns and what not while poking down the enemy team.\n\n>I main Malph/Fid support or Old Sion top, but I'm picking up Singed, Nasus, and some other tops/Jungles lately.\n\nLol I've heard Malph support is good, though heavy on the Ks. xD\nSupport, I typically go with Leona, Karma, Taric or Soraka.\nFYI, one of those times I've seen Lucian, I dueled and beat him with Taric. xD It was hilarious, granted I think this was pre rebalancing for him, it was also pretty late in the game.\n\n>Sure, but let's look at the effectiveness of those skills.

Even without building them though, it's possible to overcome his mana issues with smart spacing of your skills and a mana pot or two.\nAlso consider, as a tank, Malphite plays for the late game, when his damage becomes pretty absurd and he's so tanky it takes two enemies to bring him down.\nNo disengage... no chase... His Q and R both pretty much exemplify these aspects.  Outside of hard CC or Nasus' Whither, if Malphite Q's you, you're not going to get him.

Fiddle' E has a good range, you should be able to harass him pretty well with it and force him out of lane.  By the time your AD is ready to take Lucian on, there should be enough of a gap that your team will win outside of a 2v1.\n\n>I haven't played enough recent Olaf to talk intelligently, but he's considered the poster-boy for having been gutted.

Literally, his ONLY steroid is his passive. Caitlyn is the only other adc with this kind of mechanic, and is known for having ridiculously low overall damage output compared to other carries, in exchange for her other strengths such as range. \n\nLucian's passive is a lot more straight power than Caitlyn's, though, as it can be used multiple times easily, and he has an auto attack reset. His e is barely an auto reset though, and can start delaying your auto attack if your attack speed gets around 2.0. His general disadvantage, I will say again, comes from the fact that every other adc in the game has some form of steroid or range advantage over him, sometimes both. He also lacks a disengage, packing only one escape, where his most often compared character, Vayne, has an escape, a stealth, and a disengage. She also has two of the better steroids in the game, +70 ad and silver bolts are nothing to scoff at, where tumble eventually becomes a better, while shorter range, version of Lucian's e in sheer stats. \n\nHow do you beat Lucian, then? The answer is to not lose. He is a lane bully, don't try to beat him in lane, let him make a mistake, or instead just try to make it to late game. Any adc with a superior steroid will just outright outdamage Lucian if you are similar in gold. Draven, for example, can be down half an item, but because of the sheer steroids on his kit, can kill Lucian first in a duel, and also packs one of the better range disengages in the game, performing similarly to how you would use Thresh's Flay.\n\nAll of this is why Tristana is still the most popular adc in high ranked play. While she may have issues early game, being outranged by caitlyn and outdamaged by anyone with a nuke, if she gets to late game, she has an on-demand huge steroid with the best constant basic attack range in the game, allowing her to just deal more damage than every other marksman in the game reliably. She's also packing one of the highest range leaps in the game, arguably the best disengage in the game, and grievous wounds.\n\nWhy, then, would you pick Lucian over Tristana? Early game strengths, with still decent late game mobility and not half bad damage output. But almost exclusively early game strengths.\n\nDon't play to win, play to not lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkyard","date":"2014-10-13T19:24:09.180+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Don't play to win, play to not lose.\n\nPersonally, I play to outplay and outsmart.  But Lucian's kit makes him immune to virtually any outplay, and very difficult to outsmart when you are constantly half health, behind in CS, and hoping that laning will end soon.\n\nThat being said, Lucian can outplay/do stupid things without repercussions, unlike any other adc.  I mean, the things I get away with as Lucian are facepalm worthy.\n\nWhen it comes to cait, I understand that she is a lane bully, that is her thing.  But I can 1 v 1 her easily with Draven, Twitch, Vayne, I mean, you name the adc and you can probably beat Cait 1 v 1.  She has a legitimate weakness, but at the same time, she has 650 range, which is certainly a legitimate strength.  \n\nLucian dominates in lane, excels in 1 v 1, and his teamfight is also fantastic because of his mobility and aoe damage.  The burst from his passive is stupid.  In general this guy needs to be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Tadiken","date":"2014-10-13T22:09:56.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lucian's outplay is literally the same mechanic that Vayne has.
