There's nothing wrong with that, but the problem is when the only time Riot DOES talk about the mode, they try selling Dominion as the same thing despite actually having much higher peaks than SR due to the constant PvP action and objective contests. Sure, it's got a different flavor than SR, but if the map was actually marketed to the proper demographic there would be plenty of people interested.\n\nI mean, there's obviously some kind of population to tap into given that almost every other MOBA released recently has a form of Domination game play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2014-05-19T05:38:22.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think if there was ranked Dominion people would try and learn the map?

Like sure there still has to be balancing issues especially since I don't quite see a meta in Dominion as of now, but that's the reason why it fell off. There was no reason to learn or enjoy Dominion. For example something Nintendo learned was that the community loves games because of the ranked experience, that's why they are improving online play for SSB4. Another example would be COD. Do you think people will still play the game if there was no ranked experience? Do you think people would still play LoL if Ranked 5x5 SR was removed?

I feel that it's only fair to say that while the top 100 players are significantly better than your average bronze player, it's also unfair to say that simply because they were challenger last season, they would still be as good. \n\nWhile I'll admit this situation is unfair, remember that your MMR score doesn't translate across game modes. I may be a decent ranked 5v5 player, but my normal Treeline rating is eh at best, simply because I don't play it often. As far as I am aware, it's pretty darn hard to get into Challenger if you don't play this game a lot, and it's even harder if you have to invest yourself in other game modes. It's honestly absurd to expect their rating to accurately reflect how good your enemies were  as a player, because they don't really play Dominion as much. \n\nThough, this really hits the real problem. Simply because I'm a decent player in 5v5, I should be expected to do well in Twisted Treeline? Sure, they have the same champion pool, but the environment is so different that I'd probably flounder.

It's pretty unlikely that there's going to be another challenger premade queuing at the same time. Would it have been more fair if they had gotten matched with a bronze premade?\n\nThird, as unbalanced as it initially seems, statistically, everyone on your team except Cass has *some* stat that's comparable to them:\n\n* Braum, Akali, and you have the same number of normal wins as Lucian, Cho, and Fiora.\n* Varus is Gold, to Blitz's Plat  \n* Cass/nid is obviously unbalanced\n\nFinally, let's imagine matchmaking trying to make a balanced team. To make up the team facing the challengers, it's going to take anyone who's plat or better. But how many plats are actually in que? I'd guess not many, since anyone who took the time to get to plat clearing likes SR, and only plays Dominion occasionally.\n\nContinued in the reply to this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-19T00:06:51.081+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Let's say one plat ques up every 2 minutes.

If (player 1) isn't willing to wait for 8 minutes, then someone else (player 2) needs to be willing to do that wait (and if they leave, player 3 needs to be willing, etc).

Now you need to find another person, so everyone's que times go up again! Now they look like this.

What's worse, 13 minutes of hilarious roflstomping, and then on to the next thing, or 14 minutes of que times doing nothing, followed by what might be a more even match, but is probably still 13 minutes of roflstomping?\n\nNow, presumably they are willing to wait a long time, because they knew what they were getting themselves into. However, there are still a ton of factors I haven't considered:\n\n* What if the players waiting 4 or 2 minutes respectively, didn't want to tough it out?  \n* When I say players “are willing to wait,” that actually means, “will sit in que for that long without hitting the little red X. Because after spending 7 minutes in que, you start to wonder whether matchmaking has forgotten about you, and might hit that button even if you *would* have been willing to wait, if you had known a match was coming.\n* Players aren't found every two minutes, on the dot. 3 players might be found immediately, and then 2 more, 8 minutes later. In that case, 3 players wait for 8 minutes and 2 have no que time.\n---\nAnyway, that's my little spiel. I didn't actually end up doing much math, because I didn't feel like doing such complex calculations, and I felt like my point was well-proved without them, but I can and will do them if you want to give me numbers for the following:\n\n* Number of seconds between each plat+ player entering que (in this example, 120).\n* Chance of a player being willing to wait X number of seconds, where X is in increments of the previous number (in this example, 120/240/360/480 seconds, etc).\n* Cutoff after which practically nobody is willing to wait","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malah","date":"2014-05-19T16:57:44.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, if you're playing Dominion then SR ranks are totally worthless.
