Problem is, the indicators for {{item:2044}} and {{item:3340}} look exactly the same to me. One is green, and one is yellow, so they look exactly the same to me at a glance, especially because they are both circles. Sure one may have an extra ring around it but how could I notice that with the half a second I have to see it?\n\nMy suggestion for the small ward indicators is to change the shape of them instead of simply adding a ring around it. Make them a triangle or a diamond and I would be able to tell the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-06-21T19:35:35.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warding Totem should be yellow, though I still trust that they look the same to you.\n\nI'll bring up the suggestion; I think changing shape is a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-06-21T21:14:29.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah yellow, don't know why I said blue, still look very similar though :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"JackYAqua","date":"2014-06-21T19:48:47.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you add a barely visible circle of light around the wards so we know how far they reveal?
