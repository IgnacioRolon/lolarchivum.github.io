I have multiple accounts and I don't want to have to grind each and every one of them to play ranked like that. I already grinded them all for the masteries and champs. Plus, when you play with a known group of folks it's nice to be able to pull out that secret pick they didn't know you played because you practiced it in secret on an alt, so your op.gg, lolnexus, lolking, or whatever you feel like using doesn't show that champ.\n\nPlus there's the fact that mastery doesn't even mean you know how to play the champ. I got lvl 5 mastery on Teemo but still lose like 80% of the matches I play with him cause I'm bad at kiting.

I can guarantee to you that I will perform better on Jhin than I would on Tahm Kench, a champion that is a must-pick/ban in the pro scenes and a insta-ban in solo queue. I will perform better on Jhin than I would on Eve, a cancer champion for an entire year that also made appearances in the pro scenes. I would perform better on Jhin than I would on Vayne, one of the most well-known and used champion in the history of league.\n\nWhy? Because I'm typically bad at the champions I've mentioned and decent at champions like Jhin. You don't need to see a champion to understand its play style:\n\nPassive: Cait's passive\nQ: Ryze's bouncing thing with a different damage calculation\nW: Lucian's Q with CC\nE: Teemo's shrooms with less damage and AOE effect\nR: Xerath's ult but with a straight line skill shot twist\n\nHow to play Jhin:\n1. Harass with every 4th hit.\n2. Use W in combo with Support Harass to proc CC\n3. Place flower (e) things in gank entrances and bushes, or use to zone if pushing\n4. R units out of position/too far from your position, or if you are dying and want to dish out your last remaining damages.\n\nOf course, a new player wouldn't be completely proficient and might have to warm up, but Jhin seems like a really easy champion to play. *I've never played him before.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2016-02-02T21:58:25.572+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"From a financial standpoint though, this gives people even less of an incentive to pay the inflated release IP prices, so I doubt Riot will ever do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-02-03T01:28:41.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iainB85,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ahOigWaw,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-02-02T21:58:25.572+0000)\n>\n> From a financial standpoint though, this gives people even less of an incentive to pay the inflated release IP prices, so I doubt Riot will ever do it.\n\nThey could raise it 1k and i still wouldnt spend rp on new champs.
