Help???","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys. I was playing a game of kha'zix yesterday which my team was most likely going to win. Everything was going good in terms of gameplay until my client went in a smaller window. Every time I clicked it was pinging and I couldn't even use the menu or anything. I used ctrl+alt+del and closed out of league in task manager. I rejoined the match- same problem. I tried to use the menu and fix my resolution but that wouldn't work. I used task manager and quit again and I relogged into my client. Until the game was over, in the client, it just said: Game Still In Progress with no possible way to rejoin the game. (I treid Alt+Tab to see if there was another window open but there wasn't). I waited and later that night, I got a Bug Splat error which I accidentially declined. Can you guys please take my 20 min q away because it's absurd how I'm getting punished for something that wasn't my doing. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-05T00:54:45.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you were marked as a leaver, which resulted in a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty.  Even if it's not intentional, the system may apply this queue after a history of leaving and not just a single game.  Even if it's not intentional, leaving still causes others a negative experience and not something we remove.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
