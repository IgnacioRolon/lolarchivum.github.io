But I'm assuming it has to do with Mouse Acceleration in game. Please correct me if I'm wrong. And if it does has to do with Mouse Acceleration as I hope, Can I Disable it? Is it safe to change or will I be ban for doing so? Simply by turning the \"1\" to a \"0\".","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T20:50:42.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't recommend modifying game files, because it can ultimately result in causing you issues or even crashes.  Selecting to do so is up to you, just be wary and stick to the settings in-game to change around your mouse config.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
