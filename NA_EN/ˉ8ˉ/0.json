Please don't hate too much ;]\n\nMany of us in the past reached point, where playing only on one account wasn't enough. Either for fun, due to boredom, for leveling experiences/low ELO games or to try crazy troll builds - we created \"smurfs\" accounts. A lot of them sometimes.\n\nNext pre-season will be challenging - there will be a lot of changes and one of them leads me to this idea.\nSome of us made \"smurfs\" because playing ranked/farm IP was simply boring. With new leveling system this will no longer occur, so new accounts for that also won't be needed.\n\nI've came with idea to allow players to merge their multiple accounts into one, what will allow them to - with new system -profit more from their time spent in LoL.\n\n**THE IDEA:**\n1. Accounts Merge will be optional and based on player decision (within set pre-season time frame?).\n2. Process will be irreversible and cause to transfer assets from secondary account to main account - with deletion of secondary account.\n3. Accounts can be merged only within one region (no cross-region merge). Region transfers still available on normal conditions.\n4. You will be able to merge your account within LoL Client:\n\n* Log into main account -> Store -> Account -> Account Merge (new tab)\n\n* STEP 1 - login into secondary account (within Account Merge tab)\n\n* STEP 2 - two columns: 1st with assets from 2nd accounts (RP, IP, Champion and Skins list, etc.) - 2nd column with transferred asset value (read below about that).\n\n* STEP 3 - Double confirmation and required \"I AGREE\" stuff.\n\n\nTransferred assets value (just my ideas, how to solve problems)\n\n* RP Points - transferred fully to main account\n\n* IP/Essence - transferred with some deduction (10%/25%?) to main account\n\n* Loot Tab - transferred fully to main account\n\n* Champion NOT owned - transferred to main account\n\n* Champion owned - 50% (25?) of IP refunded to main account\n\n* Champion Mastery - TWO POSSIBILITIES: 1. Choose higher from both accounts OR 2. Sum it up.\n\n* Champion Skin NOT owned - transferred to main account\n\n* Champion Skin owned - IP refund depending on skin rarity (I'm not even trying to set any numbers here)\n\n* Summoner Icon NOT owned - transferred  to main account\n\n* Summoner Icon owned - If Icon is from Store - some level of refund, If from event - NOT transferred (no double icons)\n\n* Rune Pages - Basic two rune pages NOT transferred, additionally bought pages - transferred (after 20 pages cap - not transferred)\n\n* Additional stuff I didn't think of :]\n\n**PROS FOR PLAYERS:**\n\n* Merging accounts progress that they aren't using into main account\n\n* Allowing full focus on new system.\n\n* More Essences to spend in time-limited shop in pre-season.\n\n* Additional stuff I didn't think of :]\n\n**CONS FOR PLAYERS:**\n\n* I don't think any additional option can be a drawback...\n\n\n**PROS FOR RIOT:**\n\n* Disappearance of thousand \"ghost\" forever-gold/forever-unranked accounts data from database\n\n* Compacting player database\n\n* Focusing players in their ELO, minimizing amount of \"smurfing\" and players playing below their ELO.\n\n* Possibility to run database clean-up, deleting long term inactive accounts below level 5/10.\n\n* Freeing lots of account logins and summoner names for new players \n\n* Additional stuff I didn't think of :]\n\n**CONS FOR RIOT:**\n\n* A lot of work...\n\n\nThanks for reading all of this. Please, feel free to show me constructive criticism :]","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-09-04T01:01:07.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skin idea can't work. If you transfer the skins to the main account it means that the player didn't got 4 chests per month, but 8 which is a clear advantage that can't work out.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T02:33:14.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of maaaaaaany reasons as to why we can't merge accounts or exchange content between them outside of gifting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-09-04T17:10:34.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then people would have to be extra careful against hackers so they don't get their account stolen and merged into the hackers account","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T00:04:02.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've certainly put a lot of work into this idea that's for sure! There's not a lot I can do with this idea though, since merging accounts isn't something we can do and isn't likely to be a feature in the future. You're welcome to repost this over in General Discussion to see how the community feels about it and generate more discussion though!","replies":[{"poster":"ˉ8ˉ","date":"2017-09-04T05:54:35.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I though I'm missing something that won't allow this idea to happen.\nLike I said - it was just my thinking in some free time, tired of soloQ and I was certain there are some flaws.\n\nIf someone will find it here, he will leave his impression but it isn't so awesome to repost it over and over.\nI'm sure that if you (Riot) eventually find a way to implement such option in any shape, it will be way better than anything I can though as just one person.\n\nThanks for response :)","replies":[]}]}]}
