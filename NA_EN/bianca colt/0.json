I like playing Illaoi and it gets extremely frustrating when, for example, Singed&#039;s poison literally burns through my E&#039;s duration just because I touched it slightly. Example:\n\n> Enemies standing in the cloud&#039;s trail are poisoned for 2 seconds, taking magic damage every 0.25 seconds for the duration\n\n...which means that a single instance of his poison will reduce Illaoi&#039;s E duration by **8 seconds** in just 2 seconds.\n\nBasically, every time the target of Illaoi&#039;s E hits Illaoi, the duration of her E (active spirit on the field) decreases by 1 second. Same applies to DoT effects, which make it impossible for your E to survive for more than 2 seconds at best. \n\nCan we do something about that? Can we make it so that DoT effects don&#039;t have as much power at decreasing her E&#039;s duration? I know she's not the most popular champion at the moment, but this would at least be a nice buff for her without messing with her numbers at all.","replies":[{"poster":"0 Hogapu","date":"2018-09-16T13:09:14.501+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"Change the way enenmies can interact with Vessels. atm, it is all about hitting a lot of times the Vessel, and not about hitting a lot.
