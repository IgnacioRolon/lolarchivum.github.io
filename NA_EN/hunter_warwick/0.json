Stop \"being a jerk\" and come discuss with me.\n\nMy other account got banned for saying that people who like lolis are %%%%%%%%%s.\n\nUmm, that's not offensive or \"being a jerk,\" it's the literal definition of the word. You're not allowed to ban me for that. I didn't call anyone in the thread a %%%%%%%%%, I just said that people who like lolis are %%%%%%%%%s, which is true and entirely non-confrontational or insulting.\n\nI submitted a ticket to support. I will not stand by while the mods run rampant on their power trip. I'm done playing nice.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep forgetting that down-votes don't actually mean anything anymore. Down-vote away.\nEdit2: I'm impressed by the sheer amount of down-votes I'm getting for seemingly no reason. Keep them coming, guys!","replies":[]}
