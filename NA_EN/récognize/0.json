But I dont think I have been that toxic from what riot&#039;s logs are showing . In the first match I was just advising a shaco not to buy a worthless item , the only think i said was that our midlaner was bad , a simple statement , and i asked myself the question why bother playing ranked if I keep on getting bad teammates . Moving on to match 2 , i simply again stated that someone is bad , im not gonna say defend myself i was upset , but that was me controlling myself from saying much worse ,  i put out my huge anger out in a simple word : bad ,  Match number 3 , tilted from previous games , i started with this sentence  praying outloud : may god give me teammates with a brain before the game starts , then I tilted because I was getting camped , again I don&#039;t think that deservers a 14 days ban considering I have never been chat restricted before.\n\nNow im not saying these chats logs dont deserve a punishment , but they are far less toxic than chat logs I usually see on this forum.\n\nMatch 1:\n[20:21] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): shaco\n[20:24] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): hunters potion\n[20:26] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): is garbage\n[20:27] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): never buy it\n[20:29] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): waste of gold\n[23:20] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): give me a breakkkkk\n[27:08] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): this ahri so bad\n[29:36] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): its like\n[29:46] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): why even bother play ranked\n[29:49] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): so bad\n[29:53] RecognizeUrLord (Riven): so freaking bad\n\nMatch 2:\n[0:11] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): un mammouth dans la jungle ca fait peur\n[1:21] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): not really\n[1:24] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): lvl 1 turrets are op\n[9:03] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): oke ekko\n[11:06] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): why u running\n[11:07] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): come\n[12:29] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): LUX\n[12:33] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): how are u only\n[12:34] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): 10 cs\n[12:35] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): more than\n[12:37] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): ekko\n[12:40] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): when u didnt move from ur lane\n[12:41] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): once?\n[12:58] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): damnnn\n[12:59] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): so bad\n[14:46] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): u wanna 1v1 after this ?\n[15:29] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): oke\n[15:30] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): oke\n[16:01] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): surrender soon\n[16:16] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): all lanes losing\n[19:32] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): ur bad\n[19:34] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): thats wtf\n[22:48] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): can u guys surrender\n[22:54] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): we arent gonna win this\n[23:34] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): heimer jgl wining\n[23:35] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): just omfg\n[24:55] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): legit\n[24:57] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): 1v9\n[25:02] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): get me out of here\n[26:01] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): can u u srender\n[26:09] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): i have other matters to attend\n[28:02] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): u guys\n[28:05] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): should practice more\n[28:07] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): in normals\n[28:11] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): before playing ranked\n[28:13] RecognizeUrLord (Sona): seriously\n\nMatch 3:\n[1:20] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): may god give me teammates with a brain\n[11:08] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): u fkin kidding me ?\n[11:13] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): camp , party\n[11:19] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): ur bot lane is that much handicaped?\n[11:39] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): u think we didnt see him when he was hiding in bush for 3 minutes\n[12:54] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): surrender this\n[16:20] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): always blessed with such amazing teams\n[19:41] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): this teamm is horribleeeeee\n[20:33] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): loool\n[20:42] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): u think ur important ?\n[20:44] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): ur not thresh\n[21:10] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): ur report wont affect me\n[22:25] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): cuz i havent done anything\n[22:40] [All] RecognizeUrLord (Quinn): someone wann add me after this so u can see how easily im gonna q up after?\n\nYou guys can even look at the timers its not like I was spending my time chatting...","replies":[{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2017-02-24T02:31:55.250+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you only use chat to call people \"bad\" or be passive aggressive.

And yes these logs are not severe but they are still breaking the rules. The way the punishment system works, you move up in tiers every time you get punished. The 14 day suspension is the final one before a permaban. I'm just trying to warn you. Take some time during these two weeks to read the PB&M board, people get banned all the time for this. \n\nCalling someone bad when they make a misplay doesn't help at all. It only makes the other player feel worse about how they are preforming. You can say that's your goal and they should improve from you making fun of them but Riot doesn't agree. They are the ones that call the shots.\n\nEDIT: Spamming chat can be punishable too but so is using it only to insult other players, regardless of how infrequent it is.

That said it doesn't look anything too bad. But please mind that they don't send all reported chatlogs, only the 3 most recent. So I'd wager you were reported for graver things in the past and those games were just the drops that caught up with the flood. \n\nUltimately your punishment isn't that bad, since it's still early in the season you won't lose the ranked rewards, you'll just be locked out of rewards for about 50 games or so and then everything will be like it was. Just take this as a wake up call and from now on think twice before saying anything, and if it's something negative just skip it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-02-24T20:14:50.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If those are the actual unedited chat logs then they definitely aren't enough to skip to 14 days.","replies":[{"poster":"Récognize","date":"2017-02-24T21:15:01.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is not way I will risk editing them considering any rioter could expose me , I haven't touched a single thing and these are the complete logs I have been provided when I submitted a support ticket","replies":[]}]}]}
