They get the pages from the story devs or sound people and it&#039;s just their job to translate them and send them back?\r\nOr do Riot Games outsource for this kind of thing? Is there a company whose sole purpose is to translate a cornucopia of text into a bunch of different languages? Do they get to work on a lot of different games? Do they just get translation jobs from big companies?\r\n\r\nMainly asking because I&#039;m 21, working a pretty lame retail job and I speak three languages as *basically* my native tongues. I always dismissed the idea of working as a middle man for a bunch of retailers or translating user manuals, but mixing my adeptness at languages with my love for video games would be something I could get behind. Now I just wanna know where I can apply/how these things work. And hey, if Rito got job offers... ;)\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-08-06T21:38:36.667+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak to the structure, because I definitely don't know it intimately, but I can say that our local teams in regions do a bang up job working on really _really_ tight timelines and getting things _right_ for local players. There's a few things that are actually really interesting about what you're talking about, which we call \"Localization.\"\n\nThe first thing is that in the case of in game VO, some ideas and jokes simply don't make sense or aren't part of a local culture. Sometimes a joke that's funny because of the way it's spoken in North America doesn't make any damn sense in China! So at times, localization teams become part of the writing process, helping to shape a regional actor's performance to fit the idea for another culture.\n\nA second component in both our in game and cinematics is specific to the audio team. Our sound designers put a lot of love, thought, and iteration into how a champion sounds. Riot KarateMonkey spent ages hand placing the sounds of Urgot's mask respirator! We have to create entire \"recipes\" for local teams to use in creative ways to get the same kind of processing on their actors, and reproduce the original tastefully for their language. This isn't simply following steps, but actually listening and making sure it sounds good for the language.\n\nFinally, in our documentaries like Legends Rising or Live/Play, there are sometimes _GIANT_ teams of translators that we hire to help in subtitling and making sure that non-english dialog is edited correctly. I don't know Thai, so for Live/Play Fight, at the end of an edit I'd have a translator sit with me and listen and help make sure I wasn't cutting off any words. I remember for an episode of Live/Play (I think :/) it was almost _impossible_ to find an isreali translator. Why? It's not just that they need to speak the language in question, but that they need to know how to translate _League Of Legends_ into their language. There's a lot of colloquial terminology to League that, unless you're inside the community, you simply don't know. I mean, think of the first time you heard ADC, gank, jungle creep, CC, Nexus, backline, TP. Even if you know your language, it doesn't mean you know the word or concept behind a word. Translators have to be League players, community members, writers, _and_ know their craft!","replies":[{"poster":" Monsieur Blanc","date":"2017-08-07T15:40:17.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/Z4knRJEe-ornn-and-what-ornn-might-be","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silven","date":"2017-08-07T15:33:29.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I know what you mean. For example Master Yi's \"Wuju hand me that potion\" line would be difficult to translate into any other language but english, so there would be need for another, still fitting, joke to replace it.\n\nStill, I'd be interested in getting to know the process more and well, knowing what it would realistically look like as a job.
