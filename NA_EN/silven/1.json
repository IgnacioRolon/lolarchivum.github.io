This is a pirate hunter. A badass lady that strikes fear in the hearts of even the most ruthless swashbucklers and isn't afraid of taking lives. That's my definition of Miss Fortune.\n\nHer classic skin in comparison looks like a scantily-clad prostitute with a traffic cone perched ontop of her head.\n\nI'm not necessarily appealing for a visual rework or anything considering she just got a TU (and I mainly use the Road Warior MF skin anyway), but it's quite a shame Riot decided to make this new look of Miss Fortune an optional skin for her when, in my opinion, it fulfills the champion's fantasy better than her classic skin does.\n\nUpvote if you feel the same and maybe Rito-senpai will notice us.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: In case you're familiar with the recent Gangplank changes, I hope you understand that they make my point even more believable. To recap the current thoughts:\nMiss Fortune does not look like the badass lady she is because the Classic Skin depicts her in a previous era, a time in which she was still gaining influence and power in Bilgewater and used her 'killer charme' to get things done. At this current point in lore, meaning *right now*, however, she is indeed Captain Fortune and ought to look the part.\nGangplank, now, has recieved a **base model** update, changing his Classic Skin to depict him in the current time, after the events of Burning Tides.\n\nNow I feel like Riot is just taking the piss. Gangplank's new look, post-Dead-Pool, is his base skin, but for Miss Fortune's post-Dead-Pool attire we need to pay? This just doesn't make any sense. Either update them both so their new classic skins are from the same time, that being after their respective events, or you leave them both with their genuine 'Classic' skins and then make skins for the current time in lore. But it makes no sense to just update one to what he would look like now and leave the other hanging in her past!","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-07-31T18:56:09.903+0000","up_votes":109,"down_votes":6,"body":"I've always been of the opinion that Captain Fortune should've been her default skin.","replies":[{"poster":"KeydiamX","date":"2015-07-31T19:15:22.739+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much this.

Go and pay for that\"\n\nBut Miss Fortune isn't a sexist joke. She may be sexy, and she may have used her body to her advantage, but she respects her body and expected others to do the same. In lore, she killed a man and took his ship for touching her inappropriately. In game, Her lines include a lot of innuendo, but she isn't complacent and seductive and willing to bed. She's assertive and taunting- She's beautiful, and that makes you less than her.\n\nForm follows function. If you had called Zyra a \"sexist joke\" I might have understood your feelings. There's no reason for Zyra to be humanoid at all, let alone a sexy woman dressed in leaves. But Miss Fortune has a reason to be both assertive and sexy, and I think that Riot did a good job of designing her with charisma and dynamite as opposed to a redhead bimbo or a courtesan-style manipulator.\n\nI agree that Riot's overall champion designs have been off-point in terms of male and female representation. But Miss Fortune is a good example of when a female champion should be beautiful and should be sexy, and in a positive, empowering way.\n\nLet's not confuse \"countering sexism\" with \"slut shaming\".","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-08-01T11:14:39.547+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me rephrase tha:.
