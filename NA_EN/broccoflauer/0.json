He was my favorite champion. Old ult was flexible because you could use it both offensively and defensively. It was so satisfying landing in the enemy team with E then press R to bounce around causing havoc in teamfights, it even had some skill in positioning in which direction you wanted enemies to land. He felt so active, radical and crazy! Now he feels clunky as hell. I can agree on Q feeling a bit uninspired and samey to W so I wouldn't have minded a rework on that. But sacrificing R for more CC on Q and 'reactionary counterplay' was not the way to go. With 'reactionary counterplay' I think they saw E knockup to R knockup had little counterplay so they made this be-a-pizza-for-1-sec thing so enemies could react to his cc plays. But that's not an argument imo because other champions have even crazier combos. Why bounce around having fun when you can stand still, become a pizza for a few seconds then bounce 1 time a few yards away. So interactive and fun! I'd rather have you keep the old Q and delete the slow just to have old R back. \n\nI loved old Fiora, they remade her so I went to old Shen. I loved old Shen, they remade him so I went to Zac.
