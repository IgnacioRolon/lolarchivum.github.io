Does this mean something is wrong with the site? or does it mean the PBE is closed for sign ups? And actually I sent the request at least 5 or 6 months but there wasn't any respond to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T21:17:54.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment pbe sign ups are closed for maintenance, which is probably the reason you're seeing that error 500. No worries though, because I do see that we got your application when you sent it last year! \n\nAt this point, be on the lookout for an acceptance email when you do get invited to join the pbe servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Totemsss","date":"2017-04-10T01:28:02.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you very much~","replies":[]}]}]}
