This isn&#039;t about the last 4 days either. Last season was constantly toxic, and this season ranked is the worst I&#039;ve ever personally seen it. \n\nMy 14 year old cousin as I&#039;m watching him play the other day because I&#039;m 34, proceeded to have 3 out of the 3 games he played in be full of hate, and cursing, and AFK&#039;s, to the point where he turned off the 3rd ranked game because he was 5v4 anyhow losing when the jungler AFK&#039;d because he fought with the mid laner, and he turned on his XBox 1 and played Destiny.\n\nI&#039;m currently serving a 25 game chat restriction that I&#039;m nearly finished for defending myself from 2 toxic bully&#039;s in 2 games out of 6 in last week. Which is fine, I did tell one of the toxic bully&#039;s to be quiet and that he needed to grow up before I muted him.\n\nRegardless Riot, YOUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN.\n\nGet rid of chat all together - OR - Give players an interface OPTION to have no chat at all ON or OFF making OFF chat players NOT RE PORTABLE OR CAPABLE OF REPORTING for chat/verbal offenses.\n\nAdd in voice comms with option for no comms players and be able to record voice comms and hold players accountable with recording.\n\nOR make ranked for 18+ only and let it be the ANARCHY that it already is with a million warnings, a million smurf accounts, and a million toxic people every game.\n\nOR AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE\n\nStart INSTANT Permanently banning accounts non stop for ANY of the following offenses with ZERO WARNING:\n\nIntentionally AFK proven by comms chat. &quot;Fine screw you guys cya&quot; goes AFK\nintentionally feed proven by comms. &quot;I can die more if you want&quot; proceeds to die 3 times in 2 minutes.\nPlayers who use any of the following words or phrases:\nRace Hate and Toxicity \nReligious Hate and Toxicity \nSexual degrading or Hatred or gender preference slurs \nViolent words or threats or telling people to go die p\nPure Hatred such as this ridiculous use of the word &quot;cancer&quot; calling players &quot;cancer&quot; or wishing &quot;cancer&quot; on people.\n\nNo more warning players Riot. No more 14 day bans. No more soft warning. No more chat restrictions.  \n\nSTART INSTANTLY PERMANENTLY BANNING ACCOUNTS.\n\nMessage the entire community, and tell them all, THIS is your warning. Make them agree to Terms of Service, And start banning every player every match until your filter it all out or change it all out.\n\nOtherwise Riot, your just instigators banning over long periods of time, almost encouraging this toxic community, to have players Buy RP! Buy RP! Buy RP! Then you ban them eventually, so they can get another account and Buy RP Buy RP Buy RP!\n\nITS BULL.\n\nThe system is a joke. No one respects this system. It doesn&#039;t work. Players such as myself are quitting.\n\nAnd I can say this after playing season 1 until now and barely having any one I know still play the game. Its been a gradual fail thats now just out of control in ranked on the rift.\n\nI&#039;m honestly done with the game. It&#039;s a joke of a ranked community. \n\nI gave you a ton of options and ideas that your ignorant company of leaders and staff should swallow their pride and listen to in an attempt to fix it. \n\nOtherwise Fail moving forward. If I&#039;m 34 and I&#039;m done with the game. And my 14 year old cousin doesn&#039;t like the game and would rather play other games, and none of my friends from season 1,2, or 3 play the game in ranked anymore, THAT SURE SAYS SOMETHING.\n\nIf it smells like a rat, looks like a rat, and eats cheese, ITS A RAT! \n\nGames are suppose to be competitive, AND OR FUN recreation-ally and competitively ENJOYABLE\n\nYOUR GAME NO LONGER IS OUTSIDE YOUR SPECIAL LITTLE NICHES WITHIN PRO LEVEL AND STAFF FUN AND The occasional (NOT THE NORM) good games.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2017-08-15T05:18:29.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the OP was a little long, but I agree with some of the sentiment. I'm sure the ranked games are quite toxic, even among teammates. I've never turned on the global chat, because..why really? Its discouraging that so many people downvoted this, and that some of these hateful practices are allowed to continue. Race and other personal characteristics should have no influence over a badly balanced computer game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-08-14T12:57:07.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Otherwise Fail moving forward.

Goodbye and have fun playing other games.\n\n> I gave you a ton of options and ideas that your ignorant company of leaders and staff should swallow their pride and listen to in an attempt to fix it.\n\nAll of the ideas you gave riot just involve harsher punishments for more trivial things.  Tell me why you think permantently banning accounts on their first chat offence (being toxic) would be fair or result in people being less toxic?  \n\nPeople aren't rational and they certainly aren't going to stop being toxic.  Harsh punishments for differing levels of offences just incetivizes people to go all out.  Instead of just flaming in a game (which you can mute) people will start instantly trolling/afking if they dislike their team because they will be perma banned anyways, might as well go all out.   Then they can just buy another account (of which the market will boom like never before).\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to just restrict their ability to chat?  Then dial up the punishment if they offend after the ban is over culminating in multiple warnings and permanently banned account?   Its why we dont have the same jail times for murder and assault.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2017-08-15T05:32:00.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with OP though. I just got a 10 day chat ban for telling someone to \"stop being a cry baby.\" I was constantly being flamed at and harassed in game. I got annoyed and said that to 'em. Haven't played in a couple days. Boom, chat ban. Shit's getting ridiculous, with everyone's feelings being made of glass and getting so easily offended.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-08-17T00:45:06.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the only thing you said?  In that one game?\n\nlol if thats it then I would recommend sending riot a ticket asking to be unbanned from chat since you clearly don't deserve it.   Do they give you chat logs for a chat ban?  Idk, I've said way worse than that and have yet to ever get a chat ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2017-08-17T01:21:19.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also called that same person a \"self entitled college brat.\" Not my proudest moment, but I was very frustrated. There were no derogatory remarks, cursing or racial slurs. No KYS or anything like that. There wasn't even a negative chat trend leading up to the ban. It was just that one match. I submitted a ticket and they quoted me on those two things for the reason being chat banned. Very lame. They even told me to report toxic people, but not tell them I am reporting them because that is punishable. I wrote them back and told them how I felt about it. Probably fell on deaf ears but it felt good telling them to screw off in a nice and professional manner.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I Love Thresh","date":"2017-08-15T05:24:22.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"De-escalating works, you should try it sometimes instead of staying silent","replies":[]}]}
