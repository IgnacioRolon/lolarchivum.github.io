Those are probably exceptions made in his or their coding, as both spells are displacements, on which he usually can ult.\nMy guess would be that they used the knock-up coding for Xayah ult, to save on the animation, but forgot to exclude her from Yasuos ult targetting.\nHowever, I've never seen this bug happening (and I've played my fair share of Yasuo games), so I can't tell for sure. Maybe it was a one time thing","replies":[{"poster":"underscores222","date":"2017-09-03T03:31:13.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When he was released, Riot clarified - only allied (to Yas) knockups count, though generally any forced movement (knockbacks, etc) also trigger it.  So Trist jumps, Ziggs blasts, and so on do not count.  Xayah should be in the same boat, as she technically isn't \"airborne\" even though her animation shows her being \"up\".  In a similar way, Trist cannot jump over a powerballing Rammus - she will get hit and fall out of the air, even though her model technically never visually touched.
