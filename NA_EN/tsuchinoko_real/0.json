(I'm aware that the tickets expire on 9/11.) I was personally hoping to save these for next patch when the Star Guardian skins launch next patch and get lucky with the opening. Alternatively, do skins that get launched also get immediately added to the pool of skins that are contained in loot rewards of this sort?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T20:34:05.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The orbs themselves shouldn't expire I don't believe, but the loot tables for them won't be updating either I don't believe. The loot tables for those orbs are designed around the Arcade event, so it wouldn't make much sense if they started dropping loot from other events.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsuchinoko Real","date":"2017-08-13T09:13:53.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
