Really Riot, the reason he was capable of doing so well to begin with was because Triforce gave him HP, you received HP in your masteries, he actually did 'decent' mixed damage when he pressed his W, and he had been slightly more mobile than he currently is with the 5 additional movespeed, slightly tankier stats and a skill that didn't lock him down. From a diehard Kog main, please take this into consideration if you see it. He needs stat buffs in addition to an AD buff. Just my opinion.

I.E Sion, feels extremely satisfying when i ult right down mid lane, time my shield, and land it right as the q goes off. Lux/Kassadin would be the combos, Kayle/Sion a kind of hybrid, Garen/Amumu is all decision making. IDC about that loser who says Garen is face-mash. He actually takes decent risk reward, because if you 1v5 it does not go well, no matter how skilled you are. Treat him like an assassin but with more tank and less mobility, if you try anything but continuous picks you will get beaten on.

Love everything about her.  Her abilities, her upbeat personality, her \"I'm about to have a psychotic breakdown\" laugh, and her long-range playstyle.  She's all skillshots so I never feel like anything I wasn't earned by skill and good aim, but she's more about planning and positioning than twitchy mechanics.  Probably helps that I live on the east coast and had gross ping for a long time.  \n\nI also like that Lux feels BALANCED.  Good damage, godly range, terrible durability, and no mobility.  She has very defined strengths and weaknesses.  It's how I'd design champions if I was given the chance.  \n\nI also enjoy {{champion:80}} when I really want to dominate a game.  He feels more strategic than the average faceroll bruiser... since he has to poke you down and pick his time to engage rather than just going ham at the earliest opportunity.  I like that he can affect lanes easier than most with his ult and I actually LIKE that he tends to fall off come late game.  Again with that silly \"champ balance\" thing.  If I don't get ahead... I'm gonna have a bad time.   That's the price I pay for being terrifying early on.  He seems fair to me and I like that!  Could use a VO on his non dragonslayer skins tho and a slick new VO.\n\nI like {{champion:35}} for teh trololols, the early jungle invades, the mindgames and the fact that he's a freaking insane clown!  Am I in the bush by your red buff?  Am I ganking bot?  Is that me, or the clone?  A good shaco game makes you feel like someone's worst nightmare... and it's because YOU knew where to be and what to do.\n\nAnd... hate me all you want but I like {{champion:17}} .  I'll be honest, this one I wasn't 100% on until he got Omega Squad Teemo... which is so darkly awesome that I immediately mained the little monster.  I get a chuckle every time I kill someone via ambush or shroom trap and then walk off into the sunset while Teemo states \"I don't feel anything...\".  Chills.   But seriously... traps.  No other champ really makes use of traps much.  Teemo can't fight you 1v1.  He can't mash his face on the keys and win.  Heck, he can't teamfight worth a crap, really... and he dies FAST.   But if you play him SMART... he's infuriating enough that the playerbase has decided he is the dark lord himself.  \n\nA lot of the newer, faceroll champs with their huge piles of passives and multi-use over-complicated abilities don't do it for me.  I never feel like I got beat by those guys... I just feel like they had more to work with.   An answer for every situation.  Tons of free stats and game-breaking powers on top of already strong kits.  Yasuo already has an infinitely spammable dash and a free shield that he gets FOR spamming his dash... does he really need windwall as well?  That's not even mentioning the free crit and armor pen.  Tahm gets a button to cockblock any attempt to kill one of his teammates... ok he's a support, that's fine.  Does it need to ALSO be a huge nuke that can destroy an enemy too?  Does he need to add his health to his damage, so he hurts like hell while being tanky?  Does he need hideous sustain from his grey health regen AND the ability to press one button to get it as a shield too?  That like... doubles his already high health!  \n\nBalls of stats and overloaded kits aren't fun for me.  Give me a champ who does something and does it well, and I'll accept that they lack in some other department.  Lately champs seems to have fewer and fewer weak spots, or just have skills that do everything possible to prevent their weaknesses from mattering.  It makes them VERY binary too.  Yasuo against a skillshot-based mage mid?  He'll completely ruin the game for them.  Yasuo against Annie or Malzahar?  Yasuo is probably going to feed.  Games should be about PLAYING around your champion's weaknesses not about if you picked the proper champ to auto-win lane against your enemy or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanguine Law","date":"2015-11-24T16:26:00.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} By far, forever and ever my favourite","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi hi its zy zy","date":"2015-11-24T15:06:28.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:21}} Her splash art made me join this game (no it's not because of the breasts I'm not straight)\n{{champion:37}} She's so pretty <3\n{{champion:143}} I've always fallen in love with nature based characters, especially women\n{{champion:43}} Her rework is excellent and she's very fun to play + the quotes are inspirational\n{{champion:432}} bwahhhhhhhhhhhhh\n{{champion:267}} I love her kit and design\n{{champion:16}} My very first champion purchase\n{{champion:61}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:44}} honorable mentions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tarp96","date":"2015-11-24T14:43:00.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} aaaaall the way <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"jmaishere","date":"2015-11-24T14:40:10.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32}}  rylai's is fun on this champ\n{{champion:81}}  skillshots make you feel better at this game.\n{{champion:82}}  before the rework, the goal was to be able to 1v3 and yell stuff like \"im fucking mordekaiser\"\n{{champion:35}}  I like playing mind games with people, and ap shaco basically has a walking time bomb.\n{{champion:17}}  I like mind games, nothing like messing with your opponent\n{{champion:112}} laserbeam of death","replies":[]},{"poster":"TraderDerp","date":"2015-11-24T14:36:26.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}} top\nI like the lane-bully play style.\nI like being in the middle of a fight.\nI love the juggernaut fantasy; hilariously tanks with loads of damage, in exchange for low mobility.\n\nAlso, dunking scrubs is fun :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reposer","date":"2015-11-24T13:44:04.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:245}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:4}} \n\n{{champion:245}} Was the second champion released from when I started playing, because I started a little before Bard came out, and was a little unimpressed (Mostly because I never touched support).
