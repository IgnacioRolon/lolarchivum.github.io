And I continue to just wait.  It never loads for me.  It just stops at this:  http://prntscr.com/csuds3  but it gives me the option to refresh the page like it finished loading.  I try that and still nothing.  It slows everything else down like it's still loading something, but I've sat here for almost an hour each time I try to load it and it never leaves that screen in the screenshot.  I don't have anything else running either when I try to load it.  Is there anything that can help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T15:14:36.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be an issue with assets or plugins on your browser failing to function, or maybe even an extension getting int he way.
