Here's some stuff I feel would help.\n\nThe first thing is to prep before you get in game, here are the **[runes](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/39031240#runes)** and **[masteries](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/39031240#masteries)** that I use.  Check out pages 16-20.\n\n**First buy**: machete,  2x red pots, 1x trinket\nThis is the standard start, but there are a few people who can get away without buying the pots (Fiddlesticks and Warwick)\nI like to start ward (yellow trinket) on most people but the sweeper (red ward) is a valid option too.  I take yellow if I think I will get invaded or if I just want extra sight.  I take red if I think I'm going to gank the same lane repeatedly.\n\n**Second buy**: Level 2 Jungle item, components for level 3 jungle item\nI buy purple (ranger's trailblazer) If my character has a hard time clearing, or if the aoe would largely accelerate my clear.\nExamples: Shaco, Amumu\n\nI buy blue (stalker's blade) if my character can clear with relative ease but the slow would help me secure kills or summoner spells on ganks.  I use blue for the slow more than I do for the damage.\nExamples: Xin Zhao, Vi\n\nI buy red (skirmisher's sabre) if my character can get a lot of auto attacks off during a gank.\nExamples: Warwick, Master Yi\n\nI buy grey (poacher's knife) if I'm Nunu.\n\nIf I'm a tank I typically buy Sunfire Cloak or Thornmail to help me clear and make myself tankier.  Thornmail if they have a lot of autoattackers, otherwise sunfire.  \n\nIf I'm a bruiser who doesn't rely on attack speed I start buying warrior's upgrade, otherwise I use devourer.  Mages buy Magus.\n\nGenerally I only buy one or two offensive items as a jungler, after that I will build tank.\nExamples: Xin Zhao (devourer, statikk shyv, tank items), Vi (warrior, triforce if I'm fed out of my mind otherwise tank), Sion(warrior, tank), Maokai(stalker/ranger, sunfire or thornmail, tank)\n\nThis is largely personal preference, but if you're new to jungling or struggling with it I hope this high level overview helps.\n\nGood luck and have fun!","replies":[{"poster":"pE4CbxDPQO","date":"2015-01-08T07:20:13.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot PhillyBrew,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=Xh8UOaPX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-08T02:29:17.072+0000)\n>\n> Hey there!\n> \n> I like to jungle, but it's super hard in season 5.

These junglers all also have high innate sustain. Xin Zhao heals every three hits, so taking attack speed runes and masteries gives him the sustain he needs whilst also improving clear speed. This is a special case. Not all junglers will be able to do this. \n\nIf you're new to the game, the set up I would recommend for a very safe start is armor seals, armor quintessences, and have the rest of your runes be optimized for clear speed. Also, consider taking at least seventeen points in the Defense tree for Second Wind and Hardiness, both of which improve your survivability in terms of sustain and damage reduction. If you want an even *safer* start, take Alchemist in the Utility tree. If you combine Alchemist and Second Wind, your potions will stretch a lot farther. I would say that this setup would probably work on most junglers, albeit this setup will not be optimal for many who have special cases, such as Xin Zhao.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuperThroatPunch","date":"2015-01-08T15:53:13.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the hardest things to learn it is when and where to gank. You will have teammates that ping and expect you to show up on the spot. Don't let them dictate your pace or play style. Learning to gank comes with practice. Things like when to wait, when to dive, all that stuff takes time. \n\nDon't let your team get you down. If you don't feel comfortable then don't. Just let them know why, low health, warded, outnumbered, or whatever. \n\nAs for as items go the suggested items are pretty good in the new jungle. You will learn when to switch things up depending on circumstances. \n\nWarwick is a solid jungler that has really good sustain and an awesome ult for ganking. Amumu is also really good if you can land skill shots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfOfTheYear","date":"2015-01-08T07:38:07.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a jungle main and think I could provide some decent advice here, but it would be easier if I knew a few things.

S5 is all about the Gromp/Golems start. There buffs from smite are intended to help you clear and you are guaranteed level 2. Always start bot side... ALWAYS!
