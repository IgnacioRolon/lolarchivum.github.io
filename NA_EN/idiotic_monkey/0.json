They sound great for me but I have noticed that they have recently started to be more quiet than they were before. My volume is 100% in both League and windows sound settings so I&#039;m not too sure what it could be. I also checked the cables and everything seemed fine. I got them about a year ago. Is it because they are just old now? Any advice would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2015-06-06T00:59:34.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nIt's pretty unlikely that they just all of a sudden got quieter cuz' they're older. Has anything changed with your sound card? Updated drivers, new sound card software, etc?","replies":[{"poster":"CyberTootie","date":"2015-06-09T22:38:24.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1433889426/SadKeanuredpostaudiolevels.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}
