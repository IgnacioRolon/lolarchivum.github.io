The thing that I noticed help a lot was the lack of an all chat. Now I&#039;m not saying its a bad thing, but for ranked I feel it should be left out. Keeps your team more focused on themselves and helps them not rage as much.\r\n\r\nAlso another thing I liked was the lack of lanes. The go where you think your needed mentality. Instead of the current sit in lane until a tower goes down with the same champs in every lane near almost every game.\r\n\r\nNow for the actual gameplay. The lack of a surrender button has lead to me winning more games because I tend to focus on late game not trying to win something before the enemy spikes. Also it actually reduces toxicity. You still get the occassional toxic person but they are usually the bad people and not the better people. Once I broke about rank 25 (in like 10 games I might add where you go rank 50-&gt;1) the toxic people nearly died out.\r\n\r\nNow they do have their differences. Including the not farming and no items. But the core MOBA is still there. It&#039;s a 5v5 where the team decides the game not a single player. Also the no promo system and straight points to move up system is really nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-08-01T06:16:09.752+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a tip for all you people who don't seem to have self control and go all crazy-mad-stupid when the enemy says something in All-chat: You can disable it, and then *poof!

Removing it removes the problem completely. After game chat is fine.\n\nI am fine with leaving it in normal games. But just take it out of ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-08-01T06:27:55.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HoTs in my opinion is a stripped down, boring version of LoL and DoTA 2. The no farming or items just makes the game team deathmatch. And one of my main issues with league over the past year is that, more and more i feel like people are turning league into TDM. Instead of only fighting/team fighting when theres a reason too (over objectives), people are constantly fighting opponents for no apparent reason. Which then in turn, feeds the enemy kills that they wouldnt have otherwise gotten. Which to me isnt fun, if you wanna play TDM then go play CoD or HoTS....thats what i say atleast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gordo San","date":"2015-08-01T06:33:06.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"League is not for the weak-hearted.\n\nFarewell. \n\n**LEAGUE IS LIFE.**","replies":[{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2015-08-01T06:59:57.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gordo San,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MjbZskE7,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-01T06:33:06.305+0000)\n>\n> League is not for the weak-hearted.\n> \n> Farewell. \n> \n> **LEAGUE IS LIFE.**\n\nProblem with league right here. Die hard for League. Will not see flaws in the game. You can't just ignore flaws thats how you get a CoD style game.\n\nHotS to me feels more like a team based game than League. You can only do so much on your own in that game. In league with the right champ you can 1v3 and win if you get even slightly ahead. In HotS you are going to die so fast that you may not even get to touch them.\n\nAlso LoL is slowly trying to make the games go faster by making towers less useful. Ofc they are going to farm kills instead of kill the towers. Hell you get more gold from the kill (literally tower gold is a joke now, not even a full wave of farm). The less useful something is the less of an objective based game you have. You get less gold for them now, they do less damage, they are worse at scaring people off. The only thing that hasn't changed is early game hence you still have the same trends as years ago. Sometimes making tower weaker doesn't make people finish games faster because it puts them on a lower priority objective list. When you have objectives in order as Nexus>Baron>Dragon>player>inhib>tower it kind of shows why people focus them. As this is almost the exact order people focus right now. It used to be Nexus>Baron>Inhib>Tower/Dragon>Player. Which was a much better way to focus a team in a MOBA.","replies":[{"poster":"All In Forms","date":"2015-08-01T07:51:07.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the counter argument of \"the grass always looks greener on the other side\" could be made too.  league has flaws sure, but so does HotS.  it could be you aren't seeing the flaws in HotS because your focus is exclusively on the flaws of league.","replies":[{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2015-08-03T03:21:37.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=All In Forms,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MjbZskE7,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-08-01T07:51:07.614+0000)\n>\n> the counter argument of \"the grass always looks greener on the other side\" could be made too.  league has flaws sure, but so does HotS.  it could be you aren't seeing the flaws in HotS because your focus is exclusively on the flaws of league.\n\nMost of the flaws HotS has are't that major. There are a few newer heroes putting the game out of whack but Blizzard isn't reacting just yet because they are trying to work things out and make sure they do the right thing unlike Riot. Riot does either knee jerk guts or waits months to deal with a problem. Sometimes they don't even deal with it all or address the wrong problem.\n\nI am not saying HotS is perfect, but like most games dropping new characters into the game. There are flaws in their release. Riot just has a tendancy to exaggerator these flaws and ignore them and/or create more flaws in \"balance changes\" like the turret nerfs.\n\nI had stopped playing League up until a week ago. I had stopped for about 2 months. And I come back and it still isn't hard. League isn't hard, nor is HotS. They both have very similar difficulties. But League allows a single person to carry a team so hard that its almost scary.\n\nDota is no different in this right, but at least you had to feed a carry or let them get to late game to have this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"All In Forms","date":"2015-08-03T06:24:15.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything you've said in this post is opinion (which isn't wrong and i'm not slamming you for it) but you need to understand not everyone will share these opinions.  \n\nI personally hate HotS because i feel like i can't contribute to the same level i can on league, while when i'm on a good team and everyone plays well together its awesome.  If that's not the case and you have some people who don't really know what they're doing on your team it feels to me like my team is dragging me down and that if it were league i would still be able to make a difference.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me about it is to die in that game you have to do some really stupid stuff, people can always run away it seems when if they were in a similar situation in league they would be absolutely dead for doing something they shouldn't have.  It feels overly forgiving to me.\n\nthat being said i haven't played it since beta so take everything i said with a grain of salt lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZACKandATTACK","date":"2015-08-01T07:23:17.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly prefer League to HoTs.

Plus, in hots lane phase as we know in lol does not exist, its more like mid/late already.\nthird, ofc they have no surrender option: that is because in LOL matches last way longer, and might get burdesome sometimes; in hots a game usually lasts 20 mins. What is the sense to add a surrender after 5/10 mins? \n\nI am alright about hots, its cool for those that do not like the demand lol and other mobas have and is fun and action packed, but before throwing stuff at lol at least check your facts","replies":[]},{"poster":"Genuwhine","date":"2015-08-01T06:08:44.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think you know how to play leauge then lol \"lack of lanes go where you are needed mentality\" uhm thats how you play leauge? baron,dragon, objetives, warding.
