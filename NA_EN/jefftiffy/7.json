He has range and doesn&#039;t have to play passive all game due to being outranged.\n\nIn fact, I find it sad that bard is excelling solo over duo because his team potential is kind of meh. He does really well in 1v1s especially when he starts to be able to store 2+ meeps.\n\nFirst item tends to be trinity then tank from there and maybe a BotRK near the end.\n\nAlso, I want to note how toxic people get about this. It's like so bad that they refuse to play the game (I mean jungler starts to refuse to gank even with a lane shoved to your tower and a free stun and infinite chase should be a free kill), and they even feed and then you start to die and yell at you saying you are the feeder when you have a 10/1 lane hunting you down. Then the entire team turns on you because you are off meta.\n\nIn fact I have several times abandoned top after losing it snowballed another lane then returned top to farm just to have the same people I fed complain. Even though I have more than a 2.0 KDA.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-20T23:16:46.232+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why the hell not?

Let's look at these two scenarios.\n\n1. Your jungler is awesome and ganks early, and then ganks again, getting you two kills on your lane opponent. You're ahead in farm, you have your summoner spells, life is good. If you were any other top laners, you would sit top and farm up while denying farm to your opponent or just killing them when they try to cs. As Bard, you need to roam to get your chimes. This might let you start snowballing other lanes or it might take you on a magical journey through the jungle that doesn't really take you anywhere useful. Either way, your top lane opponent gets to free farm, push your turret, and gets back into the game. Eventually, your lane opponent can duel you and win. You might bring more to teamfights, depending on how well you use your ult and who your lane opponent is, but without help, the other team will probably always have more turrets in the top lane.\n\n2. Your jungler wants to focus on getting bot ahead to secure early dragons, so you get no ganks. The enemy jungler ganks you, or your lane opponent is just a strong duelist levels 1-3 (as many popular top laners are) and you die solo while trying to farm because you have 1 meep that doesn't even slow yet. Your opponent gets an early Tiamat and is clearing waves like crazy while you struggle to last hit under your turret. If you roam, you're giving up a free turret and lots of farm. If you don't roam, you'll never hit meep breakpoints and you'll continue to lose lane. Eventually your opponent is so far ahead in cs, kills, and levels that you can't contribute as much to teamfights, even if you land the perfect ult and they're splitpushing.\n\nObviously, these are two extremes and a lot will depend on your individual skill (in mechanics and decision-making) and on your ability to communicate and the skills of the other players in the game. This all being said, if you enjoy playing AD Bard top, keep practicing and go for it. Even if you play something that's in the meta you won't win every game. Playing AD Bard top just gives people something to blame so they don't have to think about the mistakes they made during the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-21T02:02:00.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How?
