Yeah thanks Riot. Definitely wanted to reveal that totally visible pink ward.\n\nI mean c'mon who doesn't think of these things when the concepts are made. The raptors are way too strong and I tend to skip them half the time anyways because they hit so damn hard and the buff you get you can't use because you just got low hp from trying to kill the bastards. And the wolves give you a horrible buff for doing anything other than watch your blue (which you should have saved smite for to begin with).\n\nThings Riot needs to work on in the jungle.\nLower the mini raptors damage by 3 each. Lower the big raptor's damage by 5. (They have much higher dps than the wolves with this)\nRift scuttler needs to scale in xp and gold.\nGromp needs 10 less base damage (its already 15 higher than the original wight with a bigger hp pool). And the buff needs to also give some kind of defensive stats.\n\nI mean Riot you kind of straight buffed the jungle while nerfing jungle items (all of the new ones are pretty terrible for any form of sustain, hence the new gank or lose meta). On top of this smite is on a way longer CD. \n\nThe only junglers that I have done well with are AoE heavy champs and hyper sustain champs.

I am mostly pointing out my beliefs. I know what I am talking about as much as people say I don't. I have been playing the new jungle a lot, but when a camp is so not worth that I either just smite it for the buff or ignore it until i can clear it in a way that doesn't hurt my ganks then there is a problem. Idc if I am single target, the jungle has always had all the power in the large creep because it was the most important one and gave the most rewards, now for the small ones to give less rewards but be more important to kill doesn't make any sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2014-12-09T23:52:19.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually like them strong and feel it strongly INCREASES diversity. You actually have to make a choice as to whether or not you can afford to do the raptor camp during that clear. Whereas before you just AFK clear the whole jungle. If they make them easier then you go back to AFK clearing everything with no changes from game to game.\nAlso, it does kind of depend on your champion which is cool. AOE clear junglers actually find the raptor camp the easiest, where as single-target clear junglers will have a lot more ease with gromp.\nThe only problem is that sustain junglers can still AFK clear the whole jungle and were made strong enough to compete with other junglers during the meta where EVERYONE could AFK clear the whole jungle. But Riot has already nerfed Warwick, Pantheon and Fiddlesticks which were the main abusers of \"lol there is literally no downside to me being able to farm without losing hp.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aspynn","date":"2014-12-11T03:15:51.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only reason they made it go off on pink wards I think was because of all those durr hurr moments in competitive play when the casters would laugh for ten minutes about some guy not checking for oddly placed pink wards, and then have the entire crowd cheer as they finally cleared it.

With poachers giving 50% reduced cool down on enemy camps, a hard counterjungler could effectively get to around 20 seconds if they use their smite charges on a regular basis.","replies":[]}]}]}
