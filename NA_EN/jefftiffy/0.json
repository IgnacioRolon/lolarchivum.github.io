I see Meddler post things that get hidden due to being below thresh hold when he makes tons of valid points.\n\nMaybe stop band wagoning against Riot doesn't know what they are doing and realize maybe that the people who understand the game just aren't being allowed to change it how they want and are being very cautious at how they go about it.\n\nPeople down voted Meddler for saying that 80s CD on an ult is a big window of counter play when the champ relies on said ult. When that ult can not only be QSS'd as well as Zhonyas'd. Yes I'm referring to Zed here.\n\nBut he is correct if you look at Akali, her ult is on a really low CD and there isn't as big of a window to kill her safely. Same goes with Fizz and Ahri. Both have small windows to kill them. While Zed has small windows to die but an even smaller window for a kill against a good team. The reason he is picked so often is people don't know how to counter build. They think the game is all about counter picking.\n\nHell last night I had a game where we had a tryndamere lock jung after I called. So I picked ahri and went bot lane with smite to set their jungle back to give us some breathing room. I built a morelo because they had 4 healing reliant champs (I mean DFG is leaving soon might as well get used to not using it). And then I build an abyssal because they had a lot of AP but we were lacking a tank and this is where most people are going to complain about me. I built the rest of her tank because we had none. Yes tank Ahri. Why? Because we had plenty of damage and with my utility and highish base damages I can still remain a threat and draw massive aggro. And guess what. Our terrible team comp won because I could sit there and soak damage as well as CC and burst. I traded my own build for the sake of the team and we won.\n\nCounter building can win most games, but the problem is people don't realize that stacking armor doesn't do much if you have no health to back it up. And Zed excels at killing low health targets whether they were full or not because they stack armor for his massive armor pen.\n\nAnd I will tell you I honestly despise Akali and Fizz more than Zed because I know if I can bait Zed's ult I can win against him. You just can't be nearly as reckless with your spells and constantly have to gauge who has the advantage as he is the assassin and you are more than likely a mage. With Akali sure she may lose a trade but she has enough spell vamp to stop caring and start another fight in about 30s with full hp and you are at half from the last fight.\n\nWith Fizz you have to either kill him pre-6 or you lose because his troll pole starts to really spike his power after 6 combined with his ult power spike. The Troll pole merely annoys me because its pure nope. You have no say in it. He can dodge anything he pleases unless it was already on him and that isn't very much.\n\nThe thing is Zed sacrafices his kill potential pre-6 by having an amazing 6, but if the enemy was building right they can play safe until they get their rushed Zhonya's or QSS and then kill him if he tries anything. Then Zed is forced to roam and if you pay attention and your lanes pay attention he is pretty much out of the game unless they feed him.","replies":[{"poster":"forist","date":"2015-01-17T23:32:09.510+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, I'd hope getting tons of down-votes doesn't discourage reds from posting here.

It's one thing to be frustrated or even angry at changes to something well-loved, but it's another to lash out at the people held responsible and hurl insults and accusations at them. It takes a very low expectation of the playerbase's overall maturity to assume that players aren't capable of controlling themselves or channeling their frustration in more productive ways, and I think setting the bar that low is toxic to everyone involved. An overwhelmingly large number of threads on the Gameplay & Balance boards are hate posts directed at specific champions, items or Rioters in the balance or design teams, and even then the ones that do try to make a constructive point are often made in a very hostile tone, and all of these threads attract comments with huge variance on the positiveness of their contributions. On top of this, these unproductive threads also tend to be among the most popular, and consequently drown out others that often have more thought and effort put to them.\n\nObviously, asking for nice and orderly boards is a tall order, and one that would've been already made possible if it were that easy, but wouldn't it be ideal to have both the appreciation and the frustration channeled into constructive discussion? Reds are working hard to try and improve the quality of General Discussion; are the other boards being worked on too? Gameplay & Balance I think is particularly important, since this is where the board community posts feedback on both League and changes made to it. Ideally, this is the place Riot could use to take the game's pulse, see what the community wants and suggests, and discuss future changes: while this does happen, and more often than people admit, it would be a lot easier and a lot more pleasant for everyone involved if the board's quality level were raised significantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-18T19:53:23.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Passion is a two-sided coin, with the appreciation comes the frustration.\n\nA way to cut down some of that frustration though, and to make the community better would be to get rid of the Up/down vote reddit based system, as that brings out a lot of the toxicity in people here.

I see Meddler post things that get hidden due to being below thresh hold when he makes tons of valid points.\n\nIntelligent =/= Downvotes \n\nPlayers that do not like/disagree with Riot do this. \n \n> Maybe stop band wagoning against Riot doesn't know what they are doing and realize maybe that the people who understand the game just aren't being allowed to change it how they want and are being very cautious at how they go about it.\n\n Ok I didn't really understand this, but from what I can tell, you're saying that people bandwagon on hating Riot because they don't know how caution Riot has to be in order to not screw the balance.\n\nIf that's what you say, Riot has promised a lot of things, and they have not followed up on a lot of those things. They claim that many things are on their radar, yet they fail to meet the demands of what the game needs. Riot isn't cautious, they knee-jerk-react constantly to champion popularity spikes and instead of buffing everyone, they nerf one only. I know, buffing everyone would take a ludicrous amount of time to accomplish all while balancing. But hows that Fighter rework going? Where is the change? What's new? Aside from another champion rising from obscurity because the new flavor of the month got nerf struck?\n\n> People down voted Meddler for saying that 80s CD on an ult is a big window of counter play when the champ relies on said ult. When that ult can not only be QSS'd as well as Zhonyas'd. Yes I'm referring to Zed here.\n\nAside from the after burst, which Zed almost doesn't need if hes ahead, he can still make use of the shadow and the gap closer. Zed is overloaded with too much mechanics and not enough of the weaknesses.\n\n> But he is correct if you look at Akali, her ult is on a really low CD and there isn't as big of a window to kill her safely. Same goes with Fizz and Ahri. Both have small windows to kill them. While Zed has small windows to die but an even smaller window for a kill against a good team. The reason he is picked so often is people don't know how to counter build. They think the game is all about counter picking.\n\nAkali is and has been broken for a while. Kit's too binary. Either she face rolls, or dies in the dust. Ahri dashes away because she can't do much else if she misses charm, except hope the enemy is low. Fizz is too lenient with the Playful/Trickster cooldown, 8 seconds at level 5 is too generous. Brutal since he can pretty much avoid death itself.\n \n> Hell last night I had a game where we had a tryndamere lock jung after I called. So I picked ahri and went bot lane with smite to set their jungle back to give us some breathing room. I built a morelo because they had 4 healing reliant champs (I mean DFG is leaving soon might as well get used to not using it). And then I build an abyssal because they had a lot of AP but we were lacking a tank and this is where most people are going to complain about me. I built the rest of her tank because we had none. Yes tank Ahri. Why? Because we had plenty of damage and with my utility and highish base damages I can still remain a threat and draw massive aggro. And guess what. Our terrible team comp won because I could sit there and soak damage as well as CC and burst. I traded my own build for the sake of the team and we won.\n\nUh good for you? \n\n> Counter building can win most games, but the problem is people don't realize that stacking armor doesn't do much if you have no health to back it up. And Zed excels at killing low health targets whether they were full or not because they stack armor for his massive armor pen.\n\nWhat you're saying here is not news, everyone knows of this. You claim armor alone isn't enough? Doesn't do it's job because you need health to back it up? Then we have a problem. There is not enough \"effective health\" (Damage you block with armor + health basically) to deal with Zed when he buys {{item:3071}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3035}}.\n\n> And I will tell you I honestly despise Akali and Fizz more than Zed because I know if I can bait Zed's ult I can win against him. You just can't be nearly as reckless with your spells and constantly have to gauge who has the advantage as he is the assassin and you are more than likely a mage. With Akali sure she may lose a trade but she has enough spell vamp to stop caring and start another fight in about 30s with full hp and you are at half from the last fight.\n\nAgain, what you say is nothing new. Zhonyas, QSS/Scimitar, etc. People know this, they're not \"uninformed\" on the contrary, they've experienced time and time again how armor is effectively useless despite having built health items. Tanks are not working. Oh yeah, I'm going to rush zhonyas pre-6 while he W-E-Qs me to death with no costs. Did I mention he can effectively wave clear in relative safety as well?\n\n> With Fizz you have to either kill him pre-6 or you lose because his troll pole starts to really spike his power after 6 combined with his ult power spike. The Troll pole merely annoys me because its pure nope. You have no say in it. He can dodge anything he pleases unless it was already on him and that isn't very much.\n\nNope on a low cooldown. \n\n> The thing is Zed sacrafices his kill potential pre-6 by having an amazing 6, but if the enemy was building right they can play safe until they get their rushed Zhonya's or QSS and then kill him if he tries anything. Then Zed is forced to roam and if you pay attention and your lanes pay attention he is pretty much out of the game unless they feed him.\n\nYou expect Zed to scratch his head if you Zhonyas his ult? Guess what? He's still there(He can take a few hits under tower too because he'll just R right out. Unless you're Annie with a point and click stun, he's just going to run right back out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-18T19:48:41.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's because they need to remove the voting for one, that would actually help this board A LOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-01-18T19:51:42.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you explain WHY you think that instead of making statements and acting like they're facts?","replies":[]}]}]}
