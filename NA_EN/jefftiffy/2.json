Nothing absolutely nothing. &quot;GG enemy team fed&quot; more like &quot;GG out team gave up&quot;. I&#039;m sick and tired of it and it is probably the most toxic thing in this game. It pissed me off to no end that people will fucking give up after single deaths when sometimes its their own fault. The last game I was in our Alistar was blaming me for losing to WW who was in my jungle 24/7 and not a single lane came to help me. Meanwhile Ali&#039;s defense is that I shouldn&#039;t need help in my own jungle. I&#039;m sorry but this is a gold Elo player saying this. And you are telling me that the game was over since the start because I got counter jungled when you refused to help me?\n\nThis game is getting really bad. So many games in the lobby I am told to stay silver when I am gold and I ward more than most of my team and perform better, but because we didn&#039;t win its my fault when they gave up or fed or didn&#039;t control their lane. They then proceed to give up because of something they caused. I think people who give up and proceed to sit there and blame someone for the loss really just need a straight up ban.\n\nIf you don&#039;t even try then ofc the game is over. Saying GG or surrender at 20 isn&#039;t going to give you any chance to come back. In fact it&#039;s usually a sign that you are tilted and shouldn&#039;t be playing. I mean at one point we aced the enemy team and took 2 towers while 15 kills behind and 3 towers down. But &quot;GG enemy team is fed we have no chance&quot;. Sure we lost, but I mean when you have someone tilted causing everyone else to tilt ofc you are going to lose. If you play positive you can still win and not rely on a single person to carry the team.\n\nIt's not even that I'm mad at this. It's just really hard to have any sort of fun whether it's ranked or normals whenever you have a team that is so set on losing the game that even when you start to come back the tilt throws everything away. It's one thing to give up because the game is done and you know there is no chance, that is what the surrender button if for. You shouldn't be trying to convince your entire team to end a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-10-09T18:35:43.747+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what's even better?

I was simply being vaporized by the other team going into every team fight and I was being heavily discouraged. They were a mostly AD team too, which gave me the chance to build mostly Armor and HP. I even built {{item:3025}} as a result. Finally, one team fight where I dove someone important and was tanky enough to basically force the other team to waste nearly everything on me. My team cleaned up and we won. \n\nI think people give up too easily for sure and forget that making the enemy team work hard to kill you can be just as powerful as Dragon or Baron. It forces them out of position and to become overconfident, making it much easier to kill them without paying for it. Given League allows a team fight at the late game to single-handedly sway a game, I think we can all be a bit more optimistic when a game isn't totally lost. \n\nThat said, if it's 9-23 and the fed enemy team has 3 Dragons, 5 towers and Baron compared to your team's 0 Dragons and 2 Towers, I think it might be game over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2015-10-10T03:08:21.631+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can honestly say that that right there is the cause of 90%+ of my losses. I tell my teammates to mute each other, stop arguing and play, that they wont ever see each other again so they should try win for their own sake.

And the arguing always starts when some egotistical a-hole gets his jimmies rustled when he makes a really stupid play because he thinks he is godly. \n\nman, why can't people just play to the best of their ability? What is giving up in that game going to do for you? At least if you put your full effort into it, you have a chance of winning, you ALWAYS have a chance of winning. Giving up just puts you on tilt regardless. This is a universal problem, from silver 4 to plat 1 this is the attitude I see EVERY time our team gives up first blood. I don't see why people think its ok to put other people on tilt by doing this. Its NOT ok.

I mean if you're down 30 kills, the enemy team has 4 dragons and 2 barons, you have only one Nexus turret left, and the enemy team outscales you late-game, then you're probably screwed. That said, you have to recognize when a game is winnable, and when it isn't. \n\nRecently I had a game where top was feeding the crap out of not only his laner, but also mid because he just couldn't keep up the ward coverage to deal with Diana roaming up there constantly. Unfortunately, I wasn't doing that great in lane either and was already 0/1 to the Diana and down about 20 CS at 20 minutes, so I really couldn't follow her, especially with the top laner already being fed. And I could tell this poor guy wanted nothing more than to surrender. But our bot lane was even, and I wasn't _that_ far behind, and we technically outscaled them late-game, if we could just make it there. So I basically just kept saying that we could win, took all the blame for everything bad that happened so no one went on tilt, and tried to make it so we didn't surrender. Our ADC Quinn somehow ended up getting ridiculously fed over the course of a couple teamfights, and I ended up eventually surpassing Diana in CS, to the point where our items were even. We ended up making the craziest comeback I've ever been part of, where we were at one point down by 30 kills with a dead inhib, only to surpass the enemy team by 10 kills and win the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2015-10-10T21:11:16.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of that would have happened if your team argued and surrendered, why cant people realize that?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-10-10T01:36:35.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was in a 4 man premade with friends once and the top was the random.

But all it takes is one player to make a difference. If they are out playing you and you can't contest drag, baron , or push a few towers then it is pointless . But if they have poor positioning, aren't pushing towers/advantages, or have much less farm you have a great chance at winning a game if you do those things. \n\nI've had games where I've pushed towers and won us game because we got an inhibitor which forced them to play much more defensive and forced a wedge in which we could push more towers and gain even more advantages. Anyways all in all no game is pointless and I make the clear point of saying \"if you don't have an hour to spare then why load up a match?\"  The match isn't decided in 10 minutes anyways. Unless it's a clear stomp 20-0 and by then you are probably at 25-30minutes. Then I see it appropriate to surrender but if it's 5-0 at 5 minutes you totally have a good chance at turning that around and making it a win through smart decision making. \nThe biggest fault I find with people like you is that you don't try to counter build or make an excuse to their death toll.
