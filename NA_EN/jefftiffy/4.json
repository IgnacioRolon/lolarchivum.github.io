Her shield at level 3 essentially negates any chance to kill her. And to top it off her range and mana costs are pretty low and her kit encourages her to use the full mobility instead of discarding some of it.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem is her dash. Just fought against her mid lane {{champion:45}} vs. {{champion:164}}. I couldn&#039;t do jack shit. If I tried to farm she would just Q E on me. Her dash could hit mid lane walls from the middle of lane then she could bounce to me just barely outside of tower range meanwhile im stuck eating a full rotation able to do nothing. Her dash is so fast that she can literally just use both dashes before my cage forms. And even if she is a complete and utter moron and stands and eats full rotation she only loses half hp because her shield blocks like 150-200 magic damage early on. I even rushed a {{item:3191}} to mitigate her damage. She could still kill me in about 2s even if I had flash.\r\n\r\nI feel like Camille can never be balanced the way her kit is right now. Her Q range needs to be like 80-90% of what it is right now, and her mana costs are way too low if she just spams E and her AA enhancer you can&#039;t win lane. 90% slow is stupid for someone who has an ability that is a double gap closer. The slow should be 50% at most. She already gets an AS buff, damage buff, stun, AoE, and a heal just for going in on you.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a kit pretty obviously designed to be a jungler and they end up laning and destroying almost everyone there is a problem. Camille needs to be nerfed in specific areas or she will never be allowed to be balanced. Nerfing her ult, hp pool, and shield will not help that. The problem is her core abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Scruberz","date":"2017-01-16T18:54:22.271+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning her has worked for me 100% of the time","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-01-17T22:36:54.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't get to ban every game, only 3 out of 5, so it works 100% of the time 60% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Scruberz","date":"2017-01-18T13:51:02.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can always ask your teammates to ban her.

Most junglers focus on mobility, interaction with walls, clear speed, and high dueling potential. The only thing that Camille is bad at the forces her out of the jungle is the fact that her clear is super slow, but the second she fights champs she basically becomes unkillable until around the 20 minute mark when kits finally start to be able to overcome her shielding and damage assuming you haven't fed her at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2017-01-16T19:15:24.447+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VulDread,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Pbn3HB2A,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-01-16T19:06:27.228+0000)\n>\n> She wasn&#x27;t designed to be a jgler, that&#x27;s why her W does reduced dmg to monsters.\n> \n> She&#x27;s basically meant to be a laner that ends up roaming around a lot like a jgler.

If she was designed to roam that much, she would have done so playing a position that gave her the best roam potential. \n\nAnd yet, I think she currently works best as a top laner due to her split push potential.
