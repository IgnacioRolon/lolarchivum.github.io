Given you've tried to repair and re-install, it doesn't sound like there is a corruption with the installation itself.  At this point, I would like to make sure that you have the proper OS Permissions to launch League correctly.  To that end, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104).\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues, reply back and let me know!","replies":[]}]}
