It just sends me back to the main LOL area with a button that says \"reconnect\", which does nothing when you press it. Is there a solution for this issue, has anyone else dealt with this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T22:32:57.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a strange issue, especially if selecting Reconnect doesn't do anything.  Is this on the new client?  If so, I wonder if something with the update messed up some of your files or cannot locate files needed to render the game.  Let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainman1206","date":"2016-11-19T14:01:45.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, right after the patch update of course. I've gone through a few different troubleshooting pages on LOL and haven't found the solution yet. *Sigh* wish me luck.","replies":[]}]}]}
