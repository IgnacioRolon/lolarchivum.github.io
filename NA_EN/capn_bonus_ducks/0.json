This twitter post frustrates me not only because they didn&#039;t put it as an actual client notification, or because of the fact that this is an issue that&#039;s almost a month old. No this frustrates me because this is proof that riot KNOWS why I&#039;m disconnecting from the game and I&#039;m STILL getting leaver status. RIOT I need an answer other than &quot;don&#039;t play the game until it&#039;s fixed&quot; on the same week that ARURF is on. This is a month old issue, FIX IT FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.","replies":[]}
