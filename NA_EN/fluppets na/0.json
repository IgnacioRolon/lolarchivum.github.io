Focusing on her new passive, Aspect of the serpent, she's now more about rewarding consistent, succesful use of her abilities for end-game scaling than being a dominant lane force.*\n\n>\"\n> **Cassiopeia is the idea of stalking your prey, to slowly whittle the victim down with venom untill they realize their folly, but too late! The chase is on! Faster and faster slithering closer and closer until finally the prey, cornered, turns to make a desperate attempt at a fight, only to be petrified by a deadly gaze, it’s eyes locked in stone, it can do nothing but watch, watch as the serpent’s Twin Fangs tear into it’s flesh.**\n> \n> Cassiopeia is a difficult champ and has always been so, but with this greater difficulty comes greater potential. Of course it’s very dangerous to make her very powerfull in all situations and just say “yeah but she’s really hard”, it has to be fun for those mastering Cassiopeia as well as those mastering to play against Cassio.\n> \n> *So, there’s the difficulty, but where’s the fun?* \n> \n> With the Aspects of the Serpent Cassiopeia players will find rewards for excelling in the different aspects her abilities provide: Landing skillshots consecutively (Q), proper zone-control and positioning (W) or knowing when to go all-in (E). There’s a scaling component, but it’s not free; Cassiopeia players will have to work for it and put themselves in danger. Limited resources (Mana gated) and opponents can counter-play her attempts to stack her Passive’s Aspects.\n> \n> **I definitely liked the new passive’s direction, but I strongly disliked (and so does Riot, at least officially) the way it just handed out base stats.** \n>\"\n\n* ***new* Passive - AspectSssss of the Serpent**\n \n  ***Succesfull use of Cassiopeia's abilities & gameplay aspects will grant those abilities a stacking benefit.***\n * **Aspect of the Stalk (Q):** \n  Cassiopeia gains 10% movement speed for 3 seconds if Noxious Blast hits an enemy Champion. Each consecutive Noxious Blast on the same   champion         (refreshing the Q’s poison) permanently increases this movement speed by 0.5%, up to 40%.\n * **Aspect of the Venom (W): **\nMiasma's slow% is increased by 0.4% (up to 40%) and it's cooldown is reduced by 0.04s (up to 4) for each unit killed inside miasma's pool. This effect is tripled for champions.\n * **Aspect of the Kill (E): **\nTwing Fang steals 10 HP (+0.1 AP) from poisoned champions, minions and monsters. Every third consecutive twin fang that hits an enemy champion permanently increases Twin Fang's Lifesteal by 1, up to 100. (consecutive = within 4 seconds)\n \n\n* **Q - Noxious Blast**\n\n ***Removed*** *Don't stop! Keep going!* Cassiopeia's cast animation roots her in place (actual delay unchanged)\nBase Magic Damage: (unchanged)      75/115/155/195/235 \nAP Ratio: \t+0.35 AP  \t\t=> \t+0.5 AP\nCooldown: \t4 seconds  \t\t=> \t3 Seconds \nCost: \t\t40/45/50/55/60 \t=> \t30/35/40/45/50\n\n> “It doesn't make any sense to have a chasing/kiting tool that gives you movement speed but also roots you in place; fix for quality of life/absurdity. Cooldown reverted to allow consecutive Q's to land and AP ratio increased to compensate the old-new passive's AP boost removal.”\n\n* **W - Miasma**\n\n ***new*** *Just don't step in it!*  Miasma's poisoning pool cripples it's victims: slowing, damaging and preventing them from escape (cannot use dashes or movement speed boosts while inside the pool).\n ***Removed*** *Just step out of it!*  Miasma no longer poisons enemies for 2 seconds, instead the effects are only active inside the pool.\n Magic Damage per second:                         10/15/20/25/30 (+0.1AP) 25/35/45/55/65 (+0.15 AP)\n Cooldown: \t14/13/12/11/10 \t\t=> \t14 seconds\n Slow: \t        25/30/35/40/45%\t        => \t5/10/15/20/25%\n Cost: \t\t40/50/60/70/80 \t\t=>  \t40/45/50/55/60\n\t\n> “Miasma no longer 'sticks', so the damage might seem high, but really isnt. The slow starts of really weak, but Miasma grows into a pool of crippling venom come late-game. With Aspect of the Venom & CDR you can achieve 100% uptime on Miasma. “\n\n* **E - Twin Fangssss**\n\n ***new*** *make use of that second fang!* Cassiopeia's Twin Fangs has two (2) stacks. Hitting a poisoned unit refreshes the stacks. Using all 2 stacks will cause Twin Fangs to go on a 5s Cooldown.\n ***new*** *eye-to-eye*  Twin Fang's cooldown is reduced by an additional 0.1s for every 100 range the target is closer (than 700 range),  to Cassiopeia, up to 0.2s cooldown.\n Base Magic Damage:   55/80/105/130/155           =>   50/75/95/115/135\n AP Ratio:                        (unchanged)                                0.4/0.45/0.5/0.55/0.6\n Cost:                              30/45/60/75/90                 =>   35/40/45/50/55\n\n> \"Twin Fangs Sorta works like Rumble's Harpoons, but with a refreshing mechanism. Cassiopeia is rewarded for getting up close to deal increased Damage Per Second. Early game, the increased dps from the (potentially) lower cd is gated by high mana costs and obviously high risk. Lower higher ranks’ base damage, to compensate for the (potential) increase in damage through Aspect of the Kill (10 (+0.1 AP) + (1-100 stacks)).\"\n> \n\n* **R - Petrifying Gaze**\n \n *Stare contest!* Decreased Cast delay (not removed)\n  Magic Damage: (unchanged)             150/250/350 (+0.5 AP)\n  Cooldown:  (unchanged)                    120/110/100 seconds \n\n> I was tinkering with the damage numbers, but honestly that's not the issue. \n> \n> There's a basic flaw in the thought process behind the Cast Delay on Petrifying Gaze: It's not something that has to be delayed to allow a response (Like an assasin's combo), it is an ability used as a response (to counter the assasin's engage). \n> \n> A quick google didn't find me the exact numbers on the delay time and it’s late and I’m lazy andIrealizenobodywillactuallyreadthisandimtiredandIwannagoho-oome.\n\nI had been thinking and writing this down (napking/post-it notes) for quite some time, with the recent change to cassiopeia (which feels imho uninspired) I felt like working it out and posting this. \n\nWhen commenting please focus on the gameplay aspects and less on the numbers, I mainly want to see if my thoughts & ideas strike home with those who like Cassiopeia, numbers don't really matter because, well, this won't ever go into the game.\n\nEdit: Changed Miasma's aspect to no longer increase in size but increase the slow, but lowered the base slow.","replies":[{"poster":"chriserit","date":"2014-09-28T11:08:14.567+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"**EVERYTHING is better than the actual one**, but they will **never listen us** .... they will neither read it; they didn't even answered in their thread.\n**Her name is Cassiopeia** {{champion:69}} **not Lee Sin** {{champion:64}} or Thresh {{champion:412}} they will just do what they want without caring about that.\n\nThere is a lesson you should learn:\n- \"We don't want to do the Eve treatment to a champion ever again\"\n- \"We don't want to change a Champion Identity\"\nand all the other things they said** works only for popular champions **like {{champion:412}} and {{champion:64}} (so only for OP champions)","replies":[{"poster":"GreatDane","date":"2014-09-28T18:28:18.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lil' salty there?

W is probably too strong (it's almost a root), to leave it as you propose you'd have to take out something from the rest of the kit.\nThe passive is really cool.\n\nThe ulti can be changed to: for all poisoned enemies teh delay is 0.2s, for the rest is 0.5s (i think this is the live value).\n\nIn addition, the kit is really complicated. It has scaling everywere, expecially E. It has two stack mecanichs, a reset mechanics, and a lower cooldwon mechanic. Maybe a bit too much?\n\nBut this kit is really interesting!\n\nRight now, the most ***stupid *** thing is: if you kill a champion, you'll take more time to reach full stacks.\nIt's totally absurd","replies":[{"poster":"Fluppets NA","date":"2014-09-28T20:52:42.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree it looks complicated, thats kinda why I threw it on here, because the longer it stays in your head you keep piling things on.\n\nThe E has alot of text for two mechanics that are very intuitive. One is the stack; just like Rumble's harpoons, with the staple reset on poison. The other is the shorter CD/Distance. This is basically a mimic/exaggeration of how it was; when the E was calculated on-hit and had a travel time. So this mechanic will feel intuitive to cassio players (get up close for max damage per second with E)\n\nYea W is too strong in this iteration, mainly because W feels so useless, even before the rework. Perhaps a fixed size and starting off with a very low slow that scales with the Passive could work and is more straight-forward. ETA: im changing it to this, a huge pool that prevents dashing can be too oppressive for zone control late game and isnt very readable.\n\nIm actually surprised there isn't and effect like \"Cripple: prevents the use of Dashes for x amount of time\" mainly I'd want to keep miasma as an area where you dont go into, but not because of damage, but for crowd control in line with what venom does = cripple.","replies":[{"poster":"MakersF","date":"2014-09-29T09:36:54.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cripple CC would solve a lot of assassins problems, where they once had silences and now they have nothing or slows.\nCripple should prevent any moving ability that it's not a flash (so Kassa ulti, Kata e, Talon E, Zed switch with W, WW R, etc are immune)\n\nIf you change again to just slow it will probably become underappreciated again. How about staking flat MR reduction + slow? Like 5MR reduction per stack up to 5 stacks, 1 stack per second. Tank could go in there pretty safely (-25 MR on 200 MR is not bad, but not incredible), while it would be really good against squishies.\n\nThe 2 hits E, like rumble, means that you are forgiven if you hit a not poisoned opponent. I guess that Riot doesn't want that, even if I agree that in a combat is really hard to keep track of how long everyone will be poisioned and change target when you know the poison is about to wear off. A mistake and for 3-5 sec you are useless.\nThe point with your change is: imagine there is a slow tank (mordekaiser) and a mobile squishy (lucian). You can poison the tank, hit the ADC, then hit the tank (reste the stacks), hit the ADC, hit the tank (reset the stacks), poison again the tank, hit the ADC, hit the tank(reset the stacks), etc etc etc\n\nYou see it? you can deal high DPS to a target that was never poisoned, only because you poisoned someone else, which gave you the speed to stay near the squishy, and you hit the poisoned target every other hit to reset the stacks. You can at most say that hitting a poisoned champ gives back one stack, so you are forgiven for missing one E. But at this point it is just simpler to remove this trait and let the player be punished for hitting a non poisoned champ","replies":[{"poster":"Fluppets NA","date":"2014-09-29T11:10:35.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I checked Lol's exact definition of a dash; kassadin and the likes will still derp all over the place; those teleports are 'magic' and the venom works in the muscles, so 'physical' dashes wont work.\n\nDo notice I increased the E's base CD to 5, maybe that could be increased. \n\nThe scenario you give = working as intended. That's not easy to pull off especially in the thick of the fight AND high DPS? you're wasting 50% E dmg and 100% Q dmg on a tank that is near you = beating on you.. it's something with alot of playmaking and counterplaymaking involved, id say that's a good thing. now it's just \"oops I have a dash, now your E is on long CD aaand you're dead.\" \n\nIf you look at the numbers (in general, not precise) her early game is really weak and her mana costs too high, in fact the second E stack is a noobtrap, people spamming additional twin fangs (early game) will soon be oom. \n\nThe W being underappreciated is by design, early game it sucks and enemies will walk over it, late game they'll be in alot of trouble. It has this feeling of venom, slowly working without ppl really noticing until its too late.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ILoveTiramisu","date":"2014-09-28T11:41:17.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play Cassio a lot.
