It sounds like this particular match resulted in a remake.  My suggestion here would be to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot whatever is causing the hiccup in the first place.  I highly recommend doing this in a custom game for now though, so you don't get penalized for leaving or losing a ranked game as a result.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
