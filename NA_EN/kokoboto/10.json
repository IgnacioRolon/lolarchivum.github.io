You basically just called an extremely competitive game simple, called other people idiots, and gave yourself implied compliments,\n\nThere is much, much more that you need to know about than just your abilities to play a different role.  If you go to another lane, you need to know the different, common gank paths.  You also may need to know a different time when power spikes occur (getting level 2 for instance).  You also need to know what to build, when you should and should not fight your opponent (points of strength for both champions),\n\nNot to mention the complete change of playstyle between support, adc/mid/top (relatively similar), and jungle.\n\nSupport needs to know when they should help push the wave or help the adc last hit (under tower).  They also need to be extra careful with ward placement because theirs don't regenerate over time, so if they're reckless, they'll have to back more often just for wards.\n\nAdc/Mid/Top (and support as well) all need to know when and how to trade with their opponents.  They also need to know how to last hit (this is a massive factor in player success).  They also must read the opponent for baits and set up their own baits.\n\nJunglers have to know which camp to start at with their specific champion as well as the complete path for at least the first clear.  They also need to keep an eye out for enemy wards, invades, and counter ganks, and try to do the same to the enemy jungler.\n\nAlong with all this, you failed to take into account the fact that you are playing against other humans with equally \"simple\" controls.  Therefore even if in isolation it is easy to play, your opponents' comparative skills can make it incredibly difficult.  If you disagree with this statement, please, take on the pros.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-07-21T11:41:36.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i politely disagree.\n\nit's a simple game. humans who are more talented at the game are better at math, have better internet/equipment, have friends or groups they play with regularly, and some are born with better reflexes. nothing about this game is hard.\n\nand personally i think to congratulate yourself for doing something well that isnt hard is what's narcissistic. im not even sure you understand what narcissistic means as the context you used it in was incorrect. I've posted the correct use of the word and definition below for your benefit. Mind you that this is the noun - the adjective form is the same definition only in relation to something.\n\nas for your statement about taking on professionals - that literally has nothing to do with the game. tic tac toe has professional circles too as well as connect 4. Games that are purely about luck like yahtzee and other dice games have professional circles. if it's a game that more than 1 person can participate at and there's a way to determine a winner you can bet that there's a professional player who's dedicated their life to improving their chances at winning. that doesnt mean it's a hard game. the hardest part about this entire game is honestly just doing the math because most of the formulas are cryptic. when you have to go to another website just to find out what most of the keywords or formulas for damage in the game are then of course there's going to be a huge gap in the player-base's understanding. that doesnt make the game any harder - it just means information isn't accessible. it'd be like playing chess without the rules to tell you where pieces go. Or playing monopoly with magic the gathering 20 sided life point dice (fyi there are only 40 squares on a monopoly board so 2 20 sided dice would allow you to move anywhere).\n\n\nlane, role, champion - none of that stuff matters because if it did then brand, annie, zyra, etc. would never have played in the support position at LCS. Marksmen wouldn't be jungling and fighters wouldn't be walking around in mid lane. people keep trying to imitate the professionals who for the most part have their own favorite characters just like any other person would and then fail because they dont know what their champion does or they dont know how to do the math because they arent familiar with the formulas. you can take any champion and put them anywhere on the map and they will have a competitive advantage in one form or another. you just have to know what runes to add to your champions kit to make it work.\n\n\n\nif you dont know the math then you're not good at the game. it's that simple.\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\nDefinition of narcissism\n\n    1\n    :  egoism, egocentrism\n    … up until my late 30's I lived in a state of utterly monstrous narcissism and self-absorption … — Frank Conroy\n\n    2\n    :  love of or sexual desire for one's own body His wife complained that she couldn't compete with her husband's narcissism.\n\nnarcissistplay \\ˈnär-sə-sist\\ noun or adjective\nnarcissisticplay \\ˌnär-sə-ˈsi-stik\\ adjective","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-07-21T19:46:50.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The narcissism was about your implied self-compliments of being superior in math to your fellows and being good in this game.  That falls in line with the ego definition.  I'd also like to point out that you can acknowledge your own superior skills in mathematics and video games without being insulting towards others.\n\nI'm pretty there is no professional version of basic tic tac toe, and they'd likely be playing some more complicated version.  The way tic tac toe is laid out (the 3-by-3 grid) makes it so that if both players do their optimal move, they will tie every game.  Once you get to more complicated versions, I would consider the game to become difficult.\n\nPerhaps you just don't consider the human element to be part of the game?  If that is the case then I can agree with you that each position in isolation is not difficult to play.  Still, I consider the human element to be the most important aspect of any pvp game.  By being pvp, the difficulty is determined by your opponent more than the game itself (unless the game is both pvp and incapable of making the more skilled player win, like basic tic tac toe).\n\nOh and unrelated to this discussion, could you at least be consistent be consistent in whether or not you capitalize letters at the start of sentences?  Obviously I'd prefer if you always capitalized, but so long as you're consistent with what you do, it isn't annoying.  (This isn't me attacking you instead of your argument.
