These are broad characteristics that defined pretty much all or most personality disorders.\n\n>Empathy:\n**Lack** of concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of remorse after hurting or mistreating another.\n\nFirstly it is not entirely proven. Secondly  the words clearly says empathy is lacking; it doesn't say that empathy is non-exsistent. In fact no where does it say that empathy is not present. These semantics be important because in sciences people don't say  \"hey you're lacking iron\" if you have no iron. They would just say you have no iron. If empathy was always not present they would use a different word than the double word of lacking.\n\n>You realize that if she's able to feel remorse that means that at most she's a sociopath? Psychopaths don't feel remorse.\n\nAlso did some more reading and it shows sociopath is nurtured by surroundings into the crazy, psychopath is just straight up crazy.
