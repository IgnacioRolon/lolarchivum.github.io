I believe he was more disappointed with the animation (maybe how it worked) and how it was very similar to Ryze's E. He mentioned something about how \"It's kinda late to change\", or something along the lines of \"I wish I noticed it sooner\". So that is why I'm asking.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T02:04:33.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unlikely a member of the teams that work on the gameplay and balance changes will see this post on Help & Support.
