Her art is kind of lackluster, Quinn's theme could be touched upon a little more, and her gemeplay is most certainly better, but her ULT seems like a waste of opportunity.

Any one Champion or ability can feel obnoxious to play against at some point, I think. For example, Taliyah easily feels like one of the fairest Champions to play against (and the forums seem to agree), yet getting cornered by her ultimate can leave you feeling trapped, frustrated, and stuck for options. This doesn't make Taliyah's R bad, it's just a side effect of its power, which is what ultimate abilities are there for to begin with -- power.\n\n> Her new kit i think feels very good, and i prefer jetpack valor to divebomb suicide valor.\n\nI think claiming that Quinn's old ultimate was nothing short of a suicide move commits certain gameplay assumptions. For one, using it didn't mean you were forced to get up close and personal with someone, because instead of using it to fight, you could use it for strategic map movements (like her current ult). Unlike her current ult, though, this wasn't its primary use -- if handled correctly, many a kill could be claimed with Tag Team, not to mention it gave Quinn massive escape potential thanks to the instant burst of movement speed, as well as awesome playmaking ability simply in virtue of the way it functioned in tandem with her kit.\n\nPre-rework Quinn wasn't perfect by any means, but I do think it's a stretch to say that her old ult was either excessively frustrating or flat-out suicidal.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-21T04:02:38.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really didnt like the idea of using her ultimate just for the speed boost in the past, i felt like it was a waste of an ult, but i was god awful at quinn before her rework, i just couldnt use her at all, but i really enjoy her play style now. perhaps im just being really biased here because she went from an ADC i LOATHED to one i really like, like i just REALLY sucked with old quinn... though i did practice a lot to get good with new quinn","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-20T03:31:15.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I quite like her gameplay, and i dont think her design is terrible, though i do think her splash art is kind of poor.\nI keep trying to convince myself that its not bad, because i find it hard to specifically pin down what i dont like about it, but i cant bring myself to like it, i think her and valor just look a little stiff...\n\nI really like this concept art\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/EjC6T-F7xpA/hqdefault.jpg\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/82/Quinn_model_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140802235155\n\nbut i dont really like her splash\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/nL8DJw6NHZ8/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nAlso, and this might sound strange, but i dont really feel like demacia has much personality, i get that they are supposed to be the righteous good guys, but thats kind of it.\nIn fact i wouldnt mind seeing a demacia event because, even though its probably the faction with the most champions, i dont feel like most of them have anything in common, or how they would even interact, and the most recent champs from there, lucian, doesnt seem like he even belongs there, and while quinn does, she strangely doesnt seem to really offer any insight into the faction. Like, there are all these champs but it seems like none of them interact at all. Also some demacian villains would be great, like some super competent a-hole captian that the faction cant get rid of, because hes too good or something.\n\nUnfortunately i feel like woad scout quinn or corsair quinn are both much more interesting takes on the hawk lady to the point i wish corsair quinn was the champion that you originally decided to make (as pirates are awsum), or if you made corsair quinn the canon skin and made her flee to bilgewater for whatever reason (maybe she saves valor instead of a demacian captain, who survives and wants her dead?).\n\ni think sharpening her splash art and perhaps fleshing out her character a little more could help, she just needs a few more lines perhaps and some champion interactions within her faction. I dont think she needs a VGU or a rework or anything drastic, just a more unique personality that only expands on what we already know. Like, i dont think anyone could predict what quinn would do in any given situation and i think that has a lot to do with the lack of champion interactions...","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-05-20T06:57:25.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Quinn's splash art doesn't really represent the Quinn we were shown in the early promo art, which is a shame because while her splash isn't bad per se, it's really lacking some of the majesty and 'coolness' factor of her early artwork.\n\nThat said, I remain cautiously optimistic for a Quinn VU :)","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-21T04:15:54.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dont think she needs it!
