By that i mean the meta/gameplay that is now is just shit. Its not fun at all because of many overtuned things. This is in my opinion the worst season ever. Even last season was better (ardent censer not being nerfed for 1 year for some reason)\n\nAnyways, i have alot of criticism against riot games balancing team so im gonna do a list right in this post stating the things that i would like to see changed as soon as possible. So heres the list\n\n-------------------------------------------------------STOPWATCH AND KLEPTOMANCY NEEDS TO BE REMOVED\n\nStopwatch is very very unfun for the game, when everyone takes it its just so boring u cant make plays u cant engage u cant dive because they have stopwatch, this is a good example of what league looks like in high elo  Its just stupid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_oCnKDv_n4. I would remove stopwatch and make a new rune, or nerf it super hard. I think most people that play league agree that stopwatch should be removed its just very boring to play against. You look at LCS and everyone has stopwatch so its 60 minute games nothing happening cuz of that. Promotes nothing but passive playstyle. Kleptomancy is one of the most stupid things riot has done, they need to remove it. Its very unhealthy for everyone, Its RNG nothing good out of it.\n\n---------------------------------------BRUISERS DONT HAVE A KEYSTONE/BRUISERS BEING USELESS\n\nIts been 3-4 months and bruisers STILL dont have a keystone.Bruisers not having a keystone is so %%%%%%ed. For some reason riot forgot or didnt want to make a keystone for bruisers. Atm bruisers are in a horrible state the only viable bruiser in high elo atm is Camille. Bruiser as a role has the highest amount of champions but they are not really viable (Im talking about toplane now) So when the role that has the most champions cant be played toplane that is just unbalanced, the people that have only been playing bruisers many years cant really play anymore in high elo. The problem with toplane is that bruisers have not gotten anything decent going for them in a long time. Ever since bramble vest the downfall of bruisers have clearly been shown. Bruisers need some kind of buffs, either reducing the item costs/buffing stats on bruisers items or buffing bruisers as in their abilties/passive. You can also add some kind of new item for bruisers like something that builds out of giant slayer into an item that gives them a chance to kill tanks while still giving some kind of health or resistance/cdr because lord dominiks gives only attack damage its kind of a adc item only. Because atm they cant really kill tanks after they get ninja tabi bramble vest. Also another suggestion of an item for bruisers is something to deal with shields aswell as heals, so it builds out of executioners calling and then into the item it should give some kind of resistance hp/armor/mr and abit of AD, So they can deal with shield/heal supports and shield/heal toplaners. Another problem is that bruisers 3 item cost is the highest out of all roles atm, but it is really useless because most of the time it doesnt even give MR/ Armor meanwhile tanks have alot of resistances. U go tri-force-titanic-steraks. Theres no armor or mr for that build. For example maybe they need to maybe give steraks armor and health instead of just health.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------TANK ITEMS/TANKS BEING OVERTUNED\nTank items are very overtuned, if you first look at MR items they are kinda unbalanced. There is abyssal mask that really needs a nerf, it gives too much resistances and they even get damage and a passive that allows you to sustain more. Nerfing the health by 50 and reducing the MR on that item by 10 is a good change. Spirit visage´s healing increase is 30% that is way too much, i would nerf that by 5%. I would buff adaptive helm, the item is abit underwhelming atm, buff it to 25% on the passive. Stoneplate is too overpowered because it gives just too much tankyness, its 80 mr 80 armor and double ur health, so that really needs a nerf. Nerfing the base stats of the time by 5 on both mr and ar, and decreasing the passive stats by 10 on both ar mr, would make the item more balanced. Moving on to armor items, Bramble vest is a very strong item against bruisers and its just too strong. Ever since bramble vest got released bruisers have been rly bad. They need to nerf bramble vest but not remove it, so what they need to do is reducing the armor by 5 and then nerfing the passive(Thorns) It should just deal 3 damage per basic attack and not scale with armor because it gets really good later on its just too strong. Ninja tabi is still too strong, very op item. It needs to get nerfed by either 1% or 2% reduced damage on basic attacks. With the thing i did with bramble i kinda want to do to Thornmail, the damage is too high 4 basic attacks and it deals 100 damage without the bonus armor scaling on it. Reducing that to 15 would make it better.\n-------------------------------------------------------SUPPORT/JUNGLERS ARE TOO STRONG\n\nRiot has made supports very strong during the last years, too strong. Especially in season 8. Supports have too much impact because of many things.\nNow that they dont have to build sighstone they are even stronger, they can rush ardent censer now or locket for tank supports. Atm a tank support is having more impact than a tank top which is ridicoulous. They get so tanky(the tank supports) even more tanky than toplaners with locket knights vow aftershock celestial body. Last year the game was dominated by supports being too strong with ardent. For some reason riot didnt nerf ardent censer last year. The problem is tank supports are too tanky they need to nerf that, they are just too tanky. they dont die. Shield supports are too strong with aery working on heals/shields, Stacking healing items + ardent censer which is still OP. Ardent censer needs a nerf still. A tiny one. Redemption really needs a nerf, shields are too big and strong just like heals atm. Supports shouldent have one of the highest impacts on the game. They should have the lowest. back in season 1-2-3-4 supports were in a decent spot because it was balanced and better support won but now they have just too much stats too much impact on every game.\n\nThe jungle problem comes down to only one thing. The gold income and the clearing. They are the fastest levlers the fastest gold farming role in the game. They get level 3 after 3 camps ganks a lane, camps that lane generally. Back in season 1-2-3-4 you couldent do that because you would be too behind. They get too much exp too much gold and the clear is too easy. the respawn times on camps are too long. They are always overleveled. You should be able to do something when you get ganked like the old days, but now u cant really turn. Scarra talked about that in the last beyond the rift video that i highly recommend you to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyQlbqeaew&amp;t=  They talk about leagues current state and mostly toplane being shit which it is.\n\nI really want league to continue being my fav game of all time. I´ve played it now for 5-6 years and i can say its getting worse and worse by the months. Feels like league is getting the wow treatment where its the best game ever and it turns into a shit game. Thats why im making this post its so many problems. Me ranting on and on about so many issues would take 100 pages or something. But im trying to talk about as much as i can. I can make more posts like this. But in this post im talking about the biggest problems\n\nRiots balancing team is no clue what they are doing. Im gonna try to not rant too much on this but they need to get replaced. Someone else that has knowledge about nerfing/balancing/changing the game should be there and not the current balance team. Every change is idiotic and the game is turning to shit. I never made a post like this because i never needed to but right now i need to make an impact. Moving on to some other issues, im gonna do a list to make it more simple faster.\n\nDuskblade needs a nerf for obvious reasons, everytime someone gets it, its one shot after oneshot and u cant do shit about it.\nResolve tree is too strong, i would nerf grasp aftershock and the base health of the rune choice by 30,\nRelic shield needs a nerf supports abuse it too hard, toplaners abuse it adcs abuse it. The tanky ness and the gold value u get from it is too strong.\n4.Here is some champion nerfs that really needs to get nerfed : Zoe,Vlad,Azir,Alistar,Chogath,Twitch,Tristana,Akali,Teemo,Gnar,Jayce,Heimer, Kayn,Kha, Lulu,Braum,Zac,Sejuani,Rammus\nSaying everything about all those champs would take too long time. But they really need nerfs.\nStatikk shiv needs a big nerf, its too strong on adcs.\nGold costs of adc items needs to get increased,\nRiot needs to learn how to balance new champions/rework every new reworked champ/new champ is just broken.\nRefresh champion pools by buffing champs that havent been meta for a long time to make the game more fresh and healthier.\nAutofill needs to be removed\nThis was my first time doing a post like this criticising Riots balance team. It was probaly not very well made as i am not that good at doing forum posts. But i wanted to let my thoughts about league out somewhere and not keep it to myself to atleast try to have an impact. All in all my biggest problems are bruisers being unplayable, supports/junglers being too strong. Riots balancing team taking months and months just to nerf one champion. They need to be quicker i think their balancing team is just shit. Kleptomancy stopwatch and overall season 8 runes was very disapointing.\n\nLet me know what u think, what u disagree/agree with and lets have a discussion","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-02-12T01:22:19.105+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":10,"body":"upvoted for autofill being removed","replies":[{"poster":"Vile Odium","date":"2018-02-12T03:08:46.972+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"^ autofill is an abomination","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-02-12T13:57:11.050+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":12,"body":"Autofill is a needed part of matchmaking because of all the children who cant stand not getting their role, literally just play support now and again, you get 2-3 games of autofill protection.","replies":[{"poster":"cheerfothebeer","date":"2018-02-12T15:17:18.014+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=darkcastkiller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discusAsion-id=6EKGj2UV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-12T13:57:11.050+0000)\n>\n> Autofill is a needed part of matchmaking because of all the children who cant stand not getting their role, literally just play support now and again, you get 2-3 games of autofill protection.\n\nThere is always one of you old school autofill defenders.

I spend a good 1/4 of my game running around away from exp and gold providing my team with vision. By 25 minutes I'm generally two-three levels down from the rest of the team. In addition to being low on levels, I also lose out on a lot of gold post laning phase because of how diligent I try to be on vision and objective control. \n\nIf support items were to cost more gold (say 2800-3200) our play and itemization would be heavily impacted. \n\nI also disagree that supports should have the least amount of impact.

They pretty much gutted it in 8.2 I don't generally use win rates to prove a point but  {{champion:81}} 's win rate has fallen 6 percent {{champion:75}} 's has fallen 4 percent {{champion:420}}  3 percent, {{champion:41}}  3 percent etc. Even if we disagree on whether or not the nerfs were sufficient it can still be nerfed again.\n\n**Stopwatch should be removed**\n\nI think the main problem with stopwatch was that building into the inspiration tree was just too good with footwear and I think Riot made the right nerf there I can't say for sure But If you look at the pro builds pages for {{champion:5}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:240}}  You'll see that inspiration is being built into by a minority. From what I can see here people still taking stopwatch either plan to build it into something really early, are already in the tree for spell book, or just really want stopwatch. I'd also be open to making stopwatch come online later in the game. An outright removal would just be lazy imo.\n\n**Bruisers being useless/No keystone**\n\nI see this alot nowadays and I think it's a bit unfair to say no keystone, the gold standard in the day was fervor and that's fine the essential concept was the longer the fight gets the more damage you do Pta follows this same basic principle, yeah maybe it sucks sure but to say there is no keystone is unfair like I said but lets just say buff Pta for melees that would probably work, also Aftershock got a bit of a... lets say update in order to make it more viable for bruisers it has higher damage scaling and has flat resistance buff rather than scaling so champs like {{champion:24}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:39}} could use it more effectively and tanks can use it less effectively.  \nI see the build costs come up alot and maybe I could see reducing the hydra items costs but not much besides that Bruisers items like {{item:3078}} and {{item:3053}} are so good because of their versatility, you could go {{item:3078}} , feed ur ass off and decide you want to be tanky and go {{item:3742}}  into {{item:3194}} and still do decent damage that's something tanks nor adc can do a {{item:3094}}  is useless without at least an {{item:3031}} and another {{item:3086}} item to go with it. \n\n**Tank items and tanks are overtuned**\n\nSo you say here tank items are overturned but that you've been playing for years and this is the worst season you've played, this is kind of a contradiction because {{item:3065}} hasn't seen any major changes since season 5 and every minor change since then has slowly nerfed every aspect of Visage except for the healing increase which has landed a total 5 percent more than where it already was, {{item:3742}} Has literally only been nerfed since it was introduced to summoners rift, {{item:3075}} got a pretty massive nerf when it stopped caring about how much physical damage was being dealt and got 15 percent of its armor rebound scaling removed and replaced with a mere BASE 25 damage, {{item:3110}} has seen nothing but minor gold changes since season 4, {{item:3083}} Actually got a minor buff in season 7 where the health requirement was dropped by 250 and the regen was upscaled by a whopping 2 percent, {{item:3143}} Hasn't really been touched since the beginning of season 7 and those were minor stat changes.\n -Point I'm trying to make here is that tank items being over tuned(if youthink that they are) isn't a new thing if you think tank items are overtuned than you basically are saying they've been overturned since season 4. Also your remedy to bramble is to just basically kill it 3 damage per auto and no scaling? whats the point of the item now if a Bami's does more damage than it just by being next to someone.\n\n**Supports and junglers are too strong**\n\nYou're saying that now that a support doesn't need to build sightstone they can rush ardent, but they could do that before anyway, if the argument is that you can build into the new supp item instead then you can't really rush ardent because you still have to build remnant which is only 400 gold cheaper than the old item which is like 1 amplifying tome up on the old build path. How are supp tanks tankier than top tanks? like how is a knights vow and a locket better than what a solo laner tank could build. \"For some reason riot didn't nerf ardent last year\" Ardent caught like 2 nerfs and revert last year man.... in almost back to back patches. Aery is most definitley not the problem here because wind speakers offered resistance increases just on heals and shields eary scales with damage and for a supp that isn't nearly as good as a flat 10 percent increase like we had before, so that aspect has actually gotten worse for supports not better.\n\nI'd agree with the jungle part as someone who has been playing pretty much nothing but jungle these past seasons I find myself never really having to make a choice between more farm or ganking but I find myself more so in \"Another full clear another gank\"\n\nI don't really play ad assasins so I've hardly used Duskblade so I don't want to speak on it and be ignorant\n\nResolve Tree I feel is fine grasp and aftershock both caught nerfs already, Relic got nerfed as well not many people besides supps use it anymore\n\nI agree shiv needs a bit of a nerf it's pretty much the best zeal item.\n\nI don't think ad itemization should be increased because most of their items are useless without another 2 or 3 specific items. \n\nAs far as refreshing champ pools I think thats what the reworks are for adding too many champs at the same time would be a balance nightmare.\n\nLike you said lets discuss","replies":[]},{"poster":"130x","date":"2018-02-12T02:03:58.951+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":14,"body":"Remove the new rune system, make a new mastery, and start new quint and runes, just make more.

I think most people that play league agree that stopwatch should be removed its just very boring to play against.\n\nDon't misrepresent other people to further your own argument.\nIf you believe stopwatch is to blame, then own up to it and stand behind those words. Not everyone agrees with you and it's not even \"most people\".\n\nScarra, qtpie and Hashinshin on Beyond The Rift (recent episode) have all talked about it and Scarra said that he thinks it's very good for the game, except that tie timer needs to be longer. Somewhere from 8+ minutes. And i have felt like this myself and stand with Scarra on this one. Stopwatch is in the game because people already complained about having a Zhonya-like item for other roles. Stopwatch just needs not to be a \"mandatory\" rune for everyone because then it it allows people to be really aggressive way too many times and get out of sticky situations.\n\nI agree with Scarra on this one.\nI don't think Stopwatch should be removed at all. It gives depth to this game and a one-time use Zhonya's effect isn't the issue here. The issue is mostly related to game pacing since it allows you to make profitable and risky choices too early into the game, without the risks involved. People who get quickly fed get to pop off too early and Stopwatch is usually involved in that matter but it's not the culprit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death Rex","date":"2018-02-12T10:42:33.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, you want nearly every role nerfed except mages (probably since most of them require a lot of skill to pull off) and buff bruisers. I get that, they are weak in comparison to other classes, but when everything you suggested goes through LoL would turn into a bruiser meta. Especially if they get a keystone after all the nerfs.\n\nWhile I do like to play bruisers, I feel like it's frustrating to play against them since their 1v5 potential is so big. I remember Fiora and Irelia being permabanned for some time. Having the meta shift towards them being really popular again is a bit scary.\n\nEDIT: I do recognize that something is wrong with Tanks / ADCs / Supports but nerfing them into oblivion is not the answer.
