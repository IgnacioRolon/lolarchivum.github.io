I have the same issue, my account got stolen and or lost. when i go to account recovery they send me a ticket and asking about my account and what first champions ive first bought like I remember. When I try to recover my password it doesnt send it to my email, so I really dont understand at all. I've put a lot of money in the game, and no one has helped me on this. Riot emails me questions to reply back to them, but it does not let me reply back to the email. my name on my account is \"snip\" , account is snip, because I changed the name awhile back. But this honestly sucks man I feel your \npain.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T21:17:45.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've edited out your account name for security reasons.  You'll want to use an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) instead of a regular ticket, which will enable you to input an address you can access.  Our account team can help update your info as well as recovery.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
