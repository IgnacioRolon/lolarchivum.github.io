Before patch a couple weeks ago my ping was around a constant 60 and never more than 80 throughout the entire day. Now lately during the day its about 120 at the lowest, and about 250 max during night (I assume more people player so server delays?) and have reached a max of 12,000 before I DC the game... I'm sure a couple people have reported me before for DC but I generally do logout and back in to continue game.. last game I played I DC and ended up running into the lane and just straight dying and logging out and back in the chat was bashing me and asking everyone in game to report me for feeding and dc.. I'm afraid most times to play a game now cause I don't want to be reported 500 times for this..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T21:24:48.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be experiencing a similar issue, and the  [Connection Issue](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide may be able to help you out with this as well.
