Going to window mode with Alt+Enter and back fixes the issue. Changing the resolution to something else and back also works.\n\nThe issue I have now is with the low **frame rate**. And it seems to be two problems there: \n\n1. I used to have well over 100, now it seems to be capped at 60 (changing the capped frame rate to over 60 or to uncapped does nothing). I also tried disabling V-Sync and all that, disabled all eye candy, I set the graphics to low but no results. \n\n2. While most of the times the frame rate is at a constant 60 (doesn't even drop to 59), sometimes it goes way down for 2-3 seconds. And with no apparent reasons. It can happen while just walking alone in the jungle or on lane, without doing anything else (no casted spells or other funky animations), or it can happen during a team fight, and that sucks. This didn't happen before yesterday.\n\nHope it gets fixed soon. Good luck @Porocles.\n\n_Edit: And an other thing that I observed is that now, when you minimize the game (Cmd+Tab), it first changes to window mode and after that gets minimized, and when you bring it up, it comes up in a window mode and automatically changes to fullscreen after. This didn't happen before. It's not a problem, but it is strange.

When I move my mouse the screen moves on Summoner's Rift, so I can pan the Rift. I could move the screen to the left, right, and down, but NOT up.\n\nI was in full-screen mode when I went into the game. I thought to try a few things. This is the workaround that I came up with while I was in-game. \n\nWhile in-game, I pressed my escape key, which brought up the Options Screen. I then dragged the Options screen around with my mouse until I could see the Video tab. I then had to drag around the Options window with my mouse until I could see the Windowed Mode menu. My Windowed Mode was set to Full Screen, so I tried both Windowed and Borderless when I was in in-game. Both Windowed and Borderless seemed to be a workaround, and I saw the full four quadrants of my screen while I was in-game set to either the Windowed and Borderless setting, however, when Windowed Mode was set to Full Screen I only got that 1/4 of the bottom left-hand corner of the Rift showing in the upper right-hand quadrant of my screen. \n\nWhile in-game in with Windowed Mode was set Windowed or Borderless, I was able to move my mouse and pan around the Rift.\n\nAfter the game ended I launched Practice mode to try out the three Windowed Mode options. When set to Windowed or Borderless I experienced what I saw in-game, however, when the Windowed Mode was set to Windowed or Borderless when I went into practice mode, (when I went into practice mode is the important thing here) this time I saw all four quadrants of my screen and I saw the Rift, however, the mouse still would only pan to the left, right, and down, and NOT up.\n\nWhen I went into practice mode, (when I went into practice mode is the important thing here) with the game set to Full Screen mode, I got that 1/4 of the bottom left-hand corner of the Rift showing in the upper right-hand quadrant of my screen. \n\nSo something's messed up when you go into a game with your Windowed Mode option set to Full Screen.\n\nGoing into a game with your Windowed Mode option set to either Windowed or Borderless seems to be the workaround.\n\nI did take screenshots of what I was experiencing and I really wish I could just upload them here so you could see what I was experiencing.\n\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195)\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\nprocessor 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7\nmemory 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\ngraphics Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\nModel Name: MacBook Pro\nModel Identifier: MacBookPro11,4\nProcessor Name: Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed: 2.5 GHz\nNumber of Processors: 1\nTotal Number of Cores: 4\nL2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\nL3 Cache: 6 MB\nMemory: 16 GB\n\nLeague of Legends Beta\n\nAt the bottom of the pregame screen in the lower right-hand corner\nv7.9-4359737.4360264\n\nAt the bottom of the loading screen in the lower left-hand corner\nMac Beta Version 7.9.186.1051 (Apr 28 2017/19:57:230 [PUBLIC] <Releases/7.9>Client\n\n**_Update Thursday, May 4, 2017_**\n\nOk so a new development, tonight, Full Screen is back in macOS 10.12.4, however, I still can not pan up with the mouse.

Even the mouse scrolled on the screen normally in full-screenâ mode, so it may seem to be an OS specific issue.\n\nIf my earbuds are not plugged in prior starting League on the OSX 10.11.6 machine, and I plug in my earbuds with League already up and running, my sound is distorted, so have your earbuds plugged in prior to starting up League.
