I will link one thread in which you gave a very in depth reply in which you said, and I quote:  \r\n\r\n&quot;Why am I spending all this effort to explain my role on another game? Because I don&#039;t want you or any other player to worry what my work on League means for the future of the game. While I think there are contributions I can make, I&#039;m not interested in overhauling League by any stretch&quot;\r\n\r\nI will link the full post here for those interested.  http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4801581&amp;page=1\r\n\r\nNow, several years later, I think it would be wonderful if you would showcase to the community what you have brought to their favorite game, how it has improved under your role as lead game designer, and how much the player base has grown in the past few years.  I think it would be absolutely lovely for you to prove all those haters wrong in this post.","replies":[]}
