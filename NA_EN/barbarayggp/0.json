After a while one gets better at the game based on quantity of games if not quality. I'm just saying in previous seasons you could climb faster and have less frustrating games by being able to carry games more effeciently, that more effectively reflected your skill. It honestly in this season and previous ones feels like players in current mmr could carry games when they went 7/2 or something in lane, with it now feeling like if your not 20/3 your not hard carrying the game. I know this doesnt apply to every game, im just saying this happens more often and frequent these last seasons more than any others.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rαy","date":"2018-10-18T10:44:41.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wilyum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MUggYFVv,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-17T21:17:49.172+0000)\n>\n> That isn&#x27;t true if a soccer player keeps scoring in his own goal he can solo lose that game real quick when there are no subs and every own goal counts.\n> In this game if my ADC continually feeds the enemy Kai Sa there is not much to be done\n\nSoccer players have to do this intentionally (normally). League players drag the team down because they get snowballed on in this oneshot meta. A single mistake results in them getting insta-popped everytime the are slightly out of position.\n\nRonaldo can carry his team if the players are on a somewhat decent level though.

Its like having phantomlord on your team back in the day and he couldent go Kathus.  I can be critical of OTPs because if they don't get their Pick and they are not a solid player they cripple their team. Now im a player who looks at ELO via law of large numbers. I whole heartedly believe that If your solid,above your mmr and make impact your going to climb, always, its just a grind to remove RNG.  In multiple seasons I have proved this to friends by smurfing and queing. At my best im mid-upper plat, I usually will hover in gold and plat.  My view is simple, that's honestly just my level of skill no more no less. I end up where I deserve biased of my decisions. It took me being demoted from plat to gold trying to duo because I arrogantly assumed it was good enough to consistently carry friends when it was hella not the case.\n\nBack on topic, So Auto fill.... I want to see more talk about how to replace or improve it. Its been shown that bad que times kill a game mode. This makes me leery of opt in or opt outs. They don't solve that issue when its an issue.  So personaly I really lean to having a 3rd role option the reason being that it would encourage players to learn 3 roles.  Another option I support would be to have matchmaker list roles its looking to fill, if when at role selection you have a message that more players are needed for X position.  I also would like it if riot gave more incentive for players to pick Fill and do well. If being a Fill main resulted in higher MMR or LP gains on wins, or more BE, Or some Snazzy icon or what ever it would get more players to do it, imo.\n\nIf we as a community had a good chat and couldent find a good soluition or improvement, I think that conversation could generate enough interest to be brought forward to riot. If on the next dev blog 1 person makes a post to represent the community then we back it with some 2000+ upvotes in the first hour I happen to think it would get some attention.  The constant inaccurate and ignorant tilt I see that makes me respond so jadedly however will never attract any attention. I really wish people would focus on solutions when posting instead of meltdowns over problems. That just me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2018-10-19T04:42:06.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trying to climb solo Q feels like luck. You can play at a higher level then you are in, but you still need to have good team mates. If you play consistently, then chances are you should get teamed up with people on your level, and you can climb with them. But then you need to win more then lose, since most of the time losing takes away more LP then winning does. \n\nDuo Quing is the only real way to climb. You are guaranteed someone that you can work with and taking up a slot that could have been taken by a worse player.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-10-19T11:37:01.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only lose more LP if your MMR is lower than your rank.\n\nI gain 22-23 per win and never lose more than 18, while a work mate wins around 15-16 and loses 24-25, but then again, he has like a 30% wr in B5.\n\nSo of you lose more than you win it means you are ranked higher than what the system sees as your rank.\n\nMetrics that do calculate in that are vision score, kda, farm (if on a farm based role), objective participation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-19T07:12:35.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One person should not lose you the game, BUT one person shouldn't win you the game either.","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-10-19T13:33:42.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

Rather what im saying is that in todays current iteration of league of legends, you have to work together with your team of 4 random players more than you ever have in previous seasons in order to win the game. Making games that have PLAYERS performing poorly or simply deciding to play the game their way instead of working together very unreasonably hard to win.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kledy McKledFace","date":"2018-10-19T00:57:49.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or it was bought by a chinese billionaire, fits with your periods.. xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"ez mental boom","date":"2018-10-18T05:54:06.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be fine if we were allowed to VC with randoms without relying on a third-party program.","replies":[{"poster":"BarbarayGgP","date":"2018-10-20T19:25:00.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ez mental boom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MUggYFVv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-10-18T05:54:06.376+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;d be fine if we were allowed to VC with randoms without relying on a third-party program.\n\nmaybe","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarbarayGgP","date":"2018-10-18T06:17:21.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the major problem with that is that IMO, a large part of the community doesn't want to use voice comms at all.

I'm all for having voice comms for solo que games but i doubt enough people are going to actually use it to make a difference. The main issue that needs to be fixed is the fact that one person can ruin a game but one person cant carry it. Bring solo que back to what it really is. Solo que.
