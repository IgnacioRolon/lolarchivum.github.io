It's literally what got her turned into a joke champion for nearly two years. If she has assassin levels of damage, then she's easily broken, given that her passive is one of, if not the strongest in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"facemelter710","date":"2015-10-23T01:46:59.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you suggest to the balance team to give eves ultimate a minimum dmg.

For one, it makes her extremely good at cheesing the enemy jungler since no one ever buys a pink ward right at the start of the game (pink starter would be suicide). Second is that it forces the enemy to pay more to be able to spot her coming; unless you pink ward your lane approach (which she can bypass if she knows it's there), you simply cannot push or you're going to die when she backstabs you.\n\nLast is that the stealth isn't done in an exciting way; she just gets it every time she's out of combat, and then just stalks around waiting for an opening with her enemies being none the wiser. It feels so anticlimactic when you engage an enemy who dives your teammates, not realizing you're around, and you get a double kill because your opponents were stupid.\n\nI would love it if instead Evelynn's stealth were more like Kha'Zix's, in that it would give short bursts of stealth on demand.
