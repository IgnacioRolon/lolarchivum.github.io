When new Victorious skins come out, they are available on PBE for 1 IP/ 1 RP, since the store doesn't allow for costs of \"0\" to be implemented.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowPhoenix91","date":"2019-05-10T12:25:52.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an idea for victorious skins. What if… for season 10 to celebrate 10 years you could do all the previous skins and you can choose which one you want if you get gold... Like you can get the new tenth one or you can choose from previous ones… You could make it like Riven championship I and II to show if you got it originally or in the tenth season… As a morgana lover I really want that victorious morgana! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aquatic Soul","date":"2015-05-31T22:20:58.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info Katey.Really appreciate your feedback ^.^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aquatic Soul","date":"2015-05-31T15:40:01.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay.Thanks for your help ^.^","replies":[]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2015-05-31T05:13:14.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you cannot purchase them, however I will check in a second.\n(The exception I believe being Vic Morg.)\n\nEDIT: You cannot buy them, at least the Elise one.\n\nI am unsure of the Morg one as I bought her when she came out on PBE though.","replies":[]}]}
