I understand that I need to use the legacy client to gift someone, but if that person is using the new beta client, will they still receive and be able to use my gift?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T22:14:56.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both versions of the client are live servers, so a player on the updated will receive gifts.  Keep in mind that toasts may not be active, so they may not get the cool notification banner about receiving a gift.  They should be able to discover it unlocked on their account, though.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"jusgre","date":"2016-11-30T23:06:47.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much Porocles! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
