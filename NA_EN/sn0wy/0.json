And this season we wanted to record what we got in the chests! Okay onto my question i currently had 2 chests and won a chest making it 3.\r\n\r\n So my question is the chest i won this season is it the one i just opened or will it be the last one i opened? I know if its a stack it will be last in first out however depending on how its it could be at the bottom or arranged in any number of ways. So riot programmers, I would please like to know which chest I just opened was, was it my last one i won or was it another one... Please tell me ;-) its killing me to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T01:34:18.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap.....being a former programmer myself I'd love to know the answer to this. Unfortunately, this is something only the main game designers would know and I'm pretty sure they're too busy to talk with this poro xD!\n\nIf I put on my coding hat, I would honestly think it'd be smarter to have it FIFO (queued). That way, you're always opening the chest you got the earliest. What you do you would have been the best way to code it?","replies":[]}]}
