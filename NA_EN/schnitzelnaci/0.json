Try logging out of LoL, opening Task Manager, and then closing out all LoL related processes in the list. Once you do that, log back in and see if the authentication and the client run any faster or if it works exactly the same. If it doesn't help, just let me know, I'll see if there are any other steps we can try. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SchnitzelNaci","date":"2017-06-25T08:11:35.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still not working :(","replies":[{"poster":"SchnitzelNaci","date":"2017-06-25T14:15:47.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://prntscr.com/fnyg1u look at this. mby is with server something wrong?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
