A while back I bought Deep One Kassadin, but ended up refunding it. Now, I want to buy it again (ya, ya, I know I'm bipolar :P) However, when I went to repurchase it, it said that the skin is unavailable. Anybody know why this is? Is it a bug, or are you just not allowed to buy skins you already refunded? **Please help! **Thanks!\nAdditional info: I still own Kassadin, I bought the skin while it was on sale, and I refunded it about 3 months ago... (I have no idea how long ago it was that's just a guess) Also, I have 1,860 RP right now, so I definitely have enough to buy it, and all of Kassadin's other skins are available for me to buy.","replies":[{"poster":"GummyBearWookiee","date":"2015-02-06T22:20:05.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bug...it's no longer available.  Not every skin sticks around forever...so sadly that skin is now in the vault.  They do occasionally let some of the older skins back out but it's not often.  There is though always the good ol' one in a million shot.  When they enact the mystery skins...everything is basically available...but yea...the chance is hardly great to say the least.  Sorry bud.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ptolemy7","date":"2015-02-06T23:03:00.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks everyone! That's such a bummer but oh well!

They usually open the \"legacy vault\" so you can buy these skins again usually during certain events, and almost always around Christmas time though that is a ways away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-02-06T22:31:07.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ptolemy7,\n\nDeep one Kassadin is a Legacy skin, and not available year-round. Though you were able to get him when we was available, he is not available currently.
