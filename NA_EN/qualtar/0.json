The reason why most supports play aggressive is mainly because when they have a passive/farm type of ADC and they get AA once they feel like they need to attack or run the risk of getting yelled at by their ADC because they got hit while the support didn't do anything. \n  \n  What I do is the \"2 call rule\" when I play ADC. \nCALL ONE \nIf my support pings on the enemy team which means \"go In\" I GO IN no matter if I personally think it's a bad call or not I commit because they pinged it and they have pretty much already made up their mind and now so do you. \nIf you don't go in the 1st time but your support does and they die as you watch you will run the risk of being 1v2 the rest of the game. \n\nCALL TWO\nCall two is the after math of call one.  If call two didn't work( say we both died giving a double kill to the enemy adc)  I DON'T LISTEN to my support until my team groups and what ever happened in the lane phase doesn't matter as much.   The reason is because I tried their way(my support) on their call/play and now being the ADC I do my own thinking.  If Call one did work and we got a kill or a double kill either I got both kills or my support got 1 or my support got both, I listen to their next call( if it's not broke don't fix it).  \n\n That's just my own 2cents on the matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-26T21:32:44.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when playing bot lane as support or adc, you need to be able to swtch up your playstyle. only sticking to one playstyle the entire laning phase means you either missed chances to harass and get ahead or that you will get harassed and the enemy will get ahead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotaru is Waifu","date":"2016-11-26T21:29:13.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ask them how they like to play you can trust em a few times maybe they know whats best if it does not work out tell them to pasive farm its what i do","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2016-11-26T21:27:56.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from the other side of things... I'm a support main, and it can be quite difficult not knowing what my adc wants to do if it's someone I've never played with before.  And as I play most of my matches either alone, or with friends in other lanes, that's most of my adcs.  I try to ask in champ select what kind of playstyle the adc has, as far as how aggro they want to be, and pings and such are always a good tool for when to look to go in for a trade.  \n\nIt never hurts to let your support know before the match starts that you want to focus on farming, or that you want to try and go for early kills.  Or even just to ask them what they might like to do as well.  The only warning I will say, is if you use pings to let your support know that you want to go in, and you are waiting on them to initiate, don't forget that they are keeping track of many things before they go in.  A good support will be watching for where the enemy jungler is, health and mana bars, ability cooldowns, summoner spell cooldowns, the numbers of creeps in the wave, how close they are to leveling up vs how close the enemy might be to leveling up, any missing enemy laners, etc.  I don't always have time to explain those things to my adc, but if he wants me to go in and I don't, it's because I have a darn good reason for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IPinPC","date":"2016-11-26T21:24:51.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't suicide for your support if he does mistakes, but you help him  to ensure lane dominance. Don't forget to ward too cuz his charges aren't infinite.\nPs. I really hate passive ADC. It  makes me rage when I put all my efforts, mana and HP yet ADC  does nothing. \nDon't forget, that ADC and Support are both equal players and should find synergy. You can't say just because I don't like your play style you should adapt to my style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-26T21:24:38.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"know your champs ..... not hard to play adc with random supp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qualtar","date":"2016-11-26T21:19:17.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so i tell them im high and its not working out between us?","replies":[]},{"poster":"1wolfpack","date":"2016-11-26T21:19:06.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think thats where communication is important. let your support know your gonna passively farm at the start of the game.\n\nthat way they can still poke if they want to but they will know not to go too ham.","replies":[]}]}
