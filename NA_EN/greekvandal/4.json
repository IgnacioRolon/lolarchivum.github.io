Once she reaches late-game there's just nothing you can do short of bursting her before fights break out.\n\nA champion's counterplay should not be relegated to just, \"prevent them from reaching late-game.\" That simply creates a dichotomy of the player having a horrible experience early-game and then that horrible experience being transferred to their opponents once the game reaches late-game.","replies":[]}]}
