The point is that League is a team game, and in order to have the best chances of winning you need more than just personal skill or game knowledge.\n\nIt takes communication and teamwork skills to truly outmaneuver the enemy team and push through to a victory. If teammates are being uncooperative or they keep giving up, you should probably take a look at your own behavior to see if there is something you might be doing that makes them want to stop playing.\n\nThere are plenty of simple techniques that you can apply to keep up team morale and to prevent them from tilting. And if you can't accept that or you do not like it then maybe league is the wrong type of game for you. There are other games out there where you can win on personal skill alone, League just isn't that type of game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
