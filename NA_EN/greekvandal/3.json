His full ad builds are toxic and they oneshot harder than a Rengar consistently. \r\nYet everytime i see a J4 change is a nerf to his utility or defences. Nobody likes oneshot bot J4 yet you keep pushing him to that full ad build.

However pro play typically sees him played full tank, abusing his early base damage to get early ganks, then scaling into a full tank threat. That's probably why his nerfs push him towards full AD. \n\nI couldn't imagine playing J4 without threatening damage on my EQ though.

This should make it so that full damage is only strong early on and bruiser/tank scales really nicely into mid/late. I didn't take armor/lethality into consideration because I'm too lazy for that.\n\nThe changes to Q make it so that even with less AD you'll still do near the same damage as someone who's building full AD.\n\nThe W changes reward you the tankier you are. Everything should be relatively the same with a bruiser based build. It only starts to be much stronger than the flat shield value when you get extremely tanky.\n\nThe R changes curve damage.
