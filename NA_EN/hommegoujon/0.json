I play at 33 ping and then suddenly i LAG, so I can't control my character for about 1.5 secs and then it comes back to normal and my ping is at 250 or 300. Sometimes, nothing's happening on the screen and sometimes it's right when I'm getting ganked or engaged.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know how to fix that? \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[]}
