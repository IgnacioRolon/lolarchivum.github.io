A month before that we clarified our stance on allowable topics in GD.  However, there still seems to be a lot of confusion about the rules in general and how they apply here in General Discussion as opposed to the rest of the Boards.  In our effort to continuously try to improve clarity and understanding in GD, it&#039;s time for another discussion!\n\nHistorically, Riot and the Moderation staff have always been more lenient when it came to applying certain sections of the Universal Rules to GD than to the rest of the Boards.  This is most noticeable when it comes to things like insults and harassment as GD has previously stated that low-key insults and harassment are part of the culture here and we&#039;ve done what we can over the years to respect that.  However, it also applies to things like trolling and low-key spam in discussions that weren&#039;t serious to begin with, as well as Political discussions which were allowed earlier this year but only in GD.\n\nWe&#039;ve been working to be more consistent in terms of not removing the things that we say are OK in GD in relation to the more lenient rules here like low-key trolling, insults, and harassment.  That means you&#039;ve been seeing more of it in posts than before because where prior we may have removed it right away and prevented a discussion from derailing into people going back and forth with each other, now it stays and it&#039;s rather noticeable to everyone.  Despite this being something we&#039;ve worked to be consistent on at GD&#039;s request, not everyone seems to be happy with the outcome.  So it&#039;s time to have a discussion that has the potential to be incredibly impactful to GD:\n\n**Do you want to continue to be held to more lenient versions of the Universal Rules as you currently are or do you want to be held to the same Universal Rules that the rest of the Boards are held to?**\n\nWe&#039;ll be monitoring this discussion and joining in where appropriate, but ultimately this is your discussion about what you, GD, want when it comes to being held accountable to the rules.","replies":[]}
