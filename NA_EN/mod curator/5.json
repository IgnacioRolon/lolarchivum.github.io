Specifically, we&rsquo;re looking to form a small group of players from GD to collaborate with us in building a set of GD-specific rules that we can then sticky so that all players know what is allowed and what isn&rsquo;t when posting in GD.\n\nBefore everyone gets too excited, allow me to temper your expectations a bit.  This group won&rsquo;t be creating entirely new rules for GD.  They&rsquo;ll be working collaboratively with Riot and the Moderation team to both decide where the lines should be drawn in terms of leniency in some areas as well as assist with wording that will make sure these rules are clear for the majority of the GD population.  This is GD&rsquo;s opportunity to have a direct hand in increasing clarity and consistency when it comes to moderation.\n\nSo who is going to be in this group?  That&rsquo;s where this discussion comes in.  **We would appreciate a comment below with someone&rsquo;s name from GD (other than your own) that you would feel comfortable with speaking on your behalf when it comes to rules for GD.**  Riot will review the list of names and select a handful of them to represent GD in this collaboration.\n\nWe&rsquo;ll be locking this discussion towards the end of the week, so if you want to suggest someone do it right away.  Feel free to comment on why you feel your nominee should be selected, but let&rsquo;s refrain from attacking other people or their nominees.  Thanks!","replies":[]}
