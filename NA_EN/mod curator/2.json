Among these changes were the removal of upvotes/downvotes for the main post in a discussion.\r\n\r\n&gt; There&#039;s a restriction in how much we can change with this but I have turned it off for the time being which only targets **discussion** upvoting or downvoting. This feature is still useable within comments of a discussion. This is subject to change debating on the general feedback during the testing phase from the community.\r\n\r\nThere wasn&#039;t a majority one way or the other in terms of feedback given about whether to leave them gone or add them back.  As such, we&#039;re reverting this change back to the original functionality to keep this section aligned with the rest of the Boards.","replies":[]}
