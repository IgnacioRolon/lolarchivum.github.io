the game was unwinnable. The very first thing, in the pre-game lobby. You then proceeded to blame your teammates for not taking an LP loss for you (since you didn't want to dodge), accuse Pyke of inting, harass your teammates for not dodging, spend the entire match explaining how you gave up and there was no chance of winning, and argue basically nonstop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-05-26T00:30:36.949+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow... not even in the game and already bringing the morale of the team down... yeah there is nothing toxic in there at all.
