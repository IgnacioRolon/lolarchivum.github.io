It's kind of a let down given how good the rest of the skin is.\n\nCaveat - I don't work on the skins team ;_;\n\nFun fact - Bard was the first new champion that I worked on! \n\nOther fun fact - Elderwood Bard's ult used to turn champs a blue-ish color to match the skin. You've guessed correctly about clarity: it was REALLY hard to tell when people were hit by his ult. It also wasn't as immediately understandable to players going against Bard for the first time, whereas the golden hourglass color is something that most players have run into before (Zhonya's Hourglass). I'm not sure if that was the call going into this skin (it's already pretty loaded with cool effects(!)), but it wouldn't surprise me if they ran into that same clarity question as before with Elderwood.\n\nI don't think we would make the frozen targets a different color for a Bard skin, due to the gameplay concerns that it would create. The Skins team works really hard to make sure that there aren't any gameplay advantages (or disadvantages) from skins, so I'd be surprised to see that changed around.","replies":[{"poster":"Das Kappatal","date":"2015-11-24T08:28:34.114+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's fair enough.\n\nBut surely being adorable penguins while Magically Journeying is already a massive gameplay advantage? ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-11-24T02:32:05.893+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was hoping for Santa Bard...
