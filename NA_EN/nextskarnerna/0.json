If they made a massive red post about it, its on the table, for better or worse. Its coming. \n\nHopefully they decide to scrap the passive. It does absolutely nothing for his role as a vanguard, and isn't effective in his role as a juggernaut; basically not effective for either of the roles Riot thought he might fill. \n\nAll it does is make his early jungle do-able without him being insanely strong, which they could accomplish by making his Q deal bonus damage to monsters.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-08-01T02:07:16.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To emphasize your last point.\nI got my mate to help me test him spire free.
