From the splash art alone, If you told me that this was a Battle Boss Jinx skin, I would believe you. The entire skin has the same colour scheme and feel as _Infiltrator Irelia_, a 975RP skin. All the other skins from this lineup have some sort of neon-esque thing going on for them; Pyke has his shoulderpads and dagger, Warwick has his tail, claws and ears, Akali has at least her hair in check, and Irelia has all of her blades and suit lit up (and even got an even shinier prestige skin, but I digress). Jinx, on the other hand, doesn't have any of that. It's just a dark purple jacket and a VR headset.\n\nAt the **very least**, I think it would be plausible to identify the 'neon' accents that _may_ be on her skin already and increase the brightness, or create some neon lines across/down her legs (It would look so cool when running around), because from what i've seen... I just don't see it being a PROJECT skin at this point in time.\n\n2.) **The Hair.** I am confused as to why the hairstyle choice was to be made out in the theme of Arcade Hecarim; why the Mohawk? A redesign would be appreciated; perhaps in the more traditional jinx route similar to Odyssey Jinx, if the clunky VR headset allows it.\n\n3.) **The Headpiece.** Alright, now perhaps this is wishful thinking, but remove the visor. We Jinx mains _love_ our crazy-eyes. A very nice a PROJECT fitting alternative would be a Hood, seen in that one lovely piece of PROJECT: Jinx fanart everyone adored. The hairstyle changes could easily accompany it, too.\n\n\n**Splash Art**\n\n1.) **The Waist.** Could you please, please, please fix her waist in the art. You _could_ rotate her torso so her spine is in-line with the rest of her body for a start, but at the same time increase the width of her stomach/hips to match.\n\n2.) **POW-POW?** Where is her minigun? Is it inside the Fishbones 2-for-1 special? is it hidden on her back? We might never know!\n\n3.) **Colours.** SO PAINFULLY BRIGHT PINK. Turn down the colours in her hair, and increase brightness of her 'neon' accents, wherever they might be lurking.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAlright so I think i've given some good insight into what is disliked, and what _could_ be changed. I have been wanting a PROJECT skin for my girl for a long time, as i'm sure so many others have, too. This isn't PROJECT Jinx, it's some Arcade/Infiltrator skin that has a splash of Demacia Vice mixed in. I know this skin could be so much more, and i'm willing to bet others feel the same way.\n\nDon't let my baby down, Riot.\n\nWith Regards,\nSlayer Jinx.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2019-07-16T03:50:21.078+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"PROJECT Jinx in a nutshell: \nhttps://i.redd.it/15wvdn0p4ka31.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-07-16T10:03:37.526+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, that one is good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"paisy","date":"2019-07-16T13:55:36.905+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"give us this\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Jink17162489/status/1151079108299956224?s=20","replies":[{"poster":"OneWingedHeart","date":"2019-07-16T18:28:29.151+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=paisy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=v64tUs4o,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2019-07-16T13:55:36.905+0000)\n>\n> give us this\n> \n> https://twitter.com/Jink17162489/status/1151079108299956224?s=20\n\nI second this motion.

I think the hair style is one of the few things that actually works, though: its very punk, which both goes with Jinx's typical aesthetic and the cyberPUNK aesthetic of PROJECT. I don't think it has to be pink though, I think a cooler blue or purple to fit better with the rest of the palette would be better and less jarring. Again, it better suits the \"themed colors\" thing PROJECT has going on. \n\nI didn't even notice Pow-Pow was missing from the splash, but now that you've pointed it out, its so obvious. Big miss. \n\nI think making the visor glow (a la PROJECT Lucian and Leona below) could help a lot and is a simple fix. Pow-Pow really needs to be in the splash, the overall splash just needs to have that \"glowing in a gritty futuristic city\" feel that every other PROJECT splash has. Her particles look nice from what I've seen, but her weapons hardly glow at all, which again, is a hallmark of PROJECT skins, their glowing, distinctive weapons (re-watching the preview yet again, it looks like Pow-Pow might be intended to glow, but is not. Again, this feels like a simple fix, possibly one they're working on...I hope)\n\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/185/088/large/joshua-brian-smith-project-lucian.jpg?1443929975\nhttp://www.lol-wallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PROJECT-Leona-Splash-Art-HD-4k-6k-Wallpaper-Background-Official-Art-Artwork-League-of-Legends-lol.jpg\n\nOverall, there's just nothing setting this one a part from any of Jinx's other skins, aside from maaaaybe the unique \"tech\" theme, which I feel was covered with both Odyssey and Zombie Slayer along with being skinlines that better captures Jinx's personality. Star Guardian is still the best imo, if you want something with flashy VFX but don't want the price of SG you've got Firecracker or Odyssey. Elf Jinx captures her personality and is very festive, Slayer feels like her weapons are cobbled together in a survival situation, Firecracker is another festive one. Mafia is showing its age, but at least has charm and is a great first skin for her. Even Odyssey, which I personally felt was a little lackluster, does the \"tech-y Jinx\" theme much better than PROJECT. If they really wanted a cyberpunk look for her, I think continuing Cyberpop would have been great for her, a much better fit. It doesn't even have to be part of a set, I think Jinx can carry a single skin on her own if they want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MALWARE","date":"2019-07-16T00:53:51.438+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"+1 {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psycho4rsenal","date":"2019-07-16T22:13:50.415+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with this Jinx is its stuffed with potential but so little of that potential being used.\n\nIn so many comments I run into I see people saying the visor is taking more than giving and Id agree. Ideally giving her a hood/visor that can be toggled would be better, Jinx's eyes are important to her design in most cases and the lore of this jinx an operation mishap left her insane but the design doesn't show it and the eyes would have been a very simple way to show it.\n\nFishbones could use work, its doesn't look unique versus other iterations like Firecracker/Odyssey/Classic. It looks like a lesser version of Slayer. Maybe some digital effects that show off the hologram that was on the splash would be unique. The head looks odd.\n\nThe skin needs to be brighter mainly with neon. Mixing Blue/Pink glowing neon tattoos onto her would look amazing and add a lot to her overall\n\n(nitpick tier) The hair could look better swapped with a blue primary and pink streak and the chromas suffer from some bad hair color schemes more so than the skin. Drop the rainbow hair on the white chroma, it looked bad on Od. when a blue/silver woulda been better and the same can be said here. Another chroma has \"Rakan\" like hair when different combos would be better. Blonde/Black, Black/Blonde, Red/Yellow, White/Black, Black/White, Pink/Red,  theres really a lot. White hair on any of the skins would just be amazing in general tbh.\n\nThis iteration barely comes off as \"project\" and more like cyberpunk gang member, she fails her thematic purpose. Pyke was an amazing take on the damaged cyborg design and taking some of that influence would be amazing. Making one arm clearly different from another would be neat, clear marks of damage would go a long way.\n\nI like the skin and its a good base but theres so much more that could be fixed its only passable but not amazing nor doing justice. I would hope some of these feedbacks from me or other people gets listened to, the skin could be so much more. \n\n(At least remove/toggle the visor and take away the rainbow hair on the white chroma)\n\nI look forward to the skin none the less {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2019-07-16T22:15:03.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with this skin is she doesn't look like a cyborg at all, she looks like Jinx with a VR visor.. \nShowing a lot of skin, and having the feather boa collar really gives the skin a very organic feel, I only see the cybernetics in one arm, but it doesn't really look that cybernetic.\n\nTHe skin looks fine, it's just failing at the theme.\n\nAnd yes, I know Project JHIN had the Boa, but actually this was a case where, Jhin doesn't show any skin and it's supposed to give away he's a cyborg and not a robot (it breaks the color from being monotone).

My last point with the skin is that her mohawk styled hair is too similar to her odyssey one, and strays too far from her other skins, which usually have a side bangs+braid style rather than a mohawk+braid style (Sorry for the lengthy comment, I just have a lot of thoughts on the topic)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The King Diamond","date":"2019-07-16T10:12:50.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because she doesn't fit that theme at all.
