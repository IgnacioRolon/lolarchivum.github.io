I activate youmuu&#039;s, start running at you, naturally you run away. Most Zed&#039;s, even I sometimes, will throw your W to get in range to ult. Most people running from Zed will flash the instant they see you. This is literally securing your death. \r\n\r\nIf the player is even a decent Zed he&#039;s gonna catch up to you regardless, though you WANT him to throw his W to reach you to ult. \r\n\r\nSay the Zed player throws W, then ults. If  you simply WAIT for him ult you, THEN flash away, he has no way to get in melee range/you have a greatly reduced chance to get hit by multiple q&#039;s etc unless he flashes. If you have a mobility spell and you know what you&#039;re doing you have an even better chance of surviving. \r\n\r\nIf Zed throws his W to reach you he has no other tools to reposition after you flash, blink away, etc. SO many times I&#039;ve ulted someone and they literally drag me to them while flashing because they&#039;re scared and just freak out when they see a Zed sprinting at you. \r\n\r\nI even had a Bard a few days ago use his magical journey and he literally carried me through his tunnel because he didn&#039;t WAIT for me to ult him, then travel through his tunnel. Obviously I could of went through it too, but Zed only has 3 seconds on his mark, and that&#039;s a different topic anyways. As a Zed player, I have no trouble laning against him, no trouble team fighting against him, no trouble playing against him at all.

One of my favorite plays to do with Malzahar :P\n\nAnyway its not thats hes impossible to deal with, its that he doesn't get punished for being dealt with. You can't gank one that has a brain, shove or freeze he can still CS with skills for 20 minutes straight. He builds lifesteal naturally so he has sustain. His core build also can shred tanks, which assassins aren't supposed to be able to do. And even if he makes a bad play he can still redo his ult to get out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Møøn Knight","date":"2015-04-04T16:45:30.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not so much white knighting.

He has counter play with Qss/Zhonyas. And unless you are playing a melee champ against him then you should be poking the shit out of him when he goes to last hit. Rush seeker's against him. Then finish morellos. And play safe if you need to. I see so many people complain about him but if you just play safe and farm well against him, depending on your champ, you will prob do more later in the game than him. I.E. (Orianna, Lissandra, leblanc, Ahri, Viktor, Xerath). Btw, there are safe counters like Diana, Lissandra, leblanc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-04-04T08:29:55.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> LEARN THE CHAMPS PEOPLE \n\nDon't insult me, I did!  And that's exactly why I know he should be nerfed!\nEven from his design at the most basic level. Why in god's name should his passive do percent health _magic damage_?  There is no reason for that.
