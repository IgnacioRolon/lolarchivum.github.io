First off, if you plan on commenting &quot;sounds like a personal problem&quot; or some irrelevant garbage like that, then gtfo. I make a valid claim and if you can&#039;t make a valid response as to why I&#039;m wrong then don&#039;t bother. \r\n\r\nSaying &quot;good game, easy&quot; is an oxymoron for sportsmanlike qualities. I&#039;ll report my own team, or the other team regardless. Not because I&#039;m uptight, but because it&#039;s such douchey thing to say. Especially winning after a 60-70 minute game; what was so &quot;easy&quot;? The game took long so obviously both teams were really close. But lets say you beat down the Nexus in under 20 minutes. The other team obviously knows they got demolished, and saying &quot;easy&quot; is like rubbing dirt in the wound. Instead of being a douche, just say &quot;gg wp&quot; or something along those lines. To me that seems far more sportsman like knowing that you did better, but still encouraging the other team.\r\n\r\nI would encourage all summoners to stop saying &quot;gg ez&quot;, and just say &quot;gg wp&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2016-10-31T18:03:37.207+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"All those who say \"GG EZ\" also look stupid because Ezreal is not in every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Amasa Delano","date":"2016-11-01T06:01:55.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:81}} You called?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-10-31T18:08:17.311+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a punishable offense.

Saying it when the game was essentially a 2v5 or when there was an intentional feeder or when there was someone extremely toxic on your team makes the saying completely untrue and extremely rude.

But I'm not talking about that. What if you're playing baseball and the reason you lose is because the entire outfield and the 2nd baseman left to grab a beer in the 2nd inning and never came back? Is it a good game then? What if you're playing soccer and one guy on your team scores 5 goals for the other team and yells \"HAHAHA TOUCHDOWN!\" as he does it... is that a good game? What if you you're playing basketball and two of your team mates literally drool on themselves and drop the ball when you pass it to them? Good game right? You'd expect that team to go up to you and go \"Good game!\"\n\nNO.\n\nIt's not fucking sincere. It's a fucking mockery of your team at that point and horrifically toxic.
