If you find it happening again, can you send me your leagueclient logs for that login session? You can find the logs in your root league folder > logs > leagueclient logs, and then grab the most recent leagueclient.log. You can send it to me either through google drive or a dropbox link. Let me know if you need any help with this! Let me know which problem is occurring also (loot disabled, store not working, invites not working, all three, ect)","replies":[]},{"poster":"yÃªs","date":"2017-11-02T20:39:28.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can open the store and invite friends now.
