Just started two days ago. The ping looks fine.  I usually get 60-70 and sometimes spikes to 120, but not game breaking by any means. I play on a lappy over Wi-Fi. Now I know people are going to say that's the reason, but I can be downloading and wife watching Netflix all on the same network and it runs the same. But, I did think it possibly could be on my end. I've been wanting to reformat for a couple months now, just haven't had the time, but being a 3 day weekend, I decided to go forward with it. Updated everything: drivers, graphics card ect... So I get in my first game, (after playing in bots for 20 min. ofc) and it runs perfect. Next game runs good for 10-20 min or so, then boom 2 second delay on movement and abilities. Ping at 67 ms. So, all in all, I wanted to reformat anyhow, but to answer any questions, that did not fix the issue. It doesn't appear that there was something in the background slowing the process. This is purely on riots end and they need to fix it because it sucks. In series now, lost one due to this problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yung Azn","date":"2016-05-26T20:15:34.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6.10 patch giving me lag spikes. there's no way it is on my end, as it has been always normal.
