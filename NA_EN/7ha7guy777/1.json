He has pretty solid sustain with blood thirst/price and decent poke with E. He can set up ganks or follow up on them with Q. He&#039;s manaless because we all know how much fun playing against manaless auto attack based champions is. He has his passive if he gets ganked. Spirit visage is a decent item on him so being able to justify rushing it might be good. Is there any reason to do it or not do it i haven&#039;t mentioned? He doesn&#039;t seem to have the best win or pick rate even with sated giving him insane healing so maybe he should be used in other lanes.\nIs it just me, or does blood price making farming way too easy?","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-08-31T06:28:18.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In complete honesty, probably. However, I have no idea how viable or strong it may be simply because there isn't a whole lot of information or players with experience to tell us how or why it works (assuming it does).\n\nOf course, pass Aatrox to Faker and I'm sure it will work fine, but you get my point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-08-31T05:30:43.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes pretty good against ad because of life steal and his passive.

This is because mid lane has a much shorter distance between the two opposing towers than top/bot lane. This is vital for champions like malzahar who don't necessarily have an escape mechanism. Mid laners are also put into mid lane for the increased scaling from levels over items (the reverse is true for adcs, where they scale better with items, thus they go bot in a 2v2.) Aatrox is not a bad mid, but taking him their may force your mage to have to go into a bad situation, like solo top laning. \nOf course their are some mages that do well in top lane, and therefore lane swaps with Aatrox may not be the worst thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2015-08-31T00:52:29.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I would say it is that if you really want an Aatrox on your team, he's better top or jungle, and if you want a high-sustain resourceless champion, champs like Vlad do a lot better. It would be okay as a counterpick, especially against another melee champion. His main problem is burst: he generally doesn't build super tanky, and depends on his W to keep him alive. With this being so, if you're up against something like an Annie or a Talon, you're gonna have a bad time.\ntl;dr\nYou can make it work, but don't pick it blind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxx Katarina xxx","date":"2015-08-31T00:28:30.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is pretty good vs Kat.","replies":[]}]}
