For the first few weeks it's been working fine, but as of last night I've been having massive problems with lag. My internet as a whole has been functioning fine, as has my laptop, but everytime I get into a game it feels like I'm like 5 seconds behind in game. ex: I'll be trying to get a cs and my champion won't move for 5 seconds and it's been getting really bad. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and am currently in the middle of doing a full repair. I've been having this problem since the I downloaded the hotfix last night","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-06T00:26:05.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that kinda sounds like your network is having problems with packet loss. Essentially, packet loss happens when some of the data your connection is sending gets lost or corrupted before it hits our servers. Let's test for any packet loss first before we jump to conclusions though. Grab the network logs from that game and have this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. Post a screenshot of what it shows in a reply here so I can take a look!","replies":[]}]}
