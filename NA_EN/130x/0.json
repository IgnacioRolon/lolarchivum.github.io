It reduces base cooldown which other sources of CDR then work on.  Also pretty sure Presence of Mind uses the CD after regular CDR is taken into account anyways.\n\nFor any champion other than Lux, an ace with full participation will refund 50% of their ult CD.  Lux is special in that her ult already has a similar effect, and these effects stack optimally, like regular CDR stacks with regular CDR.\n\nIt may still be a bit strong, in which case I'd suggest that Presence of Mind reduces the remaining CD by 10%, meaning that each proc in a row is worth less than the previous.  For instance if they happened instantly with your ult, the first proc would reduce the CD to 90% and then the second would reduce it to 81%.  This would also make it so if you're in the last 10% wait for your ult and you get a kill, it won't instantly refresh your ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Tegash","date":"2018-04-06T10:09:22.996+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ult hat (without Cosmic Insight) and 40% CDR reduces Lux's ult CD to about 24 seconds at max rank.\n\nPresence of Mind refunds 10% of ult cooldown per kill. This is not current cooldown, this is max cooldown. Very important to remember.\n\nThe way Lux's ult works is that it refunds 50% of its cooldown if it kills or one of its targets dies within 1.5 seconds. so that reduces the cooldown from 24 to 12. 30% of 24 is 7.2 seconds, leaving 4.8 seconds remaining. And yet I've managed to get full reset on three kills on several separate instances in a bots game.\n\nI think that Presence of Mind ignores Ultimate Hat's cooldown reduction (since it's a unique effect and isn't tied to purchasing CDR). That would mean that from Presence of Mind's calculation, Final Spark would have a 35.7 second cooldown. 30% of this value is 10.7, leaving 1.3 seconds of cooldown after Presence of Mind and Final Spark's refund effect both trigger.\n\nSince Final Spark goes onto cooldown as soon as you cast it, it has a second or two to tick down before the refunds are applied. Leaving it fully reset once both go through.\n\nOf course this only holds if Presence of Mind refunds Max CD, but I'm fairly certain that's the case.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DunkmasterDennis","date":"2018-04-05T12:47:51.095+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fucking late game {{champion:23}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-04-05T18:27:07.190+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good tryndamere players only take the last two points of ult at 17 and 18 so its not up as much as youd think","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Battalion","date":"2018-04-05T11:00:04.572+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{champion:99}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:53}}  \n\nYup","replies":[{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2018-04-05T21:09:01.579+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"Their ults aren't strong, which is why it has a low cooldown.

Without her ult, she pretty much just pokes relatively negligible damage(unless she's ahead) or you have awful positioning. So what happens if she misses her ult in a team fight? Then she waits for her ult to be up which means she's not contributing to fights much.\nSo what happens if you kill someone with her ult in a team fight? Then she still waits for her ult cd. The CD reduction is so that a Lux that _does her job_ can continue to be relevant in team fights. You can go \"boohoo why does she get 2-3 ults in a fight,\" but for her to do so, she needs to be winning that fight AND other champions have abilities at their disposal to use without waiting on a CD. ADC can just auto and crit for \"900\" damage consistently throughout the team fight.\n\nLux's ult is pretty much her main damage in a rotation, the resets are just so she can keep doing her job if she's doing well.\nThe assist change was made because recently, due to shield, hexdrinker, supports, that one rune that's pretty much hexdrinker, Lux's ult doesn't always execute, even on a squishy. Now with this buff she gets the reset if the ult would have killed the enemy but your team is who gets the last hit.\n\nSome ults are designed so that it's what a champion needs to finish an opponent.
