Every AD burst champion wants those stats. \nYour reasoning here also proves my point - you want it _when ahead_ to solidify a lead. When behind, its clearly a dang liability because you wont burst as hard as the other person and your DPS isnt going to be as high as theirs.\nYour reasoning is exactly how you get the stupid marksmen of a few months ago when they would do extremely high burst per second. \n\nStorm razor is an item that is very, VERY clearly meant for champions with assassin-esque playstyles who dont want DPS and instead want burst. It is not meant for champions like jinx, but do you understand _why people buy it on her?_ People buy it on her, and its a high winrate item, because on regular marksmen its a _snowball item_ that secures an existing lead. \nDue to the nature of a marksman it can be a viable item on them...

It's got no lethality and gives AS, things that assassins dislike. Problem is of course that AD assassins still have high AD so the automatic crit still has a lot of value for them. Then add in Duskblade to stack on top of it and you have a problem. \n\nMaking these two unable to stack should fix the problem because without the stackable Stormrazor + Duskblade procs Stormrazor holds pretty much no value for the vast majority of assassins (Rengar and Nocturne aside, but those would have to choose between Stormrazor and Duskblade as well). Lethality marksmen like MF would also need to make a choice between going for a spellslinger (Duskblade) and auto-attack (Stormrazor) based build.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"O for Orianna","date":"2018-08-12T04:03:44.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only riot listened...","replies":[]},{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2018-08-12T04:00:14.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hold it right there why should a katana be ranged only \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-08-11T23:46:10.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce can build both \"ranged only\" and \"melee only\" items\n\nIf you made it so that MF and Jayce couldn't build dusk, they'd be literally worthless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-08-11T18:22:15.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3095}}  no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leto GT","date":"2018-08-11T14:16:38.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making them share passive is better imo.
