Fill in with Last Whisper, Bloodthirster or BoTRK, and either a GA or another Zeal item. Max E first and aim to get a good pull in to win you fights. \n\n\nA quick tip for her: Xayah's level 2 is INSANE if you set it up right. As you're going to hit the last minion for level 2, throw your Q at the enemy and start stacking feathers behind them. Use the passthrough of the feathers to last hit the minion that should get you level 2 while hitting them then quick level your E and use it. The burst is very surprising and many don't expect it. Often you can kill them with their heal still up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2017-04-26T21:21:21.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh, is that why she does triple the dmg of every1 else\ngood to know she was actually underpowered","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaStruggIeEzreaI","date":"2017-04-26T21:20:59.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Max E and don't go Bork, go BF/crit items.
