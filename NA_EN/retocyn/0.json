Her passive is distracting and confussing.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So when Evelynn&#039;s passive is active, the volume and tone of sound effect changes, as well as the screen is blurred a little, this is so distracting and unfamiliar I couldn&#039;t focus on the game. It feels like learning the game from scratch, majority of the sounds is unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand why there would be so many differences just because her passive is up.\r\nI can tell her passive is up by glancing on her passive cd, the animated E, the circle around her. I don&#039;t get why there are 2 more ways to help the player realize that, but they change the aspects of the game, players (or at least I) are used to.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s reasonable for Rengar to have his screen blurred a little, since his ult lasts for about 20 seconds, but for Evelynn... She spends about half the game with her passive active.\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;s just me not being used to it yet, but the strength of voice and screen change was so drastic to me compared to Rengar&#039;s ult or Warwick&#039;s W. I couldn&#039;t focus the whole game as Evelynn, meanwhile on Rengar and Warwick it wasn&#039;t very distracting.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I&#039;d like to have some form of opting-out out of such &quot;improvements&quot; to the gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2017-11-14T18:18:23.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree I dislike it myself as well, it's quite annoying to have that stuff around the border of my screen all the time, and like you said it's obvious when you're invisible so it really serves no purpose.\n\n@needHymn, know what else informs you you've hit lvl 6? having a ability point availible and being able to level your ult, I mean for me that always seems way more obvious but hey if we can just make it a toggle/option you can keep it and others can get rid of it, win-win","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-14T18:43:52.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be fine with an opt-out for those in your situation, but I really like it.","replies":[]}]}
