Sure, some percentage of punished players avoid the chat, but the people we see on this forum are a small subset of a small subset. There are only a few thousand board users compared to *millions and millions* of *League* players, and only a small portion of those few thousand post here, and only a small portion of THOSE are afraid to use chat.\n\n>Its because of things like this. I know that its not your fault mods but you are representing the company... you can't tell me that a lot of these chats bans are...well...odd.\n\nI see very few bans I consider completely unjustified, actually. I see some that are relatively minor in the big scheme of things, but most of those are the result of repeated escalations by someone who is clearly not putting the time into properly changing their behavior. Those that ARE odd or borderline I encourage to submit a ticket to Player Support, who are usually really good at reversing the rare bans that are legitimate errors.\n\n> I get it you want your players to feel safe but when we don't feel safe by your system somethings wrong..when people are afraid of saying the littlest of things because they are afraid of getting into trouble something is not right.\n\nThe people who are afraid of using chat usually either A: don't understand how the system works, or B: fall into the category of those who feel attacked and restrained by an inability to insult, harass, or blame others on a regular basis. Exceptions exist, but I've found them to be rare once the system is properly explained.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninja Assassin","date":"2017-12-31T03:22:33.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> I&#x27;ll be honest -- speaking purely for myself, if someone feels like they&#x27;re being unduly restricted by being asked not to call other players bad, or insult them, or use hate speech, or blame people nonstop for mistakes, I&#x27;m happy to have them out of the *League* community.

Not saying I agree or disagree, but it&#x27;s not your right to tell other people how to speak and behave.\n\nIt's not, nor is it how I moderate. Hence the \"speaking purely for myself.\" I can hold personal opinions on what should or shouldn't be okay and still stick heavily to set rules, even when and where I disagree with them. I'm positive not every Rioter agrees with the official Riot policies 100% as well, and that's fine -- as individuals we're all allowed to have our own opinions. :)\n\nThe simple fact, however, is that, as a private organization, Riot is allowed to set rules for behavior, much like how if you start screaming at your local coffee shop they can (and likely will) ask you to leave and not come back. Private organizations have always been allowed to restrict acceptable behaviors on their property, be it real-world or digital property.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninja Assassin","date":"2017-12-31T03:40:17.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sorry about the dig at you not being an employee.

Hell I am afraid and I constantly watch my tongue. Maybe in that sense I am biased but still there are some really weird ass bans I have seen on here and I am afraid of being punished and you know I am a fresh account and I have absolutely no records of any infractions. I have also see this in the archives from the system and back then...weird bans and I saw people having the same reactions wondering what the hell and hoping that things would change and yet it seems that 4-5 years later things stayed the same. \n\nOkay let me ask you this...the ones that are minor in the big scheme of things...do you feel like the crime fits the punishment? If no then why not have a system that puts these people into an ai only mode for a period of time if they act up and if they don't listen and keep up the infractions just send them there instead of a perma ban? Wouldn't that make more sense and seem like a more fair and fitting punishment?\n\nI read through the system and I can tell for the most part what people get punished for and generally when people dont provide chat logs they deserve it.Ones that do generally don't have anything to hide and really don't seem like they deserve a punishment. Like I said ones like this strike me odd because it doesn't even look that bad if bad at all. \n\nalso forgive any spelling errors I am running on a few pots of tea and I reallyyyyy dont feel like going to bed \n{{sticker:sg-lulu}} \nOh and thank you for responding to me I do appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-12-31T03:49:29.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OniZetsu666,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mEzM6IuY,comment-id=00010000000000000000000100010001,timestamp=2017-12-31T03:39:09.477+0000)also forgive any spelling errors I am running on a few pots of tea and I reallyyyyy dont feel like going to bed \n> {{sticker:sg-lulu}} \n> Oh and thank you for responding to me I do appreciate it.\n\nTea is life.

If someone is being a consistent negative influence on the game community after repeated warnings that their behavior isn't acceptable, sidelining them for a little bit in a place where they STILL WILL PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE doesn't really solve the issue at all.

Still a bit uneasy with occurrences like this but I will have faith in what you have said that things like this can be resolved if support is contacted. \nIf you have seen my account backround (dont know if you can check that or anything or if you have) but I am a fresh account nothing on me and I got into the game after d-day for paladins came. So I packed my shit and came here because I thought it would be fun and I wasn't going to go play smite because who knows what other crazy crap hi-rez might do and I dont wanna fall in love with another game just to have it lie. \nHere is one thing I have seen and maybe my normal elo is in a nice sweet spot for low toxicity or something but I have met only one toxic person in the month I have been here. Thats it. In paladins 1/3 games you got into a game with a toxic player and I watched for some of these people...and they NEVER got any sort of punishment.  So for that I will tip my hat to riot because hey they actually do something!  \nNo seriously its really refreshing knowing that if someone is being an asshole they can and will get into trouble. My main fear is the system being abused and for heavy censorship. That is my main concern for people.  Yeah I know I dont speak for everyone but hey I gotta ask for myself because well I do care about the people in this game. Alot of them are really nice and I dont want to see good people get into trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-12-31T04:16:37.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OniZetsu666,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mEzM6IuY,comment-\n> If you have seen my account backround (dont know if you can check that or anything or if you have)Here is one thing I have seen and maybe my normal elo is in a nice sweet spot for low toxicity or something but I have met only one toxic person in the month I have been here.

When you set out to be a friendly, encouraging, supporting teammate who engages people and encourages the same in return, you tend to run into a lot more friendly, chill players than you do assholes. Toxicity breeds toxicity, and the opposite is generally true as well. :)\n\n>My main fear is the system being abused and for heavy censorship. That is my main concern for people.\n\nI wouldn't worry unduly. It's only purpose is to remove those players who insult and harass others, or spread negativity at an alarming rate. There's also some leeway built in that catches those players who have a bit of a bad day here or there, so long as those bad days don't include zero-tolerance language. To actually earn a permanent ban you either need to be consistently problematic over a long period of time (and through multiple warnings) OR be truly and egregiously toxic. Accounts can recover their standing through good behavior, so escalating all the way to a permanent ban takes effort -- or, rather, takes NO inclination to admit you might be wrong and show reform. Most players have NOTHING to worry about. :)\n\nAnd hey! Welcome to *League.* Glad to have you. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-31T03:04:38.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I type in games more often than I don't, and I have never been punished.
