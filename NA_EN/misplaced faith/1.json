New year, and all that shit. However, when I try to play the game, it doesn't open. I can open the client and everything fine, but when I actually press Launch, it disappears like it does usually, and I find myself starring at my computer screen for ten minutes before I realize something is amiss. Dunno what's actually going on, whether it's my own fault or if it's an issue with the client, but it's slightly annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T23:14:47.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a connection problem that can't reach pvp.net, or load up recent updates.
