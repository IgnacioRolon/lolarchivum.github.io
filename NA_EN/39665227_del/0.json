If you need a list of them I can *gladly* provide it, but I doubt you do. It's not meant to be a combative statement, simply just something to think about seeing as Riot is apparently hesitant to ever let Eve have a good, functional assassin kit for the exact reasons that are apparently fine on more popular champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Dantilq","date":"2015-03-30T06:16:07.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the issue with making her an assassin, is that her ganks are just too strong, there is too limited ways of dealing with them right now.

I think Riot should add some sort of hints that she is somewhat close, even if she is not visible. Like make a much larger \"aura\".

The stealth change is heavily noticeable by the assassin players, while the fighters think she's \"gutted\" without the move speed.\n\nNow, I'm all-for people doing whatever playstyle they feel is effective, but her lore, character, passive, and W *all heavily beyond a doubt* make her an assassin. Unfortunately, Riot doesn't like her whenever she's an assassin, and so the easiest \"effective\" way to play her is a fighter playstyle. \n\nThe problem caused by this is that Riot keeps shoving Fighter traits onto her, but still is acting like they want her to be an Assassin. The passive change was the first thing in a *long* time supporting an Assassin playstyle that they've made since her last rework. The end result is \"fighter Eve\" players pretending she's \"supposed\" to be a fighter and not liking changes in the assassin direction, while \"assassin Eve\" players not liking the last like 4 changes they did before this that nudged her in a fighter direction.\n\nFrankly, half of Eve's current kit should've gone to a fighter champion ages ago. She's not a fighter, and *nothing* about the character would imply she is other than some bad kit changes Riot has made to her. Riot needs to stop trying to make a champion with her background into a fighter, and try to make a her a healthier assassin, and then put the fighter traits of Eve (her sustained Q damage and her ultimate) onto a new fighter's kit, and all the problems will be solved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheUltimateSpear","date":"2015-03-30T02:38:49.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!\n\nThe passive change is really nice.

Which she should be able to considering she's a gank-heavy rather than a farm-heavy jungler. The base W cooldown is really too long to make the hit and run playstyle work at the moment.\n\nAnd yes, please give Eve's ult minimum damage. It doesn't have to be ginormous, but it feels so bad that you can't use it to finish someone off. Her ultimate is her only ranged spell, and the only one that can potentially exceed detection range.

She's been one of my most played champions virtually since I joined League.\n\nThe change to her passive feels nice but it doesn't add much power.  Late game it is very rare for a fight to last long enough that you can afford to drop out for 3 seconds to restealth and then get back in to reinitiate.\n\nHer W change is problematic.  In principle trading the passive MS boost for cooldown on W gives a similar strength.  There are two problems with this.  First, that passive MS is what let Eve be sticky enough to actually deal damage as a melee champion.\n\nSecond, there are very few cases where the new on-spell cooldown will actually come into play.  Lets look at the possible outcomes of Eve running into someone:\nShe kills them - W is reset without need for the new on-spell.\nThey run - she has no extra MS and is therefore unlikely to get the spell hits needed to reset W.\nShe runs - she has no extra MS but if the enemy can keep up with her she will get spell hits to reset W.  In terms of speed this is kinda a wash but W resets her stealth timer so she can't turn invisible to get away as easily.\nShe gets killed - no difference in this scenario.\nBasically if she is killed or kills her target theres no difference between her play before and now.  If she's chasing someone she's less likely to be able to catch them.  If she's running she's less likely to get away.  That's overall a nerf where her interaction with single targets is concerned.\n\nThe one case I've found the change to W to sometimes help is in teamfights when the fight goes on long enough to get a full reset from the cooldowns and I need to reposition without finishing my first target off.  Often tho the old MS would have been just as good here but there are a few cases (fucking Ashe slows) where the W active being up more often is better.\n\nIn theory Eve with 40% cdr can have W up more than half the time now but with all the nerfs Eve has suffered over time it's really hard to afford that 40% in your build when you need items like BoRK to deal any damage and Randuins to survive fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2015-03-30T01:07:29.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EllJfAGO,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2015-03-29T23:50:49.239+0000)\n>\n> I'll check with a couple of people who've done work on Eve and get back to you about this one. \n> \n> While I'm at it, since we're talking about Eve anyway, I'll get their thoughts on how the 5.6 changes have gone as well.\n\nYes!
