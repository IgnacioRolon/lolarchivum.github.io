Taking advantage of Sona is not difficult at all. Don't let her just power chord you for free, it's really not that hard.\n\nIf you let Sona reach late game, you've already fucked up. Sona is a lategame powerhouse with a weak early game. If you don't keep her from reaching that point, then you're letting Sona scale, which is exactly what you do NOT want from her, as she's very weak when behind if she hasn't scaled yet.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-12-06T22:53:09.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"oh you're hiding behind the excuse \"they're weak early just win before 20 min\" when if the sona has a brain they wont be in the face of the enemy 24/7 and taking advantage of failed engages or just the enemy being passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedric Etwahl","date":"2017-12-06T23:06:23.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not hiding behind anything. Sona isn't unbeatable late, but she hyperscales. That's a fact. Sona's early game is pitiful, especially now after these Q nerfs.\n\nOf course Sona isn't going to be in the enemy's face at all times, that's suicide. Sona THRIVES against a lane that can't do anything against her. Something like a {{champion:67}} {{champion:497}}  lane is going to have a rough time because they both get taken advantage of by Sona and her poke. If the enemy fails their engage, that's not Sona's fault, and of course she's going to take advantage of it, don't act like that's an issue with Sona.\n\nNot only that but even outside of the 2v2, the jungler SHOULD be giving Sona's lane a rough time because she has almost nothing to stop a gank or an all-in pre-6.\n\nThe point is Sona is VERY beatable in lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord of Math","date":"2017-12-07T05:33:53.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundHades,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=imBE255q,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-12-06T11:58:30.298+0000)\n>\n> Because sona is stupid as hell to play against at every point in the game along with having a single wide skill shot that wins games\n\n{{champion:432}} takes offense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-07T05:30:45.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when are \"the fans\" relevant in regards to game balance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-12-06T06:19:05.483+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":8,"body":"Good riddance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-12-06T09:42:18.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://imgur.com/GcwueJP\n\nlol","replies":[{"poster":"Winterwings","date":"2017-12-06T10:22:25.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Haha, nice try, but sadly we're not that blind...\nJune / July 2017\nThe onset of Ardent Censer meta, and let me remind you even then (A ideal meta for Sona) she was still considered only average as Janna/Lulu took the top tier spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-12-06T10:30:19.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Winterwings","date":"2017-12-06T10:44:28.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really no surprise considering how simple-but-effective her kit is...\n52-53% WR is probably supposed to be considered a baseline normal winrate with a kit such as that.
