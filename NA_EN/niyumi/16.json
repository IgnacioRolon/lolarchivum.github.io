Even against TERRIBLE players who would feed under normal circumstances, I lose, because I don&#039;t enjoy playing the three champs per role that the whales approve of.\n\nOh, you're jungling? Well, if you're not playing Lee, Kha, Hec or Vi, you lose, guaranteed. Since they all clear faster, gank better and more often, and can build full tank and still one shot you.\n\nTop? Well, you best be playing Jayce, Maokai or Ryze, or you lose.\n\nMid? If you're not Kat, Ori or Ryze (maybe Ahri), you're done for.\n\nBot lane? I hope you main Draven, Cait or Ez.\n\nSupport is the only role with more than 2-3 champs that are viable, but even then, you have a few power picks like Zyra, Brand and Malz.\n...\n\nI just don&#039;t get how anyone can believe Riot gives a fuck outside of money. There are maybe 3-4 champs per role you can play and be worth anything, and half of those champs just automatically win unless they&#039;re beyond garbage players. Balance isn&#039;t a thing, and when a champion is legitimately broken, Riot spends four months fixing them if they do at all -- but, you know, that&#039;s putting the quality of your game before income potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2017-02-07T21:05:10.931+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://cdn-9chat-fun.9cache.com/media/photo/a1AgJ645m_480w_v1.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-07T21:05:03.328+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They just nerfed Vi, your post was just invalidated because you said EVERYTHING.\n\nNot to mention they just made a new gamemode and provided the champs for free.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-02-07T21:10:49.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"They nerfed Vi?
