If you can manage to access his power through his absurdly high skill ceiling then he is (was) overpowered. However because its so hard to reach that point, if someone does then you write it off as they outplayed you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-02-29T04:12:58.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can smell all that salt from all the way here in canada you need to take a breath buddy","replies":[]}]}
