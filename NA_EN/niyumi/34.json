Just looking for a game to play when I burn out on League. I bought Fallout a week ago and love it, but I don&#039;t want to finish it too quickly. Been looking at Syndicate, Star Wars, ARK and Call of Duty -- any of them any good?\r\n\r\nI also enjoy platformers and RPGs (bought Ori and loved it, but it only lasted me about 9 hours, even though I finished it 100%), so those are always welcome suggestions.\r\n\r\nI dunno, figured I&#039;d ask people who play these games what they think. :P Thanks for any help. ^^","replies":[]}
