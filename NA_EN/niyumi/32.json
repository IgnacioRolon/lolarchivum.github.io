I know that seems like a silly question, but I grew up entirely alone -- my family hates me, and I never had friends growing up (still don't have any). Never so much as been on a date or hugged a girl, none of that.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds selfish, but I have incredibly bad anxiety / depression, to the point that they wanted to put me in a mental home if I wasn't so terrified of death that they know I'd never hurt myself. Being around other people lets me forget about all my issues for a while, and I can actually enjoy myself and be less miserable than usual (don't know that I've ever been happy though) -- that's a big part of why I like playing MMOs.\r\n\r\nBut, ever since I got out of school 5 years ago, I've been more alone than ever. I used to see people at school every day, even if no one talked to me, so I didn't feel entirely alone. Now though, I go days without talking, and the only time anyone talks to me is if they need something.\r\n\r\nSo, I want to ask how people make friends, where nerds hang out, all that, but I know it'd be pointless in the end, since I'd be too afraid to let anyone in, and just end up driving everyone away. I want to at least feel like I tried before I accept reality and just give up though.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-05-31T20:49:23.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sign up for local events youre interested at rec centers, community centers, etc.\nIve never gone to conventions like the guy posted but i've made friends playing backyard basketball and things like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-06-01T04:01:45.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't live in a city that does things like that.
