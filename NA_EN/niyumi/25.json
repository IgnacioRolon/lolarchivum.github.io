WoD killed WoW for me, so I went and played Wildstar for a year, but it died off. Went to GW2 for a while, tried getting into FFXIV, Blade and Soul (which, while fun, is kind of repetitive), TERA, etc.\n\nAfter all that, I've only got GW2 left. While I enjoy the game, there's not a ton to do as far as raiding and PvE goes. So I have a question about WoW, which arguably has the best PvE in the genre.\n\nI played WoW for 13 years, from Vanilla to WoD's prepatch (6.0). Loved it the whole time. But, when WoD launched and made all my classes 2-3 buttons, I just couldn't enjoy the game anymore. But I miss raiding, and I miss the \"game\" like PvP they have. I keep hearing wonderful things about Legion, but I don't know if it's really any good anymore.\n\nSO!\n\n* Are the classes more than 2 buttons now?\n\n* Are the raids actually interesting and fun, or are they braindead now?\n\n* How's the lore holding up -- any more retcons?","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-05-30T10:21:22.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont start, its more addicting than crack, all the advice you should need","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-05-30T05:51:30.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most Classes do have a fair amount of ability usage (at least from what I've played, I don't play all the specializations, though.)\n\nRaids are pretty interesting, but \"fun\" depends on what kind of people you get (and what difficulty you're on.) Most of the time, LFR/Normal are easy enough, fairly fun and complex, but Heroic is where you'll get a bunch of folks who don't know mechanics. Somehow.\n\nLore - it's alright, mostly. A lot of it is fairly light, out-of-the-way stuff, as in there's some major stuff that's just hand-waved or glossed over, but there is maybe one or two good stories to be told in Legion.\n\nAltogether, I'm surprised you're hearing good things about Legion, as personally, I feel like it's gone pretty far south so far. If you wanna know what I mean, ask and I'll tell, but for now, I just wanted to see your questions answered.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-05-30T06:28:07.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, with Activision fully in charge now, and all the old Blizzard guys fired, I'm fully expecting WoW to be a shit show now.\n\nBut, yeah, almost everything I hear about Legion is good (as compared to WoD). Some people are even going so far as to compare it to Cata.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-05-30T06:33:59.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. I'll warn you, there's a lot of abstract spacing-out of content in the form of \"do this x week, come back next week to do y\". (they've mostly removed it, but if you're up to date like I am, the Broken Shore/Tomb of Sargeras \"questline\" is literally the definition of unimaginative filler.)\n\nThere's also Reputation-based quest lockouts for one reputation in specific, Dungeon/Raid attunement, and not a lot of gravity is given to the whole \"legion of immortal demons coming to annihilate Azeroth\" schtick. Like, you'll find more off-hand jokes than you'll find people rightly fearing the Legion.\n\nAnd don't get me started on Khadgar.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
