Even if he did have an LDR, I'd still have well over 300 armor, in which case I'm still taking less than 30% damage from his autos. (Armor formula says 22% at 350 armor) And he still does a flat 12% less because of Tabi.\n\n> 5. His E gives him bonus true damage\n\nAnd remind me why he has that? And if ONLY HIS TRUE DAMAGE is doing anything meaningful... that's 100 per auto, if that. Unless he can auto 42 times in half a second, there's no reason for me to have died that fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Kats Pajamas","date":"2017-01-31T00:43:25.839+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sciela,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TgBjiYaJ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-01-31T00:03:58.863+0000)\n>\n> Physical damage.\n> \n> Also physical damage.\n> \n\n\nDon't be stupid.

It would be higher at the beginning of the fight and lower at the end because of the variance in damage from bork, but that's average. If he used bork's active, that would have dealt about 100 damage.\n\nThe fight lasted just under 4 seconds, and Yi had capped attack speed, meaning he would have done 9-10 autos + alpha strike + bork + red buff burn.
