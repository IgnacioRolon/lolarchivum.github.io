You know that bug where Jayce's hammer freezes? Been around for years. Still no fix, and a Rioter went as far as to say it was pointless to try and fix it anyway. And uh, have you seen some of the models in the game? Any competent team can update them in a few days to a week -- yet Rito doesn't spend the money to do so.\n\n> All of the completely non-profitable, massive content patches like the summoner&#x27;s rift update, splash updates, butcher&#x27;s bridge (i am not even going to guess at how many thousand work-hours that was, for what was basically a story event).\n\nNot directly profitable, no, but they are incredibly profitable indirectly. See, with Butcher's Bridge, they hyped up the GP rework as well as TF, Graves and MF (the first got a rework, the rest got new skins), and made money off of that. The map update was more to keep the vain players; a lot of gamers equate graphics to quality, and will quit a game if they think it looks ugly. So Rito updated the map to look better, and to draw in those more shallow gamers and keep them -- same idea for splash arts.\n\nAnd thousands of hours? Ha! In a game with as small a scope as League, it should take no more than a hundred.\n\n> Constant balance changes, much better than any other online game.. Really, a 1-2% winrate deviation is amazing for a game this complex., no matter what the forum ragers want you to think.\n\nConstant changes, sure, but are any of them actually trying to balance the game? We have absurdly strong champions who continue to be strong, even though they have 56%+ winrates (Ashe, for example) -- why? Well, Rito doesn't want balance, since that doesn't make money in an F2P game. Instead, they usher in FOTM waves, and spike skin sales for certain champs / classes. In a game like League, you will never see true balance.\n\n> Good communication with the community and support/tolerance for fansites, 3rd-party programs and sites like op.gg and lolreplay, allowing youtube videos. A lot of big companies do everything in their power to shut down any and all fan content beyond art and wiki/forum discussions.\n\nSo they let you advertise for them -- big whoop.

What better way to entice people to buy RP other than to open the chests and play the gambling game that so many other F2P companies love? Once you get a couple free things, you want more and more, and you're more willing to spend money to do so.\n\n> Continue to develop the game so it doesn&#x27;t stagnate and become boring\n\nEvery champion release, every skin release, they make oodles of money. They do not develop their game out of passion for the game. If that was true, they would be constantly working to update the older champions / models / adding maps / actually balancing / fixing bugs / whatnot (and no, having a skeleton of a skeleton crew doing champ updates is not that. A competent team would have a champion update done within a week or two at most) and making the game the best it can be -- but they certainly don't do that.\n\n> Care about the community and make it a top priority to get rid of those that make the game unfun to play\n\nNo, they don't. Trolls, feeders, AFKers, and all these other types of people are rampant. Smurfs are entirely allowed. But they remove people who hurt your feelings over the internet. So, yeah, they don't make it a top priority to do anything but the most shallow of policing.\n\n> You were saying?\n\n***You*** were saying?","replies":[{"poster":"G4LLOWSC4L1BR4TR","date":"2016-09-03T00:26:39.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sciela,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=aMeETP2L,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-09-02T19:25:54.968+0000)\n>They do not develop their game out of passion for the game.\n\nYou mean a company does their work for profit or something? **_What horrible monsters_**!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RcGjWO640w","date":"2016-09-02T19:09:30.753+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A business that designs its games to be financially stable?!

They are only about the money, but the fact that its a Free game means they are money hungry? Thats the logic you are going by?\n\nWhile it wasnt a reply to me, i wanna reply to the previous poster. First off Hextech is Free. You get free chest for every S champion you get, and free Key Shards after a couple of games. If you are so entice by that, that you feel you NEED to buy more, than the only person to blame is yourself. Again no one is forcing you to buy the hextech. You are doing so knowingly. Let alone the fact that it isnt even a requirement for the game, so how is that in any way Only about the money?\n\nEvery patches there is always balancing issues, that is what happens when you have a game with this many champions/items. its really is Riot fault, but they are improving. Plus they do updates on older champions, and items all the time. You just assume because it isnt in every update that they never do it. So again thats all on you. \n\nIm not even going to comment on the last thing because its just becoming an annoyance at this time. Not quite sure why people believe this, but they do ban people for trolling, anyone who visits this site for 5mins could see that! It is a problem, and while people can just make a new account its going to be difficult to catch every single person breaking the rules. Just like in real life!","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-09-02T23:42:32.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, so let me explain how F2P works.\n\nSo, you draw in a lot of people with your base game, cool, they start playing and potentially having fun, cool -- as long as they get addicted, you don't care. Then, you wave all kinds of extra features / cosmetics / whatever in front of their face -- and, people being the vain little things they are, they'll buy then to stand out from their friends and look different.\n\nSo that's F2P in a nutshell. That's how the model works: you make money off the cash shop, instead of your game.\n\nNow, we're moving along, your game is popular. You still don't make money off of the base game, so you put as little money into it as you can -- just enough to keep people playing and content enough to spend money. You funnel nearly all of your budget into the cash shop, making new, sparkly things and trying to get whales to buy them. You don't make any money for the work you put into the base game, so you ignore it if at all possible, and change it to best suit your cash shop.\n\nSo what does that mean in League? Well, it means we ignore the game itself, and focus on skins / champs / RP in general: Balance is not and never will be a thing, the game is full of bugs and bad programming, we have a ton of old, out-dated models, programming, mechanics, etc., and we have a lot of champions who desperately need reworks / visual updates but are ignored -- but hey, we'll make placebo balance changes every two weeks, and add new skins!\n\nJust the fact that you're willing to throw away your game like that and declare yourself F2P shows how greedy you are.","replies":[{"poster":"G4LLOWSC4L1BR4TR","date":"2016-09-03T00:25:07.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are plenty of ways that F2P games \"force\" players to spend money. Riot does none of those. There are no paywalls to unlock game modes, no pay to win options AT ALL, and recently they've even made skins, by far the biggest revenue source I'd assume, available for free too. Only an incredibly small fraction of their playerbase ever spends money on the game at all. Their balance team may not be perfect, but it's all too easy to point out times when the community was outraged about something that turned out to be fine. Most recently, duskblade was supposed to be completely gamebreaking, but has turned out to be a fairly reasonable item. It's much easier to get angry that they're not balancing perfectly than it is to actually get everything right in game. Could they be doing better? Yes. Are they greedy money hogs?
