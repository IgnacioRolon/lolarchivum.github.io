If you ask me, the ability to right click and become more of a drain tank than Vlad EVER was with WOTA is more toxic than an AP champ healing a tiny bit when they cast.\n\nSo, cap lifesteal. Make it only able to heal up to a certain amount of health per shot, or put a hard cap on the conversion ratio.
