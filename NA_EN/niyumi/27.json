Riot knows this and he is getting reworked again. In the meantime I suggest banning him.

I HATE ADC's that want to go solo and get Splatted.  Everyone _can_ kill you as a squishy ADC.  Its your job to out play and stay with team mates that can peel for you.\n\nEdit:  Also, Generally speaking ADC > Tanks > APC > ADC.  So its kinda Ryze's Job to be able to kill you.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-04-26T23:31:22.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoever said I was alone? I went in on teamfights, and Ryze would literally carry the fight and kill everyone. I could kill his entire team within a couple seconds, but then he just 4v1s and wins.","replies":[{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-04-26T23:39:45.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case, you need to pick your kill order better.
