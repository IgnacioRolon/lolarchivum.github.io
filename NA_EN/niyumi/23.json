He has one of the strongest early games for adcs, and his passive is all about snowballing (and ensures that trading kills is worth for him, so don't do that). Your goal is simply to avoid letting him get any cash ins, and then if he's been prevented from being snowballed you can probably begin to fight him mid-late depending on your own adcs powerspikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omishio","date":"2017-02-15T00:56:23.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get a good support like leona,nami, malz etc to shut him down~","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2017-02-06T20:19:20.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A major part is supports\nit depends on your support and his support","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-06T19:28:17.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you have good cc on your support, waiting till your powerspike is usually a good idea. \n\nAlso, I thought you didn't play adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-02-06T19:41:48.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing about fill mains, you play every role.

If he only has one axe spinning you can auto attack him once while his axe is in the air.  It might not sound like a lot but if you consistently auto him when he goes to CS it adds up over time.  People who play Draven typically are very cocky and you can bait them into bad engages as well.  My favorite pick into Draven is Miss Fortune since her Q can wreck him and you can disengage with your E so he can never get close to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2017-02-06T19:48:13.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The few times I've played ADC and ended up against a Draven, I was usually playing {{champion:22}}/{{champion:110}} and it wasn't a completely terrible experience.

Either force poke him when he goes to catch them or burst him and get out. He has really high DPS when he catches axes. Never go in if he has 2 axes up. Varus, MF, Jhin, and Cait all do pretty well against him. You either have to beat him before he finishes his Youmuu's (the hard way) or you have to outlast his early game until he falls off (the easier way). Don't bother trading if you can't win and he has lifesteal he has one of the best lifesteals in the game.
