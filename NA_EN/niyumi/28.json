Removed, nerfed, adjusted, or buffed? Sure, but never gutted\n\nalso, since when has Corki been \"god-tier\", let alone currently? He sits at a 48-49% win-ratio in the midlane (his most played lane) across *all elos* with an 8-9% play-rate. Those are decent numbers but hardly OP, let alone god-tier.\n\nDeath's Dance: I don't have any stats atm to confirm or deny my beliefs but I *do* hold the opinion that it's a pretty op item that provides quite unenjoyable gameplay at the very least","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-08-26T01:51:18.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No I mean gutted. \n\nCorki needs to lose something (maybe his armor shred), and then have his numbers turned way down. He is just beyond broken right now.\n\nDeath's Dance needs to lose either the damage reduction or the lifesteal (or half the AD), and maybe it'd be fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-08-26T02:47:00.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Imo I think it should lose it's cdr and/or just revert the buff to bring it back down to 15%.
