Even an amateur team could do a champ update in a few days to a week, so Riot must only have 1-2 people working an hour a day.\n\nOnly really time-consuming parts of it are setting up an appointment with a voice actor (they can sometimes be totally booked) and modeling / rigging. Programming doesn't take long (especially in a tiny game like League), and QA doesn't take long on a singular, small map with 140ish champs. So, there's really no excuse for how long they take.\n\nThe other half of the issue is that Riot balances around what's the most profitable, not what's actually fair.\n\nF2P just needs to die already. It's always been a money making scam, but people are too dumb to see it, and too lazy/greedy to pay a subscription or a box price. Meanwhile, the quality of gaming suffers for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-26T00:13:11.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sound like you know what you're doing, you should submit an application to Riot; http://www.riotgames.com/careers","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-02-26T02:58:28.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to work in gaming (always been a dream of mine), but I wouldn't work for a company that has already sold out to a Chinese megacorp and cares as little for their game as Riot does.\n\nEven if I did, I actually put effort into what I do, and I care about games as more than just a way to make money. I wouldn't cut corners to save money, I wouldn't be willing to intentionally destroy my product just to make it more profitable, and I'd want to slap Beck and Merril the first time I saw them. I interned at Nintendo over the summer a few years back, and I loved it, but my ideals and values just don't match up with how money-driven modern gaming is. \n\nSo I'd likely be fired, despite being one of the hardest workers they have. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
