Now, tell me how that's hard in any way.\n\nThe Riven CC cancelling bug is EXTREMELY hard to abuse. To the point where you´ll actually get it right in around 1 out of 100 matches, and if you´re lucky. Riven's animation cancelling is what defines her, but it isn´t available just to her.\n\n>Right click, AFK, win.\n\nYou´re either stupid or smoking some really good weed.\n\n>He has some of the easiest farming in the game\n\nTristana has it easier, Caitlyn has it easier, Jhin has it easier, Graves has it easier. Essentially, the entire ADC roster has farming easier than Draven does bar Kalista before Runaan's, maybe. Because all they do is AA or use abilities on minions and aren´t gated by a mechanic that allows them to gather more gold through efficient AAs along with careful but fast repositioning. A good Nami can absolutely prevent Draven from gathering Adoration stacks. So can Soraka if her silence is timed right. Zyra, Leona, Brand, Malzahar. They can all hard punish a Draven who tries to go from the axe catches.\n\n>he does more burst damage than almost everyone\n\nLate game, perhaps. Early game, he can easily be beaten.\n\n>has more sustain than almost everyone, AS/MS steroids that are up every half second\n\nHe goes Warlord's. Do you even know why some ADCs go Warlord's instead of Fervor?\n\nPlus, his Blood Rush has a static cooldown of 12 seconds. Draven isn´t a champion to go Essence Reaver, so unless he goes CDR runes or gets blue buff, the cooldown is staying the same. And unsurprisingly, the cooldown is only reset if he catches a Spinning Axe, which may or may not be easier during farming, but is difficult during trades.\n\n>and can hit you from across the map. Now, tell me how that's fair. \n\nSo can Ashe, Jinx and Gangplank. I don´t see how that is relevant.\n\n>Alright, so tell me how she is OBJECTIVELY broken. I mean literally broken, can't beat her, none of that. She just automatically wins, right?\n\nNo, but the simple fact that she gets two sheen procs, one of those being converted into true damage makes her broken. Imagine if Irelia could Q you for 400 physical damage plus the same amount in true damage.\n\nA gigantic rock dude, whose ult clearly states he is unstoppable can´t ult out of Camille's ult. Mohawk kid GOING BACK IN TIME can´t do so for Camille's ult. A Viking that during his ult can´t be disabled is disabled by Camille's ult. And yes, locking someone down in an area is a disable. Or at the very least should count. I´d understand if there actually was a reason behind her ult doing it. I can understand her ult applying a visual AoE EMP to prevent Ekko from ulting, but not Malphite and Olaf.\n\nShe's Irelia, but better and considerably more unhealthy. Riot's nerfs are most likely to divert her away from a tankier build i.e. stop going TF/Titanic into tank. If anything, her Q costs should be changed. 25 for the first cast, 50 for the true damage recast, 25 for the physical damage recast. Her E nerf is good enough, and her ult should disappear if she dies.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RexSaur","date":"2017-01-25T07:36:16.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all get it you want to abuse that shit to get out of gold, but how about try getting good at the game instead instead of having to abuse overpowered champs as a crutch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gamer Gallade","date":"2017-01-25T06:07:21.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning the new Warwick will only last for a little bit.\nWhen people figure him out real quick.\nCamille will still get banned or receive less because of the new Warwick\nYou better hope the upcoming nerfs will make her less ban-able.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-01-25T06:18:39.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The upcoming nerfs will make her nonviable.
