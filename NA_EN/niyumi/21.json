That was tolerable before preseason, since we had flask and mana pots to stay in lane for more than two minutes (Enough time to buy Sheen and maybe boots)... but now GP is just about useless pre-Sheen. You only have enough mana to last-hit with Q for about two minutes in lane (And if you have to use oranges to sustain or break out of CC? You're goinna run out of mana before you even hit 300 gold.), and then you run out, and have no way to recover it.\n\nIn a 28 minute game, I didn&#039;t even have my first ult upgrade. : / I had ~400 Serpents.\n\nI know you don&#039;t like GP, and I know you don&#039;t want to buff him, but please, this is just ridiculous that I can&#039;t even play a champ in lane because his sustain is so horribly bad. Just revert the nerf on his Q&#039;s sustain, and he&#039;d be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"commit an hero","date":"2015-11-14T20:06:41.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something that seems like jumping the gun and not waiting until the preseason.

I used to play him with Dorans Blade start, and farmed with a mix of autos and some Q's. I only took flask vs very hard lanes. You will run out of mana fast if you only farm with Q. Use your auto attacks and budget your mana wisely.\n\nOnce you get Triforce and a few AD items (BF sword/Pickaxe/Longswords) you can place a barrel and one shot entire creep waves with 1 Parrrley. This should help you catch up in Silver Serpants. \n\nI've seen GP's build  Tear, but I think that's bad. You should be rushing your Trinity Force, IE, Ghostblade power spikes as fast as you possibly can. Tear delays his first powerspike by 720 gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-11-15T00:16:44.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh what a pity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lovelle","date":"2015-11-15T00:06:56.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot seems to have forgotten why they gave GP that mana refund in the first place.
