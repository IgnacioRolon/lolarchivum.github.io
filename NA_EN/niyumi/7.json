There is essentially nothing almost any champion can do to beat Pantheon in lane. He is, by far, the biggest lane bully in the game. Your only job is to try to survive lane without feeding him, because Pantheon is one of the most useless sacks of shit past laning phase there is. Take TP, build armour, take very little CS to keep him from comboing you, try to counter his roams if you can with your TP (a real thug Pantheon will take ignite), and just farm when he's not around. \n\nFor champion picks, there are:\n\n{{champion:54}} : Play safe with this dude, farm up, and no joke, you can duel Pantheon. With a sunfire cape alone, as long as Pantheon isn't snowballing, you can start dunking on him. You outscale him in team fights as well.\n{{champion:43}} : I don't know if top lane tank Karma still works, but this chick is incredibly safe, has great harass, and can actually wittle Pantheon down in lane and beat him.\n{{champion:57}} : Same as Malphite, with the bonus of a lot of his tankiness being immune to armour penetration.\n\nThose are three off the top of my head, but honestly, if you don't let him snowball most champions can beat Pantheon.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-02-18T03:36:39.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick, say something rude!

Give up farm.  Play safe. Build tank. Respect his early damage.  He will out-damage nearly everyone and everything early and his kit is impossible to mess up.  It's almost all targeted.  Just accept that he wins lane by existing and do all you can to farm up under tower, avoid being tower-dove and getting shit stomped.\n \nStep 2: Wait a while.  Pantheon becomes less and less useful as the game goes on.  If he doesn't get a huge lead and start snowballing, he will struggle to matter.  He will likely try to roam with his ult if you give him nothing in lane.  The moment he leaves, hard shove and take tower... then group with your team.  \n\nStep 3: The longer the game goes, the more Pantheon sucks.  Seriously.  I have lost games where I am 16/5 as Pantheon because the game went too long and I fell off hard.  Stop him from snowballing early, and then try to stall the game out if his team is ahead come mid game.  Unless your whole team is awful come late-game... play for late game.  He'll run outta gas eventually, and the less of an early lead he gets the sooner it'll be before he's not as much of a factor on the game as he should be.\n\nOr if all that seems hard... just pick Darius and shit on him in lane.
