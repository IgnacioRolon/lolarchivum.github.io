FOUR VERSUS FUCKING FIVE, yet the braindead clicker can still win the game for the enemy team. Yep. That&#039;s fair! Doesn&#039;t matter that I&#039;m FULL AP EKKO and land my ult and whole combo on her, she lives (that's uh, more than 3,000 damage), lifesteals more than fucking full build Vlad, and carries the game. Doesn't matter that our whole team dives her -- she lives anyway, one shots everyone, and carries the game.\n\nZero skill, zero thought, zero aiming, nothing. Just right click, and win! But, you know, that&#039;s &quot;fair and balanced.&quot; Least effort, greatest reward!\n\nWhy are greedy companies like Riot allowed to exist? Why the fuck did brats enable shitty F2P cash grabs?

Dont feed them.\nIt sounds like you missed most of your abilities and/or ulted a banshee's veil. You screwed up, dont rage about it on the forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-08-28T20:07:17.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, remind me: What skill is involved in right clicking? Ekko is entirely skillshots, and if you build him AP (as he's supposed to be), he's just as squishy as any ADC -- even more so since he doesn't have the ever so balanced lifesteal.\n\nBut, this isn't just her getting fed. She was 0/0/2 bot lane, I roam down there since my mid laner wasn't in the game, and she kills all of us.\n\nAnd, no, go look at her build. She had no Banshee's. I ulted her several times, brought her to <100 health, but she lifesteals for more than I can burst her, and I end up dying. There was no screwup, it's just ADCs being absurdly broken.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-28T20:49:32.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You apparently play ADCs, so you must know how complex and intensive anim canceling, stutterstep, kiting, proper positioning and trading in lane are..\nBut from my experiences playing support, most silver ADCs have no idea what any of that means, and just rightclick and AFK.\n\nI am fairly sure that ekko cannot do 3000 damage from his abilities at any point in a game, especially in the laning phase.\n\nI think you are just mad.

Your skillshot is fat as hell and it slows, you have an aoe stun, you're tanky as fuck, and you do insane damage. All you got to do is land all your crowd control and whack. Obviously ADC's are strong but that's the point. Not all champions are created equal, and the success of an ADC heavily depends on their ability to outplay mechanically and the ability of the team to open up opportunities for the ADC.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"adidas","date":"2016-08-28T19:21:35.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:2}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:91}} \n\nheard you had an adc problem","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-08-28T21:14:49.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I truly like that double Rengar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Veigarisgod1","date":"2016-08-28T19:55:37.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
