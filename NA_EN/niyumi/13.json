{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-01-25T19:42:37.695+0000","title":"So, just read an article Riot put out.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Edit: [Here's a link to it](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/01/dev-on-leagues-business-model/)\n\nThis quote here was a little funny.\n\n**\"Value #1: We care about making a great game, above all else.**\n\n**There are a lot of things that go into this, like our design values for League of Legends, our commitment to raising the bar on skins, champions, and champion updates, or the new features we regularly add for all players, regardless of spend. Mastery, competition, and expression are core values to us, and we take your trust (and satisfaction) in these areas very seriously. Revenue is one of the things we care about, but itâ€™s not the only thing or the most important. Making money enables us to build servers, pay salaries, grow esports, improve League, develop new titles, and more, but making a great game is our primary win condition.\"**\n\nIf making a great game was your first and foremost goal... then you're either incompetent, or just straight up lying. \n\nSure, League is polished and not really bad quality, but there's a lot more to it than that. When the pro players you make money off of complain about lack of balance; when LC$ is the focal point of most of the changes you make (or don't make); when you break champions who have a skin coming (or ignore them when they already need nerfs), or ignore popular, lucrative ones who need to be toned down; when an amateur team could do the same work you do in a fraction of the time; when you say a bug (like Jayce's hammer freezing) is irrelevant and not worth fixing; when you don't fix bugs unless attention is called to them... and so many other things... I just can't believe you when you say your first goal is a quality game.\n\nJust the fact that you're F2P shows you don't really care about quality that much.\n\nIf you want people to believe you when you say something like that, you gotta actually show it. Just saying you care doesn't mean you do. Individual developers care, I remember one taking things home and updating them on his own time -- but individual developers aren't allowed to do anything more than what the suits allow them to do.\n\nI wonder if Beck and Merril still care. They certainly did at the beginning of it all, but somewhere along the road that disappeared. \n\nAnyway, point is: You gotta show that you care if you want people to believe you.\n\nOh, and by the way, you're a multi BILLION dollar company ($1.6B last financial report). A good way to make people think you care is to put some of that back into the game, instead of running a skeleton crew on anything but the skins team.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-01-25T20:08:46.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thx for the link, good article.
