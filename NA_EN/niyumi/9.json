Hence why they are usually extremely squishy.\n\n> That&amp;#039;s when Xin / Yi / Kha / etc click on you and just erase you.\n> \n\nHard CC, dodging, kiting, etc all work wonderfully against them. Or don't get caught out of position.\n\n> That&amp;#039;s when you have 500 armor, but any AD champ can just act as if you have 80, and melt you.\n> \n\nI won't argue some _items_ are too strong right now (lookin at you, bork/dd); but again, marksmen _are made to melt targets late game_. Yes, including tanks. Especially if they have armor pen items and lots of crit. That's why you buy Randuins, HP, and armor and thornmail. I will admit tanks still need some more upgrades to their itemization though.\n\n> That&amp;#039;s when the strongest champs are the easiest.\n> \n\nIf by easy you mean \"point and click boom\", not really. Most take some level of practice to gain any measurable skill with them. Yasuo for example has a high skill ceiling. So did camille. So does lee, etc. I'd say Fiora is probably the strongest champion right now that takes the least amount of practice to become decent enough with to wreck people, though.\n\n> That&amp;#039;s when it&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; for mages to heal up if they get caught out of position, but totally healthy for ADCs to do the same but 15x more effectively.\n> \n\nHave you tried to catch a Swain or Morde or Syndra or Ahri or Akali or Kat or LB \"out of position\"....? Heh....heheh....heheheheh.... Mages are designed to be either high DoT control mages (like Swain) who have a lot of area of effect crowd control and management (like Ori); or they are burst mages meant to deal a lot of burst damage in a short timespan (like pretty much everyone else).\n\n> That&amp;#039;s when so many champs like Veigar, Syndra, Annie, etc. can just click on you and instantly win with no counterplay or anything.\n> \n\nSee above. Counterplay includes: dodging (syndra,annie); HP/MR items (Maw, etc); untargetability (fizz, zhonyas, xayah); {{item:3026}}  or {{item:3102}} \n\n> That&amp;#039;s when you buff absurdly broken champs just because they have an ultimate skin.\n> \n\nMmmm ultimate skins are: Lux, Sona, Udyr, and Ezreal.\n\nNone of those have been \"buffed\", unless you count Udyr receiving like 10 less mana cost per ability, and Lux having lower cooldown on her ult.\n\n> ... yeah. Fair is the word I&amp;#039;d use to describe this game.\n\nIt's definitely not 100% _balanced_, but it's a sight better than some other games, and a lot better than earlier versions of League.","replies":[]}]}
