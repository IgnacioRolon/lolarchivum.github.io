This game is about as half-assed as they come, but it's sitting on a good foundation since Riot wasn't shitty at first. Same thing that's happening with WoW.\n\n> Most companies would never bother with full visual/audio reworks, not to mention comparing asset quality.\n\nSo, Riot makes their money off of RP sales (and LC$). If you rework a champion and hype up their new kit and visuals, people will be excited about it and buy the champ and skins so they can play the new thing. If they didn't make money off of champs, then they would just abandon the old, out-dated ones.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ender Cobra","date":"2017-01-10T01:14:27.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfYJsQAhl0","replies":[]}]}
