They ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING, and put all they had into what they did.

We knew it was a big cash grab, and everyone knew to avoid F2P games like the plague. Then comes the gimme generation, and they throw all kinds of money at shitty companies, enabling them to get to where they are now.\n\nBut, I will still say that P2P and B2P were better, and that F2P companies should just stop existing or actually put in effort (which none of them will).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Arcade Andrew","date":"2017-02-17T00:39:15.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk man, every time ive ever played teemo top against a jayce ive gotten murdered.\n\nchamp picks often make or break the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-17T01:08:36.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could just be a defeatist that makes no real effort as soon as you see a \"counter\".\nA good player can beat their counters, or at least survive.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-02-17T01:23:13.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"No such thing as counters.

Both are juggernauts, both thrive in close combat, yet Darius has far more damage (excluding the villain for Garen), sustain, brings slows and pulls to a teamfight, and has a massive true damage nuke / dash that has no CD if used properly. Darius can kill an entire team with little effort, while Garen can maybe kill one person if they get low around him, and then do nothing.\n\nNow, if you want an actual skill matchup where the champ doesn't actually dictate who wins: \n\nLulu vs. Ahri\n\nZed vs. Liss\n\nSinged vs. Anyone\n\nAzir vs. Ori\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe issue with League is that each niche should be filled with a lot of champions that all compete and do well, but the reality is that each niche has one or two champs that destroy everything else and can't be stopped.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-17T02:55:35.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if bad troll or just bad...\n\n\"No such thing as counters\" Ok, maybe this is true in bronze V where people build liandry's on lux.\n\nLissanda is a hard counter to Zed and should wreck him unless the player is garbage.\nSinged has definite lane counters and typically looses horribly to any sustained ranged damage.

A Black Cleaver rush means that Malphite's armour will be about half as effective early into the game. Garen is a useless piece of shit past laning phase so this doesn't really matter though.\n\n> ji versus grag: yi would win early but get shut down once leo and mal build armor, and maybe even grag to\n\nYi is fucking dog shit early, Gragas easily beats him at that stage.
