I camped the EVERLIVING FUCK out of every lane, did everything I could to try and get my laners back into the game, tried bossing them around to get them to play intelligently... nothing. They just did not understand how in the world the game works or how to not get stunned by Veigar and ulted by MF, or how to let the, you know, tank, be the frontline.\n\nBut, you know, that was obviously my fault. Yeah.\n\nSo can we stop pretending the matching system is any good? Don't match people by their fucking cosmetic rank, use that MMR system you have. I don't care if I play with diamonds or bronzelords, as long as they play competently and don't go and feed their asses off and make me lose despite doing fine or even great myself.\n\nOh and before you say to let my laners get the kills... I tried to. I only took kills if I was alone, or if my teammate died (or to prevent them from dying).","replies":[{"poster":"jwebb0113","date":"2017-08-29T23:03:15.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"your teams mmr by player\ntop 1477 silver 1 \njng 1474 silver 1\nmid 1477 silver 1\nsup 1477 silver 1\nadc 1475 silver 1\n\nenemy team mmr by player \ntop 1512 gold 5\njng 1512 gold 5\nmid 1512 gold 5\nsup 1517 gold 5\nadc 1464 silver 1\n\nteam comps\nyours \n{{champion:85}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:498}} \n{{champion:3}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:21}} \n\nthey have 4 ap damage champs your only ap item in game is {{item:3111}} \nkennen had {{item:3091}} {{item:3111}} {{item:1033}} \ncass no mr items \nxayah no mr items \nsona has {{item:1033}} \n\nso not only did your team nearly get countered picked in all lanes... no one on your team built items to handle the massive amount of AP damage from the enemy\n\nyou got matched with people of similar mmr of your and yes the other team does have a slightly higher mmr but the other team picked better and your team had no clue how to build or play against them \n\nyes your kda is good but vs a heavy ap comp like that you have zero mr items\n\nso blame riot and the match making and everything you want but lets look at the game for what it was... your team flat out beaten and out played","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-08-29T23:21:23.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have upgraded Aybssal if you'd open your eyes, which gives 90 MR.

He would regularly complain on the boards and blogs and whatnot like I do -- he tried to get other people to come around and realize that things weren't so great. So, he eventually went and founded a company to make a game, with the driving goal being that he wanted to make a game for gamers, by gamers. \n\nToo bad that idea died off a while ago.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
