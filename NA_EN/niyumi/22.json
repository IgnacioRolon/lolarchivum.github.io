And that was all that was played, with some slight deviations here and there. But these 3 were the majority. If you wish, go back in time (search the internet) and find what was in the meta just a season ago, retrospectively. Then go back some more. You'd find champions with varying skill levels and mechanics.

I can see why this would discourage players from being these champs, but even highly reliant skillshot champs like ezreal are seen a ton for me.\n\nThey aren't contributing to the death of gaming, either. \nThe game has millions of players, and if everyone thought about it the way you did, I don't think all those people would play it?\nPeople are never going to stop playing games, thats a fact, but have your own opinions.\n\nSure though, easier champs are stronger, but thats literally because they're easier. All champs are pretty balanced, and are capable of a lot of stuff, but the easier champs seem stronger because its easier to output that capability effectively..","replies":[]}]}
