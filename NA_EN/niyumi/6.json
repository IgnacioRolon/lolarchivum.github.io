I had a 13 game losing streak in Plat.  \n\nOddly enough not to play the blame card, but my first 3 games consisted of someone going like 0-16 or first timing a champ, \n\nThe next 3-4 games had someone afk at 3-4 minutes \n\nAnd the last 3 were complete throws. I was actually shocked at how bullshit my losses were.\n\nI dont care if i lose, but i hate losing because someone is 0-15, or first timing a champ, or an AFK you know?\n\nSometimes you get those games but yeah what nep2une said.
