In the pregame lobby, the members of the premade team thought it would be funny to ban the mid champion I had pre-selected to play. After banning her,  I didn't feel comfortable mid laning another champion - especially against a Kat, so I said I'd need to go support instead.\nI went bottom lane with Ezreal, when the game launched, you'll see fiddlesticks went straight to mid lane, and I went to bot lane.\nEzreal ( who was a part of their premade trio ) began to start trolling me by intentionally missing cs and getting poked down repeatedly by the opposing bot lane, and spamming emotes/laughing. I began csing to salvage what was left of our bot lane, and focused on hard farming while he roamed around ganking with his premade friends.\n\nSo I guess there you have it folks. I got my answer. I wasn't banned for feeding, I was apparently banned for taking another player's role.\nThe lesson I've learned? To never speak in this game ever again. It absolutely boils my blood that a group of snickering teenagers got the best of me. They were awful to me in pre-game lobby, banned the champion I had pre-selected, and silently trolled through-ought our game. Then, I would imagine, all 3 of them, must have submitted tickets complaining that I stole a champion from them. The crazy part is, if you watch the game -- I never trolled, I genuinely tried the entire game. Someone give these kids a medal of honor for their work they did on me.\n\n\n\n**Here is the official response I received from RIOT's own MIDNIGHTBLU for anyone curious:**\n\nHi there, Lizzie Borden!\n\nMidnightblu here to help clear this up for you. While I can agree you did not intentionally feed here, what you did do is equally unacceptable. Unfortunately, our system has limited reasons that we can choose for why you were being penalized, and \"intentional feeding\" is the most closely related to what you did here.\n\nWe reviewed the match here and found that you were upset that Neeko was banned, so you intentionally placed yourself in another player's assigned role and trolled the rest of your team for this match. Intentionally trying to ruin the game for others is never okay, even if your preferred champion is banned. Hovering a champ doesn't guarantee that you'll get them, so I'm afraid that if your team is still wary of the other team picking that champion first it's acceptable to do. You received a 2 week suspension here because this isn't a chat based penalty, so the lowest penalty you could receive here is a suspension.\n\nPlease do keep in mind that since this is a 2 week suspension, the next penalty for behavior like this would result in a permanent ban. Getting back at someone else for unintentionally offending you isn't ever going to be a justification for this kind of behavior, so in the future it's always going to be better to simply play out the match as best you can. I know that a lot of people want to play Neeko right now since she's brand new, but she's not going anywhere and you'll always be able to play her again in future matches.\n\nSorry that I don't have better news here for you, but if you have any other questions please let me know.\n\nMidnightblu\nPlayer Support\n\"I fight for a brighter tomorrow!\"\n\n\n\n\n**In which this was my response:**\n\nSo let me get this straight. \nYou're giving me a two week suspension because I went support when another play got the support role? \nThis happens about 500,000 times a single day of League of Legends games.\n\nBut okay, I'll bite. Let's say that's why I was suspended, you're telling me that my pre-made team banning the champion I had pre-selected, to be cruel, had no punishable offense, but me going support because the only mid champion I felt comfortable enough to play mid, was banned by my own team-mate?\n\nSomething isn't adding up here. I don't want to sound like a tinfoil hat wearing looney, but I'm beginning to suspect foul play here. I sincerely hope not, but it's mighty interesting that shorty after this game, I was suspended. That kind of investigation that occurred last night takes a live employee to personally review the chat logs and the entire gameplay. And this was done within several hours last night.\n\nAt this point, I'm pretty convinced that I was either paired with a RIOT employee & his friends, or the pre-made group I was paired with that CUSSED at me in the pregame lobby, AND banned the champion I had pre-selected, have a relative and/or close friend that works for RIOT. And in that instance, I believe I was penalized with a biased viewpoint. I have read the RIOT TOS up and down, and there is no clause protecting RIOT employee's from biased penalizing/revoking.\n\nNow I feel obligated to reach out to another RIOT employee/Escalate this further, because I'm honestly stunned that I would receive not only a two week ban for this, but that my own team-mates that name called and cussed at me in the pregame lobby, and banned my champion, were not punished, but rewarded for their behavior.\n\nIf a live Riot game-master did in-fact review this case last night ( which I find astounding, considering it was around midnight eastern time ) the only instance they have to go of off, is seeing me get upset that Neeko was banned. You do not see me cuss, you do not see me name call, you do not see me say or admit any intention of intentional feeding. The unbiased RIOT employee would have also seen the 3 members of the pre-made team that were verbally harassing me, and banned the champion I had pre-selected, and probably thought otherwise about instilling such a harsh punishment on me.\n\nWhat baffles me even more, is that I do not have a history of this. If a RIOT employee took the time to sifter through my match history, they would have seen that I get an honor almost every game, I'm usually the top performer, in regards to damage, kda and vision score/utility.\n\nTo be quite honest, even in that one game that was reviewed, I did not perform poorly, I never once ran down the lane and offered a free kill, I had a high vision score, and was actively participating in the game.\n\nSo I'm going to ask this now. Based off of all of the information I've personally listed, and reviewed, you're telling me that I was suspended because I took another players role that cussed at me and banned my champion? That was the sole reason I received a two week suspension?\n\nI'd appreciate a response -- I'm actually so flaber-ghasted by the response I received from you on this matter, that I feel like there's some serious foul play going on, and I'm compelled to escalate this, as well as share on my social media platforms and gaming network I follow.","replies":[{"poster":"No Smile","date":"2018-12-08T06:24:51.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should post the update in your main thread.\n\nThat fiddlesticks bought Spellthiefs, which he wouldn't have bought if he had agreed to give you the support role. \n\nYou stole the role and that's not okay, even if people are jerks and ban your hover.

The vast majority of suspensions, both for chat and gameplay related offenses, are not reviewed by an actual Riot employee or contractor. It's an automated system, with an algorithm that attempts to detect behavior in violation of the Summoner's Code and apply punishments based on detected behavior. Occasionally, a suspension will be manually placed, but it does not appear that was the case here. It's generally Riot's policy that the algorithm is correct by definition, but keep trying. They will, on rare occasions, revert bans. I will say, though, that this seems consistent with another player who was banned for a similar reason and made a thread recently on this board. I'd say it's unlikely, at best, that they revert the ban.","replies":[{"poster":"UpDownLeftRightAB","date":"2018-12-10T02:08:49.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> My question is: does this put us at risk of a ban if one of the players on our team not queued with us reports us?\n\nCan you post the reply here, this is a question I had after reading that response too.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2018-12-10T02:20:38.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, right, forgot to do that\n\n>VREIVAI\n>December 7th 2018, 8:24:25 pm\n>So I've been seeing players recently who are banned for taking other players roles (i.e. taking an excessive amount of CS in the support role, or other atypical play for their assigned role).\n\n>When I queue with my friends, occasionally we will swap our assigned roles (i.e. they're assigned support and I'm assigned mid, and I'll play support and they'll play mid).
