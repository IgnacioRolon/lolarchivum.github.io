The music was great the textures was great everything was great. Now it seems that layers are missing and It really is a letdown. Kinetic sona was my favorite and yet I cant hear all of the music it has to offer now. Is this an ongoing issue for anyone else? Is this even an issue? Appreciate any  feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-03-03T00:46:14.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each level of her ult adds more of the music back the first time you use it.  So fire off that Crescendo after ranking it up at 6, 11, and 16.  It's a simulation of a DJ dropping the beat with a dramatic movement.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-03T02:16:29.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup! This is correct. The music builds up as the game progresses.","replies":[{"poster":"XxZulfxX","date":"2015-03-03T19:53:57.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play another game and still same problem. Are the songs supposed to restart? I am hearing the same quiet loop of music over and over again towards the end of the game. Is this how it was intended or shouldnt the song be restarted?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-03T20:30:23.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tracks will loop, yes.","replies":[{"poster":"XxZulfxX","date":"2015-03-04T03:47:21.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I hear is the same quiet beat over and over, is this something to do with my game then?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"XxZulfxX","date":"2015-03-03T19:11:54.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do hear the music building at first, it seems as though all that build has gone done at the end. Like all the layers have disappeared again. I will try out another game and see what happens.

I do know her songs start off pretty quiet till she uses a couple skills, then it gets somewhat louder when she gets her ult at level 6 (or 7, if you misclicked).","replies":[]}]}
