{"poster":"A Small Man","date":"2015-10-27T00:19:20.621+0000","title":"Boards Org Update + New Sub-Boards","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Earlier this year we [kicked off a discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Ep4t0zPw-lets-talk-about-the-boards) with you all around the continued evolution of the NA boards, covering a whole bunch of sub-topics regarding what the Boards are and where they’re going. In addition to some conversations and updates around things like [moderation](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/gQYTAEMl-letos-talk-about-boards-moderation), we had multiple chats with you around sub-board / sidebar organization - [part one](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Hx8p6GoX-letos-talk-boards-organization) &amp; [part two](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/bWE8wUIE-lets-talk-boards-org-part-two).\r\n\r\nTL;DR - We laid out various long-brewing concerns, mostly regarding excessive sub-board fragmentation and massive traffic imbalances between a few heavyweight sub-boards and the rest of the pack. This causes a ton of interesting conversations to be all but invisible to the vast majority, and is one of the main issues causing the Boards front page to sometimes appear stagnant. At the same time, we recognize the value even the smallest board communities can bring to the community-at-large, so we want a solution that gives those topics clear new homes while increasing visibility and evening out sub-board disparity. We proposed new organization centered around a smaller number of use-case focussed sub-boards (e.g., NA LFG and Riot Plz!), where what you were trying to do would matter more than specific topical accuracy when choosing a sub-board.\r\n\r\nMany were receptive to some of the proposed changes, while others expressed concerns around potential loss of identity in cases like Story &amp; Art and General Discussion. We do feel these concerns are both solvable and necessary in the name of fixing the Boards’ long-term organizational foundation, however, you raised valid points about needing better discovery options for finding specific content. In response to your feedback, we decided to temporarily hold off any significant changes to sub-board organization while investigating tech options (e.g., tagging / filtering). Since then, we’ve continued our behind-the-scenes work while focusing on other Boards improvements (e.g., more visible moderation, some early mobile stuff), though there’s still tons of work we’d like to do. \r\n\r\nRecently, two cool new opportunities popped up that we’d like to roll out to you as soon as possible. The first is a new **Player Behavior &amp; Moderation** sub-board, meant to provide players a dedicated place for discussing behavior measures (both in-game and on the Boards) as well as more easily getting in-touch with Rioters to have conversations about disciplinary actions. \r\n\r\nThe second is a little more novel - the Gameplay team would like to pilot a space (tentatively termed the **Dev Corner**) in which Rioters can kick off set-piece discussions with players around topics past and present. Posting new threads would be limited to Rioters, so the place is going to be specifically built around designers proactively reaching out to talk about projects they’re taking on, state of the game updates, retrospective dev blogs, or even regular ‘office hours’ to shoot the shit.\r\n\r\nOf course, adding these two Boards only adds to our sub-board overload issue. With that in mind, we’re bundling these additions with some of the **more minor** Boards org consolidation and sidebar improvements we’ve previously proposed. To be clear, **we’re not touching any of the main sub-boards or General Discussion at this time** (just a couple minor title edits for clarity), and are entirely focused on redistributing conversations and content from some of the most egregiously underused sub-boards. The full changelist:\r\n\r\n**Removals**\r\n\r\n* Tips &amp; Tricks (now part of Gameplay)\r\n* Maps &amp; Modes (now part of Gameplay)\r\n* Sound &amp; Music (now part of Story, Art, &amp; Sound)\r\n* Community Creations (now part of Concepts &amp; Creations)\r\n* League Videos (split between various sub-boards)\r\n* Fantasy LCS (removed from sidebar, still active / reachable through Fantasy LCS site)\r\n* Announcements (simply duplicates news content &amp; comments so cleaning up the redundancy)\r\n\r\n**Title Changes (for clarity / inclusiveness given removals)**\r\n\r\n* Gameplay &amp; Balance > Gameplay\r\n* Story &amp; Art > Story, Art, &amp; Sound\r\n* Skins &amp; Champion Concepts > Concepts &amp; Creations\r\n\r\nThe sidebar will be updated to reflect these changes and group sub-boards a little more clearly into conversation spaces, “red-zones,” and utility spaces. Finally, we’ll be posting **updated Universal Rules** (mostly aimed at greater clarity, no significant rule changes) and moving them to the sidebar to free up some sticky space. Once we roll out the update, you can expect the sidebar to look something like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4ALn2IG.png\r\n\r\n*(Clarity on the rules DO YOU GET IT!?!?)*\r\n\r\nA note on execution - the removed boards will still exist for the foreseeable future, they’ll just be locked to posting and removed from the sideboard. This should give players the ability to copy any in-progress conversations located on inactive sub-boards over to new locations where desired.\r\n\r\nWe’re currently targeting these updates for **11 AM PST, Wednesday Oct. 28.** Several members of the Boards team are around to chat about these updates, so feel free to share any thoughts or questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2015-10-27T00:23:39.527+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"someone get me some water cause I'm FIRSTy\n\n....sorry","replies":[{"poster":"A Small Man","date":"2015-10-27T00:26:00.970+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://33.media.tumblr.com/e82727add7a325b57851d95e97fc5c84/tumblr_inline_nump6jRGQs1tr87fa_500.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegacyofTable","date":"2015-10-27T01:53:21.382+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Player Behavior and Moderation?

And yes, you are 100% correct that anyone not active in the concepts board would probably not realize that, nor do I expect them to. It's just the nature of the posts and a relatively unique problem here as well.\n\nAs far as this change goes it's neither here nor there, it doesn't make the problem worse in any way and actually may improve them slightly as it's implying more of a \"creation\" than just rattling off an idea.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"freeformline","date":"2015-10-27T00:33:13.550+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the idea of the Dev Corner!

Then won't merging the smaller sub-boards into larger ones drown out less popular discussions? You acknowledged \"needing better discovery options for finding specific content\" before combining sub-boards, yet seem to have immediately disregarded that. Combining less-trafficked boards together is certainly understandable, but without filtering tools, it just becomes that much harder to get niche discussions started.\n\nAs a specific example, I frequent Maps & Modes because I'm mainly interested in discussions about non-SR maps. The vast majority of the Gameplay sub-board, however, deals with SR gameplay. It doesn't seem feasible to manually comb through a deluge of topics about SR in search of that one discussion about TT/Dom/ARAM. Could you suggest a solution here?
