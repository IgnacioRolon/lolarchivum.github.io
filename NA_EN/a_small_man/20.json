[COMPLETE]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/ST2zjFW.jpg\n\n_Welcome to the latest installment of Between Two Turrets, a new Q&amp;A series from the NA Community team in which we'll connect you with various Rioters to chat about League, life, and anything in between. You can expect an installment every couple weeks or so, with Rioters from all over jumping in to spend some time with you on the boards._\n\n_This week, we've got game designer **Morello**!_\n\n----\n\n**EDIT - Heading back to work for now guys, thanks for hanging out! I'll try to check back over the next couple days in case anyone has more questions. Good chatting with you all!**\n\nHey everyone!\n\nMy name's Ryan Scott, and I work as part of the design team at Riot. Previously, I served as League's Lead Champion Designer for a couple years, then as a member of the design leadership team more broadly. These days, I'm working on an R&amp;D project, which is part of why I've not been able to answer LoL questions as much or engage in the topical issues. Still, I wanted to use this chance to get back out talking with folks and come up for air a bit (I missed you guys &lt;3). \n\nI know there will be a lot of questions about what exactly \"R&amp;D\" means at Riot. While you're of course free to ask anything, I've obviously gotta be a bit stingy with the details. I can potentially field very broad philosophy or \"why\" questions, but \"what\" and \"how\" (and especially \"when!\") are things I won't really be able to address. \n\nAs for non-Riot stuff, I play a ton of games in a lot of genres - video and physical. I've been spending a lot of time lately in CS:GO Ranked (SO close to AK!), a bunch of board games with the likes of Meddler, FeralPony, Reinboom, VitzKreig and Ezreal, and catching up on some Rogue-likes and other random smaller titles during the summer release lull. I have two Corgis, Professor Phineas T. Wigglebutts, and Ruby Evangelyne McNubbins. I'll try to get some pics in because Corgis > Morello. I'm also into UFC, go to Disneyland with my wife far too often, and like to drown myself in Mexican food and waterparks. \n\nI do like the \"anything\" in the ask me anything theory, so feel free to ask personal or non-LoL-related stuff if interested. I'm pretty forthcoming and don't mind sharing things about my personal or professional life, or just discuss the nerf patches with old NMST :)\n\nIt's been awhile, community. I'm excited to chat for a bit - let's have at it!","replies":[{"poster":"Billlbert","date":"2015-07-29T20:27:03.363+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"in soviet runeterra, {{champion:39}}  nerfs {{item:3165}}","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2015-07-29T20:30:22.604+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Billlbert,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ac8IwuH1,comment-id=003a,timestamp=2015-07-29T20:27:03.363+0000)\n>\n> in soviet runeterra, {{champion:39}}  nerfs {{item:3165}}\n\nCommunist!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-07-29T20:24:12.844+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Rioter who posts on the boards frequently, what are your thoughts on Rioter interaction with the community feedback and/or in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2015-07-29T20:36:04.800+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sixdogman,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ac8IwuH1,comment-id=0035,timestamp=2015-07-29T20:24:12.844+0000)\n>\n> As a Rioter who posts on the boards frequently, what are your thoughts on Rioter interaction with the community feedback and/or in general.\n\nFrankly? **Personally?** I think we're too careful.\n\nThis is all well-intended (wanting to do the right thing in the right way), but in my mind, overthinking it can lead to unintended results.

We're working a lot to bolster League's IP, so there's opportunities there to make that come to life in different ways. Likewise, if that's ALL we did, it might be too limiting for some concepts.

Poppy: Poppy's kit is abusable, has poor gameplay interaction and has low output on anything useful other than \"don't die, kill things.\"\n\n2. Yorick: Similarly, Yorick's impact on a game is damaging in a bad way, and he fails to accurately meet the Necromancer fantasy in a way I think we could bring to life (heh)\n\n3.

To explain:\n\nMaster Yi is god at Bronze. Why? Is it because he's overpowered? It's because the knowledge you need to beat Master Yi is something that is not consistently applied at lower levels of play, so the counter to that is \"play better.\" Players can overcome, improve and conquer a legitimate challenge.\n\nFor the high-end, where players wring every ounce of power out of a champion, is where balance tuning actually effects game outcomes and variety.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rico Jungle Only","date":"2015-07-29T20:03:54.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Morello. My question focuses on two fighter champs that are of hot topics, Panth {{champion:80}} & Aatrox{{champion:266}} .\n\nStarting with Panth:\nHe starts off good in the laning phase, yes, but falls off heavily after if he cannot outburst enemies as he has no mobility moves, or a reliable escape. This is in addition to the changing meta and item changes, all of which do not favor Panth at the moment... \n\nQ: I there any chance Panth's W can become a skill shot so he can jump over walls and have some way of mobility as a currently immobile fighter/assassin?\n\nI've talked to Zenon Stoic about it, and he wishes to at least fix the symmetry of Panth's W stunning interactions on champs. It would also allow Panth, (who builds usually very squishy), some fallback pattern, over being CC'd and instal-dying in the start of a team fight.\n\nQ: Is there a possibility of bringing back a fighter item that has early armor pen, but has fighter capabilities?\n\nOnto Aatrox:\nMaybe its only me, but the only build path he has right now is Bork + Tank to do decently. I remember when he was released you guys called him a Auto reliant melee fighter, but upon his release, he was a EXCELLENT caster. He had more choice in build path over just going pure tank, and if you landed you skills right, he had kill potential and felt really good before the nerf.\n\nQ: Is there any way you could bring more of the \"caster\" (where you can trade well with his abilities) side to Aatrox back?\n\nQ: Will/may the current issues lead to a small rework in the future for him?\n\nQ: Is the \"Drain Tank Fantasy\" still a think you can support, specifically in Aatrox's Case..?\n\n\nThank you for your time. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2015-07-29T20:12:17.028+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't talk in the detail necessary for this these days of what's possible (since I'm not working on LoL these days), but I can answer the more philosophical question of Drain Tank.\n\nI still believe Drain Tank can work, but I think it can't be auto-attack based. AAs are sort of an automatic DPS meter you can fill when in your attack range, and have a lot of their own tuning. \n\nSomeone like Fiddlesticks might be a better model, if you made it so more champs could interact with his W and disrupt it. Then you get some back-and-forth between how he uses the skill, if you can disrupt it and costs/benefits to that. An AA-based drain tank will just stat check you and be a spreadsheet problem - something I think neither myself nor the LoL team is particularly find of since it removes a lot of the interesting decisions around it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toaster36","date":"2015-07-29T20:25:24.948+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are your thoughts on games as tools for interactive story telling, especially on the extreme end of the spectrum?

Imagine if you stole Garen's Spin to Win and we tried to make LeBlanc do that with no animation, or had to make exponential animations to support that. We'd have to stop making all other content. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-07-29T21:18:00.364+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It might be possible using a \"ghost\" model of the champ that has the animation and rigging attached.

I loved those. They were quick to make too, so we could always do them :)\n\nUnsure on Win10","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bro Father","date":"2015-07-29T21:06:14.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking I am too late for this but here's hoping.

The issue is that we took what we were doing away before we had anything new to show, which is something I think we're too quick to do at Riot.\n\nThe new events are awesome though, so that helps a bit :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Awkbak BR","date":"2015-07-29T21:04:24.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the future of Game design and what is Riot Games' role in that?

I think that'll be the next mountain to climb. We're a culture born out of reactive firefighting, and need to learn to burn the candle at both ends.\n\nMyself, I think the biggest milestone I'm personally happy with is 2012's champion roster. While we didn't solve everything, I think we did a lot to make champions feel thematically and gameplay-wise more different when compared to the 2011 roster, where there was a big trend of normalization. I'm also happy from helping grow the team from something small into something bigger, but that's internal to Riot :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-07-29T20:04:31.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
