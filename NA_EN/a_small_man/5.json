So ill tell it anyway ;P\n\nA sound designer's job is to  create a wide enough sonic thematic palette that conveys each of the champion skills in a unique way. This helps with game-play clarity, adds to the uniqueness of the champion, keeps it from becoming repetitive or boring, etc etc.\n\nThat said, rocks are rocks. Rocks sound like other rocks - for the most part. However, such elements like size, density, shape, and other characteristics of rocks can create a different feel when hit or thrown or destroyed or used to suppress giant panicked wildebeests... a story for another time...\n\nBut that wasnt enough for Taliyah - Taliyah had a more refined version of rock. \"Woven\" rock was her deal, and the task at hand was to try and figure out what that really sounded like.\n\nHere is the cool part (commence nerd out):\n\nA few of us took a trip up to UCLA's Anecoic Chamber. If you dont know what an anechoic chamber is, read up on it here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber\n\nIts basically a \"dead\" room - one with \"no\" reflections or reverberations. It's crazy stuff. Stay in there too long and you can hear your blood rushing through your arteries.\n\nWhat better place to record really detailed stuff.\n\nRecording really small sounds and capturing them in a way that sounds big is a challenge. One basic technique is to crank your microphone pre-amp so you can record a really small sound at a really high volume - recording all of the detail at a hotter level - making the sound \"bigger\" initially to work with. However, a lot of crap happens when you do this - when you raise the initial recording level you also raise the noise floor of the room which usually ends up with a nasty hum/hiss/buzz in your recording.\n\nThis is why a dead room _rocks _ for this kind of recording...\n\nSo I packed up a bunch of tile for bathroom walls that I bought at home depot, showed up with these other Riot sound design cats at UCLA, and recorded all of Taliyah's more detailed building blocks inside of an almost completely dead room.\n\nThe recordings turned out awesome - and you can hear some of these sounds sprinkled in and throughout her kit (Q - on her casts of the shards, W - on the directional input sound, E - as the 4 waves fall out into place, R - its somewhere in there buried beneath the madness)\n\nHere are a couple pics from the recording:\n\nhttp://c3sound.com/wp-content/uploads/DevPics/AnechoicChamber_2016/rec2.jpg\n\nhttp://c3sound.com/wp-content/uploads/DevPics/AnechoicChamber_2016/rec1.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"krlpdd35","date":"2016-05-12T19:07:19.313+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is Taliyah's favorite food?","replies":[{"poster":"Thermal Kitten","date":"2016-05-12T19:09:36.003+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being from the desert, I think she would be fascinated by Rocky Road ice cream.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2016-05-12T19:09:01.377+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would say Rock Candy. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"krlpdd35","date":"2016-05-12T19:09:34.912+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VersaceLemonade","date":"2016-05-12T19:13:55.814+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"if taliyah was a high school student what sports/clubs do you think she would be involved in?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stellari","date":"2016-05-12T19:17:12.561+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":0,"body":"Geology club, surfing club - have you seen this fanart by Jason Chan, one of the artists who worked on her promo? :D  http://jasonchan-art.tumblr.com/post/144119206458/some-sketching-between-work-fan-art-of-taliyah-in#_=_","replies":[{"poster":"Wumumu","date":"2016-05-12T22:29:30.594+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Academy Taliyah confirmed?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stellari","date":"2016-05-13T00:52:57.617+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Public School Taliyah to counter the Academy snobs, imo!

And 2: It didn't have a clearly defined leading edge to the projectile, to give clarity for when the missile was about to hit, or where it came from.

It becomes less obvious if you used it well, you feel bad using it in interesting / out of the ordinary situations, and so on.

Due to complications during production, he was delayed in order to make sure he was up to snuff and ended up landing next to Taliyah, who we had specifically intended to be a mage from the get-go (when we planned that, there hadn't been a pure mid mage in a long time).

In his case we had a long-standing promise to you guys to get you this dragon champion and we did not want to delay him any longer. We decided that while both Taliyah and Aurelion go mid lane and build AP, there was enough of a difference that they don't feel like the same type of champion at all. Aurelion is all about his positioning with very infrequent spell casts (and only the Q and the R feel like traditional spells; the E is a movement ability with an ult level CD and the W is a modifier to his positioning game) while Taliyah should feel much more like a traditional mage in terms of slinging spells.\n\nLet me know once she's live if that bears out!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nellyy","date":"2016-05-12T19:42:34.577+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"\nI absolutely adore this character and her design and I just can't wait to play her, but being an artist myself makes me wonder \n\n1.

If you look at Thunderbird, you can see her run pose and her sleeves as well. Tectonic Marvel served as a great example for what we did NOT want to do (big chunky rocks, large cracks in the ground etc) I would say that except for Storm General and Spite Mage, all of these ended up going into Taliyah. \n\nI had a very early paper kit centered around \"Exhausted Ground\". Paper kits look like this:\n\n> Exhaust Ground Kit\n> \n> P: Standing on unexhausted ground while casting a spell empowers that spell, but exhausts the ground for (40s-3m) (scales by game time) \n> \n> Q: Throws a rock in target direction, stopping on first unit hit. If cast on unexhausted terrain, sends another flurry of skillshots in the same direction after a short delay. Each additional hit applies 20% of the damage. \n> \n> W: Rupture-like timing circular AOE. Damages enemies hit. If cast on unexhausted terrain, the ground grabs onto the enemy, rooting them additionally. \n> \n> E: Throws out ribbons of rock in a fan shape in front of Stone Weaver. Enemies hit are damaged and slowed, or if she is standing on unexhausted terrain, become leashed to her. If there are leashed enemies, Stone Weaver can reactivate this ability to either push or pull them (click nearer to yourself / beyond the enemy). Enemies can break the leash by moving away from Stone Weaver. \n> \n> R: Earthquake: Causes tremors in a larger area, temporarily rejuvenating all the ground so that the empowered versions of spells can be cast. For the duration of the earthquake, ground in its area cannot be exhausted. Slows and damages all enemies in the area + cripples them. Crippled enemies cannot use blinks or dashes.\n> \n> When the earthquake ends, all ground in its area becomes exhausted.\n\nAt the same time, our writer wrote a story sketch called \"The Sunrise Stone\" where Taliyah is wading through a river near her tribes camp, picking out interesting rocks from the riverbed, when a bunch of local boys show up and bully her and she is forced to use her rock magic to defend herself. This gave us a pretty good idea of her personality and how her magic would express herself.\n\nWith the three disciplines having a good idea of what they were making we then moved forward into pre-production, where we answered all remaining questions about her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Portaljacker","date":"2016-05-12T20:17:07.370+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"When surfing on her ult, you can click and she'll dismount on the side you clicked on, but I assume if she takes damage she'll fall off as well, like with Aurelion Sol's E?

I wanted to try an ability where she used up nearby walls to empower her spells, but in the interest of getting her into playtesting more quickly, I designed it as \"uses up ground\" first--designing exactly how much of a wall she should rip up, how near she had to be, dealing with places on the map where there are no walls etc seemed like a lot of work. So I didn't expect anyone to like the \"uses up ground\" spell and was super surprised when everyone who played it loved it. There is a lot of surprising nuance to deciding where to use up ground, when to cast the spell from used up ground to safe ground, etc. Looking at the problems that the wall spell posed particularly with mid lane not having a lot of walls, I decided to polish the ground version of the spell and we ended up shipping a really fun game.\n\nAnother really cool spell we tried was \"stitching walls together\". It was a skill shot she could ONLY fire through a wall (like Bard's magical journey) that would create a wall, but the wall only persisted if the missile touched ANOTHER wall.
