I wouldn't normally come here but its getting out of hand. I received and auto loss and got put in low priority queue. I waited the 20 min and it happened again and now I am 40 lp down and would really like some help resolving this issue. \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Trimeras","date":"2016-09-12T01:49:50.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue.  I have always had some connection type issues with this game (which is odd, because it is the ONLY game I have these problems with), but I have never had actual crashing issues.\n\nThe game worked earlier today, however after I updated my Win10 with the latest update, I am now experiencing crashes after champion select, going into the load screen.\n\nI have tried everything listed BugSplat help, including the suggestion above.  I am not really sure what to do here.  \n\nAs an off note as well, I have sent the crash and error reports every time it has happened, and have also sent one to Microsoft to see if it is a problem with my machine, but nothing else is having this issue.\n\nAny help would be great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T21:59:16.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something we've seen a lot lately is if you're on Windows 10 and running League in compatibility mode, it may cause bugsplats. You can check this by right clicking on the League shortcut and hit **properties**. Enter the **Compatibility** tab and ensure that you don't have any compatibility settings checked other than **run as administrator**. \n\nLet me know if you continue to have problems or if you aren't running Windows 10.","replies":[]}]}
