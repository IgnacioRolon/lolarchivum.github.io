It sounds like you may have dodged multiple queues, since it takes 2 or more dodges to get a 10 LP loss and a 30-minute low-priority queue. In this last instance, your disconnection from the matchmaking service (client freeze) counted as a dodge by [the system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging). You likely won't be demoted from another match, but I strongly recommend we resolve your problem causing the crashes before you continue to play ranked.\n\nMost of these disconnections are caused by the client losing its connection to the server entirely. Most of the time, local network settings are to blame for this happening. I strongly recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
