If so I would say that's just considered harassment and spam... and that until you put in a support ticket with a serious concern you probably won't be responded to or taken seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2015-08-17T05:59:35.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is that the problem he is the only one that work whit my request and he close all not only this, and whit this problem where i can report this guy????","replies":[{"poster":"1v1 Me At Turret","date":"2015-08-17T11:22:20.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tadao Yokoshima,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=l9yKg7EY,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-17T05:59:35.373+0000)\n>\n> is that the problem he is the only one that work whit my request and he close all not only this, and whit this problem where i can report this guy????\n\nFrom the sounds of it and what you have stated in this thread, yes. If all you are doing is posting support tickets that are asking for him to be reported then there is no validity to your actual request at hand since you haven't made a support ticket with any sort of merit. You need to actually have a problem in the game itself or concern that isn't just harassing a Riot employee for them to respond to you. I hope this helps you out.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2015-08-18T05:46:11.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not is only this, this is the main for the one that i need help, i need help to report ir, the request he close are from reporting bug to report a very high afk % almost the 50% of the game had afks and no one want to check, report rp steal, report selling elo boost etc.","replies":[{"poster":"1v1 Me At Turret","date":"2015-08-18T09:24:13.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tadao Yokoshima,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=l9yKg7EY,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-18T05:46:11.817+0000)\n>\n> not is only this, this is the main for the one that i need help, i need help to report ir, the request he close are from reporting bug to report a very high afk % almost the 50% of the game had afks and no one want to check, report rp steal, report selling elo boost etc.\n\nAlright so a few things that could help you out:\n\n1) Riot is more than likely not ignoring your concerns, but instead just keeping logs and moving on as it seems since the stuff you are reporting isn't... something they can instantly respond to. They have to investigate and the stuff that they are investigating are private since it effects the offenders, not you.\n\n2) Don't be offended if they don't keep you in the loop. They appreciate you reporting this stuff to them, but as I said before... the end result is private to those who are being reported.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2015-08-19T01:32:03.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry but when that happen the request is open, if they close the request and mark it as solved, they dont going to work in it","replies":[{"poster":"1v1 Me At Turret","date":"2015-08-19T01:42:16.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tadao Yokoshima,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=l9yKg7EY,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-19T01:32:03.872+0000)\n>\n> sorry but when that happen the request is open, if they close the request and mark it as solved, they dont going to work in it\n\nSolved in this case means that at this point... your involvement in their investigation is through and you don't need to be kept in the loop. It doesn't mean they aren't going to investigate those player's behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2015-08-19T02:59:24.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but without send the email that is respond???\n\nthey dont say nothing, he only close it","replies":[{"poster":"1v1 Me At Turret","date":"2015-08-19T03:01:59.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tadao Yokoshima,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=l9yKg7EY,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-19T02:59:24.016+0000)\n>\n> but without send the email that is respond???\n> \n> they dont say nothing, he only close it\n\nJust because they don't respond, doesn't mean they aren't looking into it. Just have a bit of faith as most of the stuff that you are putting through support tickets aren't topics that they normally keep you in the loop about. \n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
