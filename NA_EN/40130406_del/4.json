You're worrying too much about your team and how you have AFK's and justifying your losses as you being last pick when in reality, any loss should always be looked at as your own fault. What could you have done better? And if you're in Bronze, there's a lot that can be improved on, it's not your teammates.\n\n So to answer your question, carry hard, play with that mindset, forget about what happens to your team. The enemy team has just as much a chance of a troll/afk as you do. (technically even higher chance if you count yourself as 100% not going to troll) Try to be optimistic.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2015-08-19T01:25:40.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but thats break the point n1 of the summoner code","replies":[{"poster":"Scarbkage","date":"2015-08-19T18:23:11.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tadao Yokoshima,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=8iRofAPc,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-19T01:25:40.662+0000)\n>\n> but thats break the point n1 of the summoner code\n\nNo... it's really not breaking any of the summoner's code, I think you are misinterpreting it. There's a difference between being a team player (not being toxic, proper use of pings) and caring about everything that happens to your team. You can't control how your teammates play so why worry about them? Just focus on your own play and you will see yourself climb. That is all there is to it.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2015-08-21T05:10:08.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"them if i got a 20/0 i neeed dont care if the other 2 line going 20/0 as well ???? the summoner code say that you need help your team members","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
