It looks like we've already provided context multiple times on the issue you've been creating tickets about.

You're free to reach out to support again, so long as you're inquiring about an issue that hasn't already been resolved and maintain your composure throughout the ticket.\n\nI hope this clears up the confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"40130406_DEL","date":"2017-02-23T03:41:22.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"25437318 Then when yours answered this?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chundawunda","date":"2017-02-20T08:50:08.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Welcome to Riot Games friend!
