But the problem is I use the red tracker to keep apprised of all the recent game developments and tidbits. However for the past few months on any given day your posts make up 99% of all the red tracker posts. And every single post is about technical support (obviously as that's your area of expertise). So much so that you probably make up more than 10 times all the other red posts put together excluding maybe poro. Which kind of drowns out the information I'm actually interested in. Often I will even miss posts because literally every single post on the redtracker is yours.\n\nYes now I realize the irony of what I'm asking but can you help a brother out?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T21:46:42.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know of a way to specifically filter out my posts.
