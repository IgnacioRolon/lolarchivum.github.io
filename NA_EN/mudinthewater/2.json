When Kindred Ults you can force the enemy team out of Kindred&#039;s Ult, or stun and kill them if they stay and you&#039;re Morg.  \n\nADC: \nJinx.  Use her R to execute enemies after Kindred&#039;s ult completes, and delete turrets when the ult is in range of turrets. \n\nMid: Kennen/Morgana/Kat/Annie/Ekko/Orianna.  \nPress R for pentas after the ult completes and everyone is at 10% health. (In Morgana&#039;s case press R 1s into Kindred&#039;s Ult.) \n\n\nTop: Darius.  Had problems getting 5 stacks before? Kited and killed before you could ult? Not Anymore! Get stacks in Kindred&#039;s Ult. Press R after.  \n\n\nKindred is going to make AOE ults so much fun.","replies":[]}
