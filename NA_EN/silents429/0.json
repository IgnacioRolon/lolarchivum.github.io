I figure a jungle that is less dangerous means more champions can actually do it, which is what you want, more diversity. And I know, regardless of what is done we are going to see a group of champions that are more common then the rest, but I have to ask why not nerf the monsters, and buff the lanes a bit?\n\nI am not an expert and don't really stalk your threads and replies to people, but the jungle is the way it is right now to make the jungler not come out of the jungle as a demi god, after all someone who's prime objective is gaining control over the map shouldn't be able to destroy the laners, I am actually fine with the jungle not giving as much as laners. (I still want more gold and XP, nothing crazy but to keep up just a little better)\n\nSo I figure instead of making the jungle increasingly difficult we just give laners a small buff to make them stay ahead still, nothing major of course, but then our precious tank junglers, adc junglers, mage junglers etc, Can actually jungle, farm up, but not go into lane and dominate everything. I am sure this has been thought up already, but all the focus has been soley on the jungle and no changes to the lane, so maybe to fix the problems we just move our focus away from the jungle creeps.\n\nAnd uh. Yeah.\n\n\nEdit- If you look at my match history you will see I played Nautilus, first time in like 2 months or something, I wanted better context and understanding about him and the current jungle, and let me just say this now... He clears it better then before, I still think he needs a wee buff to his level 1 shield, but honestly he clears better then season 4.\n\nI ended up being really coordinated with my ganks, mainly because 3 of us were in a skype call, I was still behind in levels, despite getting plenty of kills and ganks early on, and my gold situation wasn't as much, I mean it was bad, but its not hard to be a CC machine. Just rushed Warmogs and I was set.\n\n\nMainly the point of this is I have a somewhat altered opinion that maybe we just should just go back to buffing the champions who can't jungle well and fix the XP/Gold issue.

Which in turn means that junglers are forced to pick champs that are really strong at something else.  It turns out this something else is ganking.  Hence only champs with amazing gank ability got picked for LCS and balance couldn't easily change that.  In other words, the too easy jungle forced the pros to play only one type of jungle.  The exception to this was nunu, and that was only because he was able to turn himself into a support with a sightstone and not suffer too much and give good objective control.  The other top picks were chose for their ability to gank.  Olaf (recent LCS) and Sej (recent IEM) could never have been picked in the S4 jungle at a competitive level.  Is the new jungle perfect by any stretch of the imagination?  no.  I honestly don't know how to create the jungle they want where multiple types of junglers are viable.

But part of me thinks they might yet find a way to get it up to three types of jungling (which would be amazing).  Either way, the reason they will not go back to the S4 jungle is because that path has been tried and they are not satisfied with failure.

Junglers don't end up overpowered but laners aren't drastically ahead anymore.\n\nSomeone mentioned easier clears meant ganking junglers take over, and the ones who aren't great at ganking become the unviable ones. But with the smite changes, they have the ability to slow and steal movement speed now, as well as i think a weaker version of ignite for one?
