What matters is if you contributed to it, and you certainly did. If someone starts a fight, adding to it with your own negative behavior does absolutely nothing except add fuel to the existing flame, making the situation even worse. When someone is being toxic towards you, the proper response is to mute/ignore them and report them after the game. They may not be punished after that particular game (depending on how frequently they behave like that), but if they do continue that kind of behavior then they will indeed be punished.\n\n> Also by your logic and statment here if someone flames pre lobby I am now entitled to spam /all chat the entire game now? Since you seem to think it was alright, I guess I will have to do this in future games now since riot employees endorse that behavior.\n\nNo, it's not alright to spam in /all chat the entire game, and Riot is not endorsing that behavior at all. If a toxic player is not punished after a particular game, that does not mean that their behavior is acceptable. It generally takes multiple games of reports before a review of the account is triggered, so if these players weren't punished, it likely means that they don't behave like this very frequently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-04T01:38:10.282+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what world is;\n\n>ill be feeding cause the other team will be playing ateam game while you just be a fucktard\n%%%%%%% you are such a nu male %%%got please go die\n\nacceptable behavior in front of strangers?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Burklight","date":"2017-01-04T15:57:24.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Does this mean that defending yourself when you're harassed is allowed now?
