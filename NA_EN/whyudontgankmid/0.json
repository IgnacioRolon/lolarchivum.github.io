Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2umj68/scuttle_crab_is_easily_op/\r\n\r\nWith alot of junglers able to easily solo Drake at five to six level range, control of Dragon area is big enough of an objective on its own. Considering how much damage jungle camps do early on versus harmless crab who gives you area control decent exp, big chunk of gold (full details there: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Rift_Scuttler) and DOESN'T FIGHT BACK, it makes crab a pretty safe time investment, while some champions can also gain life from punching it. Also it's rich get richer: if you are behind and can't contest the crab, you won't be able to cover much deficit by exchanging crab for clear time due to how efficient killing damn crab is, not even looking at speed shrine it leaves to its' slayer. \r\n\r\nI totally think that crab (unless it wears Thornmail or something) should give no gold and no (or less) EXP and it absolutely doesn't need to give 30 extra gold to holder of T2 jungle item.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-03T12:56:16.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It also takes a long time to kill and runs you around in a neutral and likely warded area.","replies":[{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2015-02-03T16:45:10.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BnaPrzbj,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-03T12:56:16.096+0000)\n>\n> It also takes a long time to kill and runs you around in a neutral and likely warded area.\n\nThat depends. Certain champions can kill the crab quickly/easily. Jungle Nidalee being about the most absurd example right now. If you have any good form of non-slow CC the crab dies  rather rapidly.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-04T00:58:42.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, and any damaging champ who gets a small lead can take it out relatively fast(and a Lee, lead or no).","replies":[{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2015-02-04T02:44:47.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BnaPrzbj,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-02-04T00:58:42.349+0000)\n>\n> That's true, and any damaging champ who gets a small lead can take it out relatively fast(and a Lee, lead or no).\n\nIts not just damage, the crab loses 50 Armor/MR if hit by a root or any form of hard CC.  Nidalee's hunt currently roots jungle monsters for a short time, letting her clear it very rapidly.\n\nAny AA-base champ with golem buffs, or someone using purple smite, can clear the crab within a couple of seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-04T23:27:28.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless it's been alive a while and hasn't respawned at the proper current level of hp and such, then it will not go down in 2  seconds to one champ, AA based or not(unless they are fed, or specifically abusive champs).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ComeOnAndSlamJam","date":"2015-02-03T12:34:00.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The scuttle crab is the only thing keeping some junglers, who have a shit time in the jungle, relevant.
