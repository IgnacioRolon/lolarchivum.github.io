By the time we came back the enemy team had already won.\nNo firewalls, no router issues, no internet loss.\n\nThis happened **yesterday **too, which apparently was a** server-wide problem.**\n_But this time we didn't notice anyone else DC'ing._\n\nThis is only a problem we've experienced recently, the worst we experience is sudden spikes of ping whenever we're doing heavy usage. Not this long tho. Never.\n\nHow come this is happening? I understand its only human to err but I ain't gonna play if I'm losing the matches for other people, risking get a leave and overall giving free wins when we're so far ahead like we did in this last match.\n\n**_I appreciate any information regarding the issue :)_**\n\nInfo Edit: The issue was basically a DC'ing issue, and it kept telling me to check my connection.","replies":[{"poster":"moobooh","date":"2017-03-14T21:11:57.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this issue for the last 2 weeks of playing, my network is fine and everything, the only place I disconnect is the game itself so every now and then I miss like 30 seconds to a minute of play, no ping change or anything either","replies":[{"poster":"Akira Desmondes","date":"2017-03-16T03:24:09.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.

We'll just have to be patient in case we give out free wins. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nOh btw, will we get leaves from this kind of things?

However, in cases of widespread issues like something with our servers, [loss prevention](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014-Loss-Prevented) can be enabled.  This is something that is done by our devs- not support, and would only activate for games after being enabled.  \n\nYour best approach would be to bookmark our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page or your ISP's support site and make the best decision for you.  Personally, I wouldn't risk a ranked game knowing that an issue is on-going.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Akira Desmondes","date":"2017-03-16T03:23:19.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. We got that in mind, been playing only ARAMs and honestly, its not even worth it atm. \nGonna wait a few days, see if it gets fixed up because we're salty over here with all the connection issues. Basically every teamfight we lose the connection like 3 seconds. So we just keep losing. A lot. \nAnyways we'll have to play something else for now. Thanks Porocles :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
