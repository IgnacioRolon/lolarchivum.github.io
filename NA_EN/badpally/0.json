Answer: you don't. If you got punished first then it means that you have a more active history of poor behavior than they do. Consistency X Severity.\n\nAlso, all you did was complain about Gangplank all game long and contributed pretty much nothing helpful or constructive to the chat. Your team gets it: gangplank is behaving poorly but so are you. In fact arguably you spent more time complaining about and calling for reports against GP than you did playing the game judging from the time stamps. This is not sportsmanlike conduct. If it was just once or twice then that's one thing, but all game long is too much and just annoying to have to look at.\n\n_________\n\nAt this point it's pretty clear that you're not gonna change your stance regardless of what anyone says, so there's really no point in continuing on with this thread.
