I've tried to fix it by finding online solutions and such, but none of the content I am trying to find is working. I have installed Leauge of Legends maybe 4 times since the first issue, and this happens every time I try to open the client. Once I download the game the client automatically pops up, so I have no trouble using it the first time, but then whenever I exit the client I get the error message stated above. I kind of don't want to keep on downloading the Leauge of Legends game all over again every time I want to play, it takes like 30 or so min, but still. And I have looked for malware or virus and malware, and none of that was detected. So I don't really know what the problem was. \r\n\r\n {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T00:04:42.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be a few files in the client that weren't updating or applied properly.
