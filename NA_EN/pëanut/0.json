When i entered the game, the game supports my 3200x1800 resolution, however the interface is way too small even after i turned everything to 100% in the game. The size of text, apps, and other items in my display setting is 200% which fits perfectly on my screen. I have tried multiple ways on forums but it still doesn't work. Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T23:06:26.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently there is no full support for resolutions over 1920x1080. Some aspects of the game scale properly with high resolutions, but UI is still kinda wonky. Some players can work around this by turning the UI sliders all the way up in the **INTERFACE** section of the in-game settings while playing in Full Screen mode. As a heads up, Alt+Tabbing during a match when in Full Screen may resize your UI and cause it to get really small.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Pëanut","date":"2016-09-10T01:10:23.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any plan for making league more playable for screens over 1920x1080?

I agree that higher resolutions setups are becoming more common, especially after some of the recent graphics cards have released, offering the 4K experience at a very affordable price point.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
