I logged in the game, and i suddenly didnt have any friends(i was supposed to have 46 of them), but i thought that it is just a lag, and that it will work when i restart, so i got in to a game, when i saw that i culdnt connect to chat...... i was typing that im sorry and so on, but i didnt see anything in chat. I called mid not knowing if somebody called it already, thinking that when i enter a game i will be able to explain what happened. It was 3min and i was only getting black screen, so i tryed to restart the game, and now i cant get anything exept black screen and \"connecting to server\", so i repeatedly restarted the game getting the same thing. It doesent let me reconnect for some reason, and my profile is not working, i need help with this, i already have a second profile on lvl4 but i dont whant to play a game 2 times the same way, it is just not fair.\r\n(Sorry for bad english, im from serbia XD)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T23:09:17.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is not able to connect to the game server or download anything,  so all you'll get is a black screen.
