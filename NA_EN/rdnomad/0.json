As for your poor performance, it could be anything this early on. You might not understand how each champion plays compared to others, you might not be getting the right feel for each other lane you try besides top lane, or maybe your playstyle just isn't gelling well with the rolls you're trying. \n\nMy suggestion is to find a good champion that you like/enjoy playing, and find out what roles that champion can play. If there are any other than top lane, I would try it out in those other roles.

After a while, you'll know most of your lane opponents and you can start to look up any champion in the game that you don't know yet. I think it's indeed best to focus on one or a few champions until you've figured out the basics and then try out any free week champion. That's what I did.\n\nAlso, don't play to win your lane, just going even is enough. If your goal is to CS while not dying, you'll end up actually killing your opponent more often because eventually your jungler will gank your lane and you'll be there to share the kill. If you don't know whether you'll win a fight, don't start the fight. Then again, as a new player, you sometimes have to test out your strength. However, if you play a champ for the first time, play safe in the early game and test your lategame strength first.

They also make weird mistakes and try to justify them with whatever. Biggest issue weaker players have, in my mind, is that they know how THEY want to play and how THEY want the match to go, but they don't know how to read intent from the enemy, so they get baited or bamboozled just as much or more than they actually make plays and beat others.

That is a very good indicator that you are bad, but at the same time no one plays 20 games and becomes half-decent. Being bad after 20 games is perfectly reasonable, especially for a game as difficult to pick up as League of Legends. It's important to keep in mind that millions of League of Legends players were once also level 20 players that were really bad at the game, and that you are taking a step that every League of Legends player reaches in their lifetime.\n\nThe best way to improve is to just play tons of games. Who actually cares if you lose? It's just normals. Obviously you should still be trying to win the game, but at the same time there's also a lot of stuff you need to learn, and just playing is a really good way to learn. It's even more useful if you go into a game with a midset of what to work on. If you go into a game with a mindset of \"I'm going to practice last hitting\" or \"I'm going to practice trading with my lane opponent\", then you learn so much out of the game than with a mindset of \"I'm going to practice League of Legends\". Then, when you start getting the hang of doing these actions in a vacuum apart from each other, you can work on integrating them together.\n\nThen there's also a problem where there's no one mindset that will win you the game. If I tell you that you should prioritize towers over Dragons, then you might prioritize the wrong objective in games where you do need to prioritize Dragons. If I tell you that Rift Herald is never worth taking, then you might avoid it when Rift Herald is actually the best objective to take on the map. The point I'm making here is that the mindset that you need to take in a given game changes dramatically depending on the game, and knowing what mindset to have in a particular situation depends heavily on the state of the game.\n\nThe one mindset that is actually stable throughout any game is that objectives are generally worth more than kills. While it isn't worth getting aced just to take a turret, it is worth losing a teamfight 2-3 when you take a turret or a dragon and the enemy team doesn't. It's also significantly better to get damage on a turret from getting your opponent to back when he gets low than to risk trying to get a kill from turret diving a low health enemy, and possibly not getting the kill or trading 1 for 1 in a situation you had in your favor. It's one of the biggest mistakes that many League of Legends players make, and one that every player should learn not to make.\n\nFinally, I recommend learning one champion well, and branching out into other roles and/or champions from there. If you want to learn a new role, see if any of your favorite top laners can play in that role. If you want to try out a new champion, see if you can play them in the top lane before you try them out in their normal roles. This is easily the best way to learn something completely new because you only need to learn 50% of what you'd normally need to learn with a new champion or role. If you play your top laners in the mid lane, all you need to learn is the lane dynamics of mid because you already know the champion. If you want to try out a new top laner, all you need to do is learn a new champion because you'll already know the lane dynamics. However, learning one champion well is important because having that one constant with what you need to learn in any given game makes it significantly easier to learn because you don't need to constantly relearn more than the fundamentals every game.\n\nI do have to apologize for my wall of text, but there's so much to learn about League of Legends that it needs a lot to write about. It's nearly impossible to cover every possible facet of League of Legends in a single guide, and a lot of what goes on in League of Legends needs experience in order to truly grasp. Just keep playing, and eventually you'll improve enough that you won't be bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2016-09-25T12:16:02.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"By asking this question you have already surpassed many experienced players. League is a complex game, and you've only just scratched the surface. If you're able to win your lane 50% of the time you should be damn proud. You'll get better as you play.

There's several key things you need to learn to become a good player.\n\nFirst, you need to understand that CS at most times is better than going crazy for kills. In a 40 min game, your CS should be roughly between 350-400. This amount of minions is equal to prob about 8k Gold, which would buy you 2-3 items. In comparison, if you were going even with a champ, and got 300g per kill, and lets say you killed them 10 times. That seems like a lot, but that only rewards you 3k Gold.\nSo first rule, CS > Kills\n\nSecond rule counters the first rule. This rule is that when it gets late into the game, its better to push as a team and win team fights. This is because by this time in the game, timers are generally 30 secs or more for respawning, allowing ample time to push if you ace them and take objectives. Unlike killing champions or CSing, Objectives give X gold to each player, differing based on what you took and if you helped.\nSo Second Rule, work as a team late game\n\nThe third rule is learn to predict. This becomes more important the harder your opponents are. Predicting an opponents dash and then flashing and W'ing as poppy to counter it can make a huge difference. So learn to predict how people will play.\n\nFourth and final rule of thumb: Don't specialize in one role. Playing multiple roles helps you understand how other roles will react in certain situations. For example, it will teach you that mid laners prefer to get people to crowd in an area and quickly burst them, top laners prefer to initiate, and ADC are great at focusing out singular targets.\n\nAlso, as an extension to this rule, you need to find characters that you enjoy in every role. _this doesn't mean do well with them._ You need to find a champ that you can play over and over and over and enjoy and get better at. For example, I'm a Taliyah main. I played her as soon as she released, and I loved her. When I first started, my KDA was almost always horrible as hell. By the end of that _same_ patch, I reached mastery 7 on her and played over 100 games with her, getting to the point where I had an 80% win rate with her in ranked, and a KDA that was astounding to see. It proves that if you truely love a champion, you can master them and beat the odds, because at that time, Taliyah's win rate was at _35%_ and I was easily winning double that amount of games.\n\nSo my tips?\n\nCS >> Kills Early on (With an exception on First Blood)\nPush with your team late game\nPredict your opponents\nAnd find your preferred role and character, but be willing to adapt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-09-25T05:47:32.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realistically?

The game *WILL* change and you can't stop that. Items, Champions, heck even the map itself can at any time be changed, sometimes even by champions in the game. Don't get too comfortable, because things wont stay the same for too long.\n\n**2: Find your playstyle.**\nYour unique playstyle, the things you do well and the things that work with you specifically. Note that this doesn't mean \"Tank\" or \"ADC\" or anything like that.\nI, for instance, work best with timing, huge game-changer abilities and CC I can protect or otherwise aid my allies with, thus I've grown into playing Sejuani, Veigar and Karma, whom all have those sorts of abilities. Notice how they are all champions in completely different roles, being Jungle(Sejuani), Mid APC(Veigar) and Support(Karma)\n\nIt's not easy to figure out, but once you've got it it becomes easier to spot what you might enjoy playing and/or might be naturally good at.\n\n**3: Adapt your items.**\nYour choices of items matters a *huge* amount for your performance. Tying in with tip 1: Don't get too comfortable with a build. Learn to adapt it based on the enemy team as well as your own. Playing an AP caster with relatively low cooldowns and there's a juggernaut/kitable champion on the enemy team? Buy Rylai's. Enemy is building MR? Void staff. They got heavy burst on long CD? Get Zhonya's.\n\n**4: Number of champions.**\nNow, I know it may be tempting, but if you want to *really* get good at the game, like, get REEEAAAALLY good, don't play *too* many champions. Don't limit yourself to a single champion either though. I've heard 4-8 champions is a good number of Main champions to have. Of course this doesn't mean you CAN'T play other champions, it just means you should *primarily* play a certain few champions you mesh well with and enjoy to play :P\n***\nNow to apologize for a **REAL** wall of text, have a TL;DR:\n1. Learn to adapt. Be like the straw and bend in the storm when a tree would break.\n2. Find your personal style. Nothing is more stylish than what suits you individually!\n3. Pick items based on the current match. Why pick grass into fire when water exists?\n4: Play the right amount of champions. 20 is a pretty big crowd, but 1 is kinda lonely.\n\nIf you need any help or have any questions, feel free to throw 'em my way and I'll do my best to answer/help out! I mean I know I'm not *THE* best, but I think I should be good enough to at least help a little bit :P\n(Also if you want to you can throw a friend request my way and we could talk over the LoL client instead of flooding the board. ONLY if *you* want to though.)\n\nGood luck improving further!

Here is some advice I give to plays new to PvP:\n\n* Try not to take insults to heart. There are some pretty toxic people in league. Don't let them get to you because you are still trying to get a feel for things and (more inportantly) **it's just a game**, it doesn't matter if you suck or not. If you let people know you are still learning they might calm down.\n* Try to learn what each champion does and what all the items do. This will take some time because there is a lot to remember. You can start by learning who deals the most damage, who can stun and CC you, and look up guides on what items to buy on you champion. Once you know what the other champs can do, you can be a lot more confident starting a fights.\n* Work on team fighting. If you came from playing bots you probably do not have a grasp on what to do in a team fight because bots do not organize as well as people do. Some general tips: the midlaner and adc (marksman) are priority targets. Stay close to the team (don't chase enemies when they run). Supports should help the damage dealers if they need it and help anyone else if the damage dealers are safe. Adc's should work on killing the tanks first. Tanks should usually be in the frontline to stop people from getting to the damage dealers. Assassins should wait until important CC abilities have been used by the enemies so they can go in and kill damage dealers. Mages can work on killing tanks or burst a damage dealer if it is safe. And fighters can do whatever the situation demands. Playing ARAM is a pretty good way to practice teamfighting (since that is all it is) and it's also a pretty relaxed game type.\n* Have fun. An experienced friend can really help you learn, and playing with friends tends to be way more fun. Keep playing champs you like or think you might like. My personal suggestions for pretty easy champs to pick up for different positions:\nJungle: {{champion:11}} Yi (damage dealer) / {{champion:111}} Nautilus (Tank)\nMid: {{champion:99}} Lux (mage) / {{champion:91}} Talon (assassin)\nAdc: {{champion:51}} Caitlyn (harder to kill) / {{champion:22}} Ashe (simple abilities and has CC)\nSupport: {{champion:37}} Sona (squishy) / {{champion:201}} Braum (tank)\n\nHope that helps a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Around999People","date":"2016-09-24T19:56:55.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Honestly you can add me and I'd be happy to help out.\n\nSo, it really depends on what champion you play as. Some focus more on cs and poke. Others on cs and waiting to go all in.  But cs is often the deciding factor if you're even on kills. I've had games where I went from like 1/9 to 17/10 after I farmed a ton and got my items.","replies":[{"poster":"Raven Redeemed","date":"2016-09-26T00:13:19.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately he is on a different server, unless you have a EUW account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-09-25T23:26:18.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20 games is an awfully low number.\nMy advice is that you don't concern yourself with other roles or champions outside of a few that you find interesting. Getting familiar with your role and a champion takes time, not to mention the time to learn how to lane properly and maximize your efficiency before you attempt to make juicy plays.\n\nThe key to being a better player is consistency.\nConsistency is achieved with 2 things:\n\n- learn how to lane well (general game knowledge)\n- learn your champion well (specific champion knowledge)\n\nYour success is guaranteed to be higher if you understand these things. I'm sorry to be a bit vague but you will also start to understand these things when you play game after game, for hundreds of games. The sheer number of games might sound a bit high however, even if you play an entire season casually, you should be able to get at least 300 games in. So no pressure. Play at your own pace and learn at your own pace.\n\nIf you wish to accelerate this, you may attempt to find some YT videos about things you are interested in, some guides for your champions and watch some streams on Twitch. For twitch, i suggest [Wingsofdeath](https://www.twitch.tv/wingsofdeath).","replies":[]},{"poster":"lvl 2 lagspike","date":"2016-09-25T23:03:05.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its kinda hard to say what you're doing wrong just off what you wrote...\nBut considering you only played 20 \"pvp\" games... all I can say is just keep playing...  right now you should just learn to CS better and get to know champs and builds and mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-09-25T22:45:21.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to trade the opponent out of lane so you can farm harder and be 2 levels above them. Then just freeze the lane at your tower and stand ahead of the minions, keeping the enemy out of range from the minions. This makes them tilted af and will usually beg for their jungler to help them. If their jungler helps them, odds are youll get a triple/doulbe (depending on your lane) because youre 2 levels ahead of your opponent.

Its generally a solo 1v1 lane. Only one real angle to gank from (river, tribush) and its fairly easy to ward against. Less need to keep an eye on the near by objective.\n\nNow botlane is a 2v2 and a prime gank lane for the jg. You have to keep an eye out on 2 people trying to poke you as either ADC/sup. You need to keep any eye out for the jg both ganking, invading, and going for drag more.\n\nMid is like top, but it has like 6 ways you can be ganked from. Also the other prime gank target because its usualy an assassin or AP carry in that lane a jg will want to shut down. Not to mention top and bot can roam mid easily.\n\nSo lets look at the pros for ganks in each lane:\n\nBot: Possible double assist/kill for jg, better dragon control, snowball ADC/sup.\n\nMid: Possible assist/kill for jg, possible dragon control, snowball AP carry/assassin.\n\nTop: Possible assist/kill for jg, possible hearld control (much less attractive than dragon), snowball top.\n\nThis means you may see ganks top only if you prove to be an easy target, otherwise top is just often a 1v1 lane. You wont be seeing much roaming from bot lane. If your jg is pressuring mid any, and your mid laner is doing ok, then its less likely you will see mid roaming top.\n\nTop is just the easiest lane on average. Maybe not every game, but theoretically, statistically, via the META top will be the easiest.\n\nSo why are you bad at the other roles? They require additional skills, more awareness, more game knowledge, more MOAR!\n\nKeep trying, watch some videos, take advice, ask questions.

Learning when they are powerful or simply not effective.

Or {{champion:202}} who is a strong early-mid champion who focuses on ranging teamfights or catching an opponent off guard and starting the teamfight. If you want a really good sense of scale and focusing on CS, pick {{champion:54}} .
