But another troubling pattern I would like to address is Riot sacrificing gameplay experience for balance. What I mean is, when a champion is a balancing nightmare, Riot follows a predictable pattern to \"fix\" them.\n\n1. Champion is overpowered.\n2. Community complains.\n3. Riot nerfs champion, but instead of nerfing what makes them problematic, they nerf something completely unrelated.\n4. Champion is still problematic and the community is still upset.\n5. Riot hits the champion with a brutal nerf to their kits numbers.\n6. Champion is still problematic.\n7. Riot, unable to come up with a solution, makes the champions gameplay experience awful.\n\nA few examples are Leblanc, Rengar, Kat, Ahri, Elise, and we might as well add Zoe to the list soon. When Riot is unable to properly balance a champion, they instead gut that champions gameplay experience, making them feel awful to play as. If Riot cannot make a champion viable without making them feel bad to play as, they should go back to the drawing board. Intentionally ruining a champion so that you dont have to deal with them is not a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-01-12T19:01:50.969+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":4,"body":">A few examples are Leblanc, Rengar, Kat, Ahri, Elise, and we might as well add Zoe to the list soon.\n\nriot team biggest problem is that they don't want to admit their mistakes\n\nmany of the champion that you mentioned were easy to balance,for example ahri's skill camp got nerfed over and over (E nerf,damage reduction) while it's since s5 when she got reworked that every ahri main is saying that her Q movement speed is making her kit problematic and that it should be removed (ahri mains are the first who don't like ahri being that safe)\nsomething similar happened for rengar rework (and now they might realized that so they are reverting his Q)\nbut they are too stubborn,better nerf a champion untill he becomes unplayable and wait for reworking him,instead of admitting their mistakes or listening their community","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2018-01-12T21:35:26.954+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Frankly, I WANT Ahri to lose some of her safety, yes.

Yeah you can't just fish all day with charms, that's literally the point of it costing so much. Try poking with AAs and Qs some, then if you see a reasonable opening you E and if it lands you kill them. That's like Ahri 101.\n\n>if he's already CC'ed you are just following up someone that hit another CC,what's wrong with that?

The point is that you don't have to spam E all day to eventually get a kill. Just be patient and let someone else land theirs like a tank who can get closer, then you chain with E and kill. Yes lots of champions can do it, my point is that so can Ahri despite your previous complaints saying her E is useless and very difficult to land.\n\n>OP.GG,even though as i said WR doesn't mean a lot,idk why every player always bring it\n\nThat data is literally information from only one server... xD Get a better sight to look at please. Also nothing there remotely suggests that she has a low skill cap.\n\n>so what's your point? i can't really understand,so you are just saying they should do this because yes?\n\nI'm saying they should nerf her auto attacks to be as on par with other mid lane mages and buff her somewhere else that isn't so annoying to lane against.\n\n>fun fact,i went in the pratice tool and copy-pasted their AS\nso you are saying the client is wrong? kk\ni obviusly meant the average of mages\n\nThe client is actually rounding it, so yes what the client tells YOU is wrong but it actually has the full information and so is correct. I don't know where you got that average from but it doesn't really matter. Her autos are notably faster than most other mid lane mages and that matters.\n\n>in laning phase,other mages are able to use all their base abilities for trading ,farming and pushing\n\nNo they don't get to do that at all. They'd all go oom right away if they did.\n\n>as ahri you will literally play only with your Q AA due her high mana cost (65/70/75/80/85 Q\n\nThat's not a high mana cost. Some other mid mages have costs like 70/85/100/115/130 on their main farming spell. I main one.\n\nher W less damage than 1 AA (so it's a waste of mana)\n\nThat is just factually incorrect. Even if you use it the worst way possible and have all 3 spheres hit 1 target that still isn't true. If you use it the best way possible it does 120 +90% AP damage at rank 1.\n\n>her E being blocked so eaily by minions while still having a low damage even if it hits \n\nBecause it charms them which allows you to hit all of your other spells...\n\n>and because she have about 50 less base mana pool than average of mages (for not to mention the scaling being low as well)\n\nNeither of those statements is true. Also her costs are lower than many mages.\n\n>nerfing her AS would make her laning phase a pain,especially because she's altready weak,it doesn't really affect her trading or damage output,it's just a little help for her early game so where is the problem?\n\nShe isn't already weak. It would greatly affect her trading and damage output and that's why it's a problem.\n\n>so,where are all these unbalanced stats?\n\nOn all sorts of numbers. Look at other mages as well like Lux, Morgana, Orianna, Syndra, Annie, and more. They all have different stats. But here's a key issue. If you can auto faster from the same or further range you can harass the other person safely for no mana cost. This matters a lot in lane.\n\nThe other big factor is that her pre 6 full burst combo beats most other mage's full burst combos (and her post 6 too but that gets way more complex). So if you try to trade with her autos she Es when you lock in your auto animation and it becomes nearly impossible to dodge. Even if you can land your whole combo in retaliation you'll die first because she bursts harder.\n\nI'm not saying she's broken or anything right now. She's doing fine but not overpowered. But a lot of people in this thread were saying she's weak and the move speed on her Q should be gotten rid of. I'm suggesting her auto attacks be brought in line with other similar champions so that she can get a little magic damage in return so that she can do her job of bursting people properly without being an auto attacking bully in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-01-14T13:37:20.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cosnirak,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=accEYwQz,comment-id=00070000000100000000000100000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-01-14T12:06:45.527+0000)\n\ni didn't want to answer,but i couldn't ignore all this bullshit\n\nyou totally don't know how this champion works and i bet you never played her once\n\n> That&#x27;s why you R in, E them, then Q and they can&#x27;t dodge.

Why do you think adc Ahri works so well for a champion with so little else in her kit to enable that? That's why she feels like Yasuo and is so dangerous against other mages. She can get up close and kill you with autos. In lane against her I often take more physical damage from her than anything else if the Ahri player is good.\n\n>Her Q is probably around 60% of her safety\n\nI strongly disagree but it's also pretty pointless to put numbers to it because it's impossible to quantify like that.\n\n>Frankly I just don't think you know much about playing against Ahri is all.\n\nWell I think you're very wrong and quite a bit biased.\n\n>She's a safe early laner with a great midgame and a shit late-game (especially for a mage).\n\nThe problem is that she's not really a mage, she's an assassin. She bursts, has catch, mobility, and very little aoe. So yeah, she has a great mid game and bad late game, like most assassins... The problem is she looks like a mage at first glance to some and does have a rather safe early game, which is part of why she's historically been a bit strong.\n\nRiot has struggled with what to call her and what to balance her as and she's one of the champions they decided to call \"burst mage\" but in my opinion is far more an assassin than a mage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-01-13T13:19:08.975+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kind of missing the point of my 'dodge her charm' comment.

Here's the process that Riot goes through such that the pattern you're noticing occurs.\n\nRiot has a reworking team, and a champion team. Both of these teams create what is fundamentally new abilities through reworks or new champions. Not once has a champion been released, or a champion reworked, to have an ability of theirs fundamentally changed shortly after (to my knowledge). This is because the Champion and GU (gameplay update) teams don't stick around much with the champion after they're finished. They finish the champion, and they move on.\n\nSo, if certain abilities happen to be fundamentally overpowered by nature of design, the guys who nerf those abilities are the Live Balance team. These guys don't change abilities, and they don't revert fundamental changes to kits (i.e. reverting new abilities to old ones). They mostly deal in nerfing numbers, and perhaps scraping off excess strength that one ability might have (a good example of this is Kassadin's Q silence; the silence was removed, but the core identity of his Q didn't change much).\n\nUsually, if a champion is a miss instead of a hit, it takes months or even years (hello, Aatrox) for that champion to see actual gameplay updates (new abilities, or entirely reworked abilities). I agree with you that this is a problem, and I think there's a fairly simple solution.\n\nI think that the GU and Champion Creation teams should stick around with their work after it's been released. They shouldn't be so hesitant to change these champions after they've been released, because often changing these broken abilities into balanced abilities is better for game health. So why don't they do this?\n\nA big reason, I think, is that champions and their kits directly tie into Riot's income source. Zoe might have a really broken CC ability, but changing that one week after release might be a huge hit to her sales, purely because it's been changed. This could also cause a huge backlash, because one player might examine the release kit of Zoe, and decide to buy her with RP; only to find that one week later, her kit has changed in some way that he didn't like, and so now he regrets buying the champion with RP, and might furthermore complain about it.\n\nBy admission, this doesn't apply as much to GU champions, as a significant portion of players might already own the champion who's been reworked, but it still counts, even a little.\n\nAnother reason why they might not change these champions fundamentally after release is because it's risky. There's no guarantee that number changes won't solve the problem, and adding new abilities into the game, or entirely reworked ones, is always a balancing issue. They could just as easily make a champion worse, especially if they jump the gun only a week, or even only a month into a champion release.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2018-01-12T20:28:21.826+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or like Karma, they decide they don't like something, ignore it for 2 years, and then throw it away and say it was hard to work with.\n\nKind of sounds like the Lore too...and the Journal of Justice...","replies":[]},{"poster":"9L9L9L9L9L9L9L","date":"2018-01-12T19:08:51.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then we have this guy, {{champion:13}}.
