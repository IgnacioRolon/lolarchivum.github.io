Not OMG THIS IS SO BROKEN overpowered, but overpowered. Much like Rek'sai is right now. Like Rek'sai they nerfed the AD ratio on his passive from 0.4 to 0.3 (they're nerfing Rek'sai's Q to 0.3 from 0.4.)\n\nThe problem? Much like Darius this is just going to cause end game woes for Rek'sai while doing little to curb the early game power that Rek'sai commands. Like Darius this will just discourage damage builds and focus more on full tank builds or trinity/full tank builds. Like Darius this is not a satisfying nerf that will leave an incredible laning phase and a weak late game. \n\nI know Riot sees melee building damage and immediately thinks \"WHY NOT FULL TANK?\" but maybe we can leave in some AD ratios and weaken their early game a bit to smooth over the early->late game transition? Not every bruiser needs to be a laning phase bully. Did nerfing Darius's AD ratios work? Did nerfing Yorick's AD ratios work? Did nerfing Jax's AD ratios work? Did nerfing Garen's AD ratios work? Did nerfing Kha'zix's AD ratios work? Did nerfing Malphite's armor ratio work? Did nerfing Shen's AP ratios work? Did nerfing Rammus's armor ratios work? Did nerfing Mordekaiser's AP ratios work? did nerfing Rengar's AD ratios work? I could go on but I'm bored.\n\nEither way point stands: Riot always jumps on nerfing the AD ratios because for some unknown reason they just believe that trinity/full tank is the way to go for bruisers, and if they weren't dominant in the laning phase that they'd be bad design. If we lopped 20 damage off Rek'sai's Q (-0/-5/-10/-15/-20 at rank 1-5 respectively) it would amount to a much more reasonable nerf than removing 0.3 AD ratio total off the ability and would actually achieve what you want to achieve.\n\nAlso why the hell are you reducing the AP ratio on her Q? Does it really annoy you so much that people build AP on champions you don't want them to that you will go out of your way to hound people down who want to have a little fun? \"Oh hey, Rek'sai has a 1.0 AP ratio on her Q, I'm gonna go AP Rek'sai cause that might be funny!\" Then suddenly Riot comes down in a black helicopter and punches them in the face and says \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING KID? YOU PLAY HER TRINITY FULL TANK I WILL END YOU IF YOU BUILD AP ON A CHAMPION WE DIDN'T EAR MARK FOR AP ITEMS!\" ","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2014-12-18T16:31:08.153+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":5,"body":"Are you suggesting that a non marksmen class deserves a late game fantasy\n\nEnjoy your ban","replies":[{"poster":"juaumzitus","date":"2014-12-18T22:03:02.391+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":20,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FalconPawwwwnch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4EQ8NFgk,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-12-18T16:31:08.153+0000)\n>\n> Are you suggesting that a non marksmen class deserves a late game fantasy\n> \n> Enjoy your ban\n\nWhen?

Rek'Sai is obviously a champion they made for the jungle, a strong AoE, gap closers, a form of sustain it's all there. But like Rengar, what can be strong in the jungle can also be strong in the top lane. When he first came out Rengar was pretty good in the jungle, not Lee Sin meta levels but he wasn't Warwick levels of bad (Warwick back then) so he was an ok pick.
