It's called micro, or stutter-stepping or orbwalking (although technically orbwalking is wrong.) Because Kalista can't cancel her autoattacks, she doesn't get nearly as much free mobility as it would seem if you leave this point out. Also, if you leave this point out you leave our her biggest weakness, when she attacks she commits. That means Leona can land a free e, Ezreal can land a free Q, etc. This is EXTREMELY prevalent in lane phase, where she has low attackspeed and thus can't dash very quickly.\n\nThe mechanic isn't specifically anti-melee, (if anything, you could say it's anti-slows, because it's not reduced by slowing, which normal micro is.) because every ranged champ can do this and get similar returns on it. The extra range on backwards jump is good when people are chasing you, regardless of who they are.\n\nAt the fifth paragraph is where you really start to go off the rails, though. You emphasize how her % health damage is magic, and how that screws over tanks, yet fail to mention how she has no actual steriod, putting her likely only slightly ahead of Caitlyn in terms of mid-late game dps. \n\nIf you want to specifically talk about how certain melee champs are pretty bad (which is what it seems like your last 3 paragraphs are about) then a general topic isn't the place to do it. In no way are all melee characters bad in LoL. Easy examples are Lee, Rammus, and Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRainInSpain","date":"2014-11-21T01:37:33.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Yes, this is the thing people seem to forget.

Piss poor win rates and popularity in low elo, yet dominates in high elo.\n\nThe place I see Kalista being used is in a more non-ADC based team, where the **real** carry is an AD mid, jungle, or top.  Kalista is a ranged \"Support\" Marksman that can apply some damage and plenty of utility from range.  People are going to dive her and kill her and dominate her.  But lose the game.  The guy they needed to shut and put down was somewhere else.\n\nYou see this in many games.  A team focuses down the Marksman, yet lets Master Yi take a pentakill and six items.
