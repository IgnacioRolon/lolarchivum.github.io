The reason that certain champs like Anivia and Brand aren't picked up in the midlane, despite being seriously powerful, is because they don't fit the meta, composition, or playstyle of the people who play in the LCS. Currently, the meta is dominated by high mobility or long range champions. Anivia and Brand are super stationary champions that don't have the range or spam abilities to compete with champs like Ziggs and Syndra. Champs like Lee Sin are picked up often in the jungle because they can easily snowball a team through the early game. Elise was picked up quite a lot until she got a nerf which I think was needed, but taken too far, because she has high early game damage and extreme pick off potential comparable to Thresh and Morgana. Currently the top lane meta is shifted to favor early game bullies that have extreme late game utility (Maokai and Lulu). Champs like Malphite and Nasus simply cannot survive the early game with the champs that dominate atm. Nasus was picked up a few times this year and won a majority of the time if I'm not mistaken simply because he has late game potential beyond compare (for doing something as simple as last hitting I fucking hate Nasus and will never respect the cane). ADCs need their repositioning tools, which is why Tristana and Lucian are so dominant. True, champs like Kog'Maw, Jinx, and Twitch (pretty much only picked up by cocky af Doublelift) are picked up at certain times too, but usually have the team build around peeling for them since they are super immobile. The biggest problem with Vayne is that she has the weakest early game out of every ADC. Ashe's and Varus' kits needs to be reworked, as their abilities do not support their playstyle; Ashe's passive requires her to not AA, while her Frostshot promotes it, and Varus' Piercing Arrow combined with the worst mobility on any ADC promotes long range poking, but his Blighted Quiver means he has to be constantly in the fight, auto attacking everyone as much as possible. Urgot is absolute garbage the way he is, but if he is buffed he will be overpowered. He should just be removed from the game or have his new playstyle not even come close to resembling his old one. Supports are put into the meta based on either the current meta of ADCs or the current determination of which is broken in terms of stats. Hypercarries are in atm, so Janna and Nami are in.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2014-10-19T22:29:49.107+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":5,"body":"> The reason that certain champs like Anivia and Brand aren't picked up in the midlane, despite being seriously powerful, is because they don't fit the meta, composition, or playstyle of the people who play in the LCS.\n\n**Brand has not been picked in any LCS game, ever.** This is not because \"the meta doesn't fit him\", this is because he's inherently unfit for competitive play, period. Long range mages outperform him in poking, toplane bruisers like Rumble and Ryze outperform him in DPS and durability. Also, he's naturally weak against assassins, any sort of mobility and team coordination (same reason why Sejuani isn't a competitve pick).\n\n**There is nothing that Brand can do that the other champions cannot**.\n\n> Currently, the meta is dominated by high mobility or long range champions.\n\nYou live in an illusion where \"currently\" is anything past season one. **Mobility has been the core power creep of LoL for about three years now**, probably since release of Ahri and Fizz - and frankly, the emergence of weekly LCS is what solidified it and showed the world what competitive picks are.\n\n> Anivia and Brand are super stationary champions that don't have the range or spam abilities to compete with champs like Ziggs and Syndra.\n\nNews flash: Ziggs' temporary rise to popularity is already gone.\n\n> The biggest problem with Vayne is that she has the weakest early game out of every ADC.\n\nNo, that's just how her power curve is supposed to work. Vayne's problem is not the weak early game, it's that her lategame isn't that much stronger than Tristana's or Twitch's, who don't have to pay for it with such weak laning.\n\n*I could argue with your other points, but there were irrelevant to the discussion*\n\n---\n\nBlazingSalvo's point stands: **the competitive champion pool is embarassingly small.** It's 3-4 dominant champions per role, the only thing that changes is what the holy trinity of a given lane is, since the cycle of buffs and nerfs removes a pick or two from time to time.\n\nDue to inherent flaws and the cycle of nerfs half of LoL champs are unfit for competitive play at any given time. The cycle of buffs and nerfs gives an illusion that there are many viable options, when you sum picks from all patches, but that is simply not true.\n\n---\n\n**The problem with LoL is the lack of champion diversity in design**. *All spell effects are too similar to each other*. Swain is so rare because Ryze does pretty much the same (DPS, tankiness, root, heal on R) and doesn't require snowball and heavy AP to be relevant. Vayne was almost nonexistent at Worlds because you can have just as great lategame with Twitch or Tristana and there is nothing particular that Vayne does that those two cannot. Of course if T&T got nerfed to ground, Vayne would be situationally picked again, but that's the problem - champions are too similar, so you just compare them and get the currently strongest one.\n\nWhy would you pick [insert mage here] when you have other mages? What can he do that the others cannot? Some conditional CC, burst, DPS - is there anything that makes Brand mid THAT different from Vel'Koz? Lux from Xerath? Mages are too similar, and in result only the select few ones (Orianna, Syndra, Ahri) get picked.\n\nThis goes for every role. There are very few champions with abilities distinct enough to make a true difference, doing something no one else can. Good examples are Morgana as support, Thresh, Braum and Yasuo - but the last one was nerfed to ground due to overwhelming annoyance coming from his passive effects. Also, Yasuo was the only carry out of the bunch, with no real competition in the field of being impactful in an original manner.\n\n---\n\nIf you want any further proof, look up the picks%bans at Worlds. **Only 50% of champions were picked or banned** over 78 games.\n\n[Here's a post with full statistics](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/491fp4px-worlds-pb-stats-59120-champions-were-picked-in-s4-worlds-17-of-them-made-71-of-picksbans). 17 champions made 70% of picks and bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-10-20T01:22:26.923+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":">You live in an illusion where \"currently\" is anything past season one.

I'm of the camp that 'if it were truly imbalanced they'd fix it,' but there's no doubt that there's favour in picks, at least where non-viable champs are considered.\n\nSo having said all that, I think the expectations-- as angrily as they are submitted-- are toward actually putting their money where their mouths are here and making champs at least equally viable picks, if not equally significant (that's what bans are for, though!).","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-10-19T21:18:02.142+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Two things to consider with that:\n\nA) Some of the champs considered unviable are intentionally put into that state. I wouldn't want to play a League where {{champion:78}} was the staple top lane pick, would you?\n\nB) The competitive meta, especially if so much is on the line, is much more restricted due to players only being able to play so much champions on the highest level continously. On top of it, scrimming only against a limited pool of players with equal limitations on their champion pools tends to reinforce further which champions are seen as viable and which ones are seen as unviable.\nAnd too much of a different champion pool makes you also pretty vulnerable to targeted bans. If the enemy team knows that their enemy, for example, toplaner can't play the \"meta\" champions too well and instead has his one or two incredibly strong pet picks...which not ban those two away and force him on an uncomfortable champion, making him possibly tilt?\n\nThe world championship also showed another different thing - the evolution of a meta on a single, given patch. During NA playoffs, for example, Rumble wasn't even shown once. Became a staple pick the first day. Same with Kayle, Irelia.

When they're trying to make the tiniest tweaks for balance, it feels weird that they'd just backpedal on that and make champs who aren't meant to be balanced. And then why have them be allowed picks if they're not balanced? That's going to cause a lot of flak if they get picked. That's not cunning design, that's poor design; at the very least, while they don't have to be the grand meta, champions should never be 'not viable' for at least their standard role. That much, I think, isn't so much to ask... there will always be champions better suited to certain things by virtue of this being, you know, a video game. What there should not be are champions who just cannot be picked. That's poor balance, and again I think that's where complaints are coming from. If they're going to create a champ outside the meta's guidelines, they should at the very least have a point at which they flourish. The way it is now, it feels like some champs just won't see picks because they just don't have the resources that make them useful to a team.

I don't like to 'preach the meta' as it were, but curveballs-- while nice, and generally fun to watch and play-- don't typically lead to victory in a game with a meta so apparently hard-set as League's. Maybe that's just me, but I find League to have a very strict and unforgiving meta...\n\nThe game would not, say, reward itself for having a meta that more forgave builds like Mage Fortune or things like that, but it would benefit pretty greatly from having a more strictly defined standard to which all champions could be held.\n\nAs for people losing champs over bans, that's just poor on their part. I'm no ranked player and I'm no pro, but I certainly have more than one role and two champs under my belt. That's just healthy if I'm entering competitive play-- expecting that my one or two picks will never get A) picked, B) banned or C) hard-countered isn't being a good player or meeting expectations, it's holding a dangerously narrow scope on the way the competitive play does and should work.\n\nAs for lost or gained significance, Nid might be doing better if she weren't disabled!

It has to go beyond simple number fixes. For any champ to be picked over another based on something other than shear numbers or reliability, they have to bring something specific that other champs don't bring or bring it with a twist. Vi is a good example of this and they actually talked about her a while back. They thought what can we give vi that would make you want to pick her. The answer in there post/blog was the garunteed 1.25 second knockup. You can't dodge her ult, you can't stop it, and you can't out run it (unless you have the best timing on your backs/teleports ever). While you can argue that this isn't fun for the enemy team or what not, it gives you a reason to want to pick her over say lee sin. \n\nOn the side of multiple champs bringing the same thing with a twist, we can compare sejuani and amumu. Both bring excellent aoe initiation for late game team fights. The difference? Amumu has way more damage but is less safe. Sej on the other hand has a greater distance she can initiate from and if she fails it then she can just turn around. You can argue that neither are picked in the pros and thus are a failed design in your mind but sej was very strong after her rework way back because the thing she brought to your team was actually very useful, constant aoe cc at a distance. There are actually a decent number of champs that have unique things they bring to a team but aren't picked in worlds. This is mostly because, at least from what I've seen, in the past riot perceived what was strong or useful about a popular or op champ and nerfed it. The issue was the thing they nerfed was also why that champ was brought along. When they nerfed sej, instead of nerfing her damage, they nerfed her cc, the whole reason you brought her to begin with, making her more similar to other champs. Could you imagine if instead of nerfing oriana's lane harass from autos they nerfed say, they radius on her ult by about 25 or 50? She would have fallen strait off the pick list for the pros. Her follow up cc and team fight set-up is key to her. Not her lane harass. And yet she had lane harass that was above average as well, so they nerfed it. That was a smart nerf, preserving why people would want to pick the champ while removing needless or random strengths they brought along with their selling points. As riot goes forward into improving the game, they will want and need to make balance changes that don't take away from a champs selling point while buffing what they are supposed to be good at. For instance, take the ap poke champs, xerath, lux, ziggs, and sorta syndra (and nid but she is kinda in between a lot of things atm). Why would you pick any of these over another? \n\nOf the four, xerath and ziggs are muched more focused simply on their range, while syndra and lux bring pick potential from their long range cc. Betwen xerath and ziggs, ziggs used to be picked cause he had better wave clear. Xerath on the other hand brings hard cc and his ult over ziggs, and they have arguably similar wave clear now. If they wanted to distinguish these two more from each other, they could improve zigg's waveclear while taking away from somewhere else, and for xerath focusing more on his ult as it is farely unique, maybe giving another change should it kill someone (with number changes). Not saying either of these changes are a good idea, just giving an example.\n\nSyndra and lux are a bit more complicated which is probably why syndra hasn't been nerfed yet and lux hasn't been buffed other than her passive lately. If you nerf syndras ult which is what most hate about her, you take away from her main strength, picks. Maybe she is too good at it, but it is her thing. Lux on the other hand is just a little too easy to dodge at max range but that is probably a good thing. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post, but I though I would add my 2 (20?) cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2014-10-20T15:12:39.773+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Pro meta does not equal the current solo que meta, and their scene should not be viewed as a measuring tool for determining viable champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSlappySlap","date":"2014-12-05T01:33:46.157+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is half the reason why I play exclusively ARAM recently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2014-10-22T12:25:27.919+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fearless: \"While Sona is still very much on the winning side...\"\n\n**0% Win Rate**\n\nPlayed only twice by a support player considered \"unorthodox\" in his champion pool, on one of the weakest teams in the tournament.","replies":[{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2014-10-22T16:16:46.191+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Fearless: \"While Sona is still very much on the winning side...\"\n> \n> **0% Win Rate**\n> \n> Played only twice by a support player considered \"unorthodox\" in his champion pool, on one of the weakest teams in the tournament.\n\nI was just about to post that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-10-20T13:45:37.976+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to see a League of Legends where taking Tryndamere bot lane as our carry is just as viable as taking a Vayne and he could actually lane effectively against them.
