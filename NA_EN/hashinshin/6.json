Yi/Yas/Fiora are the ones that come to mind that really irritate me personally. They have an underlying factor that I think needs to be toned back, but not removed since I feel like this is everyone's reaction and Riots decision instead of tweaking. \n\nI'm tired of riot gutting champs anyway. I feel like there are small tweaks and number reworks. Looking at Yas again I don't think they targeted the right area for him. I think they should have hit his passive instead of his base stats that they did. His survivability was never the problem imo, but his straight damage early and having to only get 1 item before he starts to spike. This coupled with a great late game caused for a champion that is fun to play, but beyond overpowered. Yet instead of targeting his late game or making his early game worse they destroyed his survivability to the point of his Win rate dying. I think if they made his passive scale at lvls 6, 11, and 16 so that his passive now is the lvl 16 scale would make yasuo better as an overall champ. \n\nNow that i got my minor rant out I really think the problem is also the fact that for some of the stronger melee champs if they get a small edge they can do what they want. They can zone better than most Ranged champs. I'm looking mainly at snowballing champs here.

You have to differentiate between melees like Udyr and melees like Akali and gap closers and nongap closers. Braum and any form of CC really hurts nongap closers so its not really fair to compare it to only melee champs. Any champion ranged or melee with a gap closer doesn't care as much about these forms of CC. If you didn't have this there would be much to combat Melee champs late game.
