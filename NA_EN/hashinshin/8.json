This feels like quadruple-nerfing, this time. Last year before worlds every single tank item was nerfed (RIP {{item:3143}} movespeed debuff) and ADC items were simultaneously buffed. This led to one of the worst game balances in history during Worlds. \n\n{{champion:18}} was \"pick, ban, or lose\" and the only tanks that were viable in the meta were {{champion:57}} {{champion:12}} and ONLY because their kits gave them innate tankyness. Top lane meta was completely ruined and got reduced to cancerous champions like {{champion:13}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:117}} \n\nThe same will happen this year if not worse in Worlds. there will be 1 or less tank per game (and I'm going to guess that tank will be {{champion:57}} or {{champion:12}} surprise surprise), mark my words. Is this Goundhog's Day?? Why does Rito ALWAYS make this mistake and expect a different result? Literally every bit of progress made this season in making tanks viable again will be COMPLETELY undone if these 5.16 changes go through. It's not too late to stop them @RiotRepertoir please cancel these changes before it's too late. The tank meta ended many patches ago. Watch any game now. Tanks are only played in top lane and maybe support. Even then, there are other non-tank champions in those roles that are just as viable. \n\n{{item:3075}} 's numbers literally have not been changed since 2010 and 2009. It's currently the least popular armor item in the game. Given a choice of ANY ONE armor item, most champions prefer to buy {{item:3143}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3047}} .\n\nThere was a time when {{item:3110}} used to give 15% CDR, 90 armor, and 20% attack speed debuff (Season 2/3) and NOBODY bought it because it was also expensive. We are returning to those times.\n\n{{item:3143}} ALREADY got nerfed last year and until you bring back the 10% movespeed debuff on-hit there is nothing to justify nerfing it further. It's new crit reduction passive is a total joke. So which is it? Is {{item:3143}} supposed to be good against crits or against speed? The 5.16 nerfs make it shitty at BOTH.\n\nThese changes literally decrease strategic diversity. There's not a single good reason for any of these changes. The only think I can see is \"well it's almost time for Worlds time to make flashy damage champions strong again {{champion:64}} must always be top pick\". Rito has consistently shown bias against tanky melee champions. Any time there's any change to make them viable, they are almost immediately nerfed back into oblivion.

It will be significantly easier for assassins to assassinate tanks.\n\nYou seem to completely forget that assassin builds are often ALL armor pen items and even botrk. So, really, you need closer to 240-250 armor to cut their damage by 50% not counting Black Cleaver, and you'll barely pull more than that with a full devoted armor-item in every slot after the round nerfs here, minus boots. They might not burst you, but you're probably only a BOTRK proc and a few extra smacks away from death at that point.\n\nBut you won't be in an isolated fight, it'll be a team fight. By then, you would've taken enough random collateral damage to be dead, and then your glass cannons are shattered glass.\n\nNo, tanks aren't meant to be invulnerable. But even now in their supposed prime they only live for like 4-5 seconds on the frontline if ONLY the adc is shooting at them. After some lovely round about nerfs coming up here, they won't even be picked beyond people wanting to toy with the new reworks and items, because they'd be lucky to live 2-3 seconds. They might toss their ult before they die, I guess.

If two items offer similar stats, but one has simply a more powerfull effeckt, it will always be prioritzed outside off specific niche situation in which the other unique effeck might be more valuable.\n\nHoever, the main concern is the power of defens items relative to offense.\nDefense items feel rather bad later on, as they get outscaled by offense items, not only because of multipliers, but also by beeing less slotefficient.\nAt the same time, defense is somewhat overhelming early-mid due to it's cost efficency.\nWith 5.16, defenseitems overall recive a nerf to both, cost-efficency(something i'm totally fine with) and slot-efficiency, which will make tankiness (from items) reliant champs that already are in a rather bad spot overall even worse. Slot efficiency actually needs a buff rather than a nerf.\n\nAlso, if costefficency is the primary factor for wether or not to get an item, maybe the game currently is to earlygame focused or not as gold efficient items don't make up for that with superior scaleing.\nIdeally, the most gold efficient items should be at lowish costs(2000-2500g) and thus not really slotefficient, while the expensive and therefor slotefficient items are not as gold efficient.\nThis means you can pick up goldefficient items for an imidiate spike, so with a rather early-mid focus or if you prepare for a baron fight, at the cost of the lategame scaleing a slot efficient item would grant. This would allow for meaningfull strategical decicions when buying items.\nRight now, the most slot-efficient items are often also amongst the most goldefficient items, so the choice is obvious, and it also leads to more heavy snowballing, as who ever reaches that item first has a significant advantage without real tradeoff, which leads to more focus on early-mid to start snowballing, which leads to a focus on the most cost-efficient items as they improve your early-mid....\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-08-13T18:10:48.687+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aImYMQXE,comment-id=001f,timestamp=2015-08-13T17:28:59.490+0000)\n>\n\n> I'd actually be interesting in hearing people's opinions on whether the approach being taken to Armor items in 5.16 (without consideration to exact numbers) is a preferred approach as opposed to a method that is more constantly taking things off the top.\n\nIt's definitely nice to see a whole slew of balance changes focused to a single item (though certainly not when it's a blanket nerf). \n\nI just wish that you guys were nerfing Last Whisper in the same patch. With all of the armor items getting weaker and only receiving a 10% reduction in critical strike damage received as compensation, champions who build armor penetration and not critical strike chance (Zed, Talon, Pantheon, Riven) will be buffed hugely against champions they're supposed to have a hard time killing (Tanks are supposed to survive burst damage and die to sustained damage. If you nerf a tank's ability to survive burst, then they aren't doing their job correctly and they have no endgame fantasy).\n\nAttempting to push for a mid-game power spike for tanks also will not work, because tanks are much easier to gank and shut down and they have a harder time farming their lanes and getting kills than AP mid laners do, which means that AP mid laners (who get their power spikes in the mid game as well and also deal burst damage that tanks are supposed to take for the team) will simply outscale them due to the large amount of gold they have at that point in the game.\n\nWhat am I supposed to enjoy about playing a tank now, with the threat of assassins looming in the distance? Assassins have, by definition and necessity, low counterplay kits. For a tank to survive their burst it **has** to be a stat check, and that is **the designer's fault**. And you're nerfing the tank's stats across the board while leaving penetration as powerful as it is. \n\nIt just seems like a poor decision on the item team's part to make sweeping changes to armor itemization without touching armor penetration.","replies":[]}]}]}
