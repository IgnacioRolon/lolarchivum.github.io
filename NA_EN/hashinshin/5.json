Effectively Yorick&#039;s entire kit is burned down to a single Q, which while early game is hella damaging, by mid-late game is simply not going to make you a threat. \r\n\r\nAlso I should mention because his E doesn&#039;t travel in a line it makes champions with gap closers/escape moves actually difficult to hit.\r\n\r\nWORSE YET is Ghouls terrible AI has a tendency to jump at the target, run to get in to position, get maybe one auto off, then dance around like little idiots and never get another auto off. \r\n\r\nThe closest comparison I can think of is Illoai&#039;s E which:\r\n\r\nA. Travels in a straight line. (Makes it so you can&#039;t gap close in to her to dodge it.)\r\nB. Comes out near instantly. (You can&#039;t walk behind her in the cast time...)\r\nC.

(Maiden of the- FUCK YOU IMMA RUN IN TO THAT TURRET.)\r\n\r\nThere are some serious problems with the kit (why in fuck&#039;s name does a split push MASSIVE COOLDOWN ultimate get targeted by a turret?!) but this is pretty much the one thing I&#039;d legitimately like to see hotfixed. Yorick is in a very sad state right now, and rather than looking at his numbers (survivability...)

If you guarantee an E hit, he could just always instruct the ghouls to harass you whenever he has them available. As far as i see it, ghouls being a 1-hit KO is justified as his kit actually has functioning abilities, unlike his previous design where 3 abilities were 3 different types of ghouls. So they had to be able to take a few hits or it would render Yorick useless. In this version, he makes mass graves off minion kills and even the maiden summons her own ghouls at higher levels.

That's not how this game works. Cowl gives you magic resist health and health regeneration but does nothing for the blinds effect. Had you said banshees veil i might have agreed to some extent but the truth is that banshees would have taken until 10 minutes at least and pops on more than just teemos Q. Teemos usually start with blind or E. Those minions do little damage early game and require 3 of 4 to activate. Teemo is ranged and mobile meaning yoricks W does very little as far as a 1v1 goes. Especially since the range is within teemos blind and basic attack. Yoricks E is a magic based ability power built skill so in theory you could poke with it, but the reality is that it scales poorly and is better saved for directing minions. R is your only true hope, but will only save you if you already have it summoned. It takes too long to summon to try and use it for reacting to teemos R + passive +Q + autos. So I don't know where you get teemo is countered by new yorick. \n\nas for nasus  being similar to yorick - q is a basic attack buff granting more physical damage, w is a circle that can dictate an opponents movement choices, E is a slow, R is a %HP drain channel that give the player additional health magic damage and vision in the form of a minion.\n\nnasus - Q is a basic attack buff that provides physical damage, W is a slow, E is a circle that deals damage and removes armor over time - usually will be avoided but sometimes enemies will find themselves inside, R is a self buff HP drain that grants the player slightly higher stats and emits an area of effect.\n\nhow are the two played?

The nerfs to Malz's passive mean going aggressive on him is the best way to deal with him unless he built tanky in which case only his Ult will deal damage. His R stops that from happening, it is a constant threat for anyone who jumps in. The game plan is stack 4+ voidlings and having your E bounce to them as you are ulting someone, if you timed it properly you can Q right when R is done to reset the E or you can just put the E back on them (in a 1v1 or 2v2 scenario). The R is not a gimmick or side not, it is a major part of his kit and one of his most reliable damage dealing abilities on a kit with fairly low damage for majority of the game.  \n\nBesides, why are you coaching me on how to play Malzahar? I never said he was garbage or bad or useless when the enemy buys QSS. I said it is how you counter him with 1 item, countering does not mean you make them useless. They are just less effective against you. I don't particularly like new Malzahar's playstyle, in fact I don't like it at all... It is boring... but it isn't garbage or bad.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-13T07:49:31.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what you talked about it nothing more than a dream-like perfect scenario that almost no one ever gets. that same scenario is Karthus having 5 enemies below 300 hp none of which have veil, maw, or zhonya while maintaining eyes on all the way until you achieve pentakill. it just doesnt happen. just like how karthus has his Q and E for reliable damage and yorick has his minions and R for reliable damage. however - when playing yorick if you get blinded and miss your Q you just lost 1 grave and some health. that blind screws yorick over big time. \n\nyou cant buy just 1 item and counter a champion. especially not an item without a passive/active.\n\nchampions can counter each other but not items. items provide advantages. that's it. countering is completely negating someone. and qss does not by any means completely negate the turret destroying fiend that is malzahar.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-09-13T16:48:27.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was giving a best case scenario, this is what you are looking for. It is not something that you will always be able to pull off but it is something you should be trying to pull off. It is not as hard or impossible as it seems, it is actually quite easy. 1 of 3 things will happen if you are trying to achieve this: 1) It works out perfectly; 2) They back off before the E bounces; 3) They kill the Voidlings as they spawn. If 2 or 3 happens, you try a different tactic. I wasn't implying it is the only thing he can do.  \n\nFor the 100th time: **COUNTERING A CHAMPION DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE MAKING THEM COMPLETELY USELESS, YOU ARE MERELY MAKING THEM LESS EFFECTIVE AGAINST YOU OR MAKING YOU MORE EFFECTIVE AGAINST THEM.**  \n\nYou seem very confused by the term \"counter\", it is not the end all solution to a champion, it is how you deal with aspects of their gameplay by making them less effective against you or you more effective against them. That is countering a champion, champions are more effective against certain champions, thus they \"counter\" them. Items can counter champions as well.  \n\nBy this definition, QSS counters Malzahar, it makes an entire ability, his ultimate no less, not as effective against you. Not only does it make it not effective against you but if you are a high priority target, it makes him less effective as a teammate in teamfights because he is no longer a huge threat to a high priority target. This puts extra strain on his teammates to deal with you as well as the rest of your team.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-13T19:51:01.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?&id=OIP.M3ebd73f7e3ddbb8ff934b8f8d52107b4o0&w=147&h=204&c=0&pid=1.9&rs=0&p=0&r=0\n\nany card game ever played when something is countered it goes into the graveyard as a worthless piece of paper.\n\nhttp://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/dead-or-alive-5/5/59/Bayman_Counter_Hold.jpg\n\nin a fighting game a counter completely negates the entirety of that move and leaves the opponent open to further hits.\n\ncounter\nverb [ T ] uk ​ us ​ /ˈkaʊntər/\nPREVENT\n​\n\nto prevent something or reduce the bad effect that it has:\nThis skin cream claims to counter the effects of sun damage.\nREACT\n​\n\nto say something to show that what someone has just said is not true:\n\"Of course I love him,\" Clare countered.\n\n(Definition of “counter verb” from the Cambridge Learner's Dictionary © Cambridge University Press)\n\nthe only thing QSS does is counter that one R it doesnt counter the entire champ. malzahar does not even need lots of ability power or his R to be effective.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-13T21:35:17.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\n\n> [{quoted}](name=BLACK REALM GOD,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Vf0YrZky,comment-id=001900000000,timestamp=2016-09-09T18:58:12.936+0000)\n>\n> You say that, but none of it is true.\n> \n> you can&#x27;t counter an opponent by buying just 1 item.
