Which I think is a good thing, but the order in the way they do it is bad. They're leaving the ADC items etc for after worlds, so us bruiser/tank players might have some problems if they're actually nerfing us and making them stronger.

If this was the case, then health itemization would behave essentially identically to armor, including the value of each point. Each point of armor gives the same bonus - if 50 armor increases your survival time by 2 seconds, then 100 armor will increase it by 4.\n\nThere exist items that pierce a % of your armor/MR, but it is linear in a vacuum. The reason people claim it had diminishing returns is because the % gain from a linear bonus decreases as that value increases. That is the same with nearly every stat, though. Even damage or crit chance experience this phenomena when they are increased in isolation.\"\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=441938\n\nIts kinda hard to explain since its not exactly whats perceived, but every point of armor is essentially worth the same as the last.

Twitch could potentially get a buff because of this, though I've never seen any ADC have issues with armor late game. Most AD Assassins have 2nd or 3rd item as LW and even with armor being nerfed slightly, they'd still need it. Difference between 120 and 150 armor isn't as much as people want it to seem prior to a LW. 120 is 54.5% reduction, 150 is 60%.  5.5% damage difference. Later on, it'll become more prominent, but one big armor item won't be losing much unless they destroy it, which they won't.

J4,Wu, Xin, anything with a cleaver, etc. \n\nIf Mr items are buffed, every AP Assassin is pretty much getting screwed. Completely. They've kept MR as something low because there isn't any % MR reductions in the game yet outside of a Void Staff. You can currently total 50 Flat MPen and 39% MPen. This is 20 flat from runes, 15 from boots, 15 from Liandry's. From there, you can reduce their MR by 20 as well with an abyssal. Beyond that, there isn't many MR reductions. There's a few like Amumu and Fiddle's passives for flats and %'s would be Kog's Q and Kayle's passive. Since Soraka and Morg both lost their own MR reducers, there isn't much left, which is why there's so little magic resist in the game. There's too little reducers and the new Abyssal they're working on is utter garbage at reducing Mr unless they fight lasts for 8 seconds or MORE since it does 5% reduced MR every 2s. Yeah, every 2s.... That means to get to a noticeable 20%, it takes 8 damn seconds. Most fights don't involve some one standing directly next to a tank for 8-12s.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2015-08-01T19:41:55.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerfing armor makes more people play Mages?\n\nExplain how this works.","replies":[{"poster":"Renaille","date":"2015-08-01T19:44:10.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Biff Manly,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=goaMzQqP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-01T19:41:55.667+0000)\n>\n> Nerfing armor makes more people play Mages?\n> \n> Explain how this works.\n\nBruisers suddenly can't get tanky enough to be useful.","replies":[{"poster":"Ser Garland","date":"2015-08-02T16:04:28.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xuldin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=goaMzQqP,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-08-01T19:44:10.886+0000)\n>\n> Bruisers suddenly can't get tanky enough to be useful.\n\nMR is getting stronger.

(They also appreciate armor in lane because they receive minion aggro.)\nWeaker armor = dead fighters.\nMeanwhile, mages can build Zhonya's and avoid being in the enemy ADC's range between casts.","replies":[]}]}]}
