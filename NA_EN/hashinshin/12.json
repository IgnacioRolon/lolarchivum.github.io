It makes sense, but this just seems to be ridiculous since Master Yi who's getting the most out of the new item isn't being touched. Let's just say his passive and his Q's passive (CD reduc per AA) are both proc'able by the Phantom hit given by Sated, so 3 attacks turns into 6 on-hit procs. First 2 proc 1st phantom, which makes 3 hits so his next AA would have his passive which makes you strike twice, giving you a 2nd phantom, totaling 3 on-hit attacks in a single swing. This means with his usual BotRK+Devourer+other AS item like a Shiv, he has 2-2.5 AS with his R going, meaning he does 3 hits in about 1s. That's about 48% of current health. In 1s.

About 16 or so minutes into the game, I was leading my team into the coming teamfight, having gotten a decent gap with W when I caught sight of the enemy Kalista hanging out in the middle of mid lane farming. I charged her, and Kalista, having been a relatively new champ at the time was slow to react to my appearance, before she could finish the auto attack she had ready to throw and escape from my grasp, my ult hooked her and I walked back...\n\nInto the middle of my team. That was the last I saw of that Kalista all game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-07-01T02:03:48.236+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"challenger>balance team\n...\nwho am i kidding\nbronze>balance team","replies":[{"poster":"Nunya Bezwacks","date":"2015-07-01T10:42:46.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"i know a lot of bronze players who don't agree with a lot of nerfs that get released this one since you obiously dont read is to stop shyvana from destroying in the future when sated devourer is released","replies":[{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-07-01T12:32:56.195+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"obviously you didn't read this guys post as to why that balance change makes little sense","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dannii","date":"2015-07-01T04:19:00.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile, {{item:3070}} {{champion:7}} {{item:3070}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-07-01T05:35:42.280+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Stop dashing in, insta-deading people, then reverting to a mile away in less time than east coast ping can react.\nThen, we'll talk.\n\n(NOTE: this is *not* a job at her power level.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-07-01T00:15:19.006+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're being a little bit condescending.

Maybe riot should get rid of W's bonus jungle damage and increase the base damage so that's it's higher than her current damage top but lower than her jungle damage.  Also, isn't the whole point of picking shyvana supposed to be because you want to power farming the jungle and become a late game nightmare?   I mean it's the people who think she's a top who are bringing her win rate down.\n\nLast season I picked Evelynn jungle and was forced to take her top against a shyv after our top didn't connect.  Despite having a machete and jungle runes/masteries it wasn't a terrible match up for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TEA Nietzsche ","date":"2015-07-01T13:06:08.778+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
