{"poster":"hashinshin","date":"2016-04-30T16:50:27.340+0000","title":"@Meddler Your season sucks. I can help you fix it.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":88,"down_votes":58,"body":"The last time these boards mattered was never. They suck. That&#039;s just a blunt truth. This is just reddit with maybe 1/5 the audience and no Riot attention. The last time anyone cared about leagueoflegends.com was when I had my post with GC like 3 RAINBOW years ago in the pre-board era. I, like most sane people, ditched once it become clear that Riot was trying to shut down negative communication. Unfortunately that seems to have backfired most spectacularly. Much like IT workers I&#039;m never appreciated when things are working, and when shit hits the fan I&#039;m supposed to be there. I wasn&#039;t. So really this entire bullshit meta is on me. \r\n\r\n_I have replaced every instance of the word &quot;fuck&quot; with &quot;RAINBOW&quot; because I think the boards are heavily moderated now. You know, for all the nobody that visit._\r\n\r\nWHEN THE WORLD NEEDED ME MOST I DISAPPEARED. I&#039;M BACK. You won&#039;t listen but I&#039;m here anyway.\r\n\r\nNow normally I&#039;d have to make my posts ragey to get attention to them and so they wouldn&#039;t be ignored, but in this case RAINBOW your stupid meta. RAINBOW your decisions in S5 and S6, RAINBOW your inability to fix anything, and RAINBOW the fact that it has taken you this long to start to try to fix this shit.\r\n\r\n**Lets begin with tanks.** RAINBOW tanks. Nobody has fun playing tanks, and nobody has fun playing against tanks. This isn&#039;t S4 tanks where they do damage and tank a lot, this isn&#039;t S3 tanks where they soak up damage. This isn&#039;t S2 tanks where nobody cares cause tanks suck. &quot;Tanks&quot; are pretty much a new concept to S5 and S6. Shyvana/Mundo S4 &quot;tanks&quot; were actually just bruisers. You know what&#039;s awesome about bruisers? They don&#039;t CC you for 5 years, building CDR just to CC you longer. They have to build damage to remain relevant (or in Mundo&#039;s case hurt himself, and therefore be far less tanky than a tank.) Most importantly, bruisers aren&#039;t Maokai. RAINBOW Maokai. Stop pushing Maokai he&#039;s a bullshit champion with bullshit abilities that makes the game worse for everyone. \r\n\r\n**RAINBOW tanks.** Bring back bruisers. Bruisers kept us safe from tanks, now tanks are killing bruisers. I&#039;ll tell you WHY though:\r\n\r\n* Sunfire is a stupid generalist item that should never be more powerful than specialized items. \r\n* IBG is way too god damn powerful with it&#039;s slow field that slows me from my house all the way from runeterra. \r\n* Both these items are too RAINBOW cheap and are completed before anyone has time to even respond to them. Their stats aren&#039;t even out of line, 6 item tanks are not OP, they&#039;re just completed too damn quick. \r\n* WHY IN RAINBOW NAME WAS THORNMAIL CHANGED TO AN ANTI-BRUISER ITEM? WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? WHO THOUGHT TANKS BEATING BRUISERS WAS A GOOD IDEA? Jesus christ Riot.\r\n\r\nChange thornmail back to being an anti-ADC item. Stop tanks from AFKing and killing bruisers because bruisers murder themselves on the thornmail damage return. Increase the cost of sunfire and IBG. I mean sweet jesus in S1 it took 3 months for Riot to respond to the sunfire meta and that was considered obscene. THIS HAS BEEN ALL OF S6. And you know what? It feels like TWO seasons because tanks ARE JUST THAT UNFUN.\r\n\r\n**Ekko**: Stop being idiots and nerf his mobility. Kassadin doesn&#039;t build tank because if he presses R too much it takes twelve billion mana and he can&#039;t do it anymore. Ekko doesn&#039;t have that concept. He&#039;s too RAINBOW mobile. He always hits his combo and then escapes, and you can&#039;t do jack shit to stop it. Bruisers can never lock him down to actually hurt him, and if you ever actually land damage he just Rs for a massive RAINBOW nuke+heal and you die. His passive is an insult to god because you did something that even god himself would never dare do. And dear god if you&#039;re an ADC you now know what it&#039;s like to play against Kalista as a melee champion. EXCEPT JACKED UP TO 11 CAUSE HE&#039;S A LITTLE SHIT. \r\n\r\n**Maokai**: Remove him from the game or halve his damage. How stubborn do you guys have to be to continue to allow the existence of a lane bully tank that has a 2 second invulnerable frame root that isn&#039;t even on a skill shot? 2 second hard CC root, 0.5 second AoE knockback on a 5 second CD Q. 20% damage mitigation that you have no counterplay against that also does a huge nuke back to you. And then his passive heals him as he continues to keep using W and Q to prevent any sort of good focus fire on him. Just stop Riot. He&#039;s dumb as RAINBOW to play literally just pressing W and Q repeatedly until you win the team fight, and he&#039;s dumb as RAINBOW to play against just pressing W and Q until you lose the team fight CAUSE HE HAS NO COUNTERPLAY. \r\n\r\n**Rageblade:** YOU&#039;RE NERFING RAGEBLADE? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? ARE YOU JUST SO OUT OF THE LOOP THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE BUILDING THIS? We&#039;re in a tank + ADC meta and your response IS TO NERF RAINBOW BRUISERS? After 6 years of nerfing bruisers have you guys seriously never learned to do anything other than nerf bruisers? Yes I&#039;m sure nerfing Rageblade is going to stop the tank+ADC meta. OH WAIT, you&#039;re actually buffing it on ADCs and nerfing it on melee. Cause you know, melee that build damage are so RAINBOW meta right now. And I&#039;m sure Kog won&#039;t be a balance problem for the fifteenth time.  No THIS time you&#039;re going to tune him properly. THIS time it&#039;s going to work. \r\n\r\n**Ryze:** Stop RAINBOW reworking Ryze and rework Yorick you biased as RAINBOW developers. This is like a meme come to life at this point. I don&#039;t even have anything to say because the joke is just there. The joke is become reality. \r\n\r\nStop being stupid about everything. YES OBVIOUSLY the champions you nerfed cause of Sated Devourer are going to be too weak after you remove Sated Devourer. You don&#039;t need data to show that. YES OBVIOUSLY nerfing rageblade when bruisers are at an all time low will seriously impact their ability to even be played ironically. Yes when you nerf every single tank item EXCEPT sunfire then sunfire will be the chosen item. Yes when you nerf every mobility item obtainable Olaf will have a plummeting winrate. This is your job for chrissake. \r\n\r\nSTOP REWORKING CHAMPIONS YOU KNOW YOU WILL OBLITERATE LATER. Cancel the Ryze rework, massively nerf him, and forget about him until you do about 50 other reworks. Do the same thing to Nidalee. Remember when you did that to yorick FOUR YEARS AGO? Remember when you jacked the RAINBOW out of Jax&#039;s base stats TWO YEARS AGO and he has never recovered (oh wait, he sorta did with rageblade BUT GOOD THING WE&#039;RE NERFING THAT!) How many juggernauts are viable right now? RAINBOW ZERO. Oh what&#039;s that, you wasted time reworking Skarner without bothering to touch his ultimate even though you know god damn well his ult will make him OP at low ELO? Wait what&#039;s that, YOU BUFFED HIS ULTIMATE? RAINBOW HELL RIOT.\r\n\r\nPhantom Dancer is stupid. Graves running around with 12% movespeed and 12% damage reduction just makes him a ranged-kite-bruiser. Say that out loud and try not to vomit. Oh wait, with warlords he&#039;s a ranged-kite-bruiser-drain tank OH GOD I CAN&#039;T HOLD IN MY PUKE.\r\n\r\nGive me back my yellow ward upgrade so I can properly ward for my split push. RAINBOW.\r\n\r\nBuff ghost if you&#039;re going to remove distortion, since you balanced ghost around distortion. Am I getting paid for this?\r\n\r\nBuff BotRK and BC on at least melee champions so they have some viable options on how to play against tanks SINCE THEY ALL JUST GET THORNMAIL ANYWAY. \r\n\r\n**STOP CHANGING EVERY RAINBOW ITEM IN TO AN ADC ITEM!** You pushed BotRK REALLY RAINBOW HARD for ADCs then nerfed it hard cause every ADC was building it. WELL GEE, I wonder if on-hits are stronger on ranged champ- yup I just got hit in the face with a frying pan because that&#039;s too stupid to even ask. We figured this out 12 years ago and you guys are STILL surprised when on-hit items are stronger on ranged champions. It&#039;s like every time you guys do on-hits it&#039;s like &quot;WHAT ITS STRONGER ON RANGED CHAMPIONS? HOW COULD WE HAVE KNOWN!&quot;\r\n\r\n**AND STOP PRETENDING THAT FORCING RANGED CHAMPIONS TOP IS EVER FUN.** Fighting ranged top laners will never be fun. NEVER. Stop forcing it. Top lane is the 1v1 lane where two many men fight each other. NOT BITCH ASS LISSANDRA SPAMS Q ALL DAY UNTIL YOU SHOOT YOURSELF.\r\n\r\n**Give bruisers their itemization back.** Make Maw a bruiser item again. Make Sterakk&#039;s a bruiser item again. Stop changing rageblade in to an ADC item. Make BotRK in to a bruiser item again. I mean sweet jesus the only bruiser items right now are Titanic and Rageblade, you&#039;re making rageblade an ADC item and you overnerfed Titanic. What do you even want bruisers to build? Frozen Mallet? Cause you guys nerfed that back in S3 if you forgot.\r\n\r\n**Give Titanic Hydra a buff**, are you guys just RAINBOW with me at this point? You remove FIFTEEN DAMAGE and you&#039;re like &quot;oh gee willickers it seems everyone is playing a tank now! How entirely unexpected!&quot; Don&#039;t people pay you to know this stuff? You nerf BotRK, BC, Titanic, you make rageblade the only viable option for bruisers even though it sandbags your entire laning phase and you can&#039;t possible comprehend why everyone swapped to tanks? \r\n\r\nGo in to the LoL client and sort champions by Role. You notice how the fighter role is blatantly the biggest? You notice how fighters are shit right now?

Have you even read the PBE lately? They are buffing black cleaver, nerfing sun fire cape to be in line with randuins and dead mans plate. Deaths dance got buffed this season and is actually decent on bruisers. High Elo rivens in Korea build it every game. Bruisers suck right now but they riot is slowly trying to fix that.\n\nYou and everyone else are just impatient. They do not want to do a knee jerk response to balance. That's how you get bullshit op champions or items. Sun fire in its current state is actually because people were claiming \"sun fire costs too much for when I can just get dead mans\". People for the most part do not know what they are talking about. Sure, you are well versed in this game. But that doesn't mean you are going to be spot on when it comes to balance.\n\nThe balance team mostly does a good job of balancing to be honest. The main gripe people have is it takes AWHILE to fix an overbuff. Graves is starting to finally get close to being balanced. But when he is it will be worth it because he won't be in the dumpster either. Ekko is still broken, but give it another patch or two and I'm sure he will be balanced. Fiora was a broken piece of shit for most of the season and now she's what she always should've been: a late game beast. And not THE late game beast like she was. \n\nTldr= while your complaints are justified, give riot some time, they simply take so long to fix things because they do not want to dumpster champions and items","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2016-05-01T09:57:21.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chuck Charles,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3e1HAAAa,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2016-04-30T22:41:16.696+0000)\n>\n\n> This post is proof that salt never stops as you climb the ladder.\n\nWhy would it?\n\nIn fact, shouldn't it get worse?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-04-30T18:42:14.866+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"well. i definitely agree with some points. the idea of graves a sa ranged, mobile bruiser is stupid.\n\neither his dash has to go, or his e passive shouldnt stack. a 30 armor/mr steroid is already more than most actual melee bruisers get. being able to stack that to become better than rammus w is insane.\n\nalso, they need to stop trying to balance bruiser items on ranged champs and nerfing these items on bruisers as a result. {{item:3053}} was never too powerful on the champions it was intended for. even before the 100 health nerf the item was core on all juggs (as intended), but neither of them was too strong as a result.\n\nthey really just nerfed the item because of graves, other adc, and assassins who picked it up. make it a melee item already and give the shield passive a health threshold like warmogs.\n\n{{item:3748}} was nerfed because of bruiser {{champion:114}} and for no other reason.\n\nthey also keep removing health on every single defensive item with the attitude \"health stackers wont miss 100 health less on one of their items\". except, that health stackers are already missing a good 300 to 500 health due to item nerfs and masteries compared to the start of the season.\n\nveteran scars alone lsot 120 health. why they ever wanted to make the mastery more attractive to adc and other squshies escapes my comprehension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zonkman","date":"2016-05-01T03:03:43.784+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tl;dr Rainbows {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Windows OS","date":"2016-04-30T22:57:32.379+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quality shitpost, my dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"hotarse","date":"2016-05-01T03:58:03.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I like tanks, I enjoy playing with them and against them. i also like bruisers as long as they aren't allowed to become as tanky as tanks while dishing out more damage and being more mobile. i don't like assassins very much, nor tank versions of assassins such as tank ekko, tank yi, and tank fiora. those need to get the rainbow out of this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-05-01T06:38:00.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rageblade in its current form and the way you want fighters to work are entirely analogous to how the annoying IBG SFC tanks are now.

What do you think of {{champion:28}} overall nerfs? Why or why not?\n\nLet me start off by saying: Riot is blind.\n\n{{champion:13}}. I don't know how much cocaine Riot has been given, but Ryze reworked *RAINBOWED* him over a lot. Yes, when his first reworked came he was broken to sh@#, but the fact that he got a reworked of him being \"outdated,\" Riot decided to make his kit much more difficult to use. Ryze, right now, is sitting at a 49% winrate and being played 4% of the time (link: http://champion.gg/champion/Ryze). I think the now Ryze is balanced, but just making him more difficult than what he used to be. Sure, he needed a rework on skills, but that doesn't change the fact his overall kit is bad. Veigar, on the other hand, got the similar reworked which *RAINBOWED* the sh@# out of him. What I didn't understand about Ryze rework was his passive changed to Charges and his Ultimate (which is his R ability).\n\n{{champion:245}}. Just remove him.\n\n{{champion:57}}. Definitely needs to look over. He's way too powerful right now. He's sitting at a 51% winrate and 11% playrate (link: http://champion.gg/champion/Maokai).\n\n{{item:1403}}. It definitely needs to get huge nerf or removed from the game, period. This item is way too godlike at the moment. Even after it's nerfs, it's still one of the most broken pieces of sh@# for auto/basic champions. Thank you for Feral Flare 2.0, Riot. You've done a amazing job *RAINBOWING* the sh@# out of Season 4-6.\n\n{{item:3124}}. Either it needs a huge nerf or get removed. ADC's like {{champion:96}} can abuse this item late game and yes it is overpowered. It's cheap too. I'm glad they're putting a 3200 gold on it for the next patch, but please for god sake just nerf its passive.\n\n{{item:3025}}. It's being abused by so many champions like {{champion:245}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:77}}. Why not, you know? We can slow them in an area without even having a slow ability. Needs a nerf, even if it procs 100% now.\n\n{{item:3153}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3071}}. From what I see, {{item:3153}} really needs a buff. Have you seen any of the Assassins nowadays go for it as first item? Like how {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} used to build it first items. Now it's all about {{item:3025}}. {{item:3153}} is sh@# now and yes, Riot needs to look over it.\n\n{{item:3075}} is just stupid now. Why did Riot decided it's ok to rework {{item:3075}}.

Yes, tanks can just buy it because it's cheap.\n\nOverall, I don't think it's ok that Riot decided to rework champions just based on how high their winrate is. Top Lane ADC's are the most stupidest sh@# ever. Who the *RAINBOW* would do this kind of thing to the meta?

I understand that we're moving to different game play each year, but that doesn't *RAINBOWING* I have to deal with such cancerous trades and fights. What will an ADC do Top Lane? Split push, have gold advantage, control over Top Lane, and range. What will a *RAINBOWING* ADC Top Lane do in terms of teamfights?

Where da hell did you get this lie? I have fun facing tanks on bruiser/melee carries and using tanks are really fun.\n\nThey're nerfing tank items however I agree thornmail should be returned to an anti-adc item having it with an armor scaling hurts non-adcs than adcs it's hard to explain. It might be that since it returns less AA damage but has an armor scaling those who deal less AA damage take a lot more in return? I guess?\n\nEkko isn't really so much mobile but more of a too much forgiveness, type of thing. An assassin who has heavily influencing CC waas something riot even said they didn't like (hence most cc removal from assassins like the famous silence removals or stun eve going bye bye) But then they release ekko a champ with a large AoE stun, perma-slows(I consider perma-slows hard cc) and an undo button. I'm fine with his kit but his CC needs to get reworked majorily they should remove his passive's slow and his stun dome's slow but allow his stun field to reveal that area from the start of the cast he just needs a lot of cc removal so he can actually be an assassin not some high ratio/base damage bruiser(Hence why I want diana to get a ratio gutting and compensation buffs somewhere)\n     Point being assassins should NEVER have this much CC and it was a bad idea by riot to do so even AFTER they said they disliked the idea themselves.\n\nMaokai is actually pretty funny, he only received a buff to sapling duration along with normal melee MR and he came back I honestly didn't expect it. IMO the only nerf maokai needs is returning his MR back to a ranged status since his passive is insane when a mage is near anyways.\n\nRageblade's rework is justified, only thing they're probably gonna do is wait a week or 2 after releaase and lower the price but the rageblade change is good.\n\nRyze needs the rework but I agree they shoulda waited till after yorick ffs, yorick hasn't even been good for so long and they choose to push him back for ryze -_- I was hype to see if they took a few ideas from my yorick rework too meh.\n\nI'm also against a lot of items being changed where it felt more of an adc item but meh have to actually look at said items specifically to actually comment.\n\nUh there's nothing wrong with ranged champs top as long as they're nerfed when becoming problematic imo like the current Kayle/Karma all other ranged champs in top are playable vs if you lane properly and suggest jungle help while if you get no jungle help just focus more on playing safe until you can get a roam off.\n\nWell bruisers still synergize with maw so I don't see an issue there just wish lifegrip was removed to stop adcs from building it but the incoming maw nerf should fix it. \nRageblade was an hybrid item not a bruiser item so the change is well welcomed. \nBotrk has never been a bruiser item shifted towards adcs but just heavily nerfed to be a shadow of it's former self so asking for it to be returned isn't correct although I wish the range was reduced back to 450 so ADCs would have to enter a unsafe range to use it or only able to use the active when self-peeling like before the range buff it received. \nFrozen mallet could see a buff to apply on any physical damage then it'd see more play then it can be nerfed in amount for non-AA damage that's it.\n\nWell they did return tiamat so it's just returned to rush tiamat then continue building, don't see an issue with that. As for titanic they should have lowered it's HP but increase it's HP ratio that way those who build it alone wouldn't have so much HP from it alone along with the passive but have to invest into HP to actually get it's passive to work, if that makes sense.\n\nOverall I'm so-so on your views but I do agree that a lot of changes need to be made","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-05-01T09:28:26.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Ekko, they should simply remove either his passive's slow component or the speed-up.

It's no fun trying to deal with someone who build 300+ armor and 3000+ hp (with a warmogs of course) who just sits there and dives the carry.  If you fall behind as any class you can't put a dent in his armor.  If you don't buy a LDR and a BC you can't put a dent in his armor.  Your poor support is just trying to delay the guy without being a damage threat and no one on your team is focusing the guy while he dives in and wrecks your backline.  \n\nOn the other side of things, it's no fun being a meatshield.\n\nI kind of wish riot would put a hard AR and MR cap in (200?).\n\n>Shyvana/Mundo S4 \"tanks\" were actually just bruisers. You know what's awesome about bruisers? They don't CC you for 5 years, building CDR just to CC you longer. They have to build damage to remain relevant (or in Mundo's case hurt himself, and therefore be far less tanky than a tank.) Most importantly, bruisers aren't Maokai. RAINBOW Maokai. Stop pushing Maokai he's a bullshit champion with bullshit abilities that makes the game worse for everyone. \n\nAgree with this as well.  Take poppy, right now she deals a lot of damage but doesn't have to build any.  I like the fact she can deal damage, but I think it'd be better for the game if she were a bruiser instead of a tank.  \n\n>Change thornmail back to being an anti-ADC item. Stop tanks from AFKing and killing bruisers because bruisers murder themselves on the thornmail damage return.\n\nThat's probably be a good idea.  Right now come midgame, your typical tank has about 5,000 armor from his 2 completed items while your ADC isn't able to punch through all that alone until he gets 4 items or so.  That means tanks don't really have a counter for a mid game fight and that's hurting the game.\n\n>Ekko: Stop being idiots and nerf his mobility.\n\nMy biggest problem with tank ekko is his ult.  I find that problematic to have on an assassin, but on a tank you can just troll the other team.  That said, his E lets him be a little too clingy when combined with the passive.\n\n>Phantom Dancer is stupid. Graves running around with 12% movespeed and 12% damage reduction just makes him a ranged-kite-bruiser. Say that out loud and try not to vomit.
