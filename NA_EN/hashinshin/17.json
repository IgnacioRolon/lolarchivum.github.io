Have no TP to get back to lane. Also no feast mana restore. \r\n\r\nAnd you give 50 mana like it&#039;s going to fix everything? TP has basically been balancing mana-less champions for the last 2 years, and now suddenly we&#039;re going to pretend like the whole mana-less versus mana issue never happened top lane? It was an issue that plagued the game for 3 seasons. Mana-less champions just chain healing/shielding to drive you out of mana, and once you were out of mana the lane was over. Riot basically removed that issue with teleport, easy access to mana potions, and etc. And what is Riot&#039;s suggestion to fix it? Go flask? Lose every trade? \r\n\r\nFlask only works right now (and pretty much nobody gets it top right now anyway) because you can TP in. Hecarim sometimes gets it, because he can TP back to lane or homeguard back to lane. Everyone else needs to be competent in trades. What&#039;s worse is with feast mana regen removed that&#039;s a good 60 mana over the first back that you&#039;re losing. &quot;But it&#039;s okay guys,&quot; you say, &quot;We&#039;re giving you 50 mana at level 1 and then 3 less mana per level!&quot; That shit doesn&#039;t even cover the removal of feast, not to mention mana potions! And now we don&#039;t even have TP to reset our mana pools! I typically take 2 mana potions on Olaf just to get though level 2-6. Now I&#039;m supposed to do that from level 1? With less mana? No feast mana? No mana potions? No TP back to lane? What do you think an OOM Jax does? Nothing is pretty much a good answer! \r\n\r\nAdding lifesteal back to masteries, removing mana potions, it&#039;s like Riot forgot any lessons they were supposed to learn before season 3. ... oh wait, the entire balance team is  different now. So they DIDN&#039;T learn those lessons. _Morello pls. _","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-10-30T20:58:25.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meanwhile the utility mastery that gives up to 75 mana is also being removed","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-10-30T21:24:39.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And is being reworked into a mastery that restores mana.
