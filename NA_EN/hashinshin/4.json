Keep in mind that Riot's entire design plan for the new jungle was to make it more tactically important.

I haven't had to change my jungle paths a whole lot, just have to back a bit sooner if I'm playing someone like Nocturne, but even then I'm usually backing after going blue > wolves > raptors, getting three, buying my jungle item, and then heading to grab red with increased damage potential and an upgraded smite.\n\nJungle was never supposed to be a beginner role. Not only does it require intimate knowledge of game mechanics, but of play and counterplay, and of all of the champions in the game. It's an all inclusive role, you can play pretty much anything but strict support or strict ADC in the jungle. It's there to fill in the gaps, so it's assumed that if you're jungling, you're a competent laner first and foremost. That would imply that you understand how it feels to have a good jungler or a bad jungler, and to apply those lessons to your own style of play. You should already have tier 3 runes, and full mastery and rune pages. You should have several champs to play several roles. You should be able to fill in whatever your team needs wherever it needs it as best as you can.\n\nThe jungle is a chess match now.

Morever the 15 damage nerf to Devourers means that he'll do 75 magic damage less in his early ganks. Big whoop. The item will still get to 50+ on-hit magic damage late game because WW gets free assists in team-fights from his W.
