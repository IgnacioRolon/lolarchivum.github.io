They weren't even good to begin with, AP mord (or mord at all) was NOT viable.\n\n2. With the changes to his shield as max HP AP mord is getting trainwrecked ANYWAY.\n\nso what's the point? Were his 0.4, 0.2, and 0.6 AP ratios scaring you in to thinking people were going to play AP mord?

They didn't even fix his actual problem... you know, the part where he's a melee with no ability to close the gap and has rather high CD's and stuff.... I mean, how do you expect a tanky mage with crap ratios and low bases to be of worth if they have issues not only staying in range to cast, but also can't even unleash a good amount of burst when they DO?\n\nI can understand making him tanky and trading it off with a little less damage, but I mean, you have to look at other champions and see WHY Morde is in a bad place. It's not his passive being iffy, it's his incredible lack of balance in his kit. Usually when I champion trades their mobility away, they get CC, especially when they're melee. If they're tanky, they trade damage. Well, he had iffy damage to start with without a DFG, his mobility sucked, and he has absolutely no form of CC without a Rylai's and even then he can't do much to get near a carry.\n\nThen there's of course his ulti. The change was nice, it really was, but as I mentioned before with how his damage is subpar, he can't even get near an enemy carry. A tanky mage usually ends up peeling for his teammates if he can't get to their carries, like a Brand or Maokai or Swain would CC the diving bruiser/tank and move on towards the bigger threats... Well, Brand and Swain both have good range and CC and heavy AoE and Maokai has good tankiness, great bases, two forms of CC, a slow, and a damage reduc for himself and teammates... Morde has a boost to his own MS if he uses his W on an ally now, but that doesn't help and the tiny boost of MR and Armor isn't really great, he's got no form of CC, his only tankiness is his passive which requires him to HIT a target, something that's difficult for an immobile melee champ...\n\nAll in all, these changes are nerfing the one thing that kept him not so much of a troll pick and turning him into a tank with no CC. Well, a tank with no CC would be the equivalent of a.... I can't even think of a champion who doesn't have at least a slow that isn't an ADC and even some ADC's have slows at least... so why can't Mordekaiser get a little love and put some CC into his kit? Like, even Eve has a slow with her R...\n\nOh, I thought of a good thing... A tank with no CC is like Fiora with pure tank items, except even that doesn't work because she has a double dash to stick to her target at least. I normally don't insult Riot's decisions, but good job Riot. You're remaking a melee champion AND FORGETTING THAT A MELEE CHAMP NEEDS MOBILITY OR CC TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB.","replies":[]}]}
