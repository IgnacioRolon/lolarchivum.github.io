Not because of blatant ADC favortism shown again... \r\n\r\nBut rather just the fact they took BC and Trinity, and tried to force them in to ADC builds. They took the few items that bruisers actually still had and try actually build damage with, and pushed them to ADCs.\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t understand it. Riot is giving ADCs some of the most grossly OP items the game has ever seen, and in addition to that they try to take away the items that melee champions use and mold them in to ADC items? You look at trinity and go &quot;Well Jax, Irelia, Hecarim, etc. REALLY enjoy low damage on-hit builds with attack speed... but... I mean Corki wants CDR and crit chance...&quot; You look at BC and you go &quot;well BC is a very efficient item for melee champions with high base damage... but... ADCs don&#039;t want as much health, and they want more damage...&quot;\r\n\r\nDoes my enjoyment of the game really matter so fucking little to Riot at this stage? Has the push for #LCSBIGPLAYS and ADCs running around murdering everything in team fights really outpaced my fun? You can&#039;t just make them new items, but you also have to give them away my items too?\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s worse is pushing crit chance so heavily on trinity just means that of the 3-4 auto attacks I get on a ranged champion I&#039;ll have so much of my item&#039;s power shoved in to pure RNG. The 10% crit chance used to take so little of the item&#039;s budget, but now you&#039;re taking away it&#039;s AP, you&#039;re taking away AD, you&#039;re taking away attack speed, and you&#039;re boosting CDR and crit? How many rat&#039;s asses do you think I give about CDR and crit on Jax? And when I play Olaf how many rat&#039;s axes do you think I give about 25 more damage? That lower price point and 100 more HP is what mattered. Who gives a fuck about 25 more damage? Same for Darius.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s like someone kicked me out of my own house to throw ADCs another birthday party.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2015-10-29T06:15:11.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point on Tri force being made into an ADC item but I am a bit confused what you mean by that for Black Cleaver Hash","replies":[{"poster":"hashinshin","date":"2015-10-29T06:18:04.518+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"They're jacking BC's price up by 500, reducing it's health, and increasing it's damage.\n\nThey're trying to make BC the ADC \"caster\" item, rather than the melee bruiser item.\n\nI assume the idea is to push BC to champions like Graves with his new coneshots and ability reliance, and away from... well literally every champion who uses it now.

Admittedly champions who rely on auto attack enhancers do lose out a small bit of power here but if you aren't buying a BotRK its pretty much a neutral change.\n\nAP and MS are two legitimate losses, that being said I cannot think of an AP champion who actually prefers Trinity over Lich Bane. Help me here I cannot think of a champion that truly cares that trinity is losing ap.\n\nCDR will always matter and I am confused why you think that Trinity users, who deal quite a bit of damage through spellblade procs and thus very much care about using abilities consistently, will not like the cdr. \n\nAll in all I predict that people who use trinity now will continue to use it, bar some other newer item proving to be the perfect fit for the bruiser types taking its place, and will hardly notice the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-10-29T17:39:33.334+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax and Irelia both have good AP ratios and really enjoyed ms and as over crit since NEITHER of them are going to be building more of it so it is still unlikely you will get a crit.
