Not even samsung white (literally the best team ever made) bothered to pick him up and people were initially struggling with gnar because their was no consensus on what to build or how to play him.  Also LCS and all other formats are played 1 patch behind live so if the players play solo que, which in NA most stream a lot so the answer is yes, they typically have at least 3 weeks to pick up the champion.  That said, most pro-players don't have a large champion pools.  If you look at not some but most players, there is a huge fall off between their best and worst champion.  In the case of fnatic an EU team and undefeated at the moment their jungler once got 3 bans aimed at him and was forced onto Rengar.  He made it work but rengar at the time was like C list on the jungler tier for pros because  a lot of people knew how to play against him.  Proof of that is that rengar game was one of his worst games, not bad overall just unimpressive for him.  Lucian doesn't really outclass 2/3s of all league champions.  He brings burst but he is in no way top tier.  If the enemy team has a decent tank line Lucian becomes useless which is why he has been so bad more than anything else.  Tanks are strong and frequently in the jungle.  The armor nerfs incoming should help him some as well as the buffs, but saying that because he is staple to everyone's champion pool makes him the best is wrong.  Lucian is just a generalist ADC.  He has all the basics that an ADC wants without being a master of any.  Without a niche, he fits into almost every comp without telling what you're comp will do.  Another example is sivir.  Fits everywhere and is more frequently picked and actually has a better win rate.  Sivir also fits almost any-team comp because she gives huge mobility which is always good when you have a bunch of tanks.  Also her W allows her to hit a whole team much easier than any champion.  All the evidence suggests that lucian being picked is proof of several possible things: staple to any champion pool, maybe really fun, maybe needs to be more niche focused, maybe brings a lot of attachment.  with sub 50% winrates among all levels of play for multiple patches I dont think OP is one of them","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-08-18T02:34:18.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2015-08-18T04:22:25.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Valid points and you're noting of gnars buff is interesting as well.  This does not change the fact that rengar was not at all an ideal champion to use.  Cinderhulk was still OP at the time and ideally he should have used a cinderhulk jungler.  That he did not proves that he didnt have a cinderhulk champion that he felt comfortable on, at least equally so to rengar.  Using your logic about taking the most OP whatever at the moment as being true, that fnatic did not bother to use a different cinderhulk champion shows that they were going pretty deep into his champion pool and that it is limited.  In fact, the casters noted that he had a rather shallow champion pool.  They noted that aimed bans at the jungler was a decent strategy and forced Fnatic closer to defeat than they have almost ever gotten.  \n\nSimilarly, I feel that Lucian was just a forced picked.  Lucian being picked doesnt necessarily mean Lucian is strong, but it does mean he FEELS generally acceptable in a lot of situation.  Thus he still might not actually be that good, but if he FEELS good, then the player will immediately pick him.\n\nThink of it this way.  Do you really think that the players have enough time to consult all the data during pick and ban phase?  Probably not.  League has a huge amount of information and during that time you have to weigh general experience to your own experience.  Please note, some people are so well ingrained into a champion that they can be counter picked and still win the match up in most competitive games.  This is especially true in league where individual skill matters a lot in any individual counterpick scenario.  Rarely do you get a counterpick where you auto win regardless of what your opponent does.  \n\nSo what are the chances they literally take out a tablet consult something like OP.GG and go over win rate of champion X over Y while picking their champion?  Realistically they probably dont.  If anything, I think expecting a player to spend hours over solo que data rather than play is more than a little ambitious.  Expecting the coaches to know all this and their players own abilities and the abilities of their opponents is once again a little ambitious as no matter what all you're data could be proven inaccurate if the opponent player in question just has a lot of skill on the champion and completely outplays your laner.\n\nPlease note, I dont know of a site that shows the statistical number of games necessary to play to increase your outplay potential against an opponent in a specific match up.  I honestly do not expect such a thing to exist since it is highly specific and not incredibly likely to help unless you have exact values for your opponent which you most likely wont.  So on the point of emotion dictating picks, it should be very likely even if not the only underlying factor.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-08-18T23:48:07.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2015-08-19T03:07:22.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and yet at the time lucian was 1 and 15 and now something like 1 and 18.  If nothing else he is slightly underpowered, if for no other reason than the fact that the meta is not in his favor.  in the cinderhulk meta, lucian was a tier 3 adc.  His reliance on burst without reliable sustained damage and range made him so.  In many ways your original arguement had merit.  Yes lucian's kit has a lot of strength in it, but in the meta of cinderhulk, which is slowly dying out, he is unquestionably subpar.  Even this devourer meta we have entered, still makes him definitively underpowered.  I would not suggest that he needs buffs, but that's digressing from the point I am trying to make.  That point is that burst oriented champions in a league dominated by tanks are weak and because lucian is a burst oriented champion he is weak.  No amount of skill can make up for a fundamental weakness like that.  Only over inflated numbers can and in the case of lucian that is not the case as the win rate dictates.  \n\nOn the part  of the analysts, on paper lucian is once again strong, but if player doesnt have a good champion for the meta they wont perform.  Look at Incarnation of cloud 9.  I just read an article where it analyzed his performance this split.  Bad shotcalling of C9 taken into account, incarnation played better in lane when he played champs that he liked.  \n\nhere's a link: http://www.goldper10.com/article/2211.html\n\nthis shows that even if a player is good if they are forced onto a champion they dont like they will underperform.  Not saying this is the end all be all but you have to take that into account.  people are not robots.  No matter how much you think pro just play and become epic and do things with this cold calculating minds, they do not.  Only in korea and china can coaches fully override their players and that's not always wise.  For instance, at MSI SKT's coach forced faker onto his best champion leblanc.  Normally this would be sound, but this was actually a bait by EDG's coach.  Knowing that SKT would go for the Leblanc they left it open and counterpicked it in all 5 lanes.  This is a perfect example of emotion blocking cold hard rationale.  According to your logic they should have predicted this because it was possible.  Emotion, however, makes it logical to take leblanc because it something that will make you feel comfortable with on your team.  In many ways lucian is in the higher echelons of ADCs by nature of his kit.  It has almost everything an ADC wants.  What it lacks is what makes him weak in this meta though.  High sustained damage.  If cinderhulk wasnt a thing you'd be unquestionably accurate to how lucian stacks in the meta.  Because cinderhulk is a thing, you're not.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-08-19T23:48:58.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2015-08-20T00:30:39.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what defines a god tier champion?  It's not just their kit it is also the meta.  If you stick a champion into natural counters they will do poorly.  Right now, Lucian's early is just off of strong because they've toned down his damage to keep him from being too much of a lane bully.  While he may have a lot of mobility, his poor range makes him a risky late game champion.  I am not saying Lucian doesn't out class a lot of champions in certain regards.  What I am saying is that his dependence on burst, and the strong front lines that have been ever present all summer make him weak.  This weakness means you need to be significantly better than your opponent to make him work.  That does not mean he cant work, but he isnt working because the meta is simply shutting down his strengths.\n\nI reiterate that if this was a different meta he would be top tier.  Just before cinderhulk became a thing, he was top tier.  This is not a question, but a fact.  That said, until cinderhulk gets toned down a bit more which is happening next patch he will continue to be mid to bottom tier.","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2015-08-20T01:41:43.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not true.  In a 1v1 match up Lucian beats out a lot of champions.  League however is a 5v5 game (TT withstanding). in a team fight Lucian brings damage to the table, specifically in burst.  Nothing else.   We are in a tank meta.  Burst is not good.  So what would beat out Lucian's usefulness in a teamcomp where the enemy is a mass of hulking high HP targets.  Champions that do this are{{champion:22}}, because her current crit passive actually out damages most ADCs as you do more aa. {{champion:42}}  because his poke is really strong. {{champion:222}} who has AOE crits,{{champion:429}}  because her rend is OP, {{champion:96}}  since he is probably the highest damaging ADC right now, {{champion:15}} because the speed boost is always good,{{champion:18}}  for the same reason as jinx, {{champion:29}}  because he can mow straight through even the back line if he can get a good ult,  {{champion:67}}  because %hp true damage is OP.  All these champions have great value against tanks because they do so much damage before(via poke) or during the fight that they can tear through them.  Not one of these champions beats out lucian in a 1v1 and yet in a tank meta they will outshine him.  This does not take into account midlane adcs like{{champion:110}}  and {{champion:81}}  who can, once again, poke down tanks or {{champion:6}} who just doesnt die.  All these ADCs have been much more popular than lucian and the number of ADC champions played as ADCs is 18 right now.  That's 9 champions who currently run just as well if not better than Lucian but only in the current meta.  This would stick lucian into the bottom to mid tier of ADCs right now.  Once tankiness goes down with 5.16, as well as his buffs, he will see a rise in viability.  Until then, specifically this thursday, he will be mid-tier.  After the new patch who knows.  Probably back into top % but once again that is because of a meta shift.\n\nTo further back up my point here is a list of op.gg winrates right now\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend&roleSort=ADC\n\nlucian is at the bottom of the soloque list.

They're a delicate class - the only one that have a majority build path and each and every one fulfill the same niche role. Any change in itemization affects the entire pool which is why it's difficult to change those items. The ADC pool is like a food chain in flux, those at the top can only stay there for so long  because the players **and** Riot don't like definitive best in slot champions,  so Riot has to figure out how to remove them without causing too much harm. \n\nI for one am glad that Lucian is getting a buff. There are so few ADC's with the versatility and reliability he provides.

ADC's are valued for objective control, and therefore always get a spot on a team\n2. ADC's have their own lane in the bot lane. They may go to other lanes (ie. Quinn or Vayne top or Varus mid), but there's always an ADC bot.\n3. No other kind of champion goes in a bot lane carry position except for ADC's, except possibly the new Mordekaiser, or if you want to call Urgot a bruiser instead of a marksman\n\nBecause bot carry diversity is so small, it is much more urgent for what diversity that exists to be balanced than the other lanes, and much easier to balance because of the smaller champion pool.\n\nCompare this to the other lanes. Jungle and Top have a decent variety of AP, AD, and tanky champions for their roles, mid has an extremely large mix of AP and AD champions with a huge variance on their strengths and weaknesses, and bot support has a decently sized mix of utility, AP, and tanky champions. \n\nBecause their champion pools are so much larger than the bot carry champion pools, it's much harder to balance it, and much less important that it be balanced than the bot champion pools.\n\nThat said, there does get to be some severe balance problems in the other lanes, especially the mid lane, where so many champions are subpar despite being healthy for the game and gets dominated super hard by a handful of champions so hard that the only viable champions are the strong champions and those that can deal with the strong champions. I personally would like it if Riot balanced non-ADC's like they do ADC's because of the diversity that would come out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Byakuya Kuchiki","date":"2015-08-18T00:14:42.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP i want you to tell me this.\n\n do you think Vayne is strong?\n do you think she needs nerfs? \nwhy is it that she needs nerfs? \nwhy dont we just buff the other ADCs up to her level since they are only picked in NA LCS/EU LCS for the strong tower push early and in LCK and LPL because they need the ranged damage to take towers later in the game. they are picked in solo queue because other things that work dont work without being organized?(basically why not buff other ADCs since the role in general isn't strong right now)\nwhy shouldn't lucian be buffed so that other lane bullies can also be buffed so that we can balance the role also","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-08-17T21:05:12.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Careful Hashinshin, you're treading in the ADC-main infested boards.

He has i believe 1 win out of the 15 or 16 times he's been picked.  \n\nConsider, also, that LCS isn't the only measure of balance. Lucian feels really, really weak right now. I remember when he was dominating botlane and don't want that, but there's currently pretty much no reason to play him. His range is too low for him to teamfight effectively and his mobility does not make up for it. He is less mobile than vayne and has 50 lower range. His spells have damage but not enough to make up for the lack of dps he can't provide since he often can't comfortably aa in teamfights. His lanebully status has been massively toned down and there are multiple adcs that bully lane way harder than him currently. His burst is good, but in my opinion not worth being so incredibly short ranged. The increased utility on his w will help him be more mobile but will not push him over the top. In my experience with him, he absolutely NEEDS buffs to be anywhere near relevant. I'm also pretty confident the upcoming buffs he has will not make him overly strong or bring him to 50% winrate. (he's currently at 46%)","replies":[]}]}
