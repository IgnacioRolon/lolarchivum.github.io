Suffice to say that is extremely, extremely weird.  This isn't something I can troubleshoot too deeply on Boards, so your next best step is to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) about this.  One of our ticket agents can take a much more in-depth look and see if its something we can resolve.\n\nLet me know if I can help you out with anything else!","replies":[]}]}
