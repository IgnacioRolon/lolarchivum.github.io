Ever since the new client I've been having problems. Recently I tried to play a game and it crashed during the loading screen. Now I have a 20 minute penalty when searching for a game. Normally I would be OK with this, but when I'm searching for a game and it finds one, a window pops up saying I lost connection and am trying to reconnect, and then takes me out of the lobby. I have no other connection issues of any kind so I think it has something to do with the client.\r\nHas anyone had this problem or have any ideas for how to fix this? I can't try much because it takes 20 minutes to recreate the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2017-05-08T03:53:16.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is most likely caused by intermittent connection issues between your client and our servers.
