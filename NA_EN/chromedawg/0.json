I can get through champion select just fine and even the load screen but when the characters are about to drop into the map, my computer gets a black screen and I have to hard reset it to get it back up. I originally thought that it was my Graphics card so I called up EVGA and had it RMA'd. A week later, I put the card in and it still happened. I then thought it could be a bad MOBO so I went and replaced everything except the card and the hard drive. Built myself a new computer and it still happens. I then replaced the hard drive thinking it could have been the culprit. I replaced it and I still get the same problem. I really enjoy playing league but I have spent over $900.00 dollars and I still can't play it. \r\n\r\nPossible answers:\r\n1) No my computer is not overheating. I have monitored the temperatures very closely and they never get into critical temperatures.\r\n2) I have disabled the Xbox DVR function for windows 10 to no help.\r\n3) I have forced my GPU to have a constant voltage as I found on the league forums that that could be a possible fix. \r\n4) My computer should have more than enough horsepower to play this game at max settings even though I only have them set to medium.\r\n\r\nComputer specs:\r\nMOBO: MSI Performance Gaming Intel Z170A LGA 1151 DDR4 USB 3.1 ATX Motherboard (Z170A Krait Gaming 3X)\r\nCPU: Intel BX80677I57600K 7th Gen Core Desktop Processors\r\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3200 C16 for DDR4 Systems - White\r\nPSU: EVGA Supernova G1 750W 120-G1-0750-XR Fully Modular Power Supply\r\nGPU: EVGA EVGA GTX GTX 970 Superclocked 4GB GDDR5 256bit, DVI-I, DVI-D, HDMI, DP SLI Ready Graphics Card (04G-P4-1972-KR) Graphics Cards 04G-P4-1972-KR\r\nOS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any help that someone has to offer.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T03:36:25.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you hear game sounds when this happens?
