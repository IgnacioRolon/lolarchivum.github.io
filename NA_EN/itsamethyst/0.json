I read some posts that dated back to 2013 that League of Legends had some compatibility issues with the R7 series. I thought everything was fine at first until I started experiencing some issues. First of all I saw some brief graphic streaks (Don't know how to describe them) that lasted about half a second, then I a white screen flashed for about a half a second again. This doesn't happen as often but then I had some instances where my computer would shut off completely during a game. My computer won't reboot instantly and I have to either wait for a few minutes or unplug and plug the power cord in repeatedly. Oddly, this doesn't happen in other games this only occurs during matches in League.\r\n\r\nI replaced the power supply to a 550 watt since my graphics card required a minimum of 400 and the recommended was about 500 watts. I'm not sure if my graphics card is broken, since I ordered it just a few weeks ago. I installed it correctly, installed the latest drivers, reinstalled League and the driver but still no luck. Is it a problem with my hardware or the game itself?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know as soon as possible, because I want to enjoy League and not deal with my computer potentially killing itself.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nAmd FX(tm)-4300 Quad Core-Processor GHz\r\nWindows 10 64-bit\r\nMsi R7 250 2GD3 OC 1.8 GHz 2GB DDR3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T19:28:59.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is something pretty serious going on if your computer is forcing a shutdown, which occurs as a safety precauution.
