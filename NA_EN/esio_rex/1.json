League's mana flooded enough (Blue Buff, Blue Pot(?), Morello's, most champions mana costs being cut, homogenized, or otherwise reduced compared to S1-3) that such an active choice is pretty much irrelevant.\n\nTo make Tear and its associated items meaningful, you need to make having a lot of mana (read: mana stability) a meaningful choice to make. Morello's in particular (with Meditation and the soon-to-be Manaflow Band) removes mana as a meaningful mechanic ... pretty much outright. The only Champions suffering still are the spammy ones Tear was bound to to begin with. In such a world, for instance, Morello's would be more the AP assassin (dump their mana in one go and get resets or do nothing) versus the siege/longevity of Tear (reduced mana costs, bigger mana pool).\n\nSo, if you took the current mana comfort a lot of champions enjoy and move that understanding onto Tear, that'd be its gameplay niche. Slightly comparable to old Athene's in a sense, minus the durability, I suppose.\n\nMorello's by contrast would be a lot more constrained and make you count your shots for the more immediate upfront damage injection it gives.\n\nThe availability of mana in meaningful ways (not touching the damage at all, arguably) would radically impact mage expression in the game, tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Face2Masher","date":"2017-10-04T15:54:26.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss when mana mattered more :(","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2017-10-04T23:22:43.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The disappearance of Tear has very little to do with the general decrease in mana-gating in the game and has a lot more to do with the fact that Tear has traditionally been used as an item to hold back champions Riot didn't want to be viable.
