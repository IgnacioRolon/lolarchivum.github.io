Im not toxic the only reasons why I get LBs are because of these Bugsplats that happen every single day. It says the same thing eveytime that the client needs to repair and I find it annoying how I always get these and leaverbusters for these. It bugsplats right after the champ select goes away and the LoL logo comes up. Also sometimes when after champ select the client stays on the LoL logo and doesn't open the loading screen. When I click on it, it says its not responding. So, I close LoL and reopen it but it will not open it keeps saying not responding on the LoL logo. This forces me to restart my computer just to play league. And, due to this they remake and I get LBs. please help me rn or else. I recently just got 5 leaver busters too due to this having to repair. I get that they are based on leaving the game frequently but just last night I had to restart my comp because of the client going unresponsive and would never open again so they remade. I got no LB for and now I just got a bugsplat THIS happens all the time and got LB evn after rejoining the game 5 mins in and still winning. it was ARURF so whats the point of giving LB in the first place. PS: due to these issues I get LB almost every 3 days and I find it unfair. please help. I would appreciate it if you removed my LB or reduced the time because im not toxic and leaving games I got from 10 min q's to 20 allthe time due to these reason >.>\n(Sorry I posted my first one in the wrong section so I reposted this here)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T02:26:21.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intent, your absence from a match negatively impacts *everyone* in it. This is a key reason as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we are unable to modify Leaverbuster penalties. Bugsplats are often an indication that there's something going wrong with your system drivers or hardware.
