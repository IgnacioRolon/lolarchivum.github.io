I put in a ticket, but I cannot edit it any further since it don't have access to the account, I changed my password, but even when i try and log it and says the \"email, password, or region  cannot verify my account\" regardless of password change I still can't access that account, and it's a little unsafe that riot has the email verification where you don't have to enter the 3 digits on the back for this reason. \r\n\r\nand im a little upset that there isn't any phone support to speed up this process, when you live paycheck to paycheck and then 200 is just missing, Its such a shitty feeling. \r\n\r\nAnyone had a problems like this and are able to share some insight?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T17:42:32.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the account is the one you're posting from, I was unable to find a ticket.
