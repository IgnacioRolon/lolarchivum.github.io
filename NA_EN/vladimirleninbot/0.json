Yes, Co-op vs AI does count as a matchmade game.  That said, you need to read the quest text carefully.  Some tasks can only be completed in Summoner's Rift or other specific game modes.  Custom does not work for this obviously.\n\nBut say the one where you need to place 4 control wards in a matchmade game?  Co-Op vs AI would work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Conphucius","date":"2017-12-04T19:06:11.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=p3VIss7L,comment-id=00010003000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-27T18:41:42.085+0000)\n>\n> If you want a BOT game, create a custom game with 9 other bots.
