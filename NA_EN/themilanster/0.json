However, with this happening, and new artistic ideas being expressed on what we already know and liked about a champion, some skins were modified to follow through with their new themes. By no means am I hating on the riot team, I love the new work they&#039;re doing, but sometimes a new skin rework on a champion makes me not like a specific skin I had purchased for a champion; I cannot be the only one who thinks this sometimes. This brings me to my point, would riot give us the kindness of refunding a skin we have previously purchased on a champion if they have been reworked and we no longer like it, possibly to purchase another skin of that champion if it interests us more? I don&#039;t know if it would cause any trouble considering its not like their giving us our real money back. If possible, maybe give us just a small window of time after release to see if we don&#039;t like the skin anymore and request a refund? just an idea","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-10T17:39:26.693+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey Slver,\n\nUnfortunately, at this time, we're not offering refunds on Champion Updates/skins that fall under the champion update. This was decided beginning with the Karthus VU.\n\nAs mentioned in the [support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884) - Our goal is to level up any outdated visuals or gameplay to make them feel fresh while still retaining what makes them unique as a champion.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the decision, please feel free to check out [this article](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4572524) which better outlines the change, as well as the steps we've taken to be a bit more transparent about what changes may be coming down the pipeline, such as the [Champion Update Schedule](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884#h2).\n\nChampion updates (and changes to the skins) are debuted on PBE before they hit live. Even if you don't have a PBE account, please feel free to voice your feedback, whether it be positive or negative, on the boards. \n\nHope this explains things a bit more. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Artificial Human","date":"2015-08-10T19:00:09.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As mentioned in the [support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884) - Our goal is to level up any outdated visuals or gameplay to make them feel fresh while still retaining what makes them unique as a champion.\n> \n\nThe thing with leveling up any outdated visuals is, that it doesnt work out sometimes and rather serve as a downgrade, just look at the Fiora VU for example. Most of her fanbase demanded a refund because they didnt like how i turned out, she comes especially in my mind because of the Reddit thread that occured instantly, saying that Fiora looks like a 50 year old.\nI play since 2012 and lurk around reddit and on the boards, i care about Riot their players and the relationship of the two and the satisfaction of the players.\n\nI witnessed a lot of Reworks and have skins for most of these champion and the default ends up being very good, but the skins doesnt change that much and look worse than the classic sometimes.\n\nHere is my feeling so far, on witnissing 3 years of reworks.\nMost reworks are hit or miss they turned out nice or end up as a dissapoint.\nThis results in me being afraid to buy skins for these champions, because these skins could get butchered in a rework and lose their value for me and im not getting refunded for that.\n\nIts almost like getting robbed, i buy a skin i like and then it turns unattractive later and i dont get a refund.\nIm losing trust and propably wont buy another skin any time.\n\nI used to buy a lot of skins, but now i've become very picky, having a paysafecard laying around since april incase a skin comes out that could get my attention.The reason for that is that my champions dont get so good skins or no skin at all and that i dislike the 750RP Tier skins.\n\nSorry for bad English","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-08-10T19:14:28.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That being said, is there a possibility to remove Royal Guard Fiora's long white boots?
