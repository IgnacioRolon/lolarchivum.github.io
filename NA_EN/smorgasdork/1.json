Whether it be nachos, hot dogs, or 5 layer dip, you want to have your munchies quelled as the enemy Le Blanc gets Q, E, W&#039;ed to her demise. In Runeterra the best place for bit sized anything is Bandle City, home of the Yordles and some of our favorite maniacs... errr ... champions. \r\n\r\nOur first Worlds app will be brought to you by the one and only Teemo, using his ultimate to create the world&#039;s best mushroom popper. I highly recommend you try it out for yourself this October.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-10-01T00:11:40.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, are you TRYING to kill me!?!?\n\n(Also I showed this to my cousin.

From all the stories that I see on the Riot Games LinkedIn page, I can only imagine it's always hair-on-fire busy in the building. I'll see if I can come up with something cooler in the kitchen to solve that. :P\n\nThey are definitely a staple snack for my upcoming Worlds party, that's for sure. I actually would grab a bunch just before I'd go on a hike. I think next time I'll make a honey wheat dough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schutzstaffa","date":"2015-10-01T00:39:18.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Im trying to currently get my 1000th win with a rioter today on my 18th birthday  and was wondering if you or any other rioter would join me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-10-01T00:11:00.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i made one and got food poisiong :/{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
