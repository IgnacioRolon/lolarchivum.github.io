Word to the wise - don't think that bigger is automatically bigger, and try to make cake pops as large as a tangerine - they become too unstable to easily coat in chocolate.

Have you considered making the icing red or using a red velvet cake recipe instead? His standard bombs just have so much red, I think they might be more iconic if you tied in the red coloring.\nRegardless, chocolate bombs=delicious.","replies":[{"poster":"Smorgasdork","date":"2015-08-29T23:44:37.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely considered it, but I was out of food coloring otherwise I would have made white and red frosting so I could paint it like one of his bombs. I didn't want to do red velvet cake because I like making mix from scratch, and making a cinna-cocao cake base was awesome!
