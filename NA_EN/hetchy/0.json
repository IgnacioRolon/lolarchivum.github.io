Ward-themed desktop lamp or nightlight. For instance, a functioning Starcall Ward or Luminosity Ward (or any ward skin).\n\n2.) Pins. Insignia pins with factions/Riot logo/champion-specific imagery (a Poro, Soraka crescent moon, Solari symbol, Teemo 'shroom).\n\n3.) Toys. Heimerdinger turret with lazer noises and lights. Rammus toy that somehow rolls. Poseable Baron, wing-flapping action Dragon. Stuff like that.\n\n4.) All pointy hats. Sorceress Lux, Veigar Graybeard (et al), Dragonwing Corki, etc...\n\n5.) Tub o' Zac: Cannister with green ooze, labeled with Zaun Laboratories insignia or something.\n\n6.) More Soraka stuff. Lots of Soraka stuff. Soraka.\n\n7.) Scaled-down weapon replicas. Soraka staff, Lux wand, pretty much any weapon.\n\nWhat else guys?","replies":[]}
