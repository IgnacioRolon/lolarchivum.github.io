You only look on those who makes you laugh by doing dumb shits in their videos &amp; streams, or that you only look at those Plats &amp; above who thinks they still deserve a 2nd chance (_or make that 3 chances including chat restrictions &amp; 14 days suspension_).\n\nThis is typically why **I do not support any of these streamers who thinks they deserved to be unbanned**. Everyone is still given the same punishment treatment, no matter famous or not. I wasn't even pissed about Dunkey who stopped making his League videos, that's his decision. He was just butthurt that he received justice about what he said.\n\nTbh, I'm still currently a fan of Sky Williams (_who's a friend of Dunkey_) and I still watch his videos. But of course if there's one day he has suddenly got a suspension/permaban &amp; will not post any League videos ever, I have no rights to complain about it. He deserved the punishment like any other ordinary players would have.  I'm also a fan of C9 and I liked watching almost every of their LCS matches, and I never complained about the time where Hai was pointing the middle finger at Ferbiven for making a bad remark on C9. He deserved the punishment too for doing that one unsportsmanlike action.\n\n-------\n\nSo seriously, dear Tyler1 fanboys. Tone down your blonde girl attitude &amp; admit the deserved punishment Tyler1 has. 15+ chances of reforming, and that says enough.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-04-30T04:48:16.893+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"yah it's right but i kinda feel bad for dunky tho. i guess some people are more sensitive than others.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfenstin","date":"2016-04-30T05:20:17.337+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":5,"body":"He doesn't need sympathy.

It's like when someone kills because of song lyrics. The band can't control what their fans do, how could gross gore?

The reason Dunky gets as much attention as he does is because he fully embraced his toxic behavior.
