You could always spam so many roots with him in lane but it didn't matter because it was only 0.75 seconds. Now it's ranked up to 1.5 and you can't move while Ryze keeps being Ryze. So yeah.

Same for the off-meta jungler: If he doesn't have an extreme strength, then he may not have enough to take advantage of to make up for his weaknesses. Then there's the sudden lane switches I sometimes see. But they only work if both people can handle the lane they're walking into.

It pretty much zones any melee laner that isn't tanky or doesn't have sustain.  It is also very strong against ranged champions as it forces them to avoid their own minions or take a pretty massive amount of damage.
