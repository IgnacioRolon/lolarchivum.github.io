{"poster":"Devoidicus","date":"2016-12-12T23:13:06.419+0000","title":"Leave Bustered Because of Bug","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to the recent disconnecting bug I was forcibly booted from ranked matches two times about a day ago. I was unable to reconnect no matter what I did. I filed two bugsplat reports, one for each crash when they occurred. I now have 20 minute queue penalties because the game is bugged. If this could be undone I would be grateful, but if someone at Riot Games could gett back to me or post on or about this at all, it would be much appreciated.\n\nI specifically tried re-logging in both instances, and reconnecting with the reconnect button. No matter what I did the reconnect would simply crash the client, and I would go back to the bugsplat screen. I have since patched the client but due to being unaware if the issue is still there (and the annoying leaverbuster penalty) I have not since tried playing, as if the problem persists my account will probably continue to receive penalties because of the bugout problem that I have no control over.\n\n\n(EDIT 12/14/16) So as of now I have tried about half of what is on the Riot support page for crashing linked here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#section-windows \n\nI have not had any luck thus far in actually launching the game without crashing before it gets to the load screen. My hardware has not changed. Nor the software or the monitor. At this point I am becoming increasingly sure that the problem is with the game and not with my computer. I have patched the launcher, so its not just my copy of the game. Someone else has posted on this thread other than the Riot employee who responded, and both our posts as well as related posts on the forum page for help, have been thumbed up telling me I am not alone in this problem. I have received ANOTHER 5 game penalty queue for this bullshit because after running all of these repairs on the client, downloading multiple recommended programs, and toggling settings on my pc, the game continues to crash just before the load screen appears post lobby. I suppose there really isn't anything else to say other than RIOT fix your game. \n\nI'm not sure if anyone else will respond to this post from RIOT games, but if they happen to read this post I'm sure it would help some people out if you looked into potential causes other than users specs.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T05:43:55.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bug that you're referencing is not related in any way to Bugsplats.

I didn't even have bugsplats before new season started though I have had installed new UI since it became available. All the suddenly I start getting bugsplats once new season begun and it happens almost every 2nd game.","replies":[]}]}]}
