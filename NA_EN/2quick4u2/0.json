Zed&#039;s only good build is {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3036}}. The problem here is, Black Cleaver&#039;s smaller items are useless so you are really weak until you complete it and Black Cleaver has a stacking armor penetration but as Zed, if you don&#039;t deal enough damage with your W+E+2Q combo you won&#039;t kill him. So you can&#039;t use Black Cleaver that good. Other option would be transcendence with 30% cdr but then you can&#039;t take triumph which is really good on zed and you will have 30% cdr unless you don&#039;t buy a 10%cdr item which isn&#039;t optimal in most cases. Problem with the zed&#039;s opponents itemization is if they are AP they can buy seeker&#039;s armguard which is 45 armor with full stacks, (stopwatch which counters zed&#039;s all kit) and then upgrade it to Zhonya&#039;s for a really low price. That will reduce Zed&#039;s damage output significantly even though he is 1 level higher than this ap champion. If this AP champion also takes 10 armor runes, it is really hard for Zed to do anything.\n\nLLStylish talks about the pre-season article that riot wrote, saying that assassins are hard to balance for example if Rengar gets fed he can one-shot anyone and carry the game, but if he falls behind he will be useless. LLStylish&#039;s asks if a Jax gets really fed, can he not do those things and carry the game as well? Except he wouldn&#039;t be useless if he falls behind since he has his stun and scaling. Assassins, who don&#039;t usually have any crowd control ability, can&#039;t be useful like Jax if they fall behind. The other difference is that bruisers have a lot more items to pick from, that are way more gold efficient than assassin&#039;s (mentioned in the video) but Zed, for example, can only buy the items I mentioned above.\n\nThe last point I want to make is Zed&#039;s early, mid and late game. Since Zed is an assassin you would expect him to have average early, good mid and bad late game win rate. According to champion.gg Zed has a:\n50% win rate in 0-20 minutes\n45,67% wr in 20-25 minutes\n47,66% wr in 25-30 minutes\n49,43% wr in 30-40 minutes\n51,63% wr in 40+\nSo he has more win rate the longer the game goes on. The reason behind that is like LLStylish said, Zed isn&#039;t a champion before he completes his {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3036}}. I think an assassin who isn&#039;t that strong until 30 minutes is a bit weird.\n\nI think Zed needs a buff, Lacaration has already written what type of buffs zed could get. \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/HIiJwgkc-possible-ways-to-fix-zed\n\nand this is Faker saying &quot;Zed is crap&quot;.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6HbPBE9Hmk\n\nps: sorry for my bad English","replies":[{"poster":"A7X Kindred","date":"2018-12-06T17:57:35.312+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":11,"body":"Oh boy here we go again, Mage players will come and downvote this into oblivion and then rant about how zed is broken and stuff, Zed mains will give them facts and info about how he's not broken, mage players will ignore and instead point out that Zed has Maw to counter AP (which btw sucks).\n\nThey will then call their best friends the ad mains to downvote this as well, after a few days this thread will be filled with comments about a Zed being broken and not having any counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Nevrankroaton","date":"2018-12-07T06:23:06.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to have some talk about Zed being an energy champion tho, because his longer W CD is also link to the fact it is a free \"I make a choice\" gap closer or escape that allow him to enlarge his Q range and make him able to proc eletrocute extremely quickly.\nAdd to that it is about energy, that he can use his Q to safely take cs or try to 'poke', that he has extremely good tool to farm/power farm, etc.\n\nI don't want his W to be reduced early, by NO mean. Zed should be a skillfull character and if you want a lower W CD, you max it second or you just accept it. He is what an assassin with an escape/gap closer should be, be 'punished' and have a down time so you can punish or organize a gank.\n\nIt is true that Zed maybe doesn't snowball as hard as some other top tiers assassin (*cough* Leblanc *cough*) but again it is what make assassin so frustrating by itself is them being slightly ahead and being allowed to be such a threat.\n\nAlso Zed can itemise with more flexibility than people want to say, he has some core items but he can always build defensive boots + a hexdrinker against AP midlaner.\n\nI rather give some power to laning Zed, like some better health regen, so he can have a better time managing his life and not be punished too much while making sure his killing power doesn't increase early.\nMaybe buff his mid game a little? Either better ult stat or maybe better AD/lvl?","replies":[{"poster":"Fire Blaustoise","date":"2018-12-07T18:30:56.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">It is true that Zed maybe doesn't snowball as hard as some other top tiers assassin \n\nAssassins arent  even good atm (midlaners).

Legitimately doesnt really do anything except roam unless you pick bad fights against him, all he does is farm and roam until later where he looks to make picks or do followup,,,,,not really a playmaker in any sense and his old kit also lacks counterplay later on at least he has a sufficiently weak early/mid for it to be alright, like he cant kill anything unless they screw up a lot. \n\n\nAkali?

Similar to kassa in a sense that he wont do anything particular up to 6 but after that he will take any chance at all to just jump in, land hits in under a second then jump around once or twice while waiting for you to die, his poke is also by far the one that lacks counterplay the most since it both hurts and has massive range unless you stack armor, and while he is weaker without his W at the same time he can just do it twice and then go ham and get a kill so what does it matter?\n\n\nWhile i think Akali might still be slightly overtuned and her \"true stealth\" is obnoxious she does at least have clear windows of weaknesses where she can be punished, and even several of them in a drawn out fight which makes dealing with her far more pleasing than with Zed who you either throw a stun or something to that effect the moment he ults behind you or you die, straight up die.\n\nOr you Zhonya and explode anyway the moment you come out of it unless he´s diving balls deep 1v5. \n\nAkali?

His poke pattern is fine and it most certainly has counterplay, you can't get any more counterplay than the brunt of the poke being 2 linear skillshots.\n\nKass is relevant from level 6 onward, both in lane and in roams, his potency in lane with all the buffs he got in s8 made him have greater agency earlier, he comes online too early for how well he scales and he has much less counterplay than Zed. \n\nAkali has obscurity as a strength to offset her particularly weak poke pattern, her disengage/re-engage play pattern is notably powerful and allows a competent Akali to execute more than one person at a time, but she does have sufficient counterplay outside of her W for sure, unpopular opinion around here but I think if Akali W became a stealth like her old one and power were more evenly distributed amongst her kit, she'd be the best designed assassin by miles. \n\nZed can all-in at level 4 in some lanes, he doesn't strictly have to wait until level 6 to all-in. Kassadin actually has a level 2 cheese but it's pretty hard to do and requires flash. These champs aren't bound to the level 6 spike, however you need to be exceptional at both to get their full potential out of course. Zed killing you at 6 is probably gonna take 2-3 Qs depending on your hp, an E weaved into the combo, an auto to proc passive and ignite + R of course. I'd say if you couldn't dodge any of his skillshots, you couldn't cc a single part of his all in or in worst case scenario, didn't flash his combo if it was up, he deserves to kill you. What would an assassin do if it couldn't even kill people? His poke as I stated before doesn't lack counterplay, it doesn't outrange a fair number of mages and it includes 2 skillshots. Play around the 22 second cd of his W so he has to think more carefully about just throwing it down to poke you all the time with no repercussions. \n\nAkali doesn't seem overtuned to me anymore tbh, as I said previously I'd like her W to lose power so she could have better power budget elsewhere, but we'll see if Riot do that when they do the kit work to her that they stated they will. Yes she is punishable when her R is used or when her W goes down, Zed is punishable when his W goes down and when his R has been expended. Both will straight up kill someone when used by a good assassin player anyway. \n\nZhonya shits on Zed pretty hard I gotta be honest with you. \n\nZed R can be abused by his opponent, you can flash him into a turret or your team to get cc'ed just like you can with Akali E, her E also throws her out of the passive ring so she gets a passive proc if it hits you. Zed reliance on his ultimate can be punished, his long escape cd can be punished, his bad AoE can certainly be punished and where his R positions him when he materialises never changes so that, too, can be punished. \n\nZed needs buffing as of current however he is not the only assassin who needs buffs. His kit is fine and in my opinion he is one of the best assassin designs Riot ever put out with clear strengths, weaknesses and sufficient counterplay. I respect not everyone will agree with me and that's okay, too.","replies":[{"poster":"2quick4u2","date":"2018-12-07T17:52:50.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do make really valid points.

Similar to kassa in a sense that he wont do anything particular up to 6 but after that he will take any chance at all to just jump in, land hits in under a second then jump around once or twice while waiting for you to die, his poke is also by far the one that lacks counterplay the most since it both hurts and has massive range unless you stack armor, and while he is weaker without his W at the same time he can just do it twice and then go ham and get a kill so what does it matter?\n\nThe real issue here, isnt Zed, its YOUR laning.\n\n\n>Or you Zhonya and explode anyway the moment you come out of it unless he´s diving balls deep 1v5.\n\ni would like seeing this in decent elo.\n\n\n>Zed´s kit has aged poorly and needs a akali level rework where he has multiple windows of counterplay to justify any kind of greater power pumped into it, because as it is now he will always either be useless or broken in high elo no matter what small changes go through.\n\nno.

If the Zed isnt doing this in your elo then are they just farming and never fighting their targets once they start building against him? \n\n\n> no. He&#x27;s in this state cause riot powercreeped mages and nerfed the sh*t out assassins items. And they added this sh*t {{item:2419}}\n\nPowercreeped mages? What the actual fk?\n\nMages has had literally everything nerfed, over and over and over, waveclear, mana, AP and even their runes, the only buff i can even recall in the last 2 seasons was to liandry because they were too shit against tanks and health stackers.  \n\nPowercreep has happened but not to the mages, rather the main ones are marksmen, supports, tanks (pre tons of nerfs) and now the main ones are the fighters like Jax/irelia/aatrox. \n\nAnd stopwatch? Are you serious?\n\nPeople in solo lanes hit lvl 6 around 6-7 minutes into the game,.........and stopwatch can only be used once. \n\nSure, it was broken when it was first added having almost no delay but by now its nothing?\n\nHells even if a mage uses perfect timing for the free stopwatch that doesnt even activate until 10 minutes, and even with the item CDR it gives Zed can still ult at least once before it comes back up, later on he can ult twice. \n\nLets be objective, Zed is an assassin,his job is to delete carries and he comes into power early on into the game, his main way to do this is to ult them, use abilities then run away. \n\nSo what happens if Zed can delete carries with his combo? He succeeds and is useful and probably helps his team win.\n\nWhat happens if his combo doesnt work for whatever reason or he is prevented from even performing it? He is shit, maybe even  utter and completely useless stinking shit.\n\nThis is what i mean, Zed is a massive hit or miss champ that can only ever be useful or useless.\n\nThe reason Akali is by far better than him is that even if she fails to kill her target on her own she can still provide a massive threat and zoning with her shroud, this partially goes for kassadin as well given that his combo has a much shorter cooldown later on meaning he can go in and out of a fight as well. \n\nTalon has the exact same issue as Zed, either he works and he is great or he doesnt and he is terrible.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MissMikasa","date":"2018-12-06T17:45:09.440+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":21,"body":"No. He's not weak.
