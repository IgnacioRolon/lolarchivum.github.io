Downsides, the cooldown for the ability is doubled and not affected by CD reduction or levels in that ability. Pro sides, can be used for sick outplays and the 2nd cast does not require any mana.

You can't even say stuff like \"50% less damage\" because who gives a sh*t if my Morgana Q only does half the damage, that's not why I used it in the first place. And if you just add more rules like \"50% less healing\" \"50% less cc duration\" \"50% less buff duration\" etc. then what's the point in taking it? Might as well take Electrocute again, or Aery.\n\nWhat I dont understand is how the cooldown works. So you have double the level 1 cooldown of the ability, this cooldown is fix and nothing can change that. To compensate that, you can cast the ability a second time during it's cooldown.\n\nSo you have double the cd but can cast it twice.\nThe only upside is being able to cast the 2nd cast whenever you want during the active cooldown.\nHowever, to do this you loose out on a LOT of cooldown, if you choose something like Blitz Q, Camille E or Zoe E plus the 2nd cast is going to be weaker?\nAnd what happens if I pick let's say Ahri Q. The cooldown will be somewhere around 16 to 20 seconds I think so let's just go with 20. Can I now cast Q, wait for 19.5 seconds, cast Q again, wait for the last .5 seconds, cast Q again, with that starting the cd again and cast Q a third time?\n\nI really need an explanation for the cooldown thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-07-31T01:28:26.168+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:7}}  shenanigans \n\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2018-07-31T19:08:39.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are like a hundred abusable spells with this, why the hell is it being upvoted? \n\nWho wants to lane against LB with a double cast q, Talon with a ranged q + crit q, Ahri with double orbs on a charm, Orianna immediate ball repositions for R's, Malza-press R TWICE, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-07-31T18:49:54.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What an ultimately broken idea lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-07-31T15:16:04.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds utterly horrible and would be a balancing nightmare.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-30T19:48:36.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grossly overpowered and hilariously broken on some champs.
