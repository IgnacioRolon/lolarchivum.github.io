If it were a cross, star of david, star and crescent, or any other iconic religious symbol you may have a point. Considering that 666 isn't even demonic according to scholarly christian doctrine, I would be more offended with Rito associating it with a demonic skin than Ritos supposed proselytizing.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonakand","date":"2015-10-21T13:17:53.946+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"A demon skin in itself may not be connected to any religion since many if not all religions have some form of demon in them.  That being said 666 is specific to the naming of the beast in Revelation from which all of these religions draw context.  666 is very well known and your very likely to queue with a player with it as part of their name.  Its a tribute to satan specifically and speaks of the enslavement of mankind to a world system controlled by him.  That being said, I can agree that there are other more blatant tributes Nasus-Anubis, infernal nasus-orthus, Azir-Horus, Wu-kong-the Monkey King from Buddisim...etc.  Nonetheless I play lol instead of SMITE, like my friends play, to get away from real world religious connections and I kind of wish they would try to steer clear of such connections...there are plenty of original ideas that they could use.","replies":[{"poster":"Squidsmastah","date":"2015-10-21T21:30:23.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet no fuckin' problem with Kayle and Morgana?","replies":[{"poster":"Jonakand","date":"2015-10-21T22:07:26.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont follow...what about kayle and morgana?

Those angels in those stories have no more real world relevance or significance than Kayle or Morgana.\n\nHonestly, people latching onto 666 as hard as they have is what has made it into a joke. In no way, shape, or form are you going to be required to have Demon Vi in order to buy or sell things in the game, so the context obviously doesn't fit. It a nod to the reference, but only barely.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-10-22T04:04:34.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the idea behind it, here's some context to what he's talking about\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013%3A11-18&version=KJV;NASB","replies":[]},{"poster":"HentRex","date":"2015-10-22T04:10:39.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana is actually part of King Arthur mythos.

Runeterra doesn't really have a unified religion, there are sorta cults (Solari, Lunari, Elise's Vilemaw Fan Club), but it's not a big part of the narrative.
