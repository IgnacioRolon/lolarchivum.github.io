His niche is also \"i dont like melees\" and he punishes melee champions very hard.

Just because he doesn’t have damage reduction doesn’t mean he’s not a tank. If that’s the case, WW is more tank than Maokai, but that just isn’t true.\n\nThe difference is the purpose of the kit. Maokai’s kit is all about locking someone down (and extra jungle vision). His damage is because his numbers are tuned higher due to his Q being a key farming skill and has flat damage and low CD. He also still builds full tank, whereas Galio, a true AP bruiser, actually builds some AP along with tank items. Maokai does not. Damage reduction/defensive steroid doesn’t make someone a tank, it’s just a survivability ability. His kit still says “I’m a tank and you won’t be going anywhere”. Besides, he also has his heal for survivability.\n\n2) Ornn is considered by many to be broken. More OP than broken, really, but still. I’m a mastery 6 Ornn, so I know he’s easy to outplay. He was an ideal tank before the change to %max HP, lower damae, could still farm, bugger focus on his utility and CC. The W damage was what sent him over the edge. That being said....no, he didn’t need an AP ratio. He didn’t need **any** damage buff to his W. His W was already his core skill and offered a lot. His kit was designed to drive players toward the tank build, not a damage build, because, well, need we flashback to full AP Maokai, Malphite, and Amumu?","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-12-14T23:21:16.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ornns w is op. and its only op because the rest of his kit is garbage that riot decided to make his w op to balance it out instead or dealing with actual problems","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2017-12-15T04:07:55.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordGeovanni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=du7jH0vy,comment-id=00060000000000000000000100000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-12-14T23:21:16.804+0000)\n>\n> Ornns w is op. and its only op because the rest of his kit is garbage that riot decided to make his w op to balance it out instead or dealing with actual problems\n\nI won’t disagree.
