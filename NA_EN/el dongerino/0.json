If you can show dominance on your pick it will greatly help the picks we can choose. The rank is between P3 - D4. The end goal is to be able to swap 2 players with strong picks around the mid and top to confuse and mind game the enemy. The team is part of a league so you will get weekly games, I just ask that you show up to those games and practice with the team once a week. If you are interested add me on League.\r\n\r\nAlso, the style I hope to achieve with this team is a 1-4 or 1-3-1. So this is for all of those of you that like to split, not to discredit tank players because you are valuable in the 1-4s.\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"BimBIm","date":"2018-11-03T17:38:53.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm interested, Summoner name is BimBim, I'm currently p3 and my champ pool is pretty big.","replies":[]}]}
