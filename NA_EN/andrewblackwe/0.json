I usually like to start my game out by TPing and sitting in middle of lane until level 3. Once I've hit level 3 the enemy has pushed past me and I can do a lot of damage and burn summoner spells. Well since \"Remaking\" has started the game has counted me AFK even though I ping and chat. Then my team, even though I ask them not to, votes to \"Remake\" and the game gives 5 people the option to vote, but does not count my vote. This results in the \"Remake\" happening, and then I lose like 18-20 LP. It's already happened 3 times today, and I shouldn't have to change my gameplay strategy just because the AFK detection is messed up. Can we please get this fixed because it really sucks dropping almost 100 LP because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Spellvamp Garen","date":"2016-09-13T09:33:28.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly? This sounds like a TERRIBLE strategy. \n\nYou are losing a lot of cs gold by stealthing and waiting till level 3. Instead, I suggest hiding in lane slightly ahead of where the creeps will meet. Wait there until your opponent is busy last hitting mobs and has them targeted and is inside the creep wave. Then you pounce on him with aa's and there's a good chance he'll get stuck running away in the minion wave. \n\nFrom there, you either ignite to kill (works amazing on karthus) or you just take control of the lane and control the creep waves. Don't let him come to last hit without taking an auto attack. That way you can dominate the lane and win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T21:40:47.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may help to explain your strategy to your team before you head to lane. Alternatively, you can hide in a bush and move around occasionally. The last option I can think of is to save this strat for matches with a premade.\n\nTo give you a quick rundown on how the [/Remake System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) works, it flags any player who is inactive for 90 seconds or more within the first 3 minutes of the match. If a player is flagged, the remake will become available at 3:00.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"andrewblackwe","date":"2016-09-12T22:28:26.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the definition of \"inactive\"?

Not just in mid.  I've gone to the enemy jungle and sat waiting to steal blue.  Right after stealing it and killing the jungler, the game ends and said \"Leaver (remake)\".  The problem is that many people hate Teemo and will screw over players purposely even if the Teemo player has a legit reason for standing still.\n\nThe way to fix this would be to send a warning to the player and at least allow him a 5 sec window to move or something.  Yeah, it may get him killed and screw his strategy and possibly even his team, but if players want to screw over one teammate then they deserve what they get.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GerAvos","date":"2016-09-14T09:03:51.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you even tp into the middle of lane unless the minions are in the lane?
