Paired with Nullifying Orb which gives 64 magic damage shield +15% of bonus ad. Combined this is about 220 effective health vs an AP mage. So you're getting 20 AD 35 MR and 220 health for 1300 gold. NOw lets compare this to mage defensive equivalent. \n\nSeekers Armguard is 1100 gold gives you 20 AP 30 Armor and you have to stack it up to get the bonus 15 ap and armor so its definately not ready for the level 6 you'll still be stacking it. but most importantly you get no Health from it. even if you spent 400 gold on a ruby crystal you only get 150 health for a total (combined with armguard) of 1500 gold and it still isnt even as efficient as hexdrinker (Not to mention by the time you have farmed up 400 more gold for the ruby crystal the hexdrinker will have already scaled up to an even stronger shield because the magic shield scales up to about 280). This is a huge problem  and it needs to be addressed. Hexdrinker is farrr too strong of an item and either needs to be nerfed or Armguard needs to be buffed significantly.\n\nI think Seekers Armguard should give the stopwatch passive and just remove stopwatch entirely. Make Seekers ARmguard cost 1300 gold and maybe remove some of the stacking stats and give it a 1 second zhonyas effect on a 60 second cooldown.

We can't have a discussion derailed because it is founded on flat out false information. \n\n> maybe you missed the fact that it's damn permanent and not just a triggered effect with a 90 seconds cooldown?\n\nI didn't miss it, it wasn't what the previous poster commented on. They said that the items gave the same gold efficiency, which they do not. I wasn't making the case about perminant vs windowed power, only that the given statement was not true. \n\nThat 6% difference is a big deal. For 200 more gold investment you get 415 more gold value stats. A 6% difference in gold efficiency is effectively giving 215 gold value above and beyond what seekers gives even after it is fully stacked, and is available imediatly. That's more than two waves worth of minions in gold value. When you frame it in terms of actual gold value it shows how big a deal that is. Two waves of minions is not a rounding difference. \n\n> I talked about why direct comparison between the two items is silly,\n\nExcept it isn't, because in the matchup this is the relative tempo comparison to their early items. How the classes match up against each other when they share a lane is a perfectly reasonable comparison to make. \n\n> seeker's is far better than people paint it.\n\nSeekers is strong and underrated don't get me wrong, but hexdrinker is just stronger in its situation.

If you consider this \"verifiably false\" and outright \"lying\", you're the one degrading our ability to have a reasonable approximation.\n\n> I didn't miss it, it wasn't what the previous poster commented on.\n\nYes it was, it's right there in their post: \"your Seeker's is **now** just as cost effective as Hexdrinker **during its 5 second shield.**\" THEY were making the point about permanent vs windowed power, and it's an important part of their argument, which **justify** the slight approximation\n\n> That 6% difference is a big deal. For 200 more gold investment you get 415 more gold value stats.\n\nBullshit, that's not how maths work. That 6% means that for the first 1100 gold spent on hexdrinker, you get 1757 worth of stats, which is 96 more than with Seeker's rate. And then for the 200 next gold spent on hexdrinker, you get 319 worth, which is 17 more than with Seeker's rate.\nYou took the value of that 6% difference over the whole item and attributed it to just the 200 last gold, that's the first bullshit. The second bullshit is that you neglected that Seeker's rate is greater than 100% too, so if you spent 200 more gold at Seeker's rate, you'd get more than 200, namely 302 which is 17 less than Hexdrinker.\nSo, a more honest way to put it is that that 6% difference means you get, at best, 96+17 = 113, and not 215, more gold worth of stats with Hexdrinker. (I say \"at best\" because it's assuming that after buying Seeker, your next 200 gold will be spent at Seeker's rate again, which is probably undervaluing it.) But yeah, that's half the figure you arrived at.\n\n**And to top it off, I just realized that you conveniently took the value at Level 18. Which is a) irrelevant, b) definitely not \"immediately available\" when you buy the item, and c) not what everyone else in this thread did. Even OP themself took the value at Lvl6, and since Barklius was talking about stacking it, it's obvious he was also talking about laning phase. So let's generously take the value at Lvl10, and oh wonder, Hexdrinker is only 141% gold-efficient, which makes indeed Seeker \"just as cost effective after farming 2 minutes\", NOT EVEN with a 6% approximation.**\n\n> in the matchup this is the relative tempo comparison to their early items.\n\nHighly questionable. The AD probably delayed his Dusk/Ghostblade by 1300 g, while the AP's probably rushing a Zhonya anyway. And guess what has a better rate between a full item and two mid-tiers components? So if you want to talk about tempo, the point goes to Seeker, not to Hexdrinker.\n\n_____\n\nAt this point, I'd like to ask again: who is \"degrading our ability to have reasonable conversations\", hmm?","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-05-16T16:16:37.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2018-05-16T19:43:54.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> *<Removed by Moderation>*\n\nOk I was trying to be polite, but you really are a fuckhead\n\n**Hexdrinker shield at level 9, approximately when Seeker's would be maxed: 190**\n\nGold/ point of health: 2.6667\n\n2.6667 * 190 = 506\n\n1330 from Hexdrinker base stats + 506= 1836\n\nSeeker's full stacked = 1661\n\n1661/1100 = 151% efficiency\n\n1836/1300 = 141% efficiency\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWKB1Zxg84s","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-05-18T21:49:17.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So heh, while I go fuck myself, why don't you reply to the other 2 comments here pointing out the values at a more realistic Level?

If I'm literally 10/0 I expect to kill at least one enemy. If literally 0/7 support with 2/3 ADC can stop me from doing it by just brainlessly clicking 2 buttons then something is wrong. This is why there is no solo carrying. If fed assassin can be stopped so easily with no skill expression by bot lane who is behind. And people like you supporting that state of the game just make things worse because riot is less eager to change that. Now they put some changes but it's just barely a grain of sand on the dessert. They need to bring back solo carrying back from s3/s4","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2018-05-16T14:58:29.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"HMMMM\n\nS3 + S4 was an assassin meta\n\nSeems I found ~~The butthurt assassin main~~ why you think Assassins shoulda been made stronger","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-05-16T15:21:07.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"S3 and S4 needed just few tweaks to certain assassin to make them less oppresive and we would have most of the champions balanced. Do you know why its better to have assassin meta than the sht we have now? Because its literally impossible to make any plays and carry. At least during assassin meta even when assassin was fed you could stop him and collapse him with team effort. Now it takes one button click to deny a fed assassin any kill. And btw.
