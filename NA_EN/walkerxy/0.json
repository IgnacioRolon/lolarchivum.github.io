I have a multitude of reasons as to why but that is not directly important due to the fact i know many people do want this system added to the client. However i think forcing everyone to have it just added to there client and have to deal with it and learn to fuck around with settings is wrong. I am computer inept, i didn&#039;t know how to mute text chat for the first like 6 months of playing this game. So i do not want to have to deal with screwing with voice chat settings everygame.\r\nOther then this I personally never want to talk in voice to teammates i do not personally know, and my friends i play with we use outside chats such as discord to talk privately. This is by far the easiest way to go. Let players who play together use other chat services and if you do not play with someone you do not need to hear them and i sure as hell don&#039;t want them hearing me just because theres a built in system. \r\nI think a good solution for this would be to make the voice chat you want on the client to be an optional add on. Don&#039;t force everyone to automatically get it in a patch and have to deal with the aftermath of having to learn it&#039;s functionality that might frankly be a game ruining function for me. Make it so that when its realeased players can choose to install it or not. This way players who find it bad like me do not have to use it or learn how to mute themselves and everyone else in everygame thats just teadious and annoying for us. \r\nA voice chat adds nothing to game depth but adds everything to game frustration for players who dont like it.","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheSideKick","date":"2017-06-01T00:05:21.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"this \"i don't want it\" needs to stop\n\nit will be in game no matter what at this point get over it\nthere will be options to mute people and listen in without talking yourself I'm sure just like many other games with voice chat, probably have a press a button to talk feature and a way to mute people as well\n\nover all it will help every one. so get over it. its coming","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-01T00:20:07.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People said the same thing with dynamic queue, \"it's here to stay, get over it\". Even Riot explicitly said several times solo queue wouldn't come back.  And now it's gone and solo queue is back. Nothing is set on stone, there's no reason to give up, specially when it hasn't even been implemented yet. They can always realize it's a bad idea, and even afterwards if it's ever implemented, they can go back on it.\n\nGet over it if you want, I won't.","replies":[]}]}]}
