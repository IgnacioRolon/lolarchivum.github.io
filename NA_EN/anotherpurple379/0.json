The pair were then resurrected and turned against their allies -- a change Xayah seems almost happy about. Blaming the Star Guardians for abandoning her to die, she has taken a bitter, personal stand against them, even as doubts begin to creep in...\"\n\n**SG Zoe:**\n\n\"A member of the ancient, first group of Star Guardians, Zoe’s heart desired not love, but chaos -- twisting her newfound power into a malignant expression of cosmic madness. After numberless eons of hunting the First Star’s chosen, she has finally come to Valoran City, hoping to destroy the latest generation of Guardians as she has countless others.\"\n\nI'm not sure if these are their official skin bios, but the way they're worded seems to hint towards it.\n\nRakan and Neeko also have short lore blurbs, but they don't reveal much at all except the very basics.\n\n**SG Rakan:**\n\n\"Star Guardian Rakan is here to bring darkness to the Universe. And get some new hair gel!\"\n\n**SG Neeko:**\n\n\"Star Guardian Neeko has descended from the stars to come to the Star Guardians aid! Will she be able to defeat the likes of Star Guardian Zoe?\"\n\nI may edit if more lore is added or changed in the PBE. Feel free to start theorizing...\n\n***EDIT:*** Rakan's and Neeko's official bios have been added to the PBE!\n\n**SG Rakan:**\n\n\"Many years ago, Rakan was destroyed in the fight against Zoe, alongside his lover Xayah. The pair were then resurrected and turned against their allies -- a fact Rakan seems keenly aware of. Biding his time to strike, he has a plan to purify the darkness from Xayah's heart... though the price may be losing himself to evil forever.\"\n\n**SG Neeko:**\n\n\"A member of Miss Fortune's original team of Star Guardians, Neeko watched her teammates fall against Zoe's dark powers, going into hiding when she, too, was thought dead. Revealing herself to the newly assembled Star Guardians at the eve of their greatest battle, the wide-eyed adventurer has vowed that this time, she won't run.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-12-18T03:25:37.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Spooky when long dead threads come back from the grave!\n\nWhile the art of thread necromancy can be useful in some cases, this unfortunately, is not one of those times.

So that settles that. For now, at least.

There is something I want to bring everyone's attention to, so bear with me. I'm sure we all know that each Star Guardian (pure or corrupted) has a \"gem\" that represents them, and you can see such gems adorned on their outfits, and consider that there are no familiars that possess such gems *except* Ran (Zoe's familiar). Now I can't help but wonder, why? Why is Ran so different as to actually have a gem that is seemingly reserved the the guardians themselves? What makes Ran so special? Perhaps there's some unique connection between Zoe and Ran that would explain that.\n\nIt's my theory that Ran is somehow essential to Zoe's corruption (maybe being the reason for it, or a result of it), possibly helping to maintain her corrupt state, and even influencing or controlling her to an extent.\n\nFood for thought, anyway.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"RainebowKitty","date":"2019-08-29T21:14:29.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh!

Perhaps I'm just looking into it the way I want it to be, but still, Zoe isn't chaotic to the point she'd fight for evil because of it. Either that description is missing something, or Riot just had a different vision, or perhaps they shortened it down so that it didn't give too much away.\n\n I'd say that Zoe was definitely one of the first Star Guardians, and if she had her ability to create portals, which I'm assuming she did since it'd make her unique to the group since no other Guardian we know of has ever had that power, then I'd say her curious nature allowed her to wander off. Upon wandering off to some other dimension, the dark matter Xayah describes in her voice lines then corrupted her. She'd be one of the first Star Guardians, but also the very first corrupted one.\n\nIf this were my decision, she'd get slightly corrupted, not think much of it, then just hide it from her team even as it progressively got worse. Eventually she'd stop being a source of light and laughter and instead become someone her Guardian comrades would be uneasy around. As her personality shifts from the quirky, energetic trickster we all know her to be, she'd become more twisted until it was impossible to tell if she was fighting to keep her Star Guardian oath, or simply to amuse herself. Her team would confront her, and she'd probably kill them all and move on. \n\nFrom then on, she'd be further corrupted, and eventually get to the point we see her at today. No one knows if she can be saved or not, but if she could be, that could add ideas for SG generation 4. Plus, we'd get a happy ending until new conflict arises, because I believe it's safe to say if Zoe's reign of terror can be cleansed, Xayah and Rakan can definitely be purified too. \n\nAnyway, here's my ideas for gen 4. Imagine a select few Guardians who have faced Zoe before and miraculously survived get together. After losing their teammates, they forge a new team with each other and vow to destroy the very thing that tried to destroy them. They wouldn't believe Zoe was truly, finally good since they know of her trickster nature, and they'd stop at nothing to destroy her. It could add a very interesting Guardian vs Guardian theme to the universe, but without the evilness factor since these individuals would truly believe they are doing the right thing. \n\nBut seriously, think about it. Dark matter also doesn't seem very off from void corruption. If it can be destroyed... Well, I'll leave you to your thoughts on that. \n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-08-28T11:10:26.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot really should change the names of zoe,rakan and zayah since they're not star guardians.","replies":[{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-08-29T06:40:03.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I heavily agree.
