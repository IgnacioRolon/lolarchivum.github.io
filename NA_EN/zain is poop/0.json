In teamfights, the screen often totally freezes, requiring me to \"alt+tab\" out of the game, and then click back in to load it again. This is quite an old issue, and Riot said that they fixed it (http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/jT9W0Jc1-16-04-16-update-on-mac-performance-issue), but I'm still having significant issues. Apparently, it helps if you turn in game sound off, but that didn't help either. I'm sure my computer's hardware is powerful enough to handle this game, as this is a new computer, so I would like to get to the bottom of this.\r\n\r\nAn example of what my screen looks like when it freezes: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=e6e359dc42&amp;view=fimg&amp;th=15a73ebc14356d70&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=15a73ebb5bdb8b910221&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ8tBNbrnW8MpD4AshMqmbzjWm66wTE92VwLNAIFW9EI3qSheiWRNTGX3YGqHcYR8CuyD21Qn-ikuPIqEyFNA-j0kR4TV7ENdtnjzlijrBhCST4OvuLOBY9o4os&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;ats=1488003521021&amp;rm=15a73ebc14356d70&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T22:58:49.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The specific issues listed in the post by **Riot Eambo**have since been resolved.

I am also getting screen freezing issues in-game. No general FPS troubles, of course, as the computer is plenty powerful to run this game on full settings without spinning the fans up to more than 50%.\n\n(Too bad the game UI doesn't support full retina resolution, it would be nice for everything not to be blurry all the time...)\n\nCmd+tabbing out and back in fixes it. Sound still plays while the screen is frozen. You can still interact with the game, too. You can move your champ, kill enemies (if you are lucky enough to click in the right place!), interact with menus, etc. It just doesn't render past the stuck frame.\n\nThis is a new issue, only with the newest Macbook Pro (that I know of). My old 2012 MBP never had this issue.\n\n@Targons Blade... I highly doubt this is an \"fps issue\". I believe it is a bug in the game. League is the only game I've played so far that has had any kind of issue on this computer. I also don't believe it's as simple as a framerate drop. Something is causing the renderer to stop rendering until the game is tabbed out and back in... Apple probably changed some obscure OGL API you guys use in their latest Radeon drivers. :)","replies":[{"poster":"mahnig","date":"2017-03-04T06:16:55.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mahnig,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ft1Zhug7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-04T06:09:36.097+0000)\n>\n> I have the same compy.
