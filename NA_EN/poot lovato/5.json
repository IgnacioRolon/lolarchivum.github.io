Except the enemy units didn't. They never moved towards my units as the round started, so my assassins never got behind the enemies. And no, they didn't have a bunch of RFCs. So my question is: What the fuck and what should I have done differently?","replies":[{"poster":"Poot Lovato","date":"2019-08-30T18:39:12.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, but this was a constant theme the entire match.

For some reason, a team might decide it's not going to move and instead lets the other team walk up to it before engaging.  It's pretty irregular, but I've found it can happen with any team in any one particular battle, even if it doesn't the next time when fighting the exact same team.\n\nI hope it gets fixed.","replies":[]}]}
