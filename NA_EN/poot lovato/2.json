And it&#039;s not so much the fact that I don&#039;t want to roll those champions because that&#039;s how ARAM goes. The issue at hand is that I consistently have to play Udyr, Olaf, or Ivern against a team of Morgana, Karma, Lux, Vayne, Sejuani, or something of that nature. I check people&#039;s accounts after games just to verify that they do in fact run ARAM only accounts, because I know that after six games in a row of running against stacked teams it can&#039;t just be sheer luck. So my question is: when, if ever, are you going to change ARAM to literally be AR, where you random from the entire champion pool, because it&#039;s just infuriating to see people win who don&#039;t deserve victory but have the odds stacked in their favor.\r\nAnd before you throw that &quot;The more champions you own the faster your rerolls  come back&quot; nonsense at me, because it doesn&#039;t matter how fast my rerolls respawn if I&#039;m rerolling bad ARAM champion into bad ARAM champion and they only have to reroll once every four games. Fight me.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-03-11T06:44:47.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is a psychological thing. You notice negative experiences more than positive ones, so it feels like you reroll these champions more often.\nOn that note, ARAM is never truly random, there is always an algorithm to RNG in any game, but the RNG is masked so well as random, things like this should be expected to occur.","replies":[{"poster":"Khâmul","date":"2018-03-11T08:57:33.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not psychological.aram isn't really aram:\n-usually people leave the game at least once before starting it because they don't like their champs\n-rolling is changing this as only the most annoying champs wil lbe prefered\n-aram accounts.\n\ni wouldn't look into the algorithm, these points came from the players, even though you prevent the first point to happen, 2nd and 3rd can be reworked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poot Lovato","date":"2018-03-11T06:49:29.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I hear the words coming out of your mouth, but I was also in each of the games where we got mediocre ARAM picks and the entire enemy team was an ARAM player's wet dream. Like I'm not throwing out random statistics or making hyperbole here. Last night we played six consecutive games of ARAM, and every single time the enemy team was more stacked than mine. I just played a game against Karma, Morgana, Sejuani, Ziggs, Vayne, and if you can't imagine how that went... Yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-03-11T07:14:41.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ultimately, ARAM is a game mode mostly based on luck anyway.

Over the long-term with a number of games, everyone's luck (theoretically) balances out, and skill becomes a much more relevant factor than luck. Similar idea as teammates in ranked or whatever. Occasionally, bad teammates will cost you a game, but blaming all your losses on bad teammates is just silly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2018-03-11T06:46:55.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is also based off of personal champion pool for some reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-11T06:48:47.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logically, all-random ARAM would be less fun than rigged-ARAM.\n\nSure, it makes stompy teams, but between ARAM smurfs and dumb luck, having it unweighted would end up with even more curbstomp or generally unfun matches.\n\nIn general it tries to give people a mix of champs they play, champs that are good in aram, and sometimes just random shit - instead of all random shit.\n\nIf it was fully random, it would need to carefully balance both teams so they get similar winrate-totals and also get an even mix of roles, at least one tank, at least one ap, ect.","replies":[{"poster":"Poot Lovato","date":"2018-03-11T07:19:51.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except every other [relevant] MOBA's AR was like that. You random from everything. And you coulnd't really complain about one-sided teams because everyone had the same chance of randoming something good or something bad. Like it was fair. When I started playing league I wanted to try a lot of different champions so I used my IP to buy almost all of them. I continued playing what I liked and just didn't play what I didn't like. So now I have all these champions I don't play and do not want to play, but I'm very likely to random them. Whereas all these other cats run around with nothing but mages or assassins or ADCs and they get really good team comps because their champion pool is lower. It's just anti-fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheShadow271","date":"2018-03-13T00:47:46.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got Shen 3 arams in a row.
