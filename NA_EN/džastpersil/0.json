It looks like you've already received a chest for Caitlyn, and you may only receive one chest for a champion per season.  \n\nYou can also check the champion section of your profile tab for gold borders that show which champions you've earned a chest for.  We also have a [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide that provides some more details on chest eligibility.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up, and congrats on level 7 on Caitlyn!","replies":[]}]}
