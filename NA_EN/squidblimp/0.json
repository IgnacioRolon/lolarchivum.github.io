(Would appreciate a Riot response!)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":228,"down_votes":19,"body":"I&#039;ll keep posting this until someone from Riot says something about this.\n\nEDIT 3: RIOT RESPONDED!\n\n**RiotScruffy** (NA)\nI don't know if this is the absolute biggest problem for the character, but it does seem like something that's screwing Illaoi and not really giving anyone else in the game a noticeably better experience.\n\nI'll see if we can look into hiding more of the tentacle info while she's in fog.\n________________________________________________________\n**Illaoi has the largest weakness in the game.**\nNo, it isn&#039;t her kiteability, even though she is kiteable.\nNo, it isn&#039;t her lack of CC, even though she lacks CC.\nThese are both intended parts of her kit, and she would probably be broken without these weakness.\n________________________________\nNo, her weakness is this:\n**You know EXACTLY where Illaoi is located at all times in the Fog of War, as well as where she ISN&#039;T located.**\n\n&quot;What do you mean? I can&#039;t see her in the Fog of War!&quot;\n\nNot literally, no. But her tentacles.\nIf she is near her tentacles, they have 2 HP, and they are &quot;active&quot; and stand tall.\nIf she is away from her tentacles, they have 1HP, and they are &quot;dormant&quot; and shrivel up.\n\nBoth of these forms are visible in the Fog of War, so you know exactly where Illaoi is.\nBig tentacles means she&#039;s near, small tentacles means she is not in that area.\nThe only exception is big tentacles that swing at vessels and spirits.\n\nADDITIONALLY, **you can see when Illaoi spawns tentacles with her passive in the Fog of War.**\nHer passive is, well, 100% passive, so she can&#039;t control this if she wants to move around the map.\nShe can&#039;t hide in a bush either, because a tentacle will spawn and her EXACT location will be known.\n__________________________________\nHow do you fix this? Well,** you make all tentacles look &quot;dormant&quot; (AKA small with 1 HP) when you don&#039;t have vision on Illaoi.**\nAnd then you **make it so new tentacles spawned cannot be seen until you actually gain vision on them.**\nThink Rek&#039;Sai tunnels: you can&#039;t see them until you get vision on them, but then they remain visible afterwards.\n\nThere are some rules to this:\n\n1) When **Illaoi herself, the actual champion,** becomes visible to the enemy team in any way, all tentacle states should be updated. When you lose vision on Illaoi, tentacles go back to looking &quot;dormant.&quot; This prevents you from knowing her location unless you ACTUALLY see her. Illaoi&#039;s team wouldn&#039;t see this change in state so they wouldn&#039;t know what vision you had, so only the enemy team would benefit from this.\n\n2) When Illaoi spawns a tentacle, the tentacle should not be visible until actual vision is gained on it. This allows Illaoi to actually hide in a brush and bait someone in without having her location revealed.\n\n3) When a tentacle even BEGINS to swing, it instantly is visible, as is its hitbox marker. This includes invisible tentacles, which would now become visible. This includes &quot;dormant&quot; tentacles, which would now be updated to look active (but would revert to  appearing dormant again if Illaoi is not visible after).\n\n4) When you auto attack a tentacle, its true form is revealed. If you were to attack a tentacle that appeared &quot;dormant,&quot; but it was actually an active tentacle, it would appear &quot;active&quot; after you had attacked it, and have one more HP to finish it off.\n________________________________\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT: This is really blowing up on Reddit!\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/49y3ge/illaois_fog_of_war_weakness/\n\nEDIT 2: Wow, this really blew up here on the Boards!

At lv 6 she gains one more.\n\nAs much as people would want to disagree. Facing a Teemo is more dangerous than facing an Illaoi. She does absolutely nothing in lane. Q is easy to dodge, E can be dodged and even if she hits it, it does NOTHING. Her auto attacks and W are the only \"skills\" she can use until lv 6 when she gains access to her ultimate which basically means, a few more Ws here and there.\n\nShe is highly unreliable.\nWhat other \"juggernauts\" have is: CC or very high damage in exchange for high mobility.\nWhat Illaoi has is: a gap closer, a random heal that makes no sense, a minigame that once you understand has no value (no value for the Illaoi player, as she will always be on the losing end) and that's it.\nHer damage is also mediocre as again, you can avoid most damage of her kit by just ATTACK MOVE. The only reason she sort of \"Feels\" like a juggernaut is her being so darn slow.\n\nThat's why Illaoi has a shitty success rate in higher \"tiers\". Her entire kit has no value once the enemy player knows and understands what Illaoi's kit does. Yes, she is played so rarely that every now and then she surprises the enemy and gets away with a snowball win. Other times the Illaoi player just gets carried. And that's about it, those are the only ways Illaoi wins in higher tiers (surprise factor or getting carried).\n\nQ avoidable by simply moving; W being a targeted dash (unable to use it as escape) and if you took care of her random passive, you won't get extra damaged by this move; E having no value since if you trade back, E's everything stops.\n\nSo, until you make her more RELIABLE (faster Qs). Make her gain rewards for hitting her skill shot (E), make her gain rewards for hitting her Q on both enemy ghost and player of whom the ghost was drawn.\nShe will be lack luster.\n\nThere is no reason to pick Illaoi (unless you are filming a hentai movie) over any other top lane bruiser/tank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2016-03-11T21:26:26.289+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"^Agreed\nThis isn't a huge issue but more something nice to address","replies":[{"poster":"Castman","date":"2016-03-11T22:35:15.444+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the enemies knowing where you exactly are on the map even in fog of war isn't a huge issue then idk what is lol.

Do you think it would difficult to have the tentacles physically appear two different ways to Illaoi's team and her enemies? From what I see, the Rek' Sai tunnels don't actually have two different states, like Illaoi's active and dormant tentacles--they physically look the same to both teams whether they have vision or not. \n\nI am imagining a scenario in which Illaoi is in the jungle taking a camp. There are two spawned tentacles that are actively attacking the camp, but the enemy team does not have vision of her. How difficult would it be to have the tentacles appear dormant to the enemy team, but active to the ally team at the same time in the same place on the map?\n\nI think it would make more sense to just not have the tentacles on the map or mini-map at all unless you have vision of them at that time. I feel like her tentacles are a lot less important to see in Fog of War than Rek' Sai tunnels, because Rek' Sai can ult to any of them, whereas Illaoi's tentacles are only really a threat if she is in proximity of them (and if you have vision of her you probably have vision of her tentacles).","replies":[]}]}
