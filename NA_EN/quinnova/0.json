It was all light-hearted. I had honour level 4 and was never considered toxic or anything.\n\nBut apparently Riot would rather ban me for literally typing \"mb\" than genuinely toxic people and inters.\n\nI've been in contact with Riot and I was told that they have a zero tolerance policy for that word. I understand that. But in the context of the enemy messages, is it really fair that I should be given a full on 14 day suspension and not at least a warning or a chat restriction? I was honour level 4 and have never been considered toxic or anything.\n\nRiot, when people complain about the ban system, they're not saying that you need to ban every single person who types anything that could be regarded in one particular light as offensive--they're saying you need to ban literal inters (and I've encountered many of those who were never punished) and genuinely toxic people, who make death threats etc. They're not saying that you need to set up an automated ban for anyone who uses a specific word irrespective of context.\n\nIt's pretty obvious to me that the enemy team was annoyed that I was fed and that we stomped that match and decided to report me for \"hate speech\", knowing it would get me suspended. The word \"%%%\" was tossed around continuously that game, but Riot obviously doesn't care about context.\n%%%'ve submitted a ticket and requested a human but was met only with a stock, unpersonalised, condescending reply stating that \"You will experience some games where you will have teammates that are negative and insult you, but in those cases it's best to just ignore them. You have the option to mute the chat and report the players after the game, in client and by sending a ticket to us.\" This has absolutely nothing to do with my experience. \n\nI didn't get angry, I didn't flame, I didn't actually insult anyone. This suspension is ridiculous by any measure. \n\nI would like to hear any opinions about this and any other similar experiences, because, frankly, when there are actual inters and people making death threats roaming the rift, banning me for this is pathetic. This isn't what people mean when they say the ban system needs to be stricter.\n\nRiot needs to ban people for making death threats, for being outright racist, or for intentionally feeding, not for using a naughty word in a light-hearted context.\n\nI would like to be in contact with an actual rioter about this.\n\n(Crosspost from the OCE Boards because I'm not sure how active they are.)\n\nEdit: Sorry, I forgot to add this to the post. When I said \"I don't have a %%%\" it was in response to the enemy typing \"your %%%\"--that is, I was pointing out the grammatical error. They used the wrong your. I wasn't calling anyone a %%%.

I get what you're trying to say, but that analogy isn't universal and really doesn't work here.\n\nLesson learnt, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aymin","date":"2020-01-03T15:40:57.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"WTF is \"mb\" seriously a flagged word?
