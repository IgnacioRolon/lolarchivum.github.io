Secondly, it rewards players for taking damage, and in reverse punishes players for healing/avoiding damage. With a new passive, we could give Renekton an even more unique identity and late-game viability.\r\n\r\nI feel that a passive that revolves around Renekton&#039;s &quot;rager&quot;, &quot;tortured-into-insanity&quot;, and &quot;mentally broken&quot; archetypes could solidify Renekton&#039;s thematic identity and give us the feel of playing a psychotic butcher. What I propose is a passive mechanic revolving around Renekton applying stacks to a Champion by dealing damage to them with his abilities (and basic attacks?) Once Renekton manages to reach a certain amount of stacks within a certain time frame, he gains bonuses towards to his victim. Only one enemy Champion can affected at a time, and after they have been afflcited, they cannot become victim again for a while.\r\n\r\nBonuses that Renekton would gain towards his target could include:\r\nBonus movement speed when moving towards the afflicted champion\r\nBonus percent damage (max, current, or missing)\r\nBonus true damage (a la Garen)\r\nLifesteal and/or Spellvamp\r\nReduced incoming damage\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Would this be a good passive for Renekton? Or something else entirely?","replies":[{"poster":"LithiumWednesday","date":"2015-10-24T08:33:42.669+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Renekton has a passive?","replies":[{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2015-10-24T21:14:41.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^^^ this xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2015-10-25T07:12:23.208+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Renekton's passive is bad because the rest of Renekton's kit is incredibly powerful.

There are plenty of situations where going in even as mega gnar is fairly suicidal. Mega Gnar is a tank with a lot of cc and burst, but bad escaping, kiting, and closing which is why you generally try to do all that stuff while in mini form, then go in with mega once you've whittled them down and gotten into proper position.
