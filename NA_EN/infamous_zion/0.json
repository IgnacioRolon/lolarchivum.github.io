So until i update it, i can always watch previous matches. This started happening 2 days ago, when Riot issued that there was a problem with bugsplats, so i guess i gotta do now a full repair.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T22:12:02.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deep Terror Nami has provided some good insight here. If updating the program and running a repair  causes no change, your best bet is to reach out to the program's developer or a subreddit dedicated to the program (if one exists). Since Riot doesn't develop the program you're using to watch replays, we're not able to support it.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
