They stopped in 2013 by the way. And yes, i know what you will say \"they aren't obliged to\" and no they aren't. But it sends a message to the community. If they were posting statistics on how good everything is going and how popular the game is in the world and all of the sudden they stop, what does that say? It says, things are not going great, or just bad. Even if they know this isn't true, they need to provide some info for the community just so people don't feel like game is losing it. Moreover, Korea is famous for gaming and everything there related to gaming is related to us (more-less). \n\nI feel like the way you were expressing here, like you are hating my guts even though this isn't my statistics. For some reason, you behave like you are arguing with me.  This post isn't to glorify Overwatch, this is just for a concern and your argument #4 has absolutely no meaning. If it was like that nobody would concern themselves with posting on boards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2016-06-11T13:34:37.689+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You posted this in the wrong sub-board mate.\n\nTry GD, Gameplay or Misc.","replies":[{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2016-06-11T14:48:31.179+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe even the overwatch forums","replies":[{"poster":"inFamous Zion","date":"2016-07-14T11:35:02.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raith alghul,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=nI1G0rT4,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-06-11T14:48:31.179+0000)\n>\n> Or maybe even the overwatch forums\n\nThis post isn't about glorifying overwatch.
