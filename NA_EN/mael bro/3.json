Assassin's aren't just pure 1v1 champions and anyone who plays them that way is wrong. They use the pressure from their 1v1 ability to get vision control and roam specifically to help other lanes. If I had to pick a selfish class I would say adc is up there since they take most of the resources from their team (of course they can also carry the mid to late game in return if you get them ahead) and need the most help at all stages of the game.\n\n> They pick champions that are utterly useless to the team comp unless they get themselves fed. Hell, i'd take a 0/20 Veigar over a 0/0 Zed, at least the Veig can still f*ck up a teamfight with a well placed stun.\n\nThe threat of a diving champion is a pretty big help to the team, the adc is forced to play safer and/or have a peeler close by constantly. Sure they don't bring cc normally, but acting like they can't roam, split push, get picks, etc is just ignorant.\n\n> They're often the most arrogant players, flashing their Mastery 7 emote on their main Fizz because ohhhh they're so skilled for one-shotting you after landed their ult that's just as wide as the lane.\n\nI usually save the emote for 2v1's or other close scenarios to tilt the other player. It might not be the nicest thing, but I do it on all champion when I outplay them not just assassins. There is always a mute button if you can't control your tilt.\n\n> They get 15 kills and then blame their teammates for losing the game, not realizing that kills are not what matters the most, and that their contribution over taking objectives is utter crap.\n\nThe only time I give my team shit is when I say something like \"I'm going to push bot, when they send 2-3 do baron\" then the support decides to run into the enemy jungle for wards when we don't see anyone, dies, and we lose baron because I'm bot. You could've easily warded after I reached their tower or we saw people on the map...","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2017-10-11T15:03:10.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nm1010,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FwnUsjbp,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2017-10-11T14:39:40.007+0000)\n>\n> Now see this is just someone who doesn't understand the assassin class.\n> \n\nIt's not that i don't understand the class, it's that 95% of players who plays that class plays it like i described.
