To start off, enable [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode in case the fancy aesthetics is causing too much stress during champ select.  Test it in a custom game though, so you don't run into any penalties!\n\nShould the issue continue, grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run a repair.  This should clear up any potentially bad game files.\n\nTest these in customs, and let me know if it helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"PotetWarrior","date":"2017-06-12T17:07:02.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally after posting this I tried again to do ranked.
