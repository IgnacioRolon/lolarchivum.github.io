None can't contest about Darius or Illaoi have a high damage at short distance, also they have possibility to contest 1v2 in certain cases, but have low movement speed and they have to take risk by receiving a probable damage to deal their damage. It is the samething for the new Urgot, low range, low movement speed, but the actual Urgot has not enough damage to compense his low movement. Urgot has difficulties to beat just one champion with his new kit because he clearly does not do enough damage. The Old Urgot could kill more easier a champion and taking less damage due to his damage reduction than the actual one. Also, the new Urgot is simple to counter : Just stay in the knee used to take less damage. Additionnaly, the new ult of Urgot is actually less useful than the old one as a tank, the old one could make you enter in a fight with damage reduction and fear ennemies, the new one does less than 100 dmg level 1 and it is only useful to kill 1 enemy with LESS than 25 % of his health if you don&#039;t miss it...\n\nOther thing, his new Q needs CHARGE or more damage, the old Q of Urgot had a cd of 2 SECONDS, 85 % AD ratio, comparatively to the new Q that a cd of 12-8 seconds and it has a AD ratio of 70 % and it is harder to hit someone with it.\n\nOverall, same if the new Urgot has many more sources of damage than the old one, the old Urgot could spam his Q, reduce the damage of enemy(his primary source of power) and slow enemy with his shield. Also, the abilities of old Urgot had more synergy between each other than actually, the new Urgot should have damage reduction when doing his E to have a kit where his abilities have a certain synergy.\n\nAs example, when a enemy was hit by E(corrosive charge), the enemy armor was grealty reduced with Black Cleaver(also slow if W activated) and that could cauze the enemy to go away from Urgot or the enemy would be hit by 2-3 Q, if the enemy was engaging, he would have done less damage due to damage reduction. Now, the new Urgot can&#039;t harass as before, he needs to be enoughly near the enemy to attack him and Urgot will without doubt take damage if he wants to really hurt his enemy to the risk of being killed.\n\nOnly few things on the new Urgot that is better than the old one, the new urgot can now clear faster wave with his AoE, deal maximum health damage and A CHANCE to execute an enemy low health.","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-08-05T20:46:17.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did I just read a five paragraph essay on \"Urgot can't 1v5 so isn't balanced and needs buffs\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Akalix","date":"2017-08-06T02:02:36.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you just read only ONE sentence from all the paragraphs and not understood all to make an opinion?

We have massive mastery reworks coming out so since his power comes (In large part) from fervor of battle I can only see urgot being pretty weak unless we get a good fervor alternative for ad caster/aa combo champs in that overhaul (Riven/fiora/etc) since they seem to be doing an attack speed buff for adcs\n\n\nThe champ is so friggin adaptable, his winrate is low because most people that are playing him right now have less than a month on him or are just checking out the new champ. we can't determine his proper winrate this patch at all, it will take at least halfway through 7.17 before we have those numbers on a decent standard and know if he needs hotpatching or not, and honestly I think his early bullying needs a little nerfing, because you can braindead win with him against almost any top laner if you know how to position and save your shotgun knees+ max q, rush phage, at least until more people learn to fight him\n\nurgot does not have enough data to be nerfed or buffed, my personal opinion is that a good urgot player is a little too strong for amount of games played and skill ceiling, whereas a bad urgot player might be a bit too weak right now","replies":[{"poster":"Akalix","date":"2017-08-08T20:41:23.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, no one can't know what will be the impact of new runes. Based on fact from champion.gg, the win rate of Urgot at top increased less than 1% in 4 days(in plat+). \nAs you said, Urgot works well with some items, but Urgot is very dependent to these items, so without money he is kindly weak.\n\nAlso, if you compare the win rate of Urgot in plat+, plat, gold, silver, bronze, we can observe that his win rate increases from plat+ to bronze (45.30 %(plat+), 45.67 %(plat), 46.19 %(gold), 47.60 %(silver), 48.97 %(bronze) August 9 on champion.gg). \n\n\nIn my opinion, we could consider that players with low rank have more difficulty to counter Urgot(wrong item bought against Urgot, not staying in Urgot knee used, less informed on Urgot capacities, other things). \n\nIn another way, i observed your rank is bronze 4... strange concidence considering facts and you are approving to nerf Urgot cauze too \"strong\", maybe you could ask help or think to a manner to counter new Urgot instead wanting to nerf him. Effectively, actual Urgot can easily be countered with just{{item:3047}} at start.","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-08-08T20:48:38.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I didn't say nerf cause too strong, I said tweak\n\nYou're a little defensive dude, by the way if you're so pissed about a new champ having a low win rate in plat+ you should probably get there first","replies":[{"poster":"Akalix","date":"2017-08-10T01:21:26.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually plat 4","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-08-05T21:12:41.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuzja1","date":"2017-08-06T02:05:39.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd prefer that the Q would get an increase of the blast radius.
