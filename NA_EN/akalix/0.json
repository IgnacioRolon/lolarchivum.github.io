What do I mean? I am saying it could be better if Urgot could choose between 2 choices for each ability(including passive and ultimate). As an example, we could choose between his old passive and his new passive(to reduce incoming damage from a champion touched by Urgot or to deal max. health damage in a radius), his old Q or his new Q(Single target spell or AoE and slow enemy), his old W or his new W(Shield based on max. mana and slow enemy touched by Urgot or shield based on max. health and deal damage while moving), his old E or his new E(throw a corrosive charge AoE or dash and grab enemy to switch place), his old R or his new R(Switching place with an enemy, reduce incoming damage and fear nearby enemies or throwing a missile dealing damage, execute below 25 % max. health and fear nearby enemies). That could make him more &quot;worthy&quot; in certains cases.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-09-30T22:03:33.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?
