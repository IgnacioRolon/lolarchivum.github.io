This is just so sad to see that i am being banned over this game. i was being harassed all game by the enemy team and my own team and i reported all of them for countless things and i doubt u even banned one of them. Honestly i didn&#039;t even curse or anything i was being trolled because i took vayne top which is perfectly normal and then i had one team member troll me by coming top and then the whole team started saying report vayne for trolling and then i got upset and i muted them. after a bit i unmuted them so we can actually win the game but it just continued. i even told them to go ahead and report me because i knew i had done nothing wrong. I just had gotten off my 2 week ban recently and i have been trying to be a more positive player but you guys or who ever banned me for because of this chat and it is really sad like i don&#039;t know what else to say. And also this was only one game there is no other chats for which i was banned.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nmesmorize: im top\r\nmesmorize: nasus u did that on purpose\r\nmesmorize: so u go bot\r\nmesmorize: i called top\r\nmesmorize: twice\r\nmesmorize: u guys even saw it\r\nmesmorize: no\r\nmesmorize: sona top\r\nmesmorize: no im not\r\nmesmorize: LOL??\r\nmesmorize: ok imma stop talking to uall before u try to report me\r\nmesmorize: lol u guys clearly dont watch gosuy\r\nmesmorize: no\r\nmesmorize: they dont understand that i caleld top lmao\r\nmesmorize: premade lol\r\nmesmorize: sona ur causing all fo this lol\r\nmesmorize: all u have to do is go bot\r\nmesmorize: i dotn want u supporting me lmao is that so hard to undestnad\r\nmesmorize: troll\r\nmesmorize: ur not in ur lane\r\nmesmorize: report sona trolling me pls\r\nmesmorize: lol???\r\nmesmorize: im asorry i have to mute u now\r\nmesmorize: nasus all u have to do is tell sona to come bot\r\nmesmorize: lol\r\nmesmorize: veigar\r\nmesmorize: stop\r\nmesmorize: talking\r\nmesmorize: lag\r\nmesmorize: god ryze\r\nmesmorize: cant i play a game without trolls\r\nmesmorize: i called for top u all saw it\r\nmesmorize: and still ignored me\r\nmesmorize: lol yas with a 500 ping u died\r\nmesmorize: sona ur the real troll on this team u 12 year kid\r\nmesmorize: ur a such a baby\r\nmesmorize: i would say more but i dont wanna get banned\r\nmesmorize: so ill msg u after the game\r\nmesmorize: dont worry\r\nmesmorize: 12 year old\r\nmesmorize: Yas cant 1v1&gt;?\r\nmesmorize: loL?\r\nmesmorize: u cant fight hahah\r\nmesmorize: come top lane\r\nmesmorize: we didbnt lose lmao u got yi\r\nmesmorize: Yas?\r\nmesmorize: pls\r\nmesmorize: u lost\r\nmesmorize: to me\r\nmesmorize: lol\r\nmesmorize: go ahead report for\r\nmesmorize: dfor no reason\r\nmesmorize: i was toxic?\r\nmesmorize: sona\r\nmesmorize: really\r\nmesmorize: ur in a premade\r\nmesmorize: and im reporting\r\nmesmorize: imgunna write such a long report\r\nmesmorize: watch\r\nmesmorize: i swear ur gunan get banned\r\nmesmorize: perma ban sucks eh\r\nmesmorize: lol reported\r\nmesmorize: tghank you so much\r\nmesmorize: yes lol\r\nmesmorize: ull find out\r\nmesmorize: cuz\r\nmesmorize: ur not but toxic\r\nmesmorize: pls dont talk to me\r\nmesmorize: good flash\r\nmesmorize: run away\r\nmesmorize: all yasuo mains\r\nmesmorize: cant fight\r\nmesmorize: nice score\r\nmesmorize: nasus\r\nmesmorize: reported","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-28T04:25:04.938+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Punishments are handled in a 4-tier system:\n\n1.) 10 game chat restriction\n2.) 25 game chat restriction\n3.) 14 day ban\n4.) Permanent ban\n\nThe way it works is whenever you receive a punishment, you go up one tier, regardless of how minor the offense may have been, though it is possible to skip the chat restrictions and go straight to a 14 day/permanent ban if Riot deems the behavior severe enough. This means that whatever can get you a chat restriction can also get you a permanent ban, if you do it frequently enough.\n\nWith all that said, it's more of a question of \"do these chat logs deserve a punishment\" rather than \"do these chat logs deserve a permanent ban.\" You mentioned that you had recently gotten off of your 14 day ban, so a permanent ban is standard for your next punishment, so now we need to decide if these logs are punishment worthy. \n\nI will admit, this isn't all that bad, but having received a 14 day ban recently meant that you were on very thin ice. There are a few things that stand out to me.\n\n> mesmorize: sona ur the real troll on this team u 12 year kid\nmesmorize: ur a such a baby\nmesmorize: i would say more but i dont wanna get banned\nmesmorize: so ill msg u after the game\nmesmorize: dont worry\nmesmorize: 12 year old\n\nCalling Sona a troll, baby, and 12 year old kid here doesn't really help. It's negative and unnecessary, and really just makes the whole situation worse. Now, when it comes to your punishment, what others are doing doesn't matter. All that matters is your behavior because that is what you are being judged on. If others are breaking the rules, that doesn't mean that you can without consequence. If the Sona was trolling, that sucks, it really does, however harassing and insulting the player doesn't help the situation. You are allowed to politely suggest that they go to the bot lane, but if they don't comply, then there's really not much that you can do as you can't directly control their actions.\n\nAlso, you're threatening to message them after the game to harass them some more. While that's not what you said, there is a heavy implication that that is what you mean.\n\n>mesmorize: troll\nmesmorize: ur not in ur lane\nmesmorize: report sona trolling me pls\nmesmorize: lol???\n\n>mesmorize: and im reporting\nmesmorize: imgunna write such a long report\nmesmorize: i swear ur gunan get banned\nmesmorize: perma ban sucks eh\nmesmorize: lol reported\n\nCalling others troll some more. On top of that, you're also calling for reports against the Sona. If you think someone is breaking the rules and you want to report them, that's fine, go ahead. However, calling for reports against another player is considered harassment, and can very well lead to a punishment.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this, but the biggest one, imo, is that it's completely unnecessary to do so. The system doesn't go by the number of individual reports a player receives. It goes by the percentage of games they are reported in, and it only takes a single report to flag a game. Any additional reports are pretty much unnecessary and don't do anything extra.\n\nSo, if you want to report someone, it's best to do so yourself and do so silently. Your report alone is enough to flag a game.\n\nOverall, a decent amount of your chat is you arguing with your teammates. I'd say that this is punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"mesmorize","date":"2016-09-28T13:01:52.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I understand and what ever at this point cause what good can this chat even do.

You are 100% responsible for your own behavior, regardless of circumstance. If you choose to act toxic towards your team, then you will get punished. You already clearly demonstrated you do not want to change your behavior considering you already went through the tier system of punishments without changing your attitude. \n\nPeople do not get false punishment or bans. And contrary to your belief, trolls do get punished and Riot **does check gameplay when cases of griefing and/or trolling are reported, as well as many other factors in the game to accurately asses the situation**. \n\nYou can't dump the blame on Riot or anyone else, you got yourself banned so you need to own up to it. There is no \"he started it\" excuse. You chose to type all that out, only _you_ could have written that and pressed Enter. \n\nNothing you do or say on the boards will lift your ban. The most anyone can do is give you advice on how to not fall into this situation again if you make a new account. But if you refuse to take the advice given to you (as you've already shown) then there's nothing left for you. \n\nSo good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-09-28T16:45:35.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> because last I checked only the people that are defending themselves are being reported and not the trolls themselves. \n\nIf you're not reporting the trolls in your game that's your problem, I'm pretty sure most people do.\n\n\"Defending yourself\" is using the mute button. It's a perfect defense, but you choose to not use it early enough or frequently enough. What were you trying to \"defend\", your honor? You *shamed* yourself by replying in kind.
