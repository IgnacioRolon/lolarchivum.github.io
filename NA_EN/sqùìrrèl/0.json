About once a month my screen goes black and the game becomes unresponsive. It then crashes and when I attempt to get into another queue, I am told I dodged, with a punishment timer. This has happened so many times that now I am at a 15 minute timer before I can get into another game. There is no reason for this to happen. I have tried other computers, other connections, and it still happens. It's a LoL thing and I'm the one suffering. Please, Riot, fix this bug or remove the timer buster for dodgers. It's just not right that bugs should punish me like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T01:59:42.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like your client is dropping its connection to the matchmaking servers.
