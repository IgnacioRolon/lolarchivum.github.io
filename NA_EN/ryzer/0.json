Because if you swapped roles then I don't know if Riot will punish him. See, its only a problem that they will notice once there are two people playing top. But if everything is working fine and there's an accommodating party. I doubt that they'd do something about it. There was some guy who posted a thread on this. He was support and the jungle simply locked in a Lux before him, saying that he's going support. I don't think that the Lux taking his role was punished for it because he went jungle.
