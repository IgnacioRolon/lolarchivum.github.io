I closed the client and then when I tried opening it again it just stayed black.\n\nI couldn't click anywhere, so I was not able to use the repair function. I decided to uninstall and now the client just shows the L with the circle loading but it doesn't show any progress into the install process. I can't click in any of the buttons of the client either. [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/BuvFaxM)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks.\n\n\nEdit: I've already tried running as admin, and compatibility mode (Win 8 and 7). I'm running windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T01:43:11.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After looking at your screenshot, it seems like this is being caused by an unstable connection between your network and our servers.

For some odd reason Windows decided it wanted to use a proxy so it activated the proxy settings but no proxy is setup so it kept trying to connect through that. Thanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}
