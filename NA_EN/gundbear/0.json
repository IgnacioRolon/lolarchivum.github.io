(The same one that a lot of others have been getting in the past week)\r\n\r\nThe problem is, I have not participated in MMR boosting in any way, all the games played on the account are played by me. I have League installed on both my desktop and laptop, and those are the only two machines my account has been logged in and played from. I've played on my laptop either from home, at work, and the occasional few times when traveling in the past year, so I don't know if IP change is the issue.\r\n\r\nLike Riot mods have suggested in other threads, I have tried submitting a ticket the same day I got the original email. Unfortunately, the response I got earlier this morning has been far less than helpful, giving zero additional information than what was in the original email:\r\n\"Your suspension was only issued after an extensive investigation was run to ensure your involvement in MMR boosting. As explained in the email you received in response to your suspension, the following actions have been taken on your account:\r\n\r\n-A two-week suspension has been issued to your account.\r\n-All previous Season rewards (Victorious skins, borders, season icons, season ward skins) have been stripped from your account.\r\n-You are ineligible for any 2015 Season rewards\r\n\r\nWhile you may feel that this punishment is too harsh, please realize that having accounts boosted, for whatever reason, ruins the spirit of League of Legends competitive play. While you are ineligible for any rewards in the 2015 Season, this does not disqualify you for anything pertaining to the 2016 Season. Keep in mind that if you have any future involvement in MMR boosting, your account will be permanently suspended.\"\r\n\r\nLiterally the same exact information as the original email. \r\n\r\nEven though in the ticket I provided what I have said in this post, and a link to my [last 50+ ranked games](http://i.imgur.com/iWShv8q.jpg).\r\n[Link to my account from NA.op.gg](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=gundbear)\r\n[Link to my account from lolking.net](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/26728060)\r\n\r\nI play mostly Morgana/Janna/Sona support, Morgana/Annie mid, Maokai/Irelia top, a variety of adc, and a variety of junglers. All of those are played pretty evenly/consistently throughout my ranked history.\r\n\r\nI earned my rank, it is unfair how Riot can accuse me of getting boosted and ban me for something I didn't do with no evidence nor explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2015-08-04T21:51:00.800+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya gundbear, \n\nI went ahead and dug into your suspension, and you're correct, you definitely played the last 50 ranked games yourself (the last 65, to be precise).  \n\nUnfortunately, your account regularly took a small detour of roughly 650 miles for your placement games at the beginning of this season, and while that'd be just fine by itself, what's infinitely more impressive is the fact that it made that trip repeatedly (in as little as 14 seconds) just to play 10 ranked games.  Your booster went 9/1, and I know it feels like you've since earned the resulting MMR, but it's important that you play all of your ranked games yourself (not just 90% of them).\n\nIn the interest of clarity, I feel it's meaningful to note that the metrics above aren't used by the system that flagged you, they're just the most obvious to a human and the easiest to discuss.  I also wanted to take this time to thank you for changing your password prior to sharing your account with your booster.  Not because it made it easier to identify you, but because I genuinely appreciate your commitment to account security.","replies":[{"poster":"Toa of Death","date":"2015-08-04T22:10:54.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so someone did his placements for him?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-08-04T22:20:58.799+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems to be the case.\n>Your booster went 9/1, and I know it feels like you've since earned the resulting MMR, but it's important that you play all of your ranked games yourself (not just 90% of them).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boyahda","date":"2015-08-04T22:08:12.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The penguins have spoken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear Popo","date":"2015-08-04T22:48:19.155+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"@mirageofpenguins\nIn honor of your mighty smite, I humbly present this awful photoshop in your image.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear Popo","date":"2015-08-04T22:12:16.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"#penguinsmite","replies":[]},{"poster":"fuzzypeach13","date":"2015-10-02T18:59:19.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"excuse me good sir  i am having the same problem i had played my 200+ games of ranked this season and after duoing with my friend and finally getting to gold after a couple of day's i was told i was \"mmrboosting\" i had put a support ticket in and described my ordeal as i had only played from my computer at home and 2 from a pc cafe called yes pc i had given them my ip, and my match history from the past 50 games in which 99% of them were played with my friend but to on evail and i dont know where else to turn to get back my season rewards and prove that im innocent so if you can please respond and help me that would be fanatatic \n\nthank you.\n\nbtw here is my account history: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=fuzzypeach13","replies":[]},{"poster":"gundbear","date":"2015-08-04T22:50:31.565+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"I'm sorry, but I thought the whole point of \"MMR boosting\" is that you are asking/paying someone to play your account with the specific intent to \"boost\" your MMR, into a higher league that you have no business being in.\n\nI had a friend who wanted to borrow my account for a few games at the beginning of the season, I didn't think it was a big deal since I don't play on it much. I have since then played and ranked it up another league myself for like you said, over 90% of the games with a 60% win rate. If anything, wouldn't this fall under account sharing or something instead of MMR boosting, since no boosting of MMR took place? That's like saying a Diamond player let his Gold friend play a few games on his account, and called it boosting.\n\nI deserve the 2 week ban for sharing accounts if that is frowned upon so much by Riot, but I honestly did not realize it would be treated as \"boosted\" and punished as such. At least leave the seasonal rewards intact? \n\nAnyway, I really appreciate your time and response. I have not had good experiences with submitting tickets to Riot support before.

Finished the season on G5 , then on S5 finished my placements with a w/l ratio of 8/2 but had a low performance, yet the ranking system put me on G1. And it looks like they are claiming that it was boosted.\n\nI play mainly mid, sup and adc... occasionally some jungle.  During S5 placements, i played some jungle, I ended up with an average of like, 40 creeps per game playing as a jungler. Even tho i did bad, they say it was boosted.\n\nBTW, it took me over 3 weeks on S4 to reach Gold 5 from Silver 3, and S5 placements took me about a week to finish. I even had a support kennen on my last match, I think he ended up 2/10 (I have a screenshot I took at the lobby when the rank icon showed up). So I guess my booster is horrible, I mean, what diamond/challenger tier booster would take nearly a month to go from silver 3 to gold 5.\n\nI've sent a tcket, but got the same generic text as you =/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadly Gale","date":"2015-08-03T19:11:42.396+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't say that my situation is anything like yours,  but it seems like they have been handling any possibility of MMR boosting and flat out saying it's mmr boosting and not even properly explaining why they think so.","replies":[{"poster":"gundbear","date":"2015-08-03T21:24:15.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah, that's what it sounds like to me.

They even sent me the exact same email that you received, after I submitted a ticket. That leaves me to believe that they are not even confirming individual cases and just use some automated bot to see if you are elo boosting, which is obviously not perfected yet. I just went on a gold climb with a duo, and now I am being punished for it. The worst part is they do not give any explanation, they just assume they are right and ban you. Because of the lack of explanation you cannot even refute their claim. Guilty until proven innocent is a horrible system to follow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weese","date":"2015-08-13T18:01:47.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the same thing.
