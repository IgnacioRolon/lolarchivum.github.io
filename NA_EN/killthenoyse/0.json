Yesterday, I made up a PBE account, i wrote my username and password ( My acc was eligible with the PBE requierments ) then I downloaded PBE. I entered in the launcher, wrote the username and password but the launcher kept telling me that Username or password is incorrect try again... I made sure more than once that i wrote it correctly, but still didn't worked out. So i pressed reset your password. I entered my username there for the reset, it said that a reset mail was send to my email address. I checked my email adress still nothing. I said ok let's wait 5-10 minutes. I waited... Still nothing, i tried again... still nothing, then I pressed Forgot your username where it said that i have to put my email for the reset ( or whatever happens ) so i entered it... I checked my email but still nothing... Please help me i don't know what to do","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T16:30:43.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the hassle here to get your account up.
