Even though I fully understand that preseason means less competitive in ranked games, I still feel frustrating to encounter bunch of trolls and afks in my ranked games (in either team or both). This has happened way more than regular seasons, making ranked game almost impossible to play and less enjoyable. My thought is because people don&#039;t care that much about their LP or honor level. As a player who spend almost 90% games in ranked queue, I have to step aside and move to normal game to &#039;normally&#039; play the game. My friends are experiencing these frustration too and the only way for us to play ranked normally is to premade as 5.\r\n\r\nPreseason are doomed to be mess, I get it. I could enjoy playing with teammates picking orianna bot or vayne jungle if they ARE ACTUALLY trying, but playing with lux with 6 tears and consistently running down mid is a torture. I prefer ranked over normal because most players are trying hard in ranked games and I will improve more if I play against the best states of them. Preseason, however, is actually a disaster for ranked queue players. What is the point of having ranked during preseason if we can&#039;t get a healthy and competitive ranked environment?","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-12-01T06:11:29.125+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"we deserve to just not have a preseason.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-12-04T00:01:30.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair a preseason is a good idea to test out new ideas and maybe new good things could come out of it. In practical use though Riot has consistently BUSTED champions, Masteries, and Meta's with stuff that they should have tested a little before opening it up live so we dont have League of Tanks, League of Dark Harvest, and so on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Liquidify","date":"2018-12-01T18:07:26.594+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

Will just say obviously all my losing games aren't a factor of afk players and I have made bad decisions in which 2 games were my fault. If I remember I played Camile which was a bad pick and I played terrible considering my skill and knowledge.\n\nIf not mistaken the afk player game was with the pyke?, he left mid-game because I asked him to play safe and the whole team including enemy was harassing him.
