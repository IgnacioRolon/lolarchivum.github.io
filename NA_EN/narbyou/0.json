It will freeze forever until I restart my computer, but the same thing happens once I go in game to reconnect again. Essentially, my team ends up losing because I am unable to play after the 27 minute mark due to some unknown error. I have already attempted to use hextech repair tool to repatch and nothing has changed. Please help ! :(","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2019-01-16T02:25:03.062+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s their shitty anti-cheat.
