In my personal opinion, Shadow Assassin Kayn probably still won't see much play even after the buff to Umbral Trespass' AD ratio. He'll probably also still be a bit on the weak side as well. Shadow Assassin Kayn's kit is very fluid and feels good to play but why would you ever choose to transform into Shadow Assassin Kayn when Rhaast has an abundant amount of sustain, percentage based damage and hard cc built into his kit?\n\nTo specify, I don't think this is an issue that stems from Rhaast overshadowing Shadow Assassin Kayn due to a numbers discrepancy (Rhaast is already pretty well-balanced in my opinion). It's an issue with Shadow Assassin Kayn not presenting a high enough incentive for players to choose him over Rhaast. Rhaast is just too reliable in solo queue because you don't have to rely on your teammates to provide cc or sustain for you - you can be a one man show. On the other hand, Shadow Assassin Kayn has a larger burst potential but he's far riskier than Rhaast because he lacks hard cc and sustain which forces players to do the one thing that many of them dislike (relying on their teammates to help them win the game). Other than this feedback, I just wanted to say good job on Kayn, Wav3Break.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/894e0d91f6017947ff90fb3982c21cd8.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-07-26T11:08:26.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously he's more reliable... he's a bruiser... assassins are always riskier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TiltyMacTiltFace","date":"2017-07-26T19:21:02.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got kayn to matery 7 also.

If Kayn is at the lowest winrate in game and is meant to be a carry, there is a serious problem to him. I have been playing a lot of Kayn and can name over 100 times some bug or nonsense killed me for 0 reason. He needs more than an ult buff. I do agree I don't need a hugggge buff, but to leave him with the lowest win rate is too much. Right now unless your 8 kills ahead, shadow form offers nothing. His W can't knock people up, which is why Darkin for is more powerful. He can't heal. Building Crit in assassin form offers little damage for way too long and no cooldowns. Building lethality is the only way to stay relevant and even than you can't duel well. I can go on and on, but I hope your not going to just buff his ult and think that will fix his problems.","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2017-07-26T07:27:37.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do just fine with Shadow Kayn, the ult buff is more than enough already.

It would be like saying soraka is healing too much, ban her. Now soraka is oppressive in her own right as a support who spams he attacks, but she can't fight teams well so she isn't hated. Kayn will be hated no matter what they do. He is an assassin/skirmisher. His role frustrates people and there is no changing that. What Riot needs to do is create a blind pick ranked game where people like us don't have our champions banned because someone is afraid to play us. As a Yasuo main wirht about 1.3million exp I have been playing him for years, even when Yasuo had the lowest winrate in game. I learned to play well, really well, but people blame the champion when you do well, then blame you when you're getting stomped. There is no winning for Carrys m8.

I've started on a literal toaster that got so warm you could make eggs & bacon on it, League ran perfectly fine on a GT325m. Over the years I've moved onto better things. I am now more or less rocking an i7 4790k + GTX 1070. It hurts to say that I've seen a massive decline in my framerate since last year. I used to be able to pull between 300-400 fps. Now my frame rate hardly sticks around 200 during the early-mid game it begins to drop into the lower 100's. Until at one point went below 80. Now we are talking about the performance on the rift, take ARAM, for example, a similar thing happens where my frame rate just barely hovers around 150. Not to mention the game visibly stutters and hiccups when entering bushes sometimes. I can for sure say that this isn't my computer's problem. It has been rebuilt completely recently, on top of that I do not have such issues with any other game. I think I actually get a higher average frame rate on Warframe now than I do on League. I surely cannot be the only one that has noticed this? League isn't a demanding game, it was designed to run on almost any computer so why are frame-rates tanking so much? I don't suppose reinstalling the game on an SSD would do much, but would possibly be worth a shot. I understand we have had many updates/changes but they should in no way affect performance as they weren't really visual updates. I also anticipate some of you will probably say that having high frames doesn't matter, or that I should be happy to have at least that many. If my frames dip so much on such hardware, I cannot imagine what lower-end users are going through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-07-25T23:56:17.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making his q a double cast would be a nice QOL change","replies":[]},{"poster":"subhuman team XD","date":"2017-07-25T22:36:53.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"awesome ! looking forward to it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xxxMadLionxxx","date":"2017-07-25T22:25:16.005+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think it takes way to long for kayne to transform.
