If anyone could help me in anyway it would be much appreciated, i really want my account back and riot support hasn't contacted me yet and i am getting worried.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T00:32:54.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to pull up your tickets so far, but it doesn't look like you've sent any under this account. Make sure you wait for their response in the ticket you have, as what the agent said is true about any responses on your part before we answer could push your ticket back in line. Those account agents will be able to help you get control of your account back, and reverse any damage they might have done in the process as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fiddlelick","date":"2017-08-03T03:45:08.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also the picture that had the spam link he sent was not included sorry but if u want to see it i can post it","replies":[]}]}
