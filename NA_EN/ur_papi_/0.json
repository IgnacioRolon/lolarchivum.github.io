After doing so it said that it had been added to my loot or w/e. I checked in game and I couldn't find it pre game lobby where it asks you to select your skin. I did lose my essence for it and my hextech chest. Please do something about it. Tried to send a ticket but the system won't let me log in cuz racism","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T23:44:12.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of some issues where specific wards are not selectable in champ select.

We are working on a fix to make the wards skins selectable again.\n> \n> Terribly sorry for this inconvenience and please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. ^_^\n> \n> Have a nice day!\n> \n> Best regards,\n> XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n> Riot Games Player Support&#x27;&#x27;","replies":[]}]}]}
