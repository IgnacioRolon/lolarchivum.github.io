Summoners!!!  :)\n\nI would like to ask one question !!! I mean it !!!\n\nPlease Answer if you know for sure (\"Know for sure\" like when you think you will be safe facechecking that brush{{champion:107}} )\n\n\nWill my MMR(invisible{{champion:17}} ) decay if I wait until the End of Season 2015 and do my placement match just before ?  Or  still have the advantage of my prev. Rank/MMR still in full effect + future 10 placement games near the End of the Season 2015?\n\nWould appreciate anyone's \"support\" and not running away ({{summoner:4}} into the bush).","replies":[]}
