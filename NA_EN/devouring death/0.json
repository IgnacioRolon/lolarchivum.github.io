That sh*t shouldn&#039;t matter. I can go 20/5 with Veigar, and it doesn&#039;t matter because I&#039;m a girl and should be in the kitchen. I report it every time, and no one is ever punished for it. I&#039;m sick of Riot not punishing people that should be punished. Listen to this &quot;The community votes overwhelmingly to punish racist or homophobic slurs&quot; &lt;from the lol client/site itself. Notice how sexism isn&#039;t included in that. It&#039;s completely unequal and unfair and I&#039;m tired of guys not having anything better to do than to fling mud at me for my gender. And more, I'm tired of them not getting punished for it.
