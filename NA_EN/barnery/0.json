How many towers did they take down? How many times did they ward? How many assists did they have? All of these factors contribute towards the S. \n\nIt's not impossible. I'm M6 Jinx and have 2 M7 tokens on her. I'd say just based off of the info you provided, their CS was too low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-04-30T06:34:21.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what where his assist like","replies":[]}]}
