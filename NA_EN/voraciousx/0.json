One of my biggest frustrations since the ranking system came out, as much fun as it is at times, is the reluctance of players seeking an S rank to get involved in any fights that don't serve up kills on a silver platter. Many times I've watched players wait in what would have been a 4v4 or 5v5 until the 3/4 teammates that engaged are dead, but the remaining enemies are reeeeaaaaaal low, only to go in and pick up the kills afterwards.
