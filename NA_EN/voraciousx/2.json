You get more earlier, and it works based on your level. Now people who are getting behind are still fine because they have the same or more lethality than they did previously. Perhaps you should target serrated dirk, and give it less lethality than before. From my experience serrated dirk is an AD assassin&#039;s powerspike, and is much more powerful than other half item power spikes. Killing them in lane, pushing the wave so they lose the experience, and coming back doesn&#039;t feel very good when you have a Zed on the other team who, after completing serrated dirk still has an advantage in that he can nearly one shot you with a W&gt;E&gt;Q+electrocute proc(Which electrocute may be the problem, it is a lot of damage).","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-03-19T01:46:59.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, as a Talon main, I can see the sense in nerfing duskblade passive.

A slight nerf to the lethality I feel like would be a good idea. Either that or electrocute. Although it's one of my runes so I dunno how I feel about that, but then again it might be healthier.","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-03-19T02:01:15.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atrushan2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0aimEKlv,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-03-19T01:58:33.753+0000)\n>\n> The lethality feels more powerful early than the passive imo, and helps them snowball even if behind.

But seriously lethality falls off hard late game so it has to have a good early game to compensate. I think lethality  in itself is in a pretty good state right now.","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-03-19T02:23:56.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Get Ogre Here,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0aimEKlv,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-19T02:01:15.815+0000)\n>\n> Well Lethality falls off late game because if someone gets one Cloth Armor it&#x27;s useless lol.

Get one kill against a Zed in lane though and you still have to play like a bitch pretty much. Ninja tabi from my experience keeps you alive maybe 1-2 autos more from death, whereas you don't have damage because you were trying to get tabi.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"130x","date":"2018-03-19T02:01:02.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think duskblade by itself is fine but that ward killing ability on it needs to go.
