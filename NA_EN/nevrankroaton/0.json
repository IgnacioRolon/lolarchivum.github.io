GOD IT LOOK GOOD.\r\nAND SO SMOOTH?\r\nThe fuck?\r\n\r\nLike it really feel good to look at, the borders are very pretty, it doesn&#039;t feel as raw as it was before and I think the best way to word it for me is that you modernised it while making very aesthically pleasing (The police, the tones for the borders colours, the smoothness when you click on people profile or hover their runes).\r\n\r\nGood job guys!
