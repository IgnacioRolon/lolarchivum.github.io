I put the logs into that and it said I had high ping and high packet loss, my ping was average of about 45 with high of 49 and my packet loss was around 12%, but my ping has always been around 45, I don't consider that high.  As for packet loss, I put in a log of a game where I didn't have this weird lag and I only had a packet loss of around 2%, so that is the problem.  But I don't know how to increase it.  I've already tried everything it recommends.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T19:47:59.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa I was just asking for a screenshot of the actual log reader image, but you did mention a 12% packet loss which would most likely be the source of those ping spikes. \n\nMost of the time, packet loss ends up being on the ISP side of things, but we might still be able to help out.

I don't need super specific directions but like when I go into the logs folder it has Game -R3d Logs, LeagueClient Logs, Maestro Logs, Network Logs, Patcher Logs, and Performance Logs.  All these folders have multiple log files in them too.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T01:23:16.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!

I have other logs of games that it happened in if you want to see those too.\n\nAlso, I just played a match and it didn't happen, but it has been happening the past week.  So I don't know why it would just do it some of the time but not every time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
