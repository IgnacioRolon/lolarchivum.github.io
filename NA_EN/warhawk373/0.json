Can someone tell me where to find these small updates if hey exist, because I feel like one week I can play a champion and do really good, then a couple weeks later I play the same champion and have the same build but can't do as much with it.\r\n\r\nPlease don't link the champion update page because all it shows is the REWORKED champions, not small updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T21:48:00.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The[ free rotation champions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752864-Choosing-the-Right-Champion) that make an appearance aren't necessarily due to changes made to them, but to provide a flexibility for various roles.
