The first and most likely is a program that's trying to draw over League and in the process, preventing it from running properly. Programs that create an overlay such as NZXT's CAM, Discord, Curse Voice, Overwolf, and many others are likely to cause this issue. Another possibility is that your Crossfire setup is not playing well with League, and running League with Crossfire disabled may resolve the issue. \n\nFinally, there are a number of steps in [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting), that address the other common solutions to this issue. \n\nLet me know if these steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
