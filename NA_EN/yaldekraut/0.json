I mean Nidalee is strong (and gets her own nerfs) and Gragas isn&#039;t too bad either but imo it doesn&#039;t look like Runic Echoes is too strong. All other AP junglers aren&#039;t overbearing (Elise, Diana, Fiddle etc.) and I think Devourer is much more oppressive than Runic Echoes (doesn&#039;t mean it needs nerfs, the devourer jungler seem just stronger right now). So I really would love context here because this nerf hits champions, who don&#039;t deserve the nerf...\r\n\r\n\r\nTiamat\r\nBuild Path changed to [Long Sword + Long Sword + Rejuv Bead + 350g] from [Pickaxe + Rejuv. Bead + 175g] \r\nAttack damage lowered to 20 from 30\r\nUnique Passive - Cleave added:\r\n&quot;UNIQUE Passive - Cleave: Basic attacks deal X to Y as bonus physical damage to enemies near the target on hit (enemies closest to the target take the most damage).&quot;\r\n\r\nTiamat I actually really like right now. It doesn&#039;t cleave anymore, which makes it easier to freeze lane for example. But why would you reduce the AD on the item and give the cleave stuff back. I agree Titanic is too strong but definetely not Tiamat.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-11T06:37:20.120+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"We're still seeing Runic Echoes be too effective on a range of junglers, a number of whom are building tank after finishing it.

Effectively titanic adds around 80 AD to your auto attacks from on-hit passive, which is being abused by shyvana's Q, master Yi's passive and sated devourer, yet you're nerfing the AD portion?

The item right now lacks proper levers to make it appealing to bruisers. It's used more by other classes who want to negate their \"squishiness\" and then built upon with other items that add some damage (Sterak, DMP's on-hit) rather than health stackers. I mean, if they up it's health and shift it's on-hit effects to bonus health with proper percentages, the item would be fine and would properly reward champions who look to stack health rather than 2 damage items and 3 hybrid items. These changes are not about the champions who are OP with it, it's about the classes who use it. By reducing its AD, they only hit champions who make use of it. If they compensate the item with higher numbers on other parts of it, Yi and Shyvana who don't stack health exclusively, in contrast with say, Volibear, Darius, Garen, etc, won't get as much out of it again, but it might turn out to be appealing to those who it is meant for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kwack its a crow","date":"2016-03-11T11:58:21.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Roam8lX9,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-03-11T06:37:20.120+0000)\n>\n> We're still seeing Runic Echoes be too effective on a range of junglers, a number of whom are building tank after finishing it.

It's because Cinderhulk just isn't up to par right now.\n\n15% HP just isn't enough to make it an attractive item for late game bulk. Taking this item is always worse than taking early pressure, which is offered by RE. This basically means that if you're a jungler who can opt into RE it's always a better option than Cinder just because of Cinder requiring far too much HP to equal out its effect. That's before even mentioning Warrior which is honestly just terrible.\n\nBasically I think maybe Echoes does need nerfs but it's also important to look at the weaker enchantments too.
