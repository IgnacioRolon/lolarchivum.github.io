Also rn, the passive from his W is literally best applied only as carry. You could say that he can squeeze in some value if he is top or mid if a jung ganks and he last hits a couple of minions, but even so - I can't find any way that this passive is useful or why is it even there (maybe it's just me). Maybe I'm biased, but imo with all those shields he can throw around and stack himself with spells, it kind of makes it feel like he could be made a better support, than he is top or mid.\n\n\n{{champion:82}} \nSo here is my idea (I will be naming the spells 0-4 accordingly for convenience):\n(0) - Passive is similar to the one now, he gains a shield instead of mana, but it just stays as an energy bar and is not used when he is attacked or over time and it doesn't shield him from damage until activated with a spell. He can regen it over time and when he or a nearby champion damages an enemy (maybe slower than how he currently stacks his passive to max with all 3 basic spells).\nThe shield can be activated with spells.\nIf used on an ally or himself, it will give them health shield, armor and magic resist for a couple of secs (maybe 7 or more since now it would take longer for him to stack his passive to limit), which are higher the more energy he uses and consumes 20-100% of his mana bar.\nIf used on an enemy champion it costs 0% of his energy bar and places an affliction on them, dot and enhanced spells against them/or maybe bonus magic damage on 5 (5 is the cap a single person can have and cannot be exceeded) attacks by allied champions and enhanced spells against them (duration of debuff continues even after the 5 attacks are made but it doesn't proc the bonus magic dmg ofc).\n(minions cannot gain this effect)\nMorde's energy bar doesn't fill, unless no allied champions are afflicted with this effect.\n\n(1) - Q gives him ms and his next auto attack will hit for more, regen some (0) and slow the opponent. If an allied champion or himself has the (0) effect on them, spreads (0) to the attacked enemy champion. If the enemy champion already has (0) on them, the attack becomes ranged and roots + slow after the root.\n\n(2) - W Spreads the currently accumulated (0) to an ally champion or an enemy champion, if the target already has (0) on them it spreads the effect to nearby teammates (cannot spread from enemy to ally or vice versa). Ranged insta-cast.\n\n(3) (has a higher cd than the duration of (0) is) - E Short range in an arc quick spellcast - maybe around the speed of Nami's W (imo shouldn't be insta-cast), that forces {{champion:82}} Morde stay in place while casting while also making him unable to use other spells. Deals damage and slows enemies. If any enemy champion in the area of the spell if afflicted by (0) also roots them and refreshes the duration and adds 2 more magic damage stacks of (0)(or caps them if they are already 4 or 5 stacks) and makes the spell castable a second time. If any allied champion is in the area of the spell and has (0) on them - gives them ms, adds a bit of the health shield back (it cannot exceed the maximum, which is determined by his energy bar) and also refreshes the duration of (0) on them.\n\nSecond cast (ranged) - Morde Throws his weapon on the ground (or an apparition of it, he can still attack) and whoever passes within an area of it, gets afflicted or gains (0).\nIf the second cast is activated by hitting both an ally and an enemy afflicted with (0), then also adds a slow to the area around it and gives Morde ms towards it.\n\n(4) R ranged instant cast skillshot - if it hits an ally champion - all allied champions around them also gain (0), or whoever has it - refreshes the shield and the duration (Shield cannot exceed the cap). Continues travelling until hits an enemy champion or at range end.\nEnemy cast - pulls the first enemy champion hit a bit towards Morde and stuns them if afflicted with (0), if not then a shorter stun and no pull.\n\nP.S. I would like to add that I have nearly no idea of how this will affect Master+ if implemented as is, but I think as presented above it's op. Or maybe not since the shield doesn't regenerate until the ally buff wears off... Anyway - hopefully people think about how much better and helpful Morde can become and as probably will be the case this won't be implemented, but if there is a chance that people could find inspiration and conjure new ideas from this, then maybe Morde can be reworked as support. Or at least a more often picked top. But supp would be cooler - admit it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhyvin","date":"2019-03-03T06:08:56.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the lore and tell me how we will ever get a noxian support","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-03T06:21:43.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rhyvin,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=tNj9fKvZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-03T06:08:56.208+0000)\n>\n> Read the lore and tell me how we will ever get a noxian support\n\nWith new retconned lore, of course.
