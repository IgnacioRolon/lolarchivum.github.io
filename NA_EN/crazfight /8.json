So just wondering if there is a way to check tourny code games on replay?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T21:25:12.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm AFAIK the only way to get replays is from the client itself, so you may need to be in touch with someone who was in those games to save their replay.
