While it may not seem like it could be a connection issue on your end, your champions not showing up is most likely happening because your client isn't able to grab the available list of champions for your account from the servers.\n\nEssentially this is how it works, when you buy champions that information is stored on our servers (that way you can change computers and still have all your champions). If you see that blank window where you champions should be, it means your network is trying to access the database of which champs it needs to show you. If your network isn't able to get a solid connection with our servers, it won't be able to get any of that info and won't show you anything at all!\n\nMake sure you're going through all those steps in the guide given to update your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). If those steps don't help at all, hit me back up and let me know! This is just the first step in troubleshooting, but more often than not those steps alone help fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-06-12T02:33:03.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get 30ish ping in game and live right next to Chicago, if im having problems how many other people are O.O","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-13T19:38:45.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just being next to the Servers isn't going to ensure that you have the most optimal connection! As for how many other people are having connection issues, that depends on their connection to the Server.

I for one have decent internet and I've been playing League for over a year now and this has never happened to me and my ISP is reliable when it comes to online gaming, so I beg of you to send this to most of the team workers and look through most of the coding that was implemented into the latest patch. I for one want to play League more and have no issue whatsoever. I'm a league-o-holic when it comes to playing :p.","replies":[]}]}
