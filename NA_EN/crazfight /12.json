At first, your issue sounded like a simple *ghost game* issue, but now I'm convinced that there were issues with your client communicating with the server as a whole that prevented you from reaching champ select. I recommend ensuring your local network settings are aligned with those listed on our [connection guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
