So I requested a password change and was able to log back into my account. My only fear is, how was my password for league changed? Does this mean I got into my yahoo, I personally use the same password for everything (except after this i changed all my passwords just in case), should i have any more worry for my league acc being hacked?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-25T22:19:59.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a scary notification to come across, so I highly recommend running through our account protection guide to protect your info in and outside of League.
