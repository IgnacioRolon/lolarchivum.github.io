However, I forgot the cost of the champion shard in the calculation (5040 BE total)! Note: 4800 champs cost (3840 BE) with the lost BE from the champion shard so that is still not the quickest way. So now if you are able to get 1 of each champion shard, and then only 6300 champs in capsules, and then only get the 6300 champs when the BE store is available with the mystery champion... This makes the new lowest level for all champs LEVEL 246!

Things that shouldn't be locked behind levels, in my opinion. Like the runes.\n\n- You can't even choose a generic rune page as a new player until level 8. Before that, you are automatically assigned whatever premade rune page Riot has assigned to your character.\n- After 8, you can choose from one of four premade rune pages, but you can't edit them in any way or create your own rune pages until level 11.\n- At 11, you can create a rune page and pick your keystone. But not the Inspiration path. That is locked until level 17. And you can only choose your keystone. All your other runes are automatically generated by whatever path you chose and are locked. You can't edit them until 13.\n- At 13, you can edit ALL the runes in your PRIMARY path. But the runes in your secondary path are still preassigned according to whatever path you chose and you can't change them until level 15.\n- At 15 you can finally completely edit your entire rune page. Except for the inspiration tree. Still can't use that either primary or secondary until level 17.\n\nI'm half-expecting when my friend gets to level 17 (she's not there yet) to find out that you can finally choose Inspiration then, but you can't change they inspiration keystone until 19, any of the primary runes until 21, and any of the secondary runes until 23. It is beyond stupid that they lock the rune trees for so long. My friend isn't an expert at the game after three days or anything, but she already had favorite rune abilities after about six games.

However, how does that compare to the old system? How many games would you have to play to get all the champions, with IP? Well, the total cost of champions, in IP, is the same as the current BE, 538,350, so that's the number you need to reach. For simplicity sake, I'm going to say that you play 10 games a day, you win 5 and lose 5, and each game lasts approximately 25 minutes. Each victory would grant you 75.8 IP, with each loss granting you 51.125 IP.\n\nBecuase numbers, these will be rounded to 76 and 51 IP. So, every ten games you would be earning _380 (Victory IP) +  255 (Loss IP) + 150 (first win o' the day)_, or _785 IP_. Now, _538,350 / 785_ is _717.8_. It would take you 717.8 days, or 1.96 years, of playing ten games a day, to buy all the champions. The total number of games needed, 7,718.\n\nSo, while the new system seems crazy in how much you need to grind for all the champions, don't forget the old system was pretty much the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuoco Diavolo","date":"2017-11-10T21:27:35.849+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started back in 2012 and finished off my roster just this week, though this was with about a 1 season break, I would say that if leveling wasn't capped when I started I'd be about level 3-400 so it's actually about the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayrett","date":"2017-11-10T22:14:40.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the lowest level shown, is with the BEST possible rolls from chests with every single shard to further lower the cost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Håppy","date":"2017-11-10T21:41:27.136+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have just shy of 3k games played and I have every champion except for a select few (which i could easily afford).

I totally agree with the OP. I've been playing this game for a couple of years now, my wife just started playing after this update went live.. she's currently level 5.  It's actually a LOT SLOWER to level up right now and to get champions in this new system than when I started playing a few years back. Her champion pool at level 5  of owned champions is actually a LOT less than what I have. She owns 3 champions: Brand, Caitlyn, and Garen. \n\nWhen I started, by level 5 I was able to have about 4-5 champions with the IP of the \"cheap\" champions such as annie, ashe, etc. without having to spend real money. If I bought the welcome bundle, I could have of course more champions (8 champions and a leveling boost) than she currently has right now, but she also isn't able to get the champion she really wants (she is loving Nami right now) because the amount of essences she is receiving isn't matching up to speed. In fact, She hit level 5, got her first champion capsule and that's how she got caitlyn.. but it spent ALL her essences to unlock her (2.8k of the ones she got out of the capsule) .\n\nnow, I'm not going to do all the math, but in order to get the champion she really enjoys playing right now, Nami, she's not only suffering the fact that RNG will have to dictate when she gets the shard, but also how slow and tiny blue essences are currently coming. \n\nThe upcoming change to the first win of the day isn't going to help that much I fear as well. You go from 525 xp (great for us older players) to 400 and 25? essences.  zoe will be out soon, and will cost 7.3k? essences on release.. at the current rate of gaining blue essences, as stated above, it will actually take LONGER and the play experience for new players like my wife, will more than likely cause them to not continue to play the game for long. \n\nI really hope that riot is taking our concerns and not just focusing on \"oh the math is right\" because math may be right, but player experience is what they should care about. Loot crates work in games like Overwatch and heroes because the PLAY experience is what keeps people interested in playing.

What a pain it is going to be to finish getting all the champs but it sucks even more for the noobs 400 level ups leveling to 30 sucked. League is getting to that point were it is hard to stay with the game. The game was awesome before the new rune and I am giving it time to see if the game still fits my taste but it doesn't look like it. Riot if I can ask, allow me to get blue essence every game so I can buy all champs. I am so Close.\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"jama655","date":"2017-11-11T03:44:56.618+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"shoulda played more before the patch damn job","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-11-10T21:34:42.980+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now calculate how much time that would take at a typical rate of play with first win of the days and like 3 additional games per day.\n\nI think the old system was something like 5 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2017-11-11T14:41:34.241+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"it took me YEARS to freely obtain all champions in this game with the old system. right now its easier than it has ever been to get new champions, especially with champion shards which i WISH i had when i was first starting out the game back in 2012. \n\nwhat people want is for all the champions to be free like they are in OW, but people forget that you paid $30($60 when it launched) for the game and those characters.  you paid $0 to join league.","replies":[{"poster":"UB3R 1337 H4X","date":"2017-11-11T18:53:04.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, yes, but if you wanted to buy all the characters in league it would cost 700$~. \n\nThe way I see it, there are three ways you can go about sating the complaints people have\n\n-The DotA/OW method and make everything free from the get go, and by the way, sod off with your \"league is free\" bullshit because DotA is too\n\n-The SMITE method and make a reasonably priced bundle of all the champions.
