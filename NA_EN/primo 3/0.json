They said that they need to verify my account ownership by providing details of the first 5 champions i purchased and like my first refunded champions or skins. I created my account around 4-5 years ago and i definitely haven't make note of those because how can people remember these sort of things. So i don't know what should i do and i have also verified my email address so this is definitely the email address that i use for my account. I think that Riot should introduce security questions like what is your favorite food and like where is your favorite place to go and i think that is so much better.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T19:00:35.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Our account team won't restore an account unless they are absolutely sure it's going to the owner.  Even if you don't make it through the first time, it's okay to try again!  Do your best to answer the questions to the best of your ability, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Milutin","date":"2017-01-03T19:31:59.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the problem, you're wasting your own time and someone else's instead of providing more secure measures that are by far more logical than remembering first champs/skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Milutin","date":"2017-01-03T19:31:14.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with you!\nIt is ridiculous to have to remember who are the first champs or skins we bought, considering we are players from a few years ago.","replies":[]}]}
