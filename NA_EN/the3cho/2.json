After a while of being inactive (not changing runes/masteries, not in store, etc.), the View Profile button AS WELL AS the View Profile option on friends/recently played/etc. do not work whatsoever.  This however isn&#039;t permanent, as I&#039;m able to log out and back in to fix this no problem; BUT, it will happen again after logging in and being inactive.  \n\nIt&#039;s a rather minor bug probably, but, it&#039;s pretty annoying having to log out and back in over and over only to have it happen again.\n\nEDIT: It's happening even WHILE I'm doing stuff in game.","replies":[{"poster":"snakebiter","date":"2016-10-27T04:54:21.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same i have to use op.gg to see the profiles of other people, dont be lazy ritoo fix please {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeX 00","date":"2015-05-25T14:01:12.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here","replies":[]}]}
