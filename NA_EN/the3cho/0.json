An update on when this feature comes back is greatly appreciated. (That said, if it&#039;s never coming back, then, please remove that gift box in post game lobby that&#039;s always grey&#039;d out...it&#039;s just giving me false hope here...)\n\nP.S. I'd rather not go back to the old client...no way to save my replays.","replies":[{"poster":"CptMojang","date":"2017-10-21T23:21:09.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump from the far-future...
