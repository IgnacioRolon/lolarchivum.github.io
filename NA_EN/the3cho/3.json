Personally, I love the threat of being the biggest target for assassins because then I&#039;m forced to actually learn to adapt and prepare for each potential one shot.  Honestly, isn&#039;t learning to adapt the entire POINT of winning games?  If you die, that&#039;s your fault FIRST (yes, I have accounted for trolls and ragers).  \r\n\r\nAs a support, it&#039;s your job to make sure your team can do their job...and it starts in lane with your ADC partner.  I can&#039;t do it alone, sure; but, again: it&#039;s about adapting to each game.  You can&#039;t win every game, but, you sure as hell can make things go smoother each time.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds upon hundreds of guides and tips on what you can do.  Mechanically, I&#039;m definitely low elo with how clumsy I am in game, but, I keep wanting to learn.  You are in control of yourself and nobody else.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve heard life begins at the end of your comfort zone...but I also believe life ends the day you stop wanting to learn.\r\n\r\n(Off topic, but, any grammar nazis that happen to read this, please tell me what mistakes I&#039;ve made in this post!
