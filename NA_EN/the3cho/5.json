(Gauging the System)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Before I go on, I want to make it clear that I am **NOT** complaining about the Instant Feedback system.\r\n\r\nI'm in mid-silver this season (as usual) and I get a lot of ragers and people just constantly giving up/int'ing. Naturally, I do report every person I see being just a headache and making the game unproductive. The rate at which I report is probably 2-3 a day, daring to believe the system works.\r\n\r\nWhat surprises me is this: I get an Instant Feedback a minimum of FIVE A WEEK. I log in for the day - I get a notification. Come out of a game - another notification. I don't know what to make of this number, so that's why I'm making this post. \r\n\r\nLike the title, really want to know: how often do you guys get a feedback report after reporting someone? Am I actually reporting correctly or am I just unlucky enough to have people like this cross me? Or is this just a normal volume of Instant Feedback reports to get?\r\n\r\nI love this game and I want to do the best I can. I honestly am not looking to condemn {{champion:67}}  people at all, but I'm not going to pass on the chance to stop someone from making the game a worse experience for the next person that has to queue with this person.\r\n\r\nPS: Yes, I do report \"ggez.\" If you're the type to do so, knock it off. You won. We lost. Making your opponent feel worse is a form of toxicity we don't need.","replies":[{"poster":"DJColdCutz","date":"2019-04-16T01:48:36.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only get like 1 every couple months, which is weird, because run into so many trolls/toxic people every day that I have to report.
