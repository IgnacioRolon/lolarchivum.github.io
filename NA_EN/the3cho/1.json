Entering the series tho, I began on a big downward spiral and, while it&#039;s not a big deal to go back to silver 4 compared to people who drop all the way to the bottom (or worse), what IS a big deal is that I&#039;ve realized my biggest flaw being unable to analyze a team fight&#039;s progress fast enough to react properly.  It&#039;s not just burst where everything happens in 2 seconds, but, extended team fights with an assassin all over the carries and our frontline out forward.\n\nBecause of this, I either find myself running with full HP only to realize I&#039;m not the focus; or can&#039;t find the primary target in time only to get bursted myself.\n\nNow, I&#039;m not going to make any kind of excuse about bad teams because I KNOW that ranked at this level should be more about developing good gameplay patterns and gaining game knowledge.  \n\nIn short, I&#039;m in need of some advice and practice techniques to be able to read a team fight as fast as I can. I might be overreaching and should just learn from mistakes more effectively, but, advice on that is gladly accepted as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Loli Lulu","date":"2015-09-13T22:12:47.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team fights can be big and messy, making it hard to keep track of every little thing. Sometimes you'll have to make split second decisions. The first step I think would be to know your Champion/role and what your job in a teamfight is. While very general, below are some tips or questions you could ask yourself based on your role:\n\n**Burst mage** - Is there an enemy nearby you can safely take out of the fight quickly and make a quick getaway?\n**Sustained damage mage/ADC** - Position yourself safely and chip away at whoever is closest to you. Priority goes to enemy high-value targets (squishy ADC/mage/assassin), but don't sacrifice your positioning too much unless you can make a play.\n**Tank** - Where can you create the most havoc and soak up enemy damage? Up in enemy squishy's face? If you have utility, maybe you want to sit back and peel a bit if enemy assassins are in your carry's face.\n**Utility/Support** - Who is doing the most damage on your team? Who is under threat? Which enemy is the biggest threat to who you're protecting?\n\nIf the team fight is turning sour, and you don't think you can pick anything else up, sometimes a strategic retreat is the best option. Better not to give your enemies any more free kills. Also, try not to tunnel-vision to hard on a single target. I think the more you play, the more you'll get used to the mess and you'll be able to stay calm and sort out the biggest priorities.","replies":[]}]}
