The problem is I&#039;m not sure if my reports are getting through anymore.\r\n\r\nThere have been people that 100% deserve to get reported in my games, but, I&#039;m curious as to the instant feedback system not appearing at all.\r\n\r\nBasically, I&#039;m curious to know if there&#039;s a way to find out if my reports are being ignored for the amount of reports I&#039;ve sent already.  If they are, well, I don&#039;t blame them.  Either way, I&#039;ll try to better man here and keep my mouth shut for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Itankyou","date":"2016-09-12T04:12:07.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you report every game your report 'mojo' decreases. Try reporting less and having fun with the game, just forget that the option is there for like 3 games and when someone says something particularly shitty that's when you report them. You will receive more assists this way.
