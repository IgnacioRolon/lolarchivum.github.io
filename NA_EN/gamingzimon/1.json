But&#039;s only half true, they don&#039;t wanna conquer land cause they are bloodthirsty murderous, they do it cause their land is made of rock and iron, no farm land and barely any trading materials. \nAnd when I saw that comic made about Darius, I was instantly thinking &quot;they are way to nice to thief children and way to friendly to other villages&quot;. \nAll they do is asking for help by other countries to help them achieve their goals, if they threaten Noxus, they bring arms and makes examples of those who deny them, doe they doesn&#039;t really make war with anyone except those who want war (Demacia and Inoia). \nPiltover and Zaun is left untouched on the radar cause they are the only trading centers. Noxus don&#039;t care about cities, since they only want farm land. \n\nDemacia on the other hand has a whole lot of stupid rules, strict punishments to those who break them, and their reason to fight Noxus is just plain revenge for their king (who was killed by Sion). \n\nWe can count Shadowisles as the most evil country, but honestly. It&#039;s only the outsiders like Mordekazer, Hecarim and Elise that makes Shadow isles, evil. \nThere&#039;s thresh too which I totally count as the Most evil guy in all of LoL. But one guy doesn&#039;t really count. It&#039;s almost just as J4&#039;s father and Cassopiea.  \nIf we count all the good guys in Shadowisles, who try to keep the humans and nature safe. Moakai, Kalista and Yorick. I don&#039;t see the isles as any bad at all.\n\nI probobly need more theories to back this up. But Honestly just like Solaris and Lunaris, it&#039;s the once who act like &quot;good guys&quot; who are the &quot;bad guys&quot;.\n\nEdit: Wooo Thx for all the responses, makes me understand this world much more. I kinda love Swain's concept and how similar he sounds like my life :D I wanna be a politic leader too someday..

Look at the first people who arrived to america, building up the united states by driving away the native people and using black people as slaves.\nAnd so like scathlocke says heros in their own stories are the evil of other stories. Noxus, Demacia, Freljord, Shurima all tend to increase their area to rule. Freljord is split and while Ashe tries a more peaceful reign, Sejuani wants to build up Freljord with Strength and is similar to Noxus and Demacia in some ways while still beeing their enemy.\nShurima tends for me to be a more \"evil\" place considering that it is beside other things alos based on old Egypt, which holded Slaves to build their archecture. Now you wonder who the Sundisk built or who the Soldiers on Azirs and his fathers empire were. Ofcourse Azir himself and for a higher class is a hero. If i remember correctly Talijah still is going back to egypt cause she senses danger and probably knows what will come back with Azirs Empire.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-03-13T23:52:08.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanna watch me piss everyone off?\n\nSo, slavery. A terrible practice, however, I usually don't place it too highly on the \"this makes society evil\" list, because if I did literally every single culture that made any impact on history would fail that test.  Slavery was useful, it was, in fact, the only way to develop your economic system until about the Industrial Period.  The only exceptions would be cultures that had \"not slaves\" that fulfilled the same purpose, like serfs, or vernai.  It's all the same, it's a nominally hereditary position that has restricted rights used to propagate the economy of whatever institution they serve.  \n\nNow, that stops being a necessity about midway through industrialization.  And that's where it starts rising higher and higher on my list.\n\nConquest itself is usually a marker of political and social factors.  It's messy, but still a necessity.  \n\nSo usually I place the notion of \"evil\" cultures when the violence and subjugation inherent in the system reach a point where it actually serves no purpose beyond terror or notions of superiority.  Even worse, when it actually hurts the economy and social systems that these acts are supposed to improve.\n\nIn that situation, the first people to arrive in the Americas don't count in some places.  But most certainly do in others.  There's a range, the Conquistadors seemed to have mostly looted and destroyed everything they could their hands on, until a later governing body popped up after.  While, for example, Jamestown reads more like two political bodies sniping at each other.  Where everyone is stupid.  I'm serious, go read the Jamestown accounts, and you will see this patter happen repeatedly: Europeans and Natives make some mutually beneficial agreement.   Europeans break their promise.  Natives respond with extreme force.  Europeans and Natives make some mutually beneficial agreement.  Natives break their promise.  Europeans respond with extreme force.Europeans and Natives make some mutually beneficial agreement... you get it. It's a cycle of stupidity.  \n\nNow that is certainly not the case come a few centuries later, when the Trail of Tears happens along with mass plantation slavery.  Slavery no longer being a necessity of a developing nation, and the forced migration of a people actually drastically hurts the economic potential of the territory they were moved through and into.  You can (and I have) made the claim that this is a period where the nation's actions could be classified as evil.\n\nThat's why I list the ones I list.  I could maybe add the Aztec, because from what I've read they seem about par with the Mongols when it comes to terror for the sake of terror.  But I have not studied them as thoroughly, so I usually leave them off the list.","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-03-14T00:42:28.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Wanna watch me piss everyone off?\n\nReminds the on that one Hashinshin stream he recently had with \"wanna hear me insult every european country\" where he used realy much historical, religious and political knowledge XD\n\nThe question is: why you did that. just for fun or knowledge? Or proof that us has no dark history? Seeing that cia had weakened and overthrown many, many states that once had stable governments and now chaos or worse dictators just for the sake of oil:\nYea it build up the economy and usa sees themself as heroes. But again back to the original statement (which you also didn't proof wrong, jsut clarified): evil is seen diffrent depending where you stay. Just so america and maybe europe too can get cheap oil to make chaos in nearly every arabic state: i suppose the most people see america not as a \"good\" country considering how easy the is even kidna can recruit people cause of this chaos.\n\n> he only way to develop your economic system until about the Industrial Period. \n\nnow that is a realy, realy vauge statement. First of, you can't tell if something else happens, all is hypothetical. Second, slavery kinda worse as low paid workers and siefs considering that whole whipping thing and the lack of territorial conques. Like serfs had also the church or their own religion and it was that you were born like that and needed to aczept. Also you lived with the family still and raping was far rare. Slavery comes from a conquest to another country or continent and abducting individuals, spliting famalys up all while the people who were made had not some relgional believ that was right but just wondered where the hell these people came from and why they are so cruel (racism often).\nThat was slavery in africa, slavery ofcourse also happened after wars often but there the consequences were kinda clear. still, there was whipping and probably rapping too, happened not so much to serfs.\nNot saying midage in europe was all fine, witchhunt and racism vs jews believing they poisoned the wells when the plague happened... cruel things. And definetly not helping the economy beside the people who sold torchs and straw.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2018-03-14T11:49:01.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=eAjTlirU,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-03-13T19:11:34.402+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s &quot;the evil place&quot; in the real world?\n> \n> No one wakes up in the morning, tweaks their mustache, and says &quot;Heh heh heh, how can I be the most evil today?!&quot; :-P Everyone is the hero of their own story.\n\nIf we talk about Planet Earth specific, currently its North Korea and a part of the Middle East.
