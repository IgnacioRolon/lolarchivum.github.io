My other friend who also was in the conversation wanted to read it but got that &quot;reading sickness&quot; which make him very sick when he read long texts, pretty much all his reading comes from CD&#039;s or assistants that read out loud. Now I would do it myself if he was interested,  but cause his sickness he rather stay away from all the lore and stuff. Which made this conversation me and my first friend were having a bit awkward. \r\n\r\nSo I was thinking, &quot;isn&#039;t there a way for people to click to get the full extended version in voice?&quot; I searched and found none, I did find on Youtube, but those voices felt so boring to listen to. \r\n\r\nSo here Ima asking, can we get some dramatic Voice for every rework, visual update and new champion spotlight? It should feel real when you read the lore, just take Smite for ex. Their spotlights they do voice out the lore dramatically before they show off they God&#039;s abilities. I&#039;m Riot should add a extra long intro on the spotlight, neither another video filled with lore. But just an voice button you can click on when you view the lore on the website.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-26T21:51:55.684+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there - I'd never heard of reading sickness other than in a car/while travelling, so that really sucks. Speaking as someone who reads and writes professionally AND for fun, I can't even imagine what that must be like for your friend! :-(\n\nLore-to-voice is certainly something I'd love to experiment with. So many player-contributors out there on YouTube etc already do this, as you said, and it certainly adds something to the lore experience, when properly produced. I'm going to bring your post to a meeting I have booked for later - I can't promise it'll happen tomorrow, but if we had complete freedom to experiment then it'd be great to at least try some of this and see what the reaction is among players/lore heads.","replies":[{"poster":"GamingZimon","date":"2018-03-29T19:40:37.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, good sir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2018-03-27T04:44:54.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can vouch, as I also experience this.
