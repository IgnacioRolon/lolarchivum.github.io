I use mouse button 1 (left click) to attack move on my main.  I've been using this setup for years now with no problem.  Today i tried to edit the settings on my smurf to allow left click, but couldn't for the life of me get it to work.  I've tried deleting the persisted settings file and making input read-only.  It seems like no matter what i do, i can't edit any settings from the input file, whether it be on my main or smurf.  Luckily my main hasn't had any settings get changed throughout all of this, but this is extremely frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"LORD TRONER","date":"2017-09-17T02:33:22.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so .. i was trying to do the same thing!  i have been playing LOL with default settings but heard that changing to attack move was better.  I saved input file ( althouth i have no idea if my changes are any good or correct xD)  but settings didnt change. Did you guys found the problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-25T21:48:51.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your config could be corrupt, so your settings aren't saving to our servers.  Deleting the persisted settings is a solid step towards getting your config reset.  You're missing a piece to that, though, as you also have to delete game.cfg.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nTry that out in whole, and let me know if it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Srs","date":"2017-04-27T03:56:10.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and honestly, i'm scared to even mess with it at this point. I don't want to somehow undo the settings on my main and be unable to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T15:13:49.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable, but we'd like to keep helping!
