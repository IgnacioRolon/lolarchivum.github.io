It seems whenever a new patch is released it happens. My right click will work, occasionally, the problem is, it takes about 10 clicks for it to do anything. The problem came back to me randomly during a ranked game. (I was playing Riven, imagine how annoyingly difficult it is to lane when your most reliable way of moving is your e and q). Since then, right clicking in game has been terrible. I've already patched the client, deleted the input file from the league of legends folder and did a custom game to restore it to the original settings - nothing has changed. On a side note, I play using a laptop and no mouse.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2017-01-13T15:37:18.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to get a new mouse when mine did this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T05:44:31.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you notice any other strange symptoms like your abilities not going off during this time or you/other champions or minions are teleporting or almost \"fast-forwarding\" around the map?","replies":[{"poster":"Vier","date":"2017-01-13T08:04:23.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I experience exactly what you said, also sometimes it says \"Attempting to Reconnect\" after the unresponsiveness.
