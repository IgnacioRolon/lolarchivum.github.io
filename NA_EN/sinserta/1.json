At about 15 minutes in, every single game, I randomly disconnect, and when I reconnect, I'll be able to play for about another minute then I will be forced to dc again for some reason. Anyone have any similar problems or solutions? I currently have ATT Internet (Sadly all they have in my current area). And every other game works fine. It's just league that is doing this to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T03:59:29.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that's happening on the clock every 15 min and then a min after each time, it might have something to do with your ISP.
