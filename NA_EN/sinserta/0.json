And today I logged on during a ranked and it was hardstuck 50. Now, I'm sure everyones going to say the same \"You can only see 60fps with human eyes\", and my return is... it felt like i was in a constant lag. It just didn't work. I couldn't even last hit properly. I have the fps set to uncapped, and after windows 10 installed a new update, it won't go past 60, no matter what. It's rough for me. Any advice on how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T04:18:18.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm you mentioned a recent Windows 10 update? Most of the time those updates will automatically turn the Xbox Game DVR stuff back on which is known to cause some FPS issues.
