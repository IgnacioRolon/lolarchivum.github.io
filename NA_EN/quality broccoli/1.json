After doing one of those, you'll move onto the daily quest for the day. For instance: Thursday's Order missions was Get 5 kills with an Order icon equipped, while Friday's mission was Collect 15,000 gold with an Order icon equipped.\n> \n> I can't give away what the rest of the daily missions are, but there are a few different mission requirements coming up!\n\nSo I am looking around and have seen a few reds stating that you get 3 daily missions, each showing up after you complete the previous. \nI am only getting two a day, rather then what seems to be stated as three. wondering If I am just misunderstanding or if it isn't working, would be said to think that I could have been getting more the last few days without even realizing it, because I have been playing a ton. also note, I bought both passes and have finished all the missions from them, don't know if that affects it in anyway. if anybody knows plz let me know, or just let me know how many missions you are getting daily for comparison.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T22:19:33.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 3 daily missions I was referring to included the initial mission \"In the beginning...\". At first I was told this mission would return each day, only to realize later on that this was not in fact correct. Thanks for the heads up so I could edit that post with the correct information!","replies":[]}]}
