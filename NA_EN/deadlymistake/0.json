Lately, during my solo/duo ranked games, I have been encountered by players who are intentionally feeding, leaving intentionally and bad sportsmanship. I am aware these players are found throughout the game of League of Legends and many other games, but I can&#039;t help but feel that I have been placed with these players due to an all of a sudden losing streak and unfortunately that losing streak does not end.\r\n\r\nPlease review this riot. I am suffering in solo/duo ranked games. They are not fun when playing with players who do not take ranked seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-04-01T01:20:15.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot cant force a change of mindset of immature people.","replies":[{"poster":"KS King Kench","date":"2017-04-01T02:52:25.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RÃ²ssy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EBpc21i2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-01T01:20:15.201+0000)\n>\n> Riot cant force a change of mindset of immature people.\n\ni think what he is wanting is for riot to place him/her with at least some ppl who are able to hold their own in game... he/she doesn't want to be constantly stuck with sucky ppl because they lost a few","replies":[{"poster":"DeadlyMistake","date":"2017-04-01T12:37:15.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not exactly, what I'm saying is that the ranked system can be fixed by not grouping up people who are on losing streaks together.
