That elo is pretty much same as bronze, because that's where brand new inexperienced level 30 accounts start.\n\nUntil you get to Gold 5, where people are much serious and experienced at the game, play champions that can duel or 1v2 the best (ie.. Master yi, Shadow assassin Kayn, Riven, Yasuo, Fizz, and Vayne). After you get to gold 5, you may begin to adapt to the meta. After plat 3, only play meta. At D3, devote your entire life to playing league and you'll get to D2.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr White","date":"2018-01-25T16:32:41.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gold V last season, got put silver 4 after placements so will probably get back there reasonably soon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-01-25T02:53:40.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for one thing, feed your teammates. if youre 4/0, but your teammate is 2/3, and either one of you can get the kill, then just back off. all you would be getting is a further lead, but if the enemy team is competent enough to focus you, the rest of the team just falls apart because they can be so behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-01-25T02:44:30.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, reasonable KDA doesn't translate to carrying a game. It just means you pulled your fair weight. When I think carrying, I think of a Kat who snowballed hard to the point of one-shotting everyone, or an ADC that simply got super fed. It's really not something just anyone is capable of doing without smurfing. Otherwise, everyone would just do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-25T02:35:01.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vel'koz support.\n\nNo one expects the void inquisition.","replies":[]}]}
