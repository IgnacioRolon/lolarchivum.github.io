It has nothing to do with security, it has everything to do with using effort more efficiently. Porting a game to *nix is a significant undertaking and then management of that code adds to the maintenance burden. People complain about how long it takes to fix bugs now, imagine if they needed to fix them for three platforms, instead of one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFate","date":"2020-02-18T05:51:10.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet they ported it to MacOs a Unix based OS","replies":[{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2020-02-18T07:08:21.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFate,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=MjGqdygr,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-02-18T05:51:10.229+0000)\n>\n> And yet they ported it to MacOs a Unix based OS\n\nBecause mac users are by the norm.. normies and sound engineers.\nlinux users are a lot more ballsy in number compared.. we compile what you download.\n\n\nas a power user a mac is the last thing on my list to get a job done.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-18T09:17:37.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that the number of Linux users who are into gaming and yet don't have a Windows machine is probably near zero.

Do you know where there's a group of hardcore Linux fans? Microsoft. That's why they're doing so much with WSL and open source.","replies":[{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2020-02-18T10:26:28.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=MjGqdygr,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2020-02-18T10:13:12.419+0000)\n>\n> There's a difference between liking one thing and disliking another thing.
