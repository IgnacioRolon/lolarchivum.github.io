I'm located in NE and I have Time Warner Cable internet.  I've tried resetting my router and having a technician from TWC come out to fix the connection.\nAlso, the lag is really weird sometimes, where the only thing affected is whether I can move/use abilities.  I can still see everyone else moving and I can type messages.\nAlthough other times I just randomly disconnect from the game for about 30ish seconds.  I don't really know what to do to fix it beyond what I've tried already. Any suggestions?\nAlso, I'm using a wired connection, not wifi.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-09-03T09:10:43.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I recommend following the troubleshooting guide on [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/205238344-NA-Server-Move-FAQ), and if that doesn't help then send us a [Player Support request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your logs. :)","replies":[{"poster":"2Grim4U","date":"2015-09-04T15:34:18.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=2o2,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=pwj1T3yt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-03T09:10:43.409+0000)\n>\n> I recommend following the troubleshooting guide on [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/205238344-NA-Server-Move-FAQ), and if that doesn't help then send us a [Player Support request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your logs. :)\n\nplease stop suggesting this, it never works.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KillerKills1","date":"2015-09-03T18:55:22.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having this problem.

I did send you a player support request with my logs and basically got back a generic \"we are working on it\" response, which I appreciate but as of right now I am completely unable to play the game.  It just seems from searching these forums that there are many people having this issue but there doesn't seem to be a direct response from riot about whats being done about it.  I could be wrong but I mean this seems to be affecting a large number of people and it has honestly cost me in ranked a couple times now. I am not getting any loss prevented so there is no point in playing anymore until I see some indication that something is being done to help resolve the situation.","replies":[]}]}
