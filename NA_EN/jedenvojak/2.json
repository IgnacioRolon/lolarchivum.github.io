Why does every mage need to have a skillshot?_\nW - Flat damage reduced, Cooldown increased, ap ratio reduced, mana scaling reduced, duration higher at first level but lower at max level\n**Verdict: Nerf**. _They just really don&#039;t like reliable CC abilities in this game I guess._\nE - Cooldown halfed, flat damage reduced, ap scaling reduced, guarenteed second bounce, but that second bounce damage is about half of the initial hit damage.\n**Verdict: ???? **- _This is a very weird change that&#039;s hard to quantify; due to the semi random nature of the ball, the floor of the updated ability is higher but the ceiling is lower - This is a Gankplank ult style change which is hard to rate. I would say, if you were regularly getting one hit off of this ability, its a buff, but if you were getting 2 or 3 hits (on one guy) consistantly, than it&#039;s a nerf._\nR - Cooldown passive here, which goes up to 30%, duration reduced, cooldown reduced\n**Verdict: Nerf**. Why?\n_30% Cooldown reduction provided as a passive when core items already provide cooldown reduction, means that cooldown reduction on core items is a wasted stat. A 10 second less cooldown on ult does not make up for a 1 second less duration on ult - his ult is worse with no meaningful compensation._\n\n**Overall Thoughts:** Ryze got his mana scalings across the board lowered, and had extra cooldown added into his kit, and while the ap scaling of one of his abilities (his Q) has gone up, the ap scalings for his other abilities were reduced, perhaps to emphasize his \"windowed moment of power\" moment especially with the cooldown reduction on E. Given from the changes they&#039;ve made to him (lowering mana ratios and giving him a higher flat cooldown) they don&#039;t like Ryze building, or don&#039;t want Ryze to build these: {{item:3110}} {{item:3025}} and want him to bulid more magey items - but Ryze still has super high mana costs (100 mana on W and E) combined with that cooldown reduction on the E, I don&#039;t know how sustainable that really is. Also, without the armor from those items, I feel like he might not be tanky enough in the later game when he has to move into range to use said abilities.\n\nPerhaps the intention is to make Ryze a champion that sort of function in cycles so that you just spam Q&#039;s until you&#039;re \"powered up\" then go to town, then drop back to useless mode for a while so you spam more Qs. In other words, Ryze is now being made into a skillshot spamming mage, which we&#039;ve certainly never seen before.\n\n**EDIT: **It has been pointed out to me that I appear to have misread Ryzes updated Spell Flux - rather than hitting the initial target once and bouncing around before hitting him one last time, it would appear that after hitting the initial target, it bounces out to a number of secondary targets simultaneously, and back to the initial target for half the initial hit damage each. As such, it looks like Spell Flux actually got a pretty nice buff, rather than a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-10T21:05:00.760+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"They should make delay on Ryze rune prison to compensate for no DFG.

Sure, the secondary targets might take less damage, but the primary target is going to get REKT, especially if they're in the middle of a minion wave or their team.\n\nFrom what I read of the E, the change that was made is that it will hit the primary target, hit a number of nearby secondary targets (exactly 1 time each) before bouncing back to the primary target again at 50% damage. This means that it will hit the primary target exactly 2 times, and the second time will hit for half the damage of the initial hit.\n\nAs I posed up above, if you only ever hit your enemy in one bounce (the initial hit) its a buff, but in any circumstance where you would hit your initial target 2 or 3 times, and if you could reliably do that, it's a nerf.\n\nIt's the difference of 1.5x damage verses the old 1x,2x,3x damage paradigm.\n\n> Also, it bothers me how everyone always calls skillshots massively disadvantageous over targeted abilities. They both have their strengths and weaknesses. Having more range and damage isn't bad, it just means you have a chance to succeed and a chance to fail. \n\nSkillshots are massively disadvantageous over targeted abilities. What's better, a 1000 range skillshot or a 1000 range targeted ability: the answer is clear, the targeted ability. The chance to fail is exactly what makes it worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-04-11T05:06:11.768+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They want to add counterplay.

The key thing to remember here is that these nerfs aren't just number tweaks, but mechanical changes that allow Riot to buff him in healthy ways in the future. The passive isn't always on anymore, but now they can tweak how much it gives him in those short windows. Q is a skillshot now, yes that is a nerf, but it means they can mess around with the damage it deals, the cooldown it has, the range, width, etc. W is a flat nerf, E feels like a flat nerf, mainly because it deals a lot less damage in a 1v1 than before (they need to increase the secondary range by at least 50% for it to be useful really, and they already buffed the number of secondary targets it hits today). R Having CDR actually increases his build diversity allowing him to build something *other* than frozen heart third item every match, now he can go for a Lich bane, or a void staff, or something else instead, which is a much bigger boon than the fact that FH becomes overkill after level 16.\n\nThis is all about changing Ryze's balance levers so that Riot has more to work with. Before these changes go through, Ryze's balance levers are:\n\n* Passive: amount of CDR given on casts.\n* Q: base damage, AP Ratio, Mana Ratio, cooldown, CDR given, range.\n* W: base damage, AP Ratio, Mana Ratio, cooldown, root duration, range.\n* E: base damage, AP Ratio, Mana Ratio, cooldown, number of bounces, range of bounces, MR shredded, duration of shred.\n* R: cooldown, spell vamp, move speed, duration, AoE range, AoE damage ratio.\n\nNow, Ryze will have at least these levers:\n\n* Passive: number of stacks before activation, duration of stacks before resetting, CDR given by cast during activation, mana shield base amount, mana shield ratio, minimum cooldown of spells during activation.\n* Q: base damage, AP Ratio, Mana Ratio, cooldown, range, projectile width, projectile speed.\n* W: base damage, AP Ratio, Mana Ratio, cooldown, range, root duration.\n* E: base damage, AP Ratio, Mana Ratio, cooldown, range, max number of secondary targets, range of secondary bounces, MR shredded, duration of shred, damage of secondary bounce, damage of return bounce.\n* R: CDR given, cooldown, spell vamp, move speed, duration, AoE range, AoE damage ratio.\n\nNow, I'm probably missing a few from both lists, but it is undeniable that the new Ryze has many more tuning levers than current Ryze, and that means they can give him more power without immediately making him pick or ban, or if necessary take away some power without making him absolutely useless again.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-04-10T23:07:53.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thing is, we already have a bunch of super complicated skillshot based mages with 8-bajillion tuning levers; Ryze doesn't need to be this way.\n\nAs a champion, Ryze is like a revolver - he works.

The issue with competative is that the types of champions they like to use/are successful with tend to be very mobile bursty champions or champs who can generate picks (granted, this is going from the LCS I watched last year, haven't watched any LCS at all this season) and Ryze shuts those types of champions down hard. And even then, I still saw losing games with Ryze because even though he's reliable, he's very weak early game: he basically is a magicarp champion.\n\nWe will have to agree to disagree on the fun part. I absolutely hate skillshots with a passion - I spent the mana, I put the ability on cooldown, and it doesn't have any CC whatsoever only damage, it should WORK. But on top of those things, the enemy can just stand behind some minions, or use some dash or displacement to negate my ability? That's not even remotely fun.\n\nAs for the banned problem, that would be easily solved by eliminating bans from ranked matches. In fact, I think that would be a good idea just for general play, as people would be forced to play against those \"OP\" champs and learn how to fight them and develop counters, rather than Riot needing to step in with knee-jerk nerfs because people are getting destroyed and haven't developed a counter strategy yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-04-11T00:52:34.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What made Ryze so strong in season 4 was that he could bully out many toplaners with a point and click nuke. Stay safe and farm up and then have one of the strongest lategames due to his ability to output AOE dps. Only after the nerfs to his Q would I consider him a Magikarp early game. Before the nerfs he could hit you with 80 (60 base + scaling) damage every 2 seconds at level 1. Junglers had to shut Ryze down before he could complete RoA or he would be a huge problem. Even without kills, Ryze can generate enough income to complete his core build before anyone else. He was only somewhat weak in the midgame teamfights when he was stacking mana and before he finished his RoA, Archangels, FH combo. \n\nHe was way too reliable as a pick for this reason. Champions shouldn't be overly reliable _and_ strong at the same time. This change allows Ryze to be strong because they take away some of the reliability. He now has power windows to work into his laning, he actually has wave clear without using his ult, he can build his Tear much faster than before BECAUSE his Q is a skillshot, and he has more options in his build path (doesn't have to build FH for the CDR). I think this gives Ryze the option to become a stronger champion than he was before. He still has a point and click root and his E is much more reliable and will do MORE damage if the target is near his minions if you're worried about hitting a target in a crowd of minions with his Q. Just use your E instead (still point and click). \n\nMy first champion I picked up was Ryze. I loved the tanky close range mage idea, but I eventually started to get bored with him. He was strong and I could win with him, but I would rather play Gragas or Sion (post rework) because of how much more there was to do with their kits. I can work to master a champion like Grag or Sion by improving on my ability to make choices with their abilities, enhance my accuracy with their skill shots, and incorporate different items into their build. The biggest choice you had as a Ryze was \"should I Q _then_ go for my W or should I just W first to make sure I lock them down and then use my other abilities. You master the mechanical aspects of Ryze very quickly, and his build doesn't change subbing possibly one item. \n\nI understand the need for mechanically simple champions for new players, but one skillshot isn't going to overcomplicate things for a new player. Yes, it will be harder to hit, but the kit is fairly simple. The passive isn't overly complicated; any new player will understand that if you spam your abilities, you will get a short powerspike. But as they keep playing the champion, they can learn to hold off on abilities to maximize the use of their passive when they are ready. They will also learn about skillshots, targeted abilities, and self targeted buffs all in one champion. I think he will still be a great starter champion, but he will be less reliable in both higher and lower tiers of play which will allow him to become a strong pick, without being overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-04-11T01:26:55.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problems of his early game being too powerful could have been addressed by having a portion of his damage locked off by levels of his ultimate, or even through his passive in some way, if he's not enough of a magikarp early while still preserving his late game powerhouse playstyle.\n\nSee, I think the thing people are missing is it's not like just \"oh they're just adding a skillshot to his kit\" - q is literally his primary offensive ability, it's what he attacks with. The difference between \"will hit\" and \"can hit\" is huge, and I think a lot of people are underestimating it.\n\nThis isn't about having a champion that's mechanically simple for new players or a starter champion; this is about having a champion that's mechanically simple and effective at all stages of play, while having reliable damage output. It's not that making Q a skillshot is overwhelmingly difficult to comprehend, rather that it completely ruins his damage output, since his spells will no longer hit. Even if someone hits 3 out of every 4 Qs, that's a flat 25% reduction to his overall damage from Q. On top of the fact that he has to... well aim it, he will most likely not be able to fire it off of cooldown like the old Q. There is no way to look at this other than being a substantial damage nerf.\n\nOn the part of CDR opening up his build path, I will concede that this may not be a bad thing. Being locked into 3 primary items is somewhat rough, and if the CDR change can do this without significantly changing his damage output, that's probably more interesting overall.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-11T00:29:55.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, that is a fair assessment about how since it is really just a nuke it shouldn't have to be unreliable, however, I think the whole point is that now it requires a bit more focus from the Ryze, while also allowing options for higher success when played really well and healthier optimal use cases (basically, it adds in variability to the game, which means that you put in just as much resource on average to get just as much out of it total, but moment to moment it creates a more dynamic environment than \"hover mouse over X until all spells blow it up\"). Because of this, they can give it higher damage and a lower mana cost, or a slew of other unique effects that enhance the feel of his gameplay. Also, I mean sometimes you *don't* want to hit them with the skillshot, odd as that sounds, because you want them to have to walk a certain direction, or you want them to have to step in the way and tank the damage rather than letting you CS with it, etc. I agree that tons of skill shots aren't fun, but having at least *one* of them can add a bit of flavor to an otherwise vanilla champion kit. Ryze is a cool concept, and being able to spam spells all the time like a madman can be fun, but it doesn't seem like it is as satisfying as being able to spam spells *sometimes*, while knowing that you were able to outwit your opponent. \n\nAdditionally, skill shots allow you to do more things than a point and click, like leading a champion who is out of range by firing your spell sooner than otherwise possible and seeing them unfortunately walk into it, or being able to scout brush, or being able to still kill someone after you lost sight of them by firing a blind shot after them when you normally would lose the kill because you couldn't target them anymore. \n\nJust for an example, look at Lux's light binding; since it is a skillshot, she is allowed to use it at extreme range and have it hit two targets. That's cool, that's different. Ryze has a short range targeted nuke, and that is all it can be at this point, because being able to reliably get a 2 person snare at 1200+ range would be *totally* unfair as a point and click. Does Ryze need that extra long range snare like Lux? Probably not, but the point still stands that by changing it to a skillshot, Riot now has more room to make his Q that much more unique. Maybe they give it some effect where casting Q causes the damage to amp up for following casts within the next few seconds, or maybe they make it so that killing a unit with it restores mana to Ryze, or anything. Not that those particular ideas are great or should be a part of his kit, but they just prove my point that skill shots let Riot make the champion cooler than they were before. As it stands now, leaving Q as just another nuke in his kit doesn't justify turning it into a skillshot, but it gives them the option of amplifying its uniqueness beyond shoot damage at X.\n\nBasically, skill shots and point and click abilities each have their own tradeoffs, and in a situation where a kit is *all* skill shots, throwing in a point and click for some reliability can be good to make it more balanced across all levels of play, and in a kit that is *all* point and click, throwing in some variability can also be good at keeping things interesting while opening up opportunities for some really unique adjustments that would otherwise leave the champion completely and utterly broken.\n\nThanks for the discussion, I hope I was able to add something of use to it :P","replies":[{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-04-11T01:04:37.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=junglerboy16,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vKmJTTGZ,comment-id=0003000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-11T00:29:55.882+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the discussion, I hope I was able to add something of use to it :P\n\nYou know, I like you, because you take the time and text to properly explain your points.\n\nWhat you say about skillshots has some merit in the sense of their zoning potential - you can use them to move them into your other abilities, like Lux using the snare to force them to run into her singularity where they're slowed for her hyper beam. And that's a fun, sort of stratigic way to use her abilities.\n\nBut Lux is a champion who is designed around high-impact low reliability abilities - it's fine if I don't hit you with my snare since you and all your friends take my giant beam to the face.\n\nThat's not Ryze though. His other abilities are all on clicks, and he has a short range on them - Q is his primary offensive ability. He attacks with that the way Tryndamere hits with his sword; but now his Q doesn't work anymore: the high end case you talk about is basically he hits with all his Qs, and then he's only doing as much damage as he was before the change. Changing his Q into a skillshot doesn't make any sense given the nature of that spell and the rest of his kit; After all, whats the point of firing one Q every .3 seconds if they all whiff?\n\nIf I was going to \"balance\" his Q, I would lower the damage on initial hit, but give it a ramp up with multiple successive casts on the same opponent, to reinforce the idea that he's drilling down on one guy; he's not a \"burst mage\" hes a \"spammy-fight mage\".\n\nLux already exists, Xerath already exists, Ziggs already exists, etc. These high zoning AOE high impact strategic play champions all already exist - there is no reason to turn Ryze into a cheap knockoff version of them.

If the Riot wants to give him a skill shot, which will weaken him, it will need to give something substantial back.\n\nRyze right now is *a fucking terrible choice* in mid lane, and as I said previously, does not make top lane any fun for melee champions.\n\nMaking Overload a skill shot has become a trade-off change. He loses 100% reliability, 0.5 seconds base CD and a bit of mana scaling for higher base, higher AP scaling and longer range with a respectable missile speed.\n\nRune Cage was, for the most part, nerfed. It has a higher base root duration, but by ranks 4 & 5, it's shorter than the live version. It also has lower damage. But, unless I'm mistaken, it looks like it might have gotten back a bit of the range it lost in the past.\n\nSpell Flux lost some of the unreliability factor, and was changed from strong in duels to strong in group fights. Unless it hits next to 0 targets, it does more than the 1-bounce damage of old Spell Flux, with better shred unless they bought no MR. And at maximum targets, it's something like 450 +8% mana +120% AP damage and 36% MR shred if I remember the numbers correctly. And it has **half** the base cooldown. This is the reason why Ryze's Overload becoming a skill shot is alright; Spell Flux means they can't safely hide inside the minions, only *far behind* them.

Seems legit.\n\nWhat strengths does Ryze lose from this rework? Well, he can't afford to build mana-tank and still kill everything, because power was shifted into AP ratios (although his mana ratios, particularly his E, are still respectable). His Q is not 100% reliable, despite the projectile speed being rather high, from what I have seen. His W has been nerfed in every aspect, his passive now has a prerequisite to work in combat, and his R has a shorter duration (and innate CDR that makes Frozen Heart less valuable).\n\nWhat strengths does he gain? Longer-range harass/farming through his Q, increased potential damage output, more viability with AP itemization (which still has respectable defense options compared to mana items), better and more reliable wave-clear, stronger mana shred, and thanks to his E's new cooldown, he can either harass outside of the wave with his Q, or inside the wave with his E.\n\nHis strengths, weaknesses and counter-play will all change with the rework.
