For example\n-Azir has a passive which gives him attack speed for cooldown reduction; Azir has the 2nd lowest attack speed in the game\n-The Soraka rework *sigh* gives her a move speed bonus passive, but lowers her base move speed\n-The Cass rework gave her a passive for scaling cooldown reduction and bonus AP, but lowered the damage on her abilities and upped her cooldowns\n\nThis is about Anti-abilities; abilities which don't give you anything, because to compensate for you having the ability, you're worse at that thing than almost every other champ in the game.

That would mean, he'd be pretty tanky even if he did not kill any creeps at all. However, if he killed anything, his HP amount would be skyrocketing to levels that are incredibly hard to deal with, especially in the early stages of the game. That means, the gain from Soul Furnace's passive would have to be incredibly small (like, 1 HP per creep, without a bonus for bigger creeps).\n\nTo accomodate that best case, they lowered his base gain significantly. Now, if he has an average or sub-average game, he'll only get as much tankiness as the next bruiser or tank (HP/lvl in the range of 85-100). However, if he has a significantly better game, he'll still get to be a total brick wall.\n\nFor numbers:\n- Sion will get a comfortable amount of HP with 10 CS/lvl, as a laner.\n- As a jungler, you need to do 2 camps/lvl, as camps give, on average, 12 HP.\n- If you do 3 camps/lvl, you exceed the old HP/lvl gain.","replies":[{"poster":"TUfekAeySi","date":"2014-10-10T13:18:11.108+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":9,"body":"Except that old Sion *did* have the original 104 HP/level, higher base health and the \"Soul Furnace\" (Enrage) passive.

So if you use the jungle to calculate:\n\nIn the jungle on a 1 minute cooldown there are 4 large creatures, and 6 small creatures, so that gets him 44 health per jungle clear.  \n4 x 8 = 32\n6 x 2 = 12\n32 + 12 = 44\n\nBigWraith + Wolves + Wraiths + Golems = 10cs\n\nIf he is jungling he will get blue and red each 5 minutes, so as a jungle he gets 244 health in 5 minutes (with perfect clear) from 56 cs.  The aim of getting 595 health on his soul furnace should therefore only take \n\n44 x 5 + 2 x 8 + 2 x 4 = 220 + 16 + 8 = 244 health\n\n10 x 5 + 6 = 56 cs\n\nThis means with perfect clear it will take in 12.2 minutes (132 cs), assuming no kills, and no lane tax (both unlikely).  Now you might say, \"he would get counter-jungled\" or \"His clear is slower than that\" so lets handle that, I would put in a factor of 25% loss, so that's an extra 3 minutes or so, to make it 15.24 minutes (However, this won't increase his cs since he won't be getting the health from those lost monsters).  Most games take longer than 15 minutes, 20-30 minutes, which means in that time (give lane tax and kills/assists) he will easily surpass his old base.\n\n\"But wait\" you say, \"old sion also scaled his health from kills, you have you calculate that to.\".  Alright, I'll do that, old Sion, if he starts the game with his Enrage maxed then he gets 3 health per minion kill.\n\nThis means that with the 132 cs he would have 396 health, way less than the 595 of the new Sion, \"but how long until new Sion's max health is more than old Sion's\"?\n\nAlright overly curious imaginary questioner, lets figure that out to. For each set of 5 minutes in the jungle new Sion gets 244, while old Sion got  168 (assuming his enrage was maxed from level 1, instead of level 13 or later).\n\nHowever, if we are going to do this, we should take into account the lower early health scaling from old Sion, to do this I have used a random ap sion build guide (since Commando Yi was talking about AP Yi), this guide doesn't level his enrage until level 4 (so he doesn't get any health from his first clear) and maxes it at level 18, so I am going to say at 25 minutes the sion will be level 18 (way earlier than is true almost always).\n\nCalculating this gives it that after 15 minutes new Sion in-fact has 7 more health than old Sion did, of course this is after the jungle first spawns.\n\nEdit: Alright, I just had a look at an ad Sion build which maxes Enrage first, assuming you do that we will treat it as a transition from 1 to 3 per cs at 15 minutes, (So I am giving him the full 15 minute clear at 3 health per cs).  This gives old Sion more health until 20 minutes in, so this gets old sion with more health for 5 extra minutes, I don't think that's enough to win a game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Erronius","date":"2014-10-10T16:06:58.211+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yeah..

At high-levels of play where players have an actual brain, Riven cannot do anything in spite of her abilities. Why? Perhaps it's because she has less armor than an ADc.\n\nName one champion that was successfully changed. Just one.

The guy can play any character in the character roster at high levels of play. Faker also can pick up champions and do things you wouldn't believe to be possible. There's a fine line between understanding when high-levels of play are for the argument and when high-levels of play are irrelevant to the argument. When we're talking about the total ability of what can and cannot be done, that's when we use Challenger Tier views because they are the people that capitalized on everything and continue to outplay everyone under Challenger Tier. But when you use a Challenger Tier's ability to play a champion better than anyone in the world, that's when your argument becomes irrelevant. This game is not for 0.1% of the community - it's for the whole community. Someone mastering a champion does not mean the champion is in a good place. Riven is not in a good place. Everything besides the greatest players in the world playing these champions, demonstrates it. I guarantee you that Faker could do better with, let's say Zed, than he could with Riven.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UrGayTwink04","date":"2014-10-10T17:54:28.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> \n> This is about this weird thing I've noticed with several new champions and champion changes where they basically are given non-abilities.

Why is Riot even making champs with non-abilities?  I guess the abilities will SOUND COOL when you originally read the champion description when they reveal it (on their site, without the hard numbers) so that people go and buy the champ.  Then it isn't until after you look at the base stats / numbers that you realize you've been duped.  Or maybe they appeal to a younger demographic that doesn't ever read stats?

Her base attack speed is horrendous, being the 4th lowest in the game at lv 18. However, Pow-Pow helps mitigate that (as a \"non-ability\" as you put it), increasing her attack speed incrementally. With all 3 stacks, she has the highest base AS in the game at 1.6813 AS, compared to {{champion:22}} and {{champion:67}} tied for second at 1.105 AS. \n\nSwitch to Fishbones though and her attack speed goes back to a measly 0.731 AS. That's the tradeoff, and that's why these kinds of abilities are in place, mitigating supposed weak points.\n\nIt should be considered however that Riot isn't perfect, and some might scale too hard or not hard enough into the mid/late game.

Some would say this is what makes Jinx not only strong, but OP, due to the fact that she has more leeway and options at her disposal. The reason I think she hasn't seen any significant nerfs to this (yet) may be because (at least in high level competitive play) she isnt able to use this advantage of hers to overcome her weaknesses in lane to other ADC's like {{champion:236}}  or really deal with the assassination abilities of someone like {{champion:29}}  later in the game.\n\nSo if someone like her, who HAS choices with nice tradeoffs, isn't strong enough to be a popular \"meta\" pick atm, it becomes clear that those WITHOUT choices (or at least less choices) would have an even tougher time. That kind of has been the always-dominant \"gateway\" champs needed to pass in order to be viable, the amount of choices they have. Thats why champs like {{champion:64}} , {{champion:412}}  and {{champion:60}}  have almost perpetually remained not only relevant, but dominant in the meta.\n\nSo basically, while I personally feel Sion is in a more or less good spot atm (though it is way too early to tell for sure), Azir, Soraka, and all the other champs in their positions could probably use some buffs in some ways to compensate for their lack of choices.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TUfekAeySi","date":"2014-10-10T13:22:27.764+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you're really grasping the issue.
