I feel marksmens got hit to hard, I no longer fear them, they are just free kills as a jungler, but when you got a vlad adc with a brand support (as a jungler) I won't go near bot lane with a 50 foot pole. I won't say they are dead as they can still fuck you up, but they are not what they were.","replies":[{"poster":"Pentakill Bobo","date":"2018-06-20T14:57:20.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, there is no more fear from the ADCs, especially with the new items, the crit adcs are useless and they need ton of gold to actually do something, and what u mean by adc am talking about the marksman and not this new meta where anyone can claim to be adc and dominate the lane and/or hyper carry a game like you said with yas. So sad, i used to ADC main and carry the game all by myself, but now even if i win my lane a bit, am still useless in team fights, i literally deal nothing, cant do anything.... just so sad","replies":[{"poster":"Darkone7001","date":"2018-06-20T15:04:43.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel you, I was a kled/ornn toplane main, I can't even look at the cancer my lane has become, I just went jungle volibear/ramus so I can camp the shit out of a lane and get whatever champion fed asf and get them to hypercarry the game by 15 minutes, its just how you have to win man.
