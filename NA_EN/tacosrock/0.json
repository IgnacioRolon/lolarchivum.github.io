Whenever I was in champion select one time, I was kicked out of the champ select because the client crashed. Then, when I try to reconnect, it doesn't let me reconnect back into champion select.  It just shows a blue light circling around saying \"trying to reconnect\". I also checked my internet at that time, and it was working well... so, how is it fair that I have to lose 3LP and wait 5 minutes because your client doesn't work???? Not my fault. I don't care if I get compensation or not for this bs, but just fix this new client before you force everyone to use it or else it's gonna make a lot of people angry.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T17:23:57.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a combination of issues happening here that's causing you to disconnect.  As a first step, I recommend removing any third party applications that interact with lead.  Apps like play.tv can cause you to crash during champion select.  You might also be having a problem with your network failing to stay connected during champion select or even in-game, and would recommend going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  The steps there should patch you up!","replies":[]}]}
