Taliyah, Yasuo, Aurelion Sol, Azir...all of them have high skill floors and high skill ceilings. They require significant investment of time to learn, so most people don't realm understand how they work. This creates the same winrate trend we're all familiar with: low early, low mid, sudden spike. You're left with a committed group who learned the champion and can use it effectively vs. a general public that doesn't know its mechanics. Riot nerfs the champ based off of the mains and LCS players and it's left in an unplayable state for everyone else. It's bad, sloppy design.\n\nThe reverse is essentially how you end up with Ekko: a brain dead champion with so low a skill floor that anybody can suddenly start using him any time a new OP build comes out for him. When Aurelion Sol was going to get needed for his high winrate on mains, you didn't see a sudden increase in his plaurate. Tank Ekko is discovered, though, and he was in every game.\n\nThis is the crux of the issue. Riot needs to stop releasing champions with too high or too low a skill requirement, because these champions end up requiring constant adjustments. The champs should be easy to learn and hard to master, to borrow the old cliche. I love Taliyah, but I recall predicting this exact turn of events when I discussed her with a friend.
