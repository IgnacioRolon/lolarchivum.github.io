If you look on the current PBE notes, you can see that theyre getting nerfs, which makes makes no sense. I don&#039;t even remember the last time I have seen a Lissandra and I rarely see Taliyah picked (I&#039;m plat elo).  I&#039;m assuming that these nerfs are because of the fact that theyre quite efficient in LCS.  This makes me extremely aggravated because LCS and other official League competitions make up less than 1% of the player base. So, theyre nerfing these champions STRICTLY because of that. I don&#039;t even see Taliyah and Lissandra dominate that hard anyways. Its always Cassiopeia, Aurelion Sol,  and Viktor dominating mid. Why not nerf them instead? This really shows how biased Riot is towards LCS if these nerfs go through.

So sorry I don't waste all of my time watching the LCS and whatever other championships there are, as they are currently garbage, but really, they have to think realistically about these changes.  The pros know what theyre doing pretty much 24/7. That's why they are pros.  They WILL dominate on high skill-cap champions. The other 99% of players are not as good as them. So, when youre gonna tell me that theyre nerfing them, which lets be honest, its only because of faker and bjergsen (maybe a few others), it leaves the rest of us to play these champions, that were perfectly fine in SoloQ , at an even higher level than it already takes to play them.
