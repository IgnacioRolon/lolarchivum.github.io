Frankly the current amount of missions is really hard to manage using the small pop-up window.  Please let me know if I am supposed to be seeing additional daily missions at all and if so why am I not seeing one for today.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynamic Impact","date":"2017-08-21T14:17:02.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bought my dungeon pass pre late 21/8 was just wondering if this will effect how much tickets i get over all i'll be grinding to get most the quest done though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T02:27:38.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had to do a bit of digging to figure out just what is going on with these daily missions to be sure of why we don't have a second daily today.

That also conveniently for riot throws off the math of buying orbs if they are 10 tickets a mission.
