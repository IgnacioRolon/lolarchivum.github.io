I want the chance to prebuy like everyone else got.  Kinda BS to let some take advantage but not others.  \n\nSo did riot convert the ones in everyone's inventory to shards/champs or are they still mystery shards that can be used later?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-11-10T04:19:23.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=aW2ujqAR,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-11-10T04:17:52.959+0000)\n>\n> Yeeaaaaa looks like this item got some heavy changes recently without any forewarning going out....\n> \n> https://i.gyazo.com/fe95abd15c32cecee4861f9672f66b10.png\n\nDarn.
