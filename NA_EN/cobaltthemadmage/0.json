Fixing my proxy settings client-side didn't seem to have any effect, and troubleshooting couldn't identify any further problems on my end. I am running a repair as I type this, but what are some other things I would need to look into in case that still doesn't work?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T20:53:28.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network can't establish a connection with your game server, meaning that your issue is more related to a connection problem and not your game files.  As a first step, try the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide which will have instructions to get this fixed.  It would be best to test it out in custom games to prevent Leaverbuster issues.
