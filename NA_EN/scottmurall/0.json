Last season the new system rolled out late so riot let people gain honor very quickly to compensate.\n\nThis season we don't hav that helping hand. So if you avoid getting reported you should steadily climb. If it took OP about 2.5 months to climb 2 tiers then it should take about the same to hit honor 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Aurelion Söl","date":"2018-09-23T14:36:32.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I can't control people reporting me for feeding when I didn't try to... that's what the system doesn't account for the human aspect of things.
