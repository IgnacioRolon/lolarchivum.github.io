Sometimes it's even more responsive than damage.\r\n\r\nGetting killed by a melee attack after flashing out of it feels wrong. Yes, that's how the mechanics work, and you should've flashed before they even started their attack animation, but it still feels icky.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2014-12-09T10:05:44.863+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"If moving out of range canceled every melee attack, melee would never get a hit on moving targets.

Hell i hate it now because its the single best summoner spell in the game and not taking will gimp whatever champ your playing doesnt matter who.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock Rockburgh","date":"2014-12-11T00:59:23.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, I didn't realize that this was the old implementation.
