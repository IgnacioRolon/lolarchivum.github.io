If you want to know some more about our thinking in designing this system, check out our Little Legends deep dive.\r\n\r\nLittle Legends **“Series” Eggs** can be purchased in the loot tab in the store. \r\n\r\nThere are multiple “Series” Eggs available, each of which has the possibility to output one of 6 variants of 3 different species of Little Legend. In total, there are 18 different variants a “Series” Egg can output.\r\n\r\nThere are some special rules for “Series” Eggs:\r\n\r\n**Duplicates Star Up:** Getting a duplicate variant will cause it to star up by one level. Once a variant reaches 3 stars, it won’t hatch from future eggs.\r\n\r\n**New Content with Each Egg**: Each egg you hatch will grant you a variant you don’t already own, or a star up for a variant you already own. \r\n\r\n**Double Drops**: Occasionally, when you receive a Legendary Little Legend, two Little Legends will hatch from a single egg.\r\n\r\n**All Variants at 3 Stars = Rare Egg**: We really don’t recommend it, but if you continue to open a “Series” eggs after you own all variants it contains at 3 stars, it will output a “Little Legend” permanent that can be forged into a “Rare Egg”. Rare Eggs will output a random variant from any “Series” Egg. The Rare Egg will be updated to contain Little Legends from future “Series” Eggs as they are released. But you really should probably just stop buying eggs from a “Series” after you own all the variants it contains at 3 stars.\r\n\r\nHere’s what each “Series” Egg can output:\r\n\r\n**Series 1 Egg:**\r\n\r\n* Legendary (5% drop rate, 30% chance for double drop)\r\n* Epic (20% drop rate)\r\n* Rare (75% drop rate)\r\n\r\n*When a Little Legend reaches 3 stars, it’s removed the table and its probability is equally distributed to all remaining Little Legends.\r\n\r\nLegendary:\r\n-Lost Silverwing\r\n-Sugarcone Furyhorn\r\n-Shadowmask Hauntling\r\n\r\nEpic:\r\n-Snow Cherry Silverwing\r\n-Tropical Silverwing\r\n-Void-marked Furyhorn\r\n-Willowbark Furyhorn\r\n-Dark Matter Hauntling\r\n-Lunar Claw Hauntling\r\n\r\nRare:\r\n-Demacian Silverwing\r\n-Rosebloom Silverwing\r\n-Dawnglow Silverwing\r\n-Molten Furyhorn\r\n-Tundra Furyhorn\r\n-Lionheart Furyhorn\r\n-Shadow Isles Hauntling\r\n-Fireborn Hauntling\r\n-Toxic Hauntling\r\n\r\n**Series 2 Egg:**\r\n\r\n* Legendary (5% drop rate, 30% chance for double drop)\r\n* Epic (20% drop rate)\r\n* Rare (75% drop rate)\r\n\r\n*When a Little Legend reaches 3 stars, it’s removed the table and its probability is equally distributed to all remaining Little Legends.\r\n\r\nLegendary:\r\n-Skydance Molediver\r\n-Brambleback Runespirit\r\n-Ravenlord Featherknight\r\n\r\nEpic:\r\n-Clumsy Molediver\r\n-Toxic Molediver\r\n-Sakura Runespirit\r\n-Black Mist Runespirit\r\n-True Ice Featherknight\r\n-Extra Spicy Featherknight\r\n\r\nRare:\r\n-Soft-nosed Molediver\r\n-Fresh-water Molediver\r\n-Blazebattle Molediver\r\n-Sentinel Runespirit\r\n-Seedling Runespirit\r\n-Glacial Runespirit\r\n-Pengu Featherknight\r\n-Cheeper Featherknight\r\n-Sakura Featherknight\r\n\r\n**Rare Egg:**\r\n\r\n* Legendary (5% drop rate)\r\n* Epic (20% drop rate)\r\n* Rare (75% drop rate)\r\n\r\n*When a Little Legend reaches 3 stars, it’s removed the table and its probability is equally distributed to all remaining Little Legends.\r\n\r\nLegendary:\r\n*All legendary variants from “Series 1” and “Series 2” Rare Eggs\r\n\r\nEpic:\r\n*All epic variants from “Series 1” and “Series 2” Rare Eggs\r\n\r\nRare:\r\n*All rare variants from “Series 1” and “Series 2” Rare Eggs\r\n\r\nJust like the game itself, Little Legends are brand new and we’re taking your feedback.

I like Little Legends and their implementation, but I have incredible amounts of disgust for how I would get the one that I want.\n\nTo elaborate, upon first seeing all of the Little Legends a while ago, I really wanted to grab the Sugarcone Furyhorn. It's pink, and adorable! But as far as I know now, in order to get it, I would have to do the following:\n1. Purchase a \"Series 1\" Egg\n2. Open it for a 5% chance to receive a \"legendary\" drop\n3. Assuming that it is a legendary drop, somehow achieve a 33% chance to open the Sugarcone Furyhorn- as it is 1 of 3 \"legendary\" drops\nSo overall, I would have a 1.666~% chance to open ONE Sugarcone Furyhorn.\nAnd assuming that I don't open it, in theory my odds of getting it would increase. Except they wouldn't, because I could get repeats of other Little Legends that I've already opened until I get them 3 times.\nI do NOT like those odds.\n\nI originally assumed that the system would operate off of having **Species** Eggs. Wherein you could buy a \"Furyhorn\" Egg, and it would randomly produce 1 of the 6 different Furyhorns. So, it'd be closer to:\n1. Purchase a \"Furyhorn\" Egg\n2. Open it for a **16.666~%** chance to receive a Sugarcone Furyhorn (assuming there are 6 variants in total)\n3. Continue opening as I see fit to perhaps increase its rarity\n4. After owning all Furyhorns at maximum rarity, be unable to purchase anymore \"Furyhorn\" Eggs\nI would've liked this MUCH better! At least then I can attempt to get variants of my favourite Little Legend- and really, I like all of the Furyhorns, so there are others I'd like to spend money on if not just the Sugarcone variant. It's not stellar, in that I can't just choose to buy the variant I want 3 times, but it's better! I was planning on spending money this way, honestly.\nHowever, as the system stands (assuming I've got a proper grasp on this), I refuse to purchase these.\n\nI'm not saying this has to change. What I am saying is that I, personally, will not spend RP on these as they are. This seems \"unnecessary\" from the viewpoint of a casual, Furyhorn-loving player. I can understand a company wanting to make money, but I honestly find this to be... incredibly skewed. Overall, not a fan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dengen","date":"2019-06-24T17:46:00.626+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":2,"body":"i'm dissapointed that you have to pray to RNJESUS to get the variants you really want. oh well...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serralion","date":"2019-06-24T18:29:04.046+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"Way too pricey for what they are and what they do with this kind of pricing system.

I'll address my biases at the moment, which is obviously against these types of practices. However, I do not see this black or white, and have the same opinion here as I do with Prestige Skins right now. I will state my opinions, my exceptions, and finally, my feedback. \n\n**Opinions:**\n\nReally? I am really disappointed to see that this is where this road went down. The moment I saw that Sugarcorn Furryhorn, I was downright in love with the little guy, even at level 1, with his dopey stance and stupid face. God that guy is adorable. I knew that as cosmetics, that there was going to be a price to pay for them, but such a variable price doesn't really encourage me to shill out money on the chance of getting any of the other ones, who I honestly kinda hate. \n\nI am aware, however, that the base variants of the lil' critters are purchasable by their lonesome. That on itself makes it somewhat better, but as we continue to proceed down the line of randomly gotten cosmetics, obviously some people are going to fall in love with some specific variation, like I am with the cutest little Furyhorn. Now that I'm on my own and outta the parents, I can't say I'm of sound mind trying to get this guy, and waste money on other variations that I will never want, and never use. It's a downright waste of my money. \n\n**Exceptions:**\n\nHowever, outside of my personal feelings about this situation, I think people down below are somewhat mistaken, similar to that of Prestige Skins. While admittedly, their implementation may have had some eye raising choices, I believe the same issue falls here as it was with Prestige. People's expectations are driving their rational. Just like how Prestige Skins aren't meant to be gotten by everyone, nor is the idea you're supposed to try to collect them all, it's similar here. People want these, but are disappointed with how they are gotten, which is fair, but the argument could be made is 'You're not supposed to dump money into this, unless you really want one', like Prestige before they were made Grindy as hell per event. \n\nHowever however, however, it is the complete opposite here. With how this system is set up, it seems like we're not even encouraged to get a single one, but to somehow collect them all. As I said above, I hate all of those which are not the Sugarcorn Furyhorn. He is the goodest boy and deserves to be loved. You've made the these exactly the same as pre-change Prestige Skins, where you needed to dump a **huge** amount of money into getting the **one** you want. \n\nAs with Prestige, I extremely hope that this changes the same way Prestige has gone. \n\nAdditionally, I'd like to point something out for all the folk crying 'Surprise Mechanics'. I'd like to keep people reminded that one of the biggest points of controversy in the Lootbox debacle, is that these things are coming out in games in which are also costing you a premium for the game itself, that big 60$ price tag. While I'm still not a fan of these types of practices, League's only income is from people too impatient to earn a champion, or it's cosmetic side. There's always a challenge to find when it comes to finding a way to make money that is acceptable by the consumer, what they find acceptable. \n\nObviously, companies will see what consumers are fine paying for, so they push the line to see what they can get away with it. That's just the nature of the relationship between consumer and producer. \n\n**Feedback:**\n\nFor my feedback, I'm going to try to side away from the fact that I love the Sugarcorn Furyhorn and I want him for the cheapest available amount. My feedback will be aiming for a decent compromise between Player and Company. \n\n1) **Keep the Series Eggs, Remove the Level Up Feature, remove tier Ranks**: You keep the lootbox format, but you remove the level up feature that levels your pets up via getting duplicates. You remove the Rarity system in pets, and make them a simple divided chance amongst them all, which obviously lowers the more Eggs you buy. Legendary Ranks are fine in normal skins, but unless there is some additional effects or VO or something, I honestly do not know why these are being seperated into Tiers outside of \"Enh, we felt like literally copying Lootboxes.\"\n\n2) **Keep the Series Eggs, Keep the Level Up Feature, Keep Tier Ranks, Add a way to get Eggs outside of buying them**: If you're going to create a system that requires so much spending of money, then you need to be able to get them in alternative ways. Off the top of my head, these alternative ways could be an individual Level for TFT, shorter Ranked seasons that could gift Eggs for progress up the ladder (Think Duelyst/Hearthstone kinda thing), or possibly earned through normal level up chests. This one has more ideas than I can think of. While this mimics Overwatch, which isn't that good a thing, I consider it a better alternative.\n\n3) **Just make them like skins.**: I think while this is biased in favor of the consumer, I think this is simply the most favorable you will get from consumers point of view. Overprice them if you have to, removing the loops and rings is what people desire. Level them up via playing Matches with them maybe. \n\n\nI'm sure that there are more potenials that I haven't listed here, but as it stands now, I think that the system you have set up now is entirely, onesidely in favor of the consumer. I think the lashing out by the community is understandable, because this is beyond a level of acceptable.\n\nLate mention, whatever choice you go with, please make it so you can choose which level of animal you get to use for your little boy. I love the sitting on butt Furyhorn boi. ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suge Daddy","date":"2019-06-25T03:43:37.515+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"**This is actually ridiculous**.

One would think that Riot would continue the mostly fair system they already had in place for this latest mode... \"surprise mechanics\" indeed.

This new gambling scheme is straight out of an unscrupulous gacha game and I hope it doesn't mean that we have more \"surprise mechanics\" to look forward to if it brings a profit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haelstrom","date":"2019-08-26T05:44:16.647+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's a waste of time but, I know several friends who would buy cosmetics from you but won't be supporting the game even including myself because this RNG garbage is antithetical to what is desired.\n\nThere's no shame in wanting to turn a profit for a F2P game, especially one that's been out for nearly a decade - I get it. I remember when Riot was a much tinier company when I joined right after beta ended. It's part of the sustainability of the game to market cosmetics and minor conveniences. \n\nBut having played several Korean MMOs and other services that went this route, going the lootbox route is a big turn off to anyone with moderate money management sense, and preys on gullible buyers (children) or people with gambling addiction inclinations. It's predatory and will be remembered as a blemish on the game. \n\nYou should really just scrap it and refund people their RP who have already purchased the items in question before it becomes too involved for you to do so. Whomever green-lit this in the midst of the lootbox debacle is, being polite as I can, playing with fire.

They are merely just companions and don't do anything besides be expressive on the screen. Something like this should have an option to buy with Blue Essence in game loot as well, so the fact they cost purely only RP (Riot Points), is nothing but absurd despicable greed! Not to mention that they cost around 700 RP at the least, which is absolutely ridiculous! The greed from Riot here is very real, and I advise pushing back, either waiting for Blue Essence in game loot to be an option for these Little \"Greedy Useless\" Legends, or at the very least, they cost much less RP. I advise the cost of Little Legends be dropped to around a Hextech Key cost, so about 150 RP or even less than that since they don't do much for the gameplay experience. So if not 150 RP, perhaps 50 RP, which is enough to buy a skin shard with in game event tokens. A final option would be to throw in some Champion skins with the cost of the Little Legends Bundle, and actual champion shards to activate for champion ownership.\n\nThese are the options if Riot wants more buyers, more Legendary finds from having cheaper costs, and more interest in what the game mode can offer. For now, I will stick to buying champion skins, since at least I know I get what I want, and there are quite a few skins I will get, but since Little Legends is a gamble, I will not buy any until it's at least reasonably fixed!\n\n{{sticker:garen-swing}} ","replies":[]}]}
