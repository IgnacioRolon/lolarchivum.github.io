Given that the League client didn't start up previously, it sounds like there may be some sort of OS Permissions issue.  Essentially, League is trying to run, but something is blocking it from doing so.  In order to rule this out as a root cause, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104).  Some of the steps there may seem fairly simple, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nHit me up again if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[{"poster":"GLADYOS","date":"2016-05-11T01:27:05.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried doing the options to fix it but it still doesn't work, the set up screen is still completely white and it just goes away again.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:10:42.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since those steps didn't help, we are going to have to dig a lot deeper and review some logs to give us a better idea of your computer configuration.
