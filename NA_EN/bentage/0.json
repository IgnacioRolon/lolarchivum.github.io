With the slight rework to Morgana taking her from being my safest blind pick option into super god mode with the 40% healing to being what she is today with 20% on champions, cannon minions and jungle creeps, I now find her to be lacking in comparison to her before the slight rework. I have accrued 1.5 mil mastery points on her since its inception and had a rather steady win rate of ~60% through the 3 seasons. The rework hit and initially shot me through the roof I was over 75%! She clearly was broken with 40% to champs and needed something done about it. But rather than taking her to 20% to champs can we not just revert her back to before the rework? I use to have 20% spell vamp to everything now just to champs it has taken my 60% and dropped me to under 55%. I seem to be about the only person who sees the new kit as being a rather harsh nerf to what she had prior to reworking. I have currently stopped playing Morgana in any solo lane other than being a counter pick I now no longer feel like her black shield is enough to warrant her being a blind pick. I stand firm in my belief that if she were just reverted back to her pre rework kit she would fall right back into a comfortable slot of being viable. Thanks again for your time and consideration, have an outstanding day.\r\n\r\nBentage\r\nMisses His Morgana","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2018-01-02T23:06:53.933+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh I like this new passive healing better, cause I believe it is not cut to 1/3 effectiveness for her W and Ult.

With all the mobility and aggressive junglers I don't feel comfortable playing my old pushers (like xerath) without knowing most of the enemy team so it was nice to be able to blind pick Morgana mid and be able to run a push strategy.\n\nSince the changes I don't feel as comfortable playing her mid though.  A big part of her power was the constant sustain from pushing waves, but now if she wants to heal she has to focus champions which means she can't push the minion wave.  I definitely understand the reason for the change but despite Riot saying it was supposed to help make her more viable as a midlaner without impacting support I feel weaker in Mid lane now.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucas Fehrwight","date":"2018-01-03T09:17:03.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Understand the changes?\n\nADCs heal way more than morg passively and where is that nerf.
