What happened to stability?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This started yesterday. I have made no updates to any hardware, or software on my PC. I'm regularly getting 200+FPS, am usually the first of my teammates to load, and only use ~50% of my CPU/GPU even during intense fights. I've had no issues with any other games, from Ghost Recon:Wildlands, to CS:GO, to PUBG; This is isolated to League of Legends.\r\n\r\nThe below is an example of something which happened earlier today:\r\n\r\nLeague freezes on champ select. On ARAM my randomly chosen character will show, but I'm unable to set summoner skills, runes, or masteries.\r\nAttempting to shut down league via task manager, results in my PC freezing outright and requiring a hard reset.\r\nOnce windows is loaded, I attempt to launch League, and login, to have it bring me to the team loading screen. It  freezes and I get a popup telling me I should be using the \"Play button\" to launch League correctly (lol what?) Again, trying to shutdown the process with task manager (so i can relaunch it) causes a freeze.\r\nUpon reset and launch #2, I finally get into a game, but wait, there's no sound. A friend messaging me via steam makes sound, but nothing from league. I alt-tab to check sound settings, and league stops responding.\r\n\r\nBy the time I managed to have league of legends launched, with sound, I was 10 minutes into an ARAM game with a very angry team.\r\n\r\nI've attempted to fix the issue by using the \"Initiate Full Repair\" button. But this same sort of scenario happened since then. Again, this issue is only affecting League, other games run perfectly; otherwise I would be looking into things like Nvidia drivers, or system instability on my end. I'm not sure what's been happening behind the scenes, but whatever was done, this is game breaking.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyromaniart","date":"2017-05-12T18:24:24.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been having many of the same issues but I'm playing on a mac, it freezes during champ select, mind you I can hear everything going on, count downs, pings when someones in chat, background music.

I found it odd, which is why I remember it, however i was more worried about getting the game fully closed so I could attempt a relaunch.\nIt took 4-5 tries before it actually loaded properly, with sound. League was constantly freezing/hanging and wouldn't even close if I attempted to shut it down via Task manager. That's when I decided to \"Initiate Full Repair\", because when a program fails so hard it wont even close, there's got to be some corrupted file.\n\n>Are you also on Windows 10?

I double checked, and this is still disabled. So that is not the cause of the issue.\n\n>If the issue persists, your best bet would be to go through each step of the game crash guide to rule out any possibilities with the game, hardware, drivers, and anything in between.\n\nI have gone through those, and they're of no help.\nThe game ran perfectly fine last week. I'm curious why Riot would release an unstable patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T15:29:14.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info.
