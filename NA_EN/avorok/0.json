I have never played ranked, never been hacked in all those years, and today, I found out that I did. And I can't send in a ticket because it keeps giving me an error, even typed a long message, which was lost, tried again, copied, then tried. Still an error. I really want this issued resolved asap. As i'm under great stress about this. They used all 3 of my refunds, to buy some random skin, played ranked on my account, and gifted skins to two other random accounts that I do not know, and suspect they are the culprits. This person also deleted all my friends and added random people I do not know. I really would like Riot to help me fix this issue. I can't even see my RP purchase history because it gives me an error. Which I think this account has been hacked for about the beginning of October. So I'm not sure If any money is missing from my account or not yet. \r\n\r\nPlease help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T18:21:42.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're able to still access your account for the time being, which is really good!
