Yasuo?don't even get me started, bro.\r\nThat weeb got a chroma that is literally Project Yasuo but in BrokeMode.\r\nAnd then, there is Caitlyn. Aah yes bro, the super serious Piltover Vigilant that everybody is supposed to take seriously, but instead gets sexualised and it rlly doesn't fit in her personality in any possible way. I can't see Caitlyn the same way as before. But what REEALLY disturbs me is the fact that yet again they did ANOTHER prestige skin (because who would live without them?)and they messed up with the only thing that should make us buy it. the splash art is just.. fked up man. If y'all want to do these garbage skins at least do them correctly,that neck ain't acceptable, bro.\r\n Riot failed, since they said they were going to count ''when was the last time a champ got a skin'' but apparently they don't take their promises for a long time.\r\nAnd in the end there is Qiyana, a 'champ' nobody likes, and gets an arcade skin as the launch skin.\r\nNow, y'all gotta explain me why, someone like qiyana who has just come should have not only New super detailed effects, but ALSO NEW LINES, But my BOI {{champion:82}} who's been here since 9 years, doesn't even get his skins' effects right.Seems legit (i wouldn't have minded if they put up the price for All morde skins to 1350, but now i guess the best looking skins are the cheap reworked skins) \r\nThis made me believe less and less to Riot's words the moment i remembered they told us they were going to count how much time has passed since a champ got his last skin.\r\nFrom a gameplay perspective, i really don't give a shit. Like, if they ever nerfed the champs everytime we thought that specific champ was too OP they'd be like ''Well -5 Movement speed i guess'' so it wouldn't change much\r\nAnd then there is the community,\r\nAah ~ I just read about NightBlue (the Ali A of League) Not only trying to get a teemo banned because he was support, but he was AFK and INSULTING HIM while doing so.\r\nThis is Utterly Disgusting, you're not gonna lose all ur league players if a Family Friendly Streamer like NightBlue gets banned for 2 weeks, because yes, you can't let streamers have this much power and that's what he deserves. ( i don't find NB3 that interesting anyways. he's kinda boring and basic af) #UnBanTheTeemo\r\nIf y'all had a person to represent the whole damn community of Lol in one person, that'd be Tyler1 Pre PermaBan\r\nThey came up with this Dota2 copyc-- TeamFight AutoChess, yes. I'll give him 3 months before it becomes like overwatch.\r\nNow i only log in this game only for my few friends that i share matches with.\r\nRiot is going downhill,i can tell u that much.\r\nIdk man.","replies":[]}
