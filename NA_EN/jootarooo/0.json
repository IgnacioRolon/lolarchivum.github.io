No one gives a shit about wards' aesthetics, not even the owner of them. no one gives a shit about emotes, they're pure cashgrab. Just let me find skins and make sure you get some orange essence everytime you find one, because i can find 10000 skins and still have 0 OE. Please, make my chest worth the effort since i'm a f2p player and i'm not willing to spend much money on skins anyways. Remove paying RPs for champions because nobody and i mean NOBODY would pay to play something they can buy with in-game currency. If some of y'all do, you gotta be lazy af. To add to that, i think the addition of a trading system server where u get to exchange, sell, or buy skin shards with orange essence currency would be pretty sick. But what am i asking? You nearly can't even get your own client working. Not only this would create a place for everyone to go Often, chit chat making new friends, but it'd be EXTREMELY convenient for players that really can't afford or just don't wanna pay for your stuff. I think that the game isolates every player, forcing you one way to get friends, which PLAY the game, and it's unlikely cause every player meets once, and if that game goes bad, they'll probably start insulting You, and that doesn't help.\r\nRiot, seriously, i think you got potential fr, but y'all keep doing shit on your OWN WITHOUT listening to the community IDEAS. Last time u did that you just stole a solar eclipse leona concept from years ago and added extra bulkyness and armor to it. If you want to be stable, you should check the Boards more, and i mean reading to people's rants about in game problems, and i think that is the only way for you to improve. Eternals? sure, make them ion give a damn but make them worth your 6 months build up, because now you're stabbing the most popular moba game to ever exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Cind3rkick","date":"2019-08-22T21:52:16.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/rant\n\n\n\n\nYou ever wondered why riot is so hesistant to give out free stuff?

It is shocking, but i run into a *lot* of players who made their first act to buy every single champion with RP.\n\nRemoving it serves no purpose aside from unjustly punishing the noble cash whale.","replies":[]}]}
