I had never seen such a message before. I am looking for clarification and explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T21:56:42.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iiiinteresting. A player may have been using the little known /me feature in chat, which can make it look like some kind of emote. I'm rather sure we haven't made any in game announcements referring to \"killing a worm\".","replies":[{"poster":"RuneTerrarist","date":"2018-01-09T06:06:08.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had this exact same line pop up.

Both have brought me no closer to discovering the origin of this message like notification. So a little more explain would be greatly appreciated.
