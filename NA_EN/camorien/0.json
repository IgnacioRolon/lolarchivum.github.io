I've never heard of it being helpful in preventing connection problems, so I'm not sure why it would affect this. \n\nBy a large margin, most issues with connections are caused by local network settings that conflict with League. My recommendation would be to work through the steps outlined in our [Mac Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) as a first step. \n\nLet me know if this issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
