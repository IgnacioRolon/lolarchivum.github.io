I have had it hooked up for the last week or so using it for extended display, just as I have done PLENTY of times before, and when I played a game after unplugging it it bug splats. However; if I play with it plugged in, it will also bug splat if I don't have the 2nd display (monitor) set as my main screen. Then when I get into game with the 2nd monitor as my main screen, it gives me 20 FPS until I alt + tab out and change the main display back to my laptop. This has never happened before, and I am really confused. Before this happened all I did was put the 2nd display as my main and it was fine. :l Any help is greatly appreciated.
