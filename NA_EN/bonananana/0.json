Hotfix changes do get tested extensively, but it's over a shorter period of time so it's not completely equal to a full patch cycle of testing. As a result in order to justify the risk involved hotfixes need to be really high value (e.g. X champion is currently disabled because they crash the game) or be at least fairly high value and really low risk (e.g. changing a single number in a text file that corrects a major damage bug). In this particular case Xin Zhao's Q doesn't knock up if the target isn't moving at the time of the third hit. That's definitely a significant bug, but it's not crippling him and the fix involves code changes, which are much riskier than just changing data values. As a result (as far as I'm aware, server patches aren't my area of expertise) we're not currently planning to hotfix this bug. \n\nIn terms of how often we update we're currently putting out a patch every two weeks generally (major exceptions around things like Worlds, Christmas etc). I can understand your frustration that fixes like this can take a bit of time to come out, that's the same cadence of patches as in Season 1 back in 2011 though.","replies":[{"poster":"Dryditch","date":"2015-02-18T17:04:55.698+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meddler, I (and I'm sure many other Xin mains) appreciate your response to this problem, but I can't help finding this explanation a poor excuse for not hotfixing the problem. If some code were modified in Xin's files, what would it  actually take to roll it back a patch? If it's a broader issue with the gamecode as a whole, then it makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't appear there are other glitches with knockups.\n\nIf this were a bug where Lee Sin's Q didn't mark the target hit, or Zed's passive was dealing damage which stopped at 1 hit point before death, there would be a hotfix out yesterday. (Based on prior examples from relevant player-base size and glitches/malfunctions) \n\nXin is almost completely unplayable for his mains now, since we rely on the rhythm of that .8 second auto attack/spell disrupt window as a slight relief from damage. \n\nXin mains play an all-in style, and we engage when there is a 90% chance we'll get a kill or force a disengage. In the jungle, our routes end with an at-max 10 minute solo dragon before first-back, which we can't do without the respite provided by Q's knockup.\n\nXin not having his knockup is like Nasus's Q getting an accidental cap at 300 stacks. It changes the champion entirely, and forces a difference in playstyle.\n\nAt the very least, could there be some kind of notice that pops up in the launcher to put Xin's lack of knockup in peoples' faces, so those who haven't played him recently don't make fools of themselves, expecting his Q to function as advertised?","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfchylde","date":"2015-02-18T18:43:53.393+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.

Furthermore, the knockup on the Q is easily one of the top 3 most important components of his kit, so it not functioning should really result in disabling of the champion. I wonder how much aggregate LP was lost or how far his win rate dipped as a result of this bug. Definitely enough to warrant a disable or at least a update/message in the client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-02-18T18:39:04.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idunno about you, but without Xin being able to knock up the monsters, his first clear is atrocious now.
