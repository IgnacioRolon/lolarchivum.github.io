Just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-11-08T05:08:35.543+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Workin' on it - will hopefully be in next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"idiotness","date":"2014-11-09T23:09:20.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Eno! It's great to hear that you're working on this. As a matter of opinion, I think something -15dB from the current is a better neutral volume.\n\nTo others, if you want to manually override the sound files while we wait, they're located in\n\n> ...\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_patcher\\managedfiles\\0.0.0.9\\Content\\Runtime\\RiotClient\\Release\\bundle-chrome\\src\\audio\n\nI'd recommend making backups because it's unclear whether Riot will push the files again when the next patch ships and you might just end up permanently softer launch sounds (and maybe get a nasty surprise if they ever change it).","replies":[{"poster":"Chiskon","date":"2015-02-09T05:26:16.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After hurting my ears every time I logged in while forgetting to mute the game for the past few months I decided to look for this post.
