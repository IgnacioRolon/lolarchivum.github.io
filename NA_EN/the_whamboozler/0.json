He has no spells or abilities save his ult, which he doesn't get til level 6 as normal.  He has high base stats across the board to compensate... but no spells at all.  \r\n\r\nHis ult does one and only one thing.  It is a single-target spell that immediately kills an enemy champion with twice their current health in true damage, making it impossible to survive barring MASSIVE shield stacking or a very well-timed hourglass.  Kinda like Garen's ult on steroids.  His ultimate has a piss poor range of like.... 300 units.  A little over melee range, but still short.  It has a cooldown of 60 seconds... lowering to 40 as you increase it's rank at the levels that you could normally rank up your ult.\r\n\r\nIs this guy balanced?  Or not?  Discuss.","replies":[]}
