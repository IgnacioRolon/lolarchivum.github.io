She's currently an extremely fast clearer which, given all the other tools she has, is a strength we don't think she needs.\n\nDon't really know if I can have much input on this considering that as part of the balance team, you would probably know better than I would. However, I think the problem with Nidalee is mostly her safety in the jungle, being able to clear through it quickly it a large part of the problem, but she is able to sustain through it much faster and easier that a lot of other junglers currently (exception could be Fiddlesticks, maybe Olaf). She can counter-jungle very effectively, especially harassing the opposing jungler with her spears after healing up after her first couple camps, when the opposing jungler will most likely be at low HP. She's just maybe too safe in the jungle, and a little too effective. Her ganks rely on her landing her spears, so there's potential to survive her attempts with some quick feet.\n \nI think that making her abilities in Cougar form have a mana cost could help to mitigate her clear speeds, or make her choose between faster clear, or the dueling potential for counter-jungling. It would make her have to make active choices in either harassing with spears, continuous ganking, clear speeds and sustain - making her unable to do all of them too effectively.

WHY did this go through to live when the simplest of solution's was possible that wouldn't have horrible sides effects vs players. LOWER the 150 damage cap on monsters to 50.\n\n i guarentee you EVERY nid on the planet would rather have traps deal 50 damage to monsters than have deal NOTHING to players.\n\nyour buffing cait to get armor and magic pen to help with the tank meta. many champs have % hp.. nid's % hp is on the easiest skill in the game to counterplay and it would removed NEEDLESSLY.\n\nPLEASE revert this horrendous nerf on traps vs players. she can be nerfed in the jungle sure, but for heavens sake dont make this thing do worthless damage to players","replies":[]}]}
