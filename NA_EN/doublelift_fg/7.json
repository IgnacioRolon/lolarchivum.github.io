Hmm. It's hard to tell how much the Riptide CD will make up for the loss in Titan's Wrath damage. It is a step in the right direction, though. It doesn't make much sense to have power like that tied to a shield (Remember how Skarner's used to buff attack speed, but it was pointless because the shield always broke?). Maybe make Riptide do bonus damage to minions and monsters. Also, if you Dredge Line to a wall, the mana cost should be half refunded and the CD reduced.","replies":[{"poster":"cZair","date":"2015-02-28T02:02:39.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crewx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AG9qysjF,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-02-28T00:36:17.981+0000)\n>\n> That Volibear buff is fan-freaking-tastic.

That's why I think if you have AP% on 3 ( Q, E, and R) of his abilities people would be more likely to do AP.\nAlso building Triforce on Voli is already a thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-02-28T06:22:04.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you do know the cd is reduced already tho right?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HolyWarsPunish","date":"2015-02-27T23:51:14.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"BS BS BS they actually buffed nidalee... guys we need to boycott them wtf they totally went out of their minds","replies":[{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-02-28T00:30:05.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hardly a buff...
