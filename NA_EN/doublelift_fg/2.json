It would also be nice if you showed something on the buff bar about how much he is healing and when. Its actually really hard to notice his passive sometimes as the Trundle player and as the opponent. Its just odd considering there arent even particles or animations to show the healing is happening. His health regen also doesn't change to reflect this.\n\nAlso, have you considered making his AS on W 40/50/60/70/80% instead of 20/35/50/65/80%? I think it would be really nice to make it not forced to max until after Q and E. Would you really help out his jungling because of how much his E needs ranks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moobeat","date":"2015-03-03T16:19:28.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"as of 3/2, Range on passive is up to 1400 from 1000! \n\nTROLL TOWN.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2015-03-03T19:43:25.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cTBol6w6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-03T09:15:34.857+0000)\n>\n> Couple of other tentative changes in there too that probably won't get picked up by datamining:\n> \n> * Fixing a bug with his ult where the final damage tick wouldn't occur (well, that one's not tentative of course)\n> * Increasing the range on his passive.\n\nSo... Is this how bad power creep has become in regards to tank stats? Or is this an admitance that the jungle is too dificult to *not* powercreep the jungle? Trundle is still good, and doesn't need this. Heck, I still feel he is the epitome of balance in this game, as he can do his job as a bruiser without using tons of unnecessary mobility, and is one of the few junglers to be able to duel Lee early and win/break even. \n\nI know alot of old trundle mains, and people like me that chose him when we had to jungle, dropped him like a sack of potatoes when you deleted his character, but that doesn't mean he needs help or is weak. It means that it isn't the same champion, even if he plays exactly the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plantora","date":"2016-02-02T09:40:25.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may say, I really don`t think Trundle needs a buff, he is perfectly fine the way he is.  {{champion:48}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2015-03-03T14:20:41.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered allowing him to Ult Baron/Dragon again?

The recent Trundle passive change was a bit unclear but now when you mention it, i do know now what that 1000->1400 change was.\n\nWhile we're at datamining, could you give more context on Shyvana E buff? Shyv deals 3% max hp on hit on E debuffed targets since friday patch (i think so at least), yesterday it was nerfed to 2.5% but the damage is still the same anyway. I assume that other PBE guys didn't notice the change as the tooltip most likely have set 2% max hp instead of pulling the number from game files (if it's true, you may want to fix it).
