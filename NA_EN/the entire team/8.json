He went from a unqiue stoic guardian. Always prepared, vigilant, and guided while giving advice. He would tutor Shyvana to control her rage, Poppy in confidence and to move on from her tragic past. After his rework he was mostly compared to that giant jerk, or some compared him to Jayce. Jayce isn't a bad character, just why have two same attitude champions. I personally like the rework, he should be a Vanguard and not a mage ... warrior ... thing. He is more active in melee combat instead of a sniper. I can see the complaints in changing play styles.\n\nSwain was hated entirely based on looks and no Beatrice. His kit on the other hand, was considered perfecto by all, haters and lovers. His attitude, voice, everything else was good, it was his design that was considered a complete failure. It is the fact that he went from an old crippled man, with a walking stick and a six eyed bird, to a somewhat old muscle bound man with a claw hand like thing and no bird. People compared him to Vladimir, and considered he stole Vlad's rework. He even looks a bit like a older Vladimir with his hair style a bit matching. I personally agree, Swain was unique, even to his hair due. Now he is a copy pasted muscle mage, that seems to be the new fad these days. I prefer my mages and warlocks old, withered, and weak, but crafty, clever, and wise instead.\n\nHowever of all the reworks that are failures, Aatrox takes the cake and cries while eating it, absolute worst rework unchallenged. His rework makes the Juggernaut rework, including Morde, look successful. Everything that was Aatrox is no longer Aatrox. The only reason he is picked is because he is an early game power house who drops off just as bad as Pantheon, but is all better. This is an early game meta so of course pick the best early game champion. But that is the thing, old Aatrox was an auto attack late game destroyer when he got there. His revive was a late game changer that turned the tides when it was being used well. Auto attacks are also the best late game. \n\nStill continuing on, Aatrox's looks and lore are even worse. His old looks were jagged blades and armor, with a darkened, look to represent destruction and death of WAR. Now he is smooth and mostly red, looking like more of a plastic toy, what a joke. His lore rework destroyed League of Legends. It changed from a LEAGUE OF LEGENDARY HEROES FROM ACROSS THE PLANET AND COSMOS to League of Lovecraft. The Void is the big bad, what about the Shadow Isles? Or the Frozen Watchers? The Shadow Isles will probably turn into some innocent anti hero group or something. The Frozen Watchers even got retconned into the leaders of The Void, such a terrible shame. This is the same mistakes WoW made, changed a unique lore into just another Lovecraft story. Always happens when Lovecraft is involved.\n\nBut it doesn't even end there, now for the worst part. So Aatrox's kit, and looks are completely different, but what about his attitude? Horrible, absolutely horrible, I mean AFFECTS YOUR HEALTH HORRIBLE! Whoever in Riot thought it was a good idea to make a champion seethe, whisper, rage while yelling, what have you about wanting to commit suicide and hates all life a good idea ... that person should be mentally checked. I think that person wants to commit suicide and should be helped not to do it. Listen to old Aatrox's audio file, you'll hear an awesome, fantastic, professional Demon God of War at his finest work. He had the best voice, attitude, and lines, no other champion could even be close to compete. Now he is a suicidal depressed emo bitch, to which again, wants to commit suicide. I sometimes have to take breaks from the game after playing him because he makes me so sad and super depressed from just listening to him. I could just mute him but that doesn't really work.\n\nPhew long winded rant there haha, Aatrox rework was a personal one. Also before I forget the man behind Aatrox's rework stated that the rework was NOT for Aatrox's mains. ... Then what the f%$k is the point of a rework for then?","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2019-01-19T00:30:10.078+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having everything turn to Lovecraft when Lovecraft is involved is just so freaking weird to someone who's read Lovecraft before. It shouldn't be this giant affair threatening to take over the world or whatever, because that immediately misses the point. Part of the point is that those Old Ones simply don't even care about us, so why would they worry themselves with taking over our world? If they wanted, they could subjugate us or destroy us on a whim, so why the theatrics with the Prophet of the Void and the released void creatures? As far as I'm concerned, it's not even Lovecraftian in anything but the naming schemes. Part of the madness that comes with interacting with anything relating to the Old Ones is the feeling that they're incomprehensibly powerful and beyond our understanding, and it's when you try to understand that you become mad. You don't become \"corrupted\" by them and become their agent, you just go bonkers by having your reality completely and utterly broken by beings who don't operate on the same rules of reality that we do. \n\nI hate WoW's twisting of Lovecraft, and I'm not a fan of League's rendition, either.

He was a silent battle manipulator that shaped valoran for milennia just for fun at first, and now he’s a rage-fueled chaos machine who’s only hope is to eliminate reality to free himself.\n\nPersonally, I dislike that fallen Ascendants and Darkin are now the same thing. It never sat right with me, and the fact that we can technically count Xerath and Renekton as Darkin seems to be aggravating everyone. I can get behind the Darkin as once being noble, or Aatrox being desperate to find a host after his current one/s die, but the complete personality flip just doesn’t settle right. How’s he even supposed to eliminate reality anyways, become so massive he collapses in on himself? \n\nGameplay wise, he’s just a completely different champ than he used to be. While none of the kits fit the theme they were trying to portray well, parts of his old kit would’ve worked so much better st accomplishing this than his new one. For example, he’s currently supposed to be a nigh unstoppable force that manipulates the bodies of the fallen to improve himself somehow, without changing how he fights much. Only thing that uses dead/hurt enemies is his e, which is basically lifesteal and two dashes plus a damage bump. His old passive grants him the ability to become stronger and revive based on how much he hurt the enemy, his old w allowed him to drain the life of enemies more efficiently or utilize his health to deal increased damage to enemies, and his old ult literally sucked life force from nearby enemies to empower him. All of these fit better than a glorified grievous wounds, a magic chain that resets itself after a second or two, and a slight bump in damage/health and a revive if used under like 10 seconds.\n\nRegarding appearances, his original model and animations look better than almost all of his new ones. The only new animation/model I like is his transformation for his R, but not the ability itself. Even his splash art was better, as originally he looked cold and calculating, maybe gonna kill you maybe not, while the new one looks like he fell backwards after stepping on dog crap and is expressing mild disappointment/disgust awkwardly through his teeth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deathhawk888","date":"2019-01-18T14:28:27.262+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I’ve heard people wanting {{champion:50}} to be reverted simply because Beatrice is not there or his old kit was “better”, but old Swain had to build full Mana and Zhonyas just to be relevant past 20 mins.\n\nPeople say they want X reverted because they had a bad experience with them or have nostalgia goggles, like Akali.

Rework introduced more counterplay in almost all aspects of her kit, backloading and spacing out her damage, restricting her mobility and adding actual resource management. Yes, true stealth is bullshit, but other than that Akali is by far the best designed assassin.\n\nSeriously, did you people already forget how fun was it to lane against old Akali? Old \"dominate her for first 5 levels then die when she reaches 6 anyway\" Akali? Old \"all my damage is instant point-and-click so if you're in range of my triple gapcloser I statcheck you to death\" Akali? Old \"I'm either useless or broken with no middle ground\" Akali? Yeah.
