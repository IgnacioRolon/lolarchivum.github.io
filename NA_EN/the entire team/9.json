Tankiness and damage should not coexist. You must sacrifice one to get the other. None of this titanic hydra, sterak’s, and a few other “juggernaut” items that gives tankiness *and* damage. \n\nThis also goes for carries. Phantom dancer, death’s dance, maw of malmortius, banshee’s, abyssal mask (which I admit is not really a carry item), zhonya’s should perhaps be toned down if not outright removed.\n\n% hp damage, true damage, and % damage reduction (the type that cannot be pierced by pen) need to be severely restricted.\n\nOn to lethality items and the can of worms duskblade opened: free damage on items that make you play around the item, and not around the champion, needs to go. That includes guinsoo’s, that includes stormrazor, and others. Items should be *augmenting* your champion, not defining your champion.\n\nAs for increasing tankiness, there just simply needs to be more reward for getting pure tank items. Perhaps reducing damage across the board in the way I described might also cause this to happen. Nonetheless, I don’t feel as rewarded building a randuin’s/frozen heart/spirit visage as I do building a titanic hydra/deadman’s plate/sterak’s gauge/abyssal mask/wits end.\n\nThere are two other things I would like to address. One, cooldown reduction is too easily accessible and maxed cdr is expected on most of the champion pool now as opposed to only a few back in the day. Two, there is *far more* cc in the game and much of it is not reducible via tenacity.","replies":[{"poster":"BOOSTlNG4NUDES","date":"2018-12-11T23:59:13.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remove lethality and give old armor pen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-12-11T12:18:45.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They have the same net effect.\n\nIf you increase **all** durability by 100%, that has the exact same effect as reducing **all** damage by 50%, but you have bigger overall numbers.\n\nThey have the exact same meaning.

You survive longer with more tankiness as a tank. You shouldn't have lots of time to do these things if you didn't invest in defense. Damage dealers should be glass cannons. Tanks should be the exact opposite.\n\nI do think damage is too high for tanks though. Getting one shot by a tank at level 18 is no fun.
