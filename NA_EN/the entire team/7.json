Get out of here.\n\nThe flaw in that logic is that you expect tanks to be like an MMO tank: a job that requires little input and little awareness of your HP, and to think about nothing else other than initiate the fight and act like the dummy. That's not how a MOBA tank works (at least, in Riot's eyes). They peel for their damage dealers, they initiate to get a good fight starting, they CC a lot to disrupt assassins, and they have to be a little more mobile to catch other people.

Able to take more of a beating than a man due to armour plating, but not generally known for speed and manoeuvrability. \n\nBut if you think that tanks just sit out on the battlefield occasionally firing on anything that takes their fancy, you need to update your tactics from WW1. Tanks require thinking to properly use, and that holds true in games as well. Contrary to whatever people on here are saying, a tank does not just sit there mashing 'attack'. They do in fact have to keep an eye on their HP, they have to control aggro to stop it going onto the healers or that one idiot DPS that just won't position correctly, they have to face the boss correctly (and that's not always purely away from everyone else), dodge damage zones, throw up self-mitigation at the right times, and if it's WoW raids, know when to hand off to the _other_ tank because the boss is designed to wear through one over time. If a tank isn't paying attention to their HP, it's because they have more important things to worry about that no one else can do for them, whilst at least their HP can be dealt with by the healer. Everything OP has listed as things MOBA tanks do that MMO tanks don't, MMO tanks are doing.\n\nBut going away from that (not-so-)little aside, do you know what a Juggernaut is doing? They're taking all the attention onto themselves because they're going non-stop for the enemy squishies. If Nasus gets in amongst the ADCs/Mages, does the team ignore him? No, usually everything goes on the Nasus: CC, damage, shields/heals on his target. Juggernauts disrupt fights every bit as much as the things Riot has accepted are tanks; the only difference is they do it by being a threat rather than by being a pest with CC. The very fact we describe them as tanky should suggest to the sensible that they are tanks. If you want to give them their own sub-class _within_ tanks then by all means go ahead.\n\nRiot's position on this is like going into a shop and seeing a blue hat being advertised as a red hat. The store can say it's red all they like, but if I throw that hat into a spectrometer and get a reflected wavelength of 450nm, it's blue irrespective of how delusional the shopkeeper is.\n\nNow, to get downvoted by all the very obvious 'I MUST stand in the fire' DPS players I can see that think MMO tanking is a faceroll....","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2019-10-20T20:52:53.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I liked what you were saying until you started throwing in secondary ideals of a tank.

There is a such thing as infantry-based siege, but the lack of protection often forces the unit to dial down the scope of damage involved.\n\nYou can place as many secondary purposes on a tank as you want, their primary reason for existing in battle is having protection to get into range, and then fire absurdly powerful artillery.

Every other trait is so much less important that even if a tank has none of it's secondary traits, people will still identify it as a tank as long as it's just \"durable\"\n\nIndeed, I agree with you here and in many of your posts.\n\nJuggernauts ARE tanks in a common sense, but aren't tanks as a LoL class, as I stated in my previous comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Keiaga","date":"2019-10-20T08:17:00.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's a case of both sides being right.
