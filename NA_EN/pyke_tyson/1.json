I've seen players get tilted because other players \"ignored\" them when they were actually chat/ping muted and led to missplays.\n\nIf you're not bming or further pushing a player to get tilted, I pesonally don't find any issue in letting people know they're being muted as long as it's just that, without any other message, so both players can move on. If the muted player moves on to griefing or afking, that behavior would happen even if that player wasn't told to be muted, because that mentality would be triggered by anything that goes wrong in the match anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-09T23:02:26.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you just say, \"muted,\" then the answer is no. \n\nif you say, \"alright i muted this dumbass that's so much better,\" then maybe\n\nThe automated punishment system _seems to be_ based on keywords, frequency of chat, frequency of keywords, and reports","replies":[{"poster":"Pyke Tyson","date":"2019-08-09T23:10:32.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=enshine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HzLGy36m,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-09T23:02:26.475+0000)\n>\n> If you just say, \"muted,\" then the answer is no. \n> \n> if you say, \"alright i muted this dumbass that's so much better,\" then maybe\n> \n> The automated punishment system _seems to be_ based on keywords, frequency of chat, frequency of keywords, and reports\n\nAlright, that's what I thought.
