Now every time the game launches it launches on the wrong monitor, the secondary display. Which is a lower resolution. How do I redirect league to launch on the primary display?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T19:42:43.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's [currently an issue](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001073767--Jan-11-Click-here-if-you-re-getting-an-Out-Of-Range-or-Input-Not-Supported-error-on-loading-screen-) where some players are receiving messages like that this morning.

I found that alt+enter and then resetting to full screen restores it to the correct display. The game is now launching on the primary display but if I alt+tab I have to re-do that process. Thanks for working on the fix! Good luck.","replies":[]}]}]}
