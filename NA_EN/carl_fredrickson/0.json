Initially waited 6 minutes to have an AFK check pop, hit yes and no one answered. Waited another 4 minutes for the next one to pop. Got into that lobby and after making it through most of the bans someone AFK'd then I waited another 8 minutes for the queue to pop... so on and so on.\r\n\r\nI am in Silver I - not a high elo with low amounts of people... why is this happening? It has happened to me the last 4 or 5 days.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-19T21:32:38.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does seem not normal at all.  It is possible that while in the queue, you disconnect from our PvP.net Servers but nothing immediately happens on your client as the queue time continues, even though it can't find you a match because were disconnected.  If this continues to consistently happen, make sure to complete the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  The steps there should allow us to rule out the connection as a possible root cause.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Carl Fredrickson","date":"2016-05-22T23:42:47.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the answer! If it continues to happen I will check out the connection issues.\n\nI don't know if it has been widely reported but it is widely known that if you sit in a queue for a while and cancel and reconnect it will usually insta-pop.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Carl Fredrickson","date":"2016-05-19T18:37:58.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"11:37 - made it.","replies":[]}]}
