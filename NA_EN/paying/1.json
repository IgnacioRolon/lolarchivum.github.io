I'm curious if your computer and AC are plugged into the same wall outlet. It's possible under some circumstances to overload an outlet and cause power issues for certain electronics on the same outlet. I'm also curious if you have your computer hooked up to a surge protector or a power strip. \n\nWith a bit more background on this issue, I believe I'll have a better idea what the cause could be,","replies":[{"poster":"Paying","date":"2016-07-28T05:26:06.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its connected to a surge protector and yes its connected to the same wall outlet. i changed where i plugged my headphones to, and it seems to be working so far, but the thing is that the particular usb outlet that i used to connect my headphones to is the problem, and not the headphones themselves, i think. in any case, thanks for trying to help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"theArtifacts","date":"2016-07-26T17:38:56.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may also be an issue in the walls of your home where the AC is wired in such a way that the wiring is running parallel to and in close proximity to your LAN line and or modem/router. It may be causing electromagnetic interference within the lines however it seems more likely that Targons is correct.","replies":[]}]}
