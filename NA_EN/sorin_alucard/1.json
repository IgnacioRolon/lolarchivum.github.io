But let's talk about your one rogue player shall we? if we limit in game punishments from moderators to their specific games (IE I can only say this guy is being super toxic and deserves a chat ban while I'm in IN THE GAME with him) then you limit the damage that is dealt - I would also suggest that the punishments stack similarly to how they do normally - so if I say this guy needs a chat ban and he's been chat banned several times for good reason then it automatically goes up to a (I forget if it's 1 week ban after chat ban or two week - but you get the idea) likewise if I say that this is toxic enough to be a 1 week ban but it's a first offense then it gets looked at but probably goes to a chat ban instead. Riot actually being reasonable with the system (eyes roll at riot being reasonable with something for a change... still haven't fixed death recap...) would both limit and increase the power at the same time- powerful enough that their ability to just take toxic people out of the game is there - but not powerful enough that they can cause serious damage... unless the people they are targeting are truly the worst of the worst in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2018-03-17T04:00:25.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't need to be overly complicated or impossible to implement ---- we used to have tribunal after all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheWhiteElephant","date":"2018-03-16T18:03:25.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UxG5apjF,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-03-15T17:05:57.621+0000)\n>\n> Out of curiosity, what is your proposal?\n\nWant a simple solution?\n\nRito's epic punishment system is linear regardless of offense category. There are basically no merits to this flow, and it is extremely ineffective at accomplishing what it sets out to do:\n10-game chat restrict -> 25-game chat restrict -> 14-day ban -> perma-ban\n\nSo what you end up with are permabanned accounts for \"toxic\" chat. (Which seems to be judged on an \"if you wouldn't say it to a 2 year old\" judgment system.) What do those players do? Leave, maybe. Or get a new account, with a fresh honor level, no chat restriction or whatever. So what do they do? Reform, maybe. Or not.\n\nI propose my radical, life-changing, fantastical solution: **TWO(?!)** punishment tracks:\n\n- Toxic in chat?  10-Game Chat Restrict -> 25-Game Chat Restrict -> Permanent Chat Restrict -> Permanent CHAT Ban\n - *Extremely* toxic in chat? (Racism, etc.) Start at Permanent Chat Restrict or Permanent Chat Ban\n- Intentionally feeding? 14-Day ban -> Permanent ban\n\nNotice that the chat-related punishments bar you from using---you guessed it---chat! If Tyler2 is extremely toxic in chat and gets permanently _chat banned_, he's going to have a lot less incentive to level (or buy, etc.)  a new account. Now he can continue playing but cannot flame his teammates. If he redirects his efforts by intentionally feeding, now his account gets banned.\n\nThis still has the potential eventuality that accounts get banned and players acquire new accounts, but in the likely much more common case people will continue to play but just without chat privileges. Now:\n\n- They keep their skins, rank, etc\n - Fewer smurfs! When that Platinum or Diamond(+) player gets chat banned, they continue playing in their elo instead of starting fresh at high Silver/low Gold.\n - Fewer [anti-smurfs?]! When that Bronze player gets chat banned, they continue playing in Bronze instead of starting fresh at high Silver/low Gold.\n - Fewer [anti-]smurfs means less toxicity. The Diamond Riven player stomping the Silver Yasuo in top lane is probably going to cause the Silver player to get flamed. Likewise, the Bronze player that starts over at basically Gold 5 MMR is probably going to feed and CS poorly until they fall back to Bronze, because they are playing above their elo.\n- Fewer accounts are created \n - More summoner names for everyone!\n- Less people are raging in chat\n - More people retaining accounts without chat privileges vs acquiring new accounts\n- The message regarding intentionally feeding is firmer and stronger\n\nI literally cannot conceive a single reason as to why anyone would think this is not simply a better solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2018-03-16T20:10:31.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this would help greatly.\n\nTo add to your point\n\nI think moderators could help, even contributing to this system (to determine the track).

Partly because toxic players are no more or less likely to spend money, but mostly because this equate account age, hours played, and money spent with how important a player is to the community. That's pretty unfair to the guy who picked up *League* a month ago to play with his kids, plays only rarely, and spends money elsewhere, but passionately loves the game.

I would even go as far as saying that the elo system when leveling is broken beyond all recognition. \n\nI am a DotA 2 player with approx. 3.5k hours in game. A friend suggested I try league of legends as well. One weekend I was bored enough to try and I created an account. \n\n\nThe first games were easy of course (bot matches) and then the first 5 matches against real players were easily won with my moba knowledge from DotA (ganking, csing, objectives and basic spacing and prediction). HOWEVER, after about 10 games of decently challenging opponents where I really felt I was learning about LoL and aclimitmising to the structure of a different MOBA beast, things went horribly wrong. Suddenly my level 6/8 account was matched against level 20 and above accounts. I even had some opponents that were level 30 and were mid silver tier players. \n\nThis turned my games sour in the worst way. I was flamed constantly for not knowing every skill of every hero in the game. I was reported constantly and I lost 10ish straight games. That's when I quit. DotA was no where near that level of absolute ridiculousness. When I started in 2012 I played with my friends and I fed horribly, but I was having fun and learning at the same time. \n\nI really think measures need to be taken to ensure new players have a decent experience first time. The level 30 grind is far too long as is, compared to almost every other Moba. \n\n\nIn conclusion, what I have seen of the matchmaking system in league has led me to view it as archaic, with no place in the modern Moba world.\n\nI don't hate the game, I hate the system (as well as some of the players).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-03-15T17:24:16.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chermorg,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UxG5apjF,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2018-03-15T17:14:27.831+0000)\n>\n\n> Toxicity in League is already much better than in many other large multiplayer games so...\n\nThat's a tough position to defend.

An IP ban may block an entire family because of the actions of one individual.  \n\nAlso, as is the case with any system, those that want to come back will do so because ANY measure you use has a workaround, IP addresses are easiest to change, MAC Addresses/hardware IDs are pretty easy to spoof, there are websites dedicated to circumventing two-factor authentication issues so that you don't have to use your real phone number and so on.  \n\nThreads like this, while certainly based upon good intentions, aren't really realistic in their solutions.
