So my question is regarding the BE \"Mission\" I've been hearing about through friends and the league of legends subreddit. I have not recieved this mission, nor the blue essence from my previously bought runes. Now, It's been a fair few years before I bought my runes but lucky me I started with some friends who were already playing so they were all T3 Runes. And after counting them all last night, I came to the conclusion that they should reach 13.5k BE (4.5k from 5 different sets of 3 T3 Quints and 9k from 10 different sets of 9  T3 glyphs, marks and seals.) Upon logging in I was given 5.6k some odd BE making a total of 11.5k with the 6k IP I had been building up. I've been told the mission simply requires a win in any matchmade game and the \"BE orbs\" will appear in your loot tab. I've checked it a few times to no avail. Any ideas? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T02:16:07.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm yea this looks a little odd tbh.
