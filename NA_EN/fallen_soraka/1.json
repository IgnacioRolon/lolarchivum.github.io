Draw a Bead originally increases the range of basic attacks, Explosive Charge, and Buster Shot. Since those two abilities are offensive abilities, Draw a Bead may also increase the range of Gatling Gun, Bio-Arcane Barrage, and Parrrley. If the enemy tries to get out of range, you can use Bio-Arcane Barrage with the Draw a Bead buff or use Super Mega Death Rocket to finish off the target.\n\nThis guy is suppose to have a similar appearance to {{champion:42}} but instead of piloting a slow helicopter, he pilots a fighter class aircraft.","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-28T03:04:38.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: Nasus \nW: Sion\nE: Zac\nR: Tryndamere\npassive: Volibear.\n\nHere is a raidboss, fuckloads of damage from nasus q, great mobility, and practically unkillable even if you five man focus him. only weakness, he needs to afk farm for the first 20 minutes of game, after that he is un-matchable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyril Slate","date":"2015-06-27T23:23:00.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} Passive: Shurima's Legacy\n{{champion:74}} Q: H-28G Evolution Turrets\n{{champion:9}} W: Drain\n{{champion:45}} E: Event Horizon\n{{champion:34}} R: Glacial Storm\n\nPardon me while I become the most non-gankable person ever.\nLittle turrets, big turrets, stunning, slowing, draining.
