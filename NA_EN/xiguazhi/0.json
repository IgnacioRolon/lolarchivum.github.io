I have Service objects created for all the specified ports that RITO lists but this seems not to have helped at all.  This is the only internet service I seem to be having issues with.  After going through my logs on my firewall and logging all activity for a week I noticed through searching the IP addresses my computer is connecting to for league that there is a vast range of UDP ports that seems to be getting packets blocked by my firewall when it is an INCOMING connection, as long as my machine initiates the connection it doesn't seem to be a problem.  This is pretty typical of most Firewalls I believe.  Anyways,is there something I am missing or does League of Legends really use ports 10,000-20,000 UDP to connect in game? and are these packets that my client should be requesting and its just getting missed?  Any tips etc.  would be helpful.  I thought QoS would help but that hasn't done anything for me either, I have a pretty big pipe and don't typically have an abnormal amount of traffic going on in my home.\n\n\nI would also add that I realize this is similar behavior to some VoIP services that use UDP, does it work in a similar way to RTP? in that it uses a random port in a port range?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T17:18:48.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best route of getting a solution for your packet loss is reaching out to our tech specialists by [submitting a ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) To ensure our tech specialists have all the information required to assist you, I recommend attaching a set of logs using our [Hextech Repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs), and the URL to a completed [Network Analysis.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq1) Should you elect to, you can also include a [traceroute log](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) as well.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
