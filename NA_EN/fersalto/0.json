I closed the game after a few minutes of it trying to reconnect and there is no option to rejoin for either of us. It's as if we'e not even in a game right now. This friend is playing from a different location as I am so I know it has nothing to do with out internet. I've linked what my client looks like to show my client is acting as if the match doesn't exist. \n\nEDIT: I was trying to add a second link and messed it up and can't edit it but if you directly copy the first its the client, the second is match history which doesn't show that game.\n\n\nMy concern with this is: Is the game still going and are we going to lose LP because of this if so?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T20:02:33.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The screenshot isn't coming up, but these symptoms sound like connection issues.  There were also some ISP problems during the time of your post, so that might have played a part.  Is everything okay now?  If the game is still going on or results in a remake then it would count as a loss.","replies":[]}]}
