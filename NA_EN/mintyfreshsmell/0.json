Static damage:  140 / 160 / 180 / 200 / 220\n(Git rid of the crit it is a bit unpredictable in damage and extend the range to the previous flash distance.  He just doesn't have the escape/distance he use to have.  Plus his orange smoke appear in fog of war to players so this really isn't much of a buff.)\n\nJack in the Box should last about 90 second up from 60 seconds.  Saying the jungle camps will be exploited really is moot since players showed they can still do it with 60 second and other champs like Jhin are now taking advantage of leveling from traps in camps.\n\nRevert the change on Shaco's Two handed shiv to include his base AD and not his bonus AD.  I was just a nerf to him in the guise of a buff.\n\nAnd lastly leave his Hallucinate the same.\n\nFixed!

If you run from him he has a ranged slow, a gap closer and does bonus damage. If you stay and fight he has a stealth flash and a a fear that does a good chunk of consistent damage. If you try and chase him you should never be able to catch him. Basically, the opponent's level of play is almost irrelevant versus how well the Shaco plays.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2016-02-24T03:08:32.852+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reworking shaco is hard for their is always one or two abilities that everyone completely identifies with a champion.

With Tristana it was her rocket jump and her Q steroid, she kept those. \n\nI think you are noticing a pattern here, a champion in a major rework in the end always keaps a signature move that makes us go \"Yeah that's what makes Shen, Shen\"\n\nHowever when I think of shaco, I think of his entire toolkit, how he annoyingly goes invisible and dashes a million mlies away from me, how he can clone himself and turn a one v into a two v one, how  he can put boxes down, how he throws shivs that slow me so he can catch up and have good ganks.\n\nShaco is probabbly the hardest champion to rework, for the question is, what do you get rid of, what do you change, and what do you invent for him?\n\nFor let's be honest, when we think of Shaco we think of everything that he is, not just one or two abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-02-24T16:24:04.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only things I can really say they could do something with are his passive and his E, at least when it comes to completely changing an ability. Those two are the ones that can be changed significantly while still being able to retain their feel. But I think you underestimate how much Shaco could be changed just by tweaking his other abilities.\n\nLike his boxes, what is so iconic about them? Suddenly running into a nest of boxes because you got baited by a Shaco. But this means you can change how they deal damage, maybe have them wind up and then explode instead of being DPS traps? Maybe have them be a bit like Zigg's E and have Shaco able to get a short dash if he's near a box when it goes off? You could make his Q invisibility leave behind an after image when he initially stealths so you get an idea of where he went? Maybe it could be a two phase ability where he uses it once and that preps him to deal more damage on his next auto but if he uses it again it will remove that buff and instead stealth him?\n\nBreaking down his abilities helps to get into the more nuanced ways of making them healthier while also still holding true to the spirit of the ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-02-24T11:51:00.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres a few champions for me who has 4 abilities in their kit that makes me recognize them for who they are.\n\n\nShaco, Zed, Katarina, and Leblanc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-02-24T09:39:28.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Shaco Passive and E ( the knife throw ) could be reworked actually, but those are so effective for how much are simple that it' s not a real problem for the time being.
