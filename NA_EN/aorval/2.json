The patch for Preseason 8 introduced over hundreds of different patches to the game. New runes, stat changes on EVERY champion, item changes, etc. There were tons of stuff introduced, now look at Season 9. You&#039;re looking at over 72 different patches this season to start off. Riot needs to stop doing these big patches, stop introducing new things like champions and reworks, and just flat out balance the game one step at a time. They need to add the stuff they changed in the first place that were already balanced as is. Minion gold changes need to be reverted back to normal for instance. \r\n\r\nMark my words, season 9 will be worse if Riot continues to do these big patches without facing the actual problem.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-12-30T00:12:57.430+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"its riot... the fact that I'm still playing even rarely means i have accepted the fact the game is never going to get better so I'm trying to enjoy whatever i can.\n\nthere is nothing riots other teams can do to save this game with the balance team this far gone.\n\n how long have we said damage is too high... all it does it get higher\n\n hell we now have minions running at 423 fucking movement speed now\n\n i cant even catch up to my own damn minion wave after 25 min.\n\n how they even got past the concept phase to even be on the table.. let alone make it to internal testing then pbe then live, is beyond me\n\nminions  move so damn fast now skill-shot anywhere near them are impossible to land","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2018-12-31T02:13:14.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of giving the minions super speed they should have instead added a banner of command siege minion every 3 or 6 waves.\n\nThe movement speed along with the creep block is awful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juice","date":"2018-12-29T22:09:25.442+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Of course, it already introduced even more damage via stat bonus selection and more gimmicky stuff like the minion gold change\n\nRiot is owned by Tencent, nothing will change, this ride only goes downhill","replies":[{"poster":"mosdeadly","date":"2018-12-31T07:35:21.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Juice,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EcJjQXEn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-29T22:09:25.442+0000)\n>\n> Of course, it already introduced even more damage via stat bonus selection and more gimmicky stuff like the minion gold change\n> \n> Riot is owned by Tencent, nothing will change, this ride only goes downhill\n\nTencent has proved to me with some of their content that they are capable of making great content and clearly seem to leave companies to their own affairs.\n\nNo we are giving tencent too much credit when the blame falls on rito.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2018-12-31T08:05:43.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Their bias work ethic and refusal to listen to the community happened long before anything with Tencent.

They will be half tanks, half bruisers. Just look at Ornn and Senjuani changes. More damage. The 10% more resistances on Ornn won't really make him a tank. Also, if I am reading this correctly, he will be able to upgrade one item from his team mates for free?
