This whole game since patch 7.22 was introduced has been RNG on who wins. The stomp or be stomped meta. The 1 death per minute is completely normal now meta. The 3 autos from Irelia level one does 90% of your health meta. On this account, I have counted the number of times I have lost lane, which is 11 times. The total number of losses I have are 43 as I am writing this post. What in the actual hell am I supposed to do to carry games today? Seems like whenever im somewhat decently fed top with 3/0 kills, someone on the enemy team is 7/0 already. Seriously, what is the strategy behind winning today? Because I seriously have been trying everything to find it since season 8 started and have yet to find anything. The only strategy that somewhat works is to completely dominate your lane and roam, which thats not always possible to do if the enemy laner is playing extremely passive or if youre getting ganked 24/7. A few games ago, I got ganked 13 times in 16 minutes, not exaggerating either, I counted 13 times where I got ganked while my jungler ganked twice.\r\n\r\nThis game is getting wack, and if season 9 changes nothing the first few months, then im truly gone from this game and am just gonna focus fully on college and work instead.","replies":[{"poster":"XL BENCH PRESS","date":"2019-01-22T09:04:48.612+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember a year or two ago, people used to say 'all games are winnable so long as you carry'.

I had a specific playstyle with full lethality runes (nobody took on Jayce). They also took away a rune I used a lot, it was the equivalent of Phase Rush but instead of having to hit 3 separate times to activate, you only had to do 30% of their health in a couple seconds. Also Jayce was meta at the time, being a otp on Jayce I was able to abuse that a lot. Today Jayce is ranked Tier 3 because he doesnt have enough mobility or powerspike anymore to end games unlike a lot of meta champions. Thats one of the main reasons, the other reason is simply because people die too much today compared to season 7 and before.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-01-24T00:19:14.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlucky.\n\nThough, to get back to your original complaint about team holding you back, thing is you should expect to lose at least 30-40% of your games through no fault of your own no matter what, no matter the meta, just due to it being a team-game. And that's not a problem, because a 65+% winrate is more than enough to climb quickly.\n\nOne game like that is frustrating, but it's nothing unexpected.

However, he can also roam from to win short skirmishes with well-placed shockblasts and all-ins, reset, and resume  splitpush near the next objective.  Successful roams get his team ahead, and every assist he earns during each one is roughly a wave of gold.\n\nTry to use your lead to win map control.  Push in the enemy top laner during lane phase, drop a deep ward, and wait for the enemy jungler to show on it.  Ping for your jungler to grab the free drake.

The main reasons are the fact that you can get yourself ahead by winning lane and setting ur opponent behind. As you are ahead you can just shove the wave on and help your jg gank other lanes, which not only improves their ganks, but nearly guarantees a kill.
