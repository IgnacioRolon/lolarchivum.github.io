The thing I hate the most about League is the fact that people can talk shit to you, but when you reply, you just get hammered down. This SJW meta type dogshit that consists in this game is completely stupid. \n\nThe fact I get a 10 game chat restriction for calling out and inter on one of my other fresh accounts, https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=mousebrother look at the Fiddle ADC and sivir support. Sivir force took Fiddles role as adc because Fiddle's Draven was banned, Fiddle says hes still going adc but as fiddle. Sivir starts stealing Fid's cs rather than supporting, thus Fiddle ints. I jump in to tell Sivir how she should stop csing and just support so fid can adc and we will win, she continues being toxic along with fid and loses us the game. I myself got a chat restriction on the account for that one bloody game, because this is what is toxic in league for fucks sake. People who are inting, people who mindlessly think for themselves, this is whats toxic. People saying insults is toxic sure, but you can literally mute them. You cant mute someone who is inting or contributing to the kid inting. \n\nAnyways, the game that happened we got a Kayn. The Kayn was someone who I played with/against many times on multiple accounts and he knows my Twitch. Every time I played with/against, he always flames everyone. This game he decides to flame me for being an \"inting ugly nerd losing his promos\". So I decide to respond back to it, considering this is what he does every single games ive ever played with him. Surely enough, he submits this one bloody chat game to a Riot support member, who then IP bans me. \n\nEvery single account I have, is gone. I cant even log into any of them for the \"reasoning\" except for this one. Which this one, all it shows is this one game. This one single game of toxicity, which costs all 40 of my accounts. No \"Kys\" mentioned, not one swear word, literally just made fun of the dudes looks and language so he gets a taste of his own medicine for what he does every game, and thats worth all 40 of my accounts to be banned? It's actually ridiculous, all this does is create a more toxic environment, because now all that happens is I go back to a fresh account with a more toxic mentality because Riot simply does not care. If you want to stop toxicity, start banning the real problems which is Inting/Trolling. Neither I, or the Kayn (who is toxic), should receive a perma ban for something that can be stopped by a simple mute button. All this does is make players more and more toxic when they get banned. \n\nAnyways, heres the chat logs. Sure one game of toxicity for good reason, guess that means all 40 accounts should be banned.\n\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nAORVAL: aight just let me solo her **(When he failed gank top)**\nAORVAL: getting yas fed **(Reply to enemy Irelia)**\nAORVAL: my lanes done\nAORVAL: just gonna open it **(I say this all the time because my mental is weak but I never actually open/afk in my games ever)**\nAORVAL: go next\nAORVAL: ok %%%%%%%%%%% lmfao\nAORVAL: go back to china s%%%%%%%%%%%nty eye kid\nAORVAL: welp\nAORVAL: thats what happens when you get a shit jungler that screws your lane\nAORVAL: no wonder you only have 1 viewer on twitch lol\nAORVAL: bad at league and a crybaby\nAORVAL: report?\nAORVAL: ggez\nAORVAL: winnable btw xD\nPost-Game\nAORVAL: yeah\nAORVAL: kayn has a twitch btw\nAORVAL: 1 viewer\nAORVAL: poggers\nAORVAL: ugly asian as well\nAORVAL: %%%%%%%%%%% bing bing bing\nAORVAL: eggwol\nA%%%%%%%%%%%ou has eggwol\nAORVAL: bing bing bing\n\nhttps://imgur.com/YyIn4lE","replies":[{"poster":"insomniacjezz","date":"2019-04-21T03:07:42.474+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must be pretty special to deserve an IP ban, as far as I know Riot doesn’t hand those out...ever.","replies":[{"poster":"AORVAL","date":"2019-04-21T03:09:24.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=insomniacjezz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7hY7mjg5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-04-21T03:07:42.474+0000)\n>\n> You must be pretty special to deserve an IP ban, as far as I know Riot doesn’t hand those out...ever.\n\nGuess being racist deserves an IP ban then idk.

You should word your post better.\n\n That's clearly not all I took from the post considering I offered you advice in the form of what to do, and then I explained why IP/ID bans (most likely) wouldn't be applied to a regular player such as yourself.  The reason I didn't specifically mention anything relating to the Kayn/Sivir situations is because your racism was so egregious that it didn't matter. \n\n If you want me to address that, I'll give you the same spiel that anyone else would give you. Someone else's rulebreaking doesn't justify your own, just because they broke the rules doesn't mean you get to stoop to their level and skirt by without punishment. A mute button might be a solution in _other_ games, but Riot has made it clear that they don't want any sort of negativity on their platform. \n\nDon't like it? Don't play. That's generally how rules work for optional activities. \n\n>Riot bans all my accounts for one game?

You're complaining about the state of the game/community and then **directly contributing to the very minority that upset you in the first place.** It's backwards and you're just being a hypocrite.\n\n Like I said though, you're only wasting _your_ time and your time alone.
