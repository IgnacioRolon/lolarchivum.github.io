We&#039;re going to use this space to talk about this issue and offer some examples to illustrate the reasons why this is a harmful practice.\n\nLet&#039;s take a look at the most common scenarios:\n\n \n\n&bull; **You give your password to a friend or family member**\n\nNooooo! Don&#039;t do it! The only person that should know your  password is you. Don&#039;t forget that accounts are personal. Each summoner is unique, which means that when his account is shared, part of its personality is lost in the process. Don&#039;t give your password to that friend who wants to check out your skins or to that cousin who just joined the League and wants to know what a level 30 account feels like. You can always help them create their own account. That way, you can even start a team and play together.\n\n \n\n&bull;** Free RP offers**\n\nDon&#039;t take the bait. There are shameless people out there who want to take advantage of innocent players by offering free or discounted RP. They will ask for your password in order to transfer the RP. And you know what happens when you give it to them? They keep your account and you never see the RP. The only way to purchase RP is through the in game store or with the pre-paid cards sold at stores and cybercafes. If you see anyone offering RP on another site, **don&#039;t trust them, and** [submit a request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) reporting the abuse. Piltover will be grateful!\n\n \n\n&bull;** Elo boosting**\n\nOut of frustration or sheer laziness, some people ask others to play ranked games for them in order to climb the ladder. It&#039;s a bad practice that violates the Terms of use. Furthermore, it can result in a [temporary or permanent](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en/articles/201751834) ban of the account. Don&#039;t forget that if someone else uses your account, they might behave inappropriately with it. It&#039;s never worth the risk!\n\n \n\n&bull; **Account trading**\n\nAs we said before, accounts are personal, non-transferable and free. Both selling and buying them is strictly prohibited. Not only is it bad practice, it is also often used to take advantage of players. Someone sells you their account, keeps your money and then recovers said account. You end up with no account and no money. Don&#039;t buy or sell accounts. In both cases, you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-10-03T16:59:24.638+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they would just read the ToS/Summoner Code at least one in their life of playing this game they would know common sense things like this isnt tolerated.

As far as i know the only games like that are mainly targeted towards kids (who arent allowed to sign contracts/ToS) like Club Penguin, Neopets, Animal Jam but even then the Parents should be monitoring them while they play on it. But as far as i know games like League doesnt encourage you to share your account information with anyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Alpha Samsuni","date":"2016-10-03T17:36:37.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":18,"body":"https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/argument-is-invalid-meme-36.jpg?quality=85&strip=info&w=500","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-10-03T17:59:24.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know in WoW, a parent is allowed to share an account with their child who is a minor due to the ToS, but otherwise I don't really see encouraging stuff to share accounts with parents.
