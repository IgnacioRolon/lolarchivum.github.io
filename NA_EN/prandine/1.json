Going into a custom game I tried all the resolutions in full screen, windowed and borderless and nothing fixed the problem. I have a feeling that something in the latest patch caused this because I've never had this issue before today.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T22:36:22.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be happening because the resolution isn't adjusting properly to the tv.
