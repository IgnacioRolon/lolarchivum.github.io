Fine, remove it, remove the E stacking on monsters aswell.\n\nBut please, stop nerfing his lane roles, jungle Graves wont give a shit about MR removal, you know who will?\nBotlane Graves who goes against mages and supports with actual Magic damage.\n\nIm sick of having my main getting hit in damage, durability, and burst, just because Jungle Graves has this stupid ass unnecessary passive.
