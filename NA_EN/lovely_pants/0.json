That&#039;s not how people upset with the system want it to work.**\r\nCan we all just move past this single point of friction in the debate?\r\n\r\n-Low queue times and diversity are not mutually exclusive traits desired of the fill role. \r\n-Secondary support players are likely players who actively enjoy the role more than any third option, but don&#039;t want it every game.\r\n-Human decision making is hugely influenced by convenience. Even if you can manually game the system to grant you more diversity, the lack of convenience naturally drives players away from the fill/secondary support choices.\r\n\r\nThe support role may be unattractive to the majority of players, but you can&#039;t grow the support role by forcing players to participate in it. That doesn&#039;t seem to be helping queue times for non-support players, and it will only get worse as the support pool is distilled to support mains only.\r\n\r\nThe system as it stands is not working for anyone except support mains like myself who enjoy half-second queues. It&#039;s not about blaming anyone for why this has come to be. Long-term work continues to be done to make the support role more attractive, but there is no obvious guaranteed solution for making the role more popular. It&#039;s probably half as much a gameplay issue as a social one, to start.\r\n\r\nIn the short-term the system needs to be tuned better to accommodate the needs of players. The other way around should not and cannot be expected.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-03-20T16:26:43.524+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I really don't think Riot cares.

This single issue is probably one of the most damaging threats to the long-term stability of their game.\n\nI disagree that it is damaging their game MORE than the old pick order Toxic fifth pick = support was. So, it's actually better. The only way Riot can make Support a more desired role is by deleting support and adding a fifth income/exp stream so you don't have this position that is behind on levels and gold every match.\n\nIt just isn't that much fun for many people to be 3+ levels and a thousand gold behind everyone while also being an extra 2-3k behind in a practical sense from buying your support item. That's okay. The system allows people who don't enjoy it now to not play it. If you can't see how this is better than the old system, I don't know what to say. A few minutes of extra wait time is a price worth paying to not be toxic fifth pick support 80% of your matches because someone always dodged until you ended up randomly placed fifth.\n\nTL:DR, This new queue system is the best thing Riot has ever done for the game. Except for the fkin dynamic group queue shit. That is literally the worst.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2016-03-21T13:06:03.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the intentions of the new queue. I don't think it's necessarily better when an entire subset of players in the Secondary Support and Fill range are severely neglected even if it gives other dual role mains reliable positions. Statistically with the old system I don't see how you're getting support 80% of the time unless you never ever push for a different position. Even as a fill under the old system, I probably only ended up with that half the time, and as my choice. \n\nI understand that being taxing for some, nonetheless, but the simple fact that the queue system is rapidly failing to function more as time goes by, despite short-term clarity of choice benefits, should be sending off alarm bells all around. \n\nPersonally, I don't want to see the system reverted either. I want it to be tuned. I don't know if that's the correct answer, but I do agree that there are elements worth preserving in it.\n\n(actually, I don't care about dynamic group queue at all and might hypothesize from a role choice balance perspective it has the potential to alleviate some of the unwanted role syndrome, but that's another big tangent of speculation to go off on).","replies":[{"poster":"the snaper","date":"2016-03-21T18:05:55.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel a higher chance of getting a hex box or key might help for players who pick fill as their secondary role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"the snaper","date":"2016-03-21T18:04:15.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel dodge is still very heavy now.
