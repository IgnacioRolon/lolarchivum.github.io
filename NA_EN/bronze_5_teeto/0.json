I naively trusted him and he scammed me took the money on paypal and didnt give me the account. So I want to let Riot know his name so he doesn't play in professional anymore. What proof and information do you need Riot? I have chat logs from his account and discord chat log and paypal showing his name and emails. I dont want to give my information from my main account though because I dont want it to be banned. Will I be exempt from being banned for account buying for giving this information if i give the chat logs with his account?","replies":[{"poster":"NEEToBE","date":"2017-05-12T20:38:20.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't it your fault for trying to buy a account?
