U can totally expect them to help ur team, right? it&#039;s not trolling, right? i can just choose what my teammates can play, right? it&#039;s my decision and it&#039;s not reportable even, huh????? \r\n\r\nI will be very disappointed if i ban my teammates best champion and they don&#039;t play their best... It&#039;s my right to ban whatever i god damn please :) they will be my little bitch and obey my commands. they will most definitely not play their best champion, they will play a ghost cleanse fizz. that is a better choice. i will be happy with that and then report them end of game.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-10T09:26:28.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A player is within their rights to ban what they want. The imp in me likes to revenge ban though.\n\nIf you suspect your pick might be controversial do not show your intent.\n\nI understand you might want the team to know what type of role you will be filling, so highlight a similar champ but not the actual one you want. For example if you want talon, highlight zed. If you want aurelion sol highlight taliyah. If you want Zac highlight rammus or malphite, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-11-10T09:49:00.709+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This literally destroys the point of pick intent. If i want riven so I highlight fiora/camille and someone picks riven for jungle or mid. (I am not the only one who plays her in those lanes) then it destroys pick intent. If I highlight camille and someone is like 'I will ban riven because she is not hovered' this also destroys pick intent. if I hover riven and someone bans her then that also destroys pick intent. Showing  your pick intent should not be the same as playing chicken with the asshats in the game. This is why I report everyone who bans anyones pick intent for any reason. The only way we will make it against the terms and conditions is to continually report for it until riot understands that we dont like it. \n\nOr the majority of people simply dont care and the stance never changes. Either way I will report everyone I see who does it.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-11-10T10:47:09.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you and do the same, but Tenth Leper suggestion is practical. If you just want to play your champ and not have to fight with your team, doing as he said is smart. That won't be as good for the community long term, but once in a while you don't want to think about the community and you just want to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze 5 Teeto","date":"2017-11-10T09:55:31.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you! you couldnt be more correct!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bronze 5 Teeto","date":"2017-11-10T09:51:36.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like ur idea. i just wish u could show ur team exactly what ur gonna play without being trolled also tho ;(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-11-10T09:21:26.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant tell if your upset because you banned a teammates pick intent.
