I can usually log in easily and make it into the client, however often times the client seems to disconnect without recognizing it. I'm able to create games and invite people, but I cant see them join my lobbies. after that if I start a queue, it gives me a retrieving data message but never shows me I've been put into queue. Even weirder, the people I'm playing with can see everyone including myself put into a queue and get the accept notification, however I usually cant accept because it's still retrieving data from server. if I cancel the retrieval, I will usually get spammed with a bunch of connectivity error messages. \r\nIf I make it past this, it gets really weird though. In the event that I make it into champ select, I cant see what champions are being selected by my team members, and if I try to select a champion it gives me a retrieving data from server message. However, all of my teammates can see me pick the champion, and I can select what spells, runes, and masteries I want but I cant see the acts go through even though they can. Then when it locks everybody in, I still don't see anything happen and have to re-open the client in order to join into the game. \r\nPreviously I thought this was an issue with using Skype, as I read using ports 80 and 443 caused issues within the game, so I changed that and the issue did fix for maybe a day, but now it is a reoccurring issue again. \r\nIf anyone knows how to fix this is would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"amd098","date":"2015-08-09T04:30:38.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to services.msc and stop a service called IPHelper, should solve the problem.\n\nI got that fix from reddit.
