Since his passive converts bonus health to AD, will that mean that the calculation for extra shield amounts on Locket will always end up being zero? Or will the bonus health still apply to items regularly?","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-05-15T19:48:57.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would think that it still counts as a bonus health, but its his passive that converts it to the AD. therefore I think that locket would still treat it as if he had the health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2018-05-15T19:40:29.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"agree killing locket on a support isnt very supporty, im guessing his purpose isnt to really support though.","replies":[{"poster":"A happy face","date":"2018-05-15T19:50:31.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Professor Ward,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gp9vqOqG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-15T19:40:29.709+0000)\n>\n> agree killing locket on a support isnt very supporty, im guessing his purpose isnt to really support though.\n\nI hope he is seen as a true support. I think it would be quite cool for bonus health to still apply to items like locket, allowing Pyke to build some situational survivability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-15T20:00:19.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke is going to be either nerfed massively or buffed massively, in some order.","replies":[]}]}
