It doesn't mean you've been punished just yet, it was just letting you know that if you do end up leaving more games there's a chance that you'll be placed in a low-priority queue for a few matches. I'm not seeing any punishments on your account yet so you should be okay. \n\nIn order to get the box to go away, you should be able to type I AGREE and then click on the Okay button.","replies":[]}]}
