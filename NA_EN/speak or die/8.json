It feels terrible to main him and hear that he won't get an update he needs all because big brother china doesn't want him updated... \n \nIt feels bias as hell and feels like it's just an excuse to push out other more popular champs before him. I can't speak for everyone  but We've been waiting YEARS for him to get updated and I'm NOT going to wait another 4 years for China to *possibly* be okay with an update for him.\n\nI'm fine that Splash arts had to be updated to not include skull imagery due to China, but they can NOT be the reason he is being held up for an update, ESPECIALLY when champs HERE have been updated JUST as seemingly randomly like {{champion:114}}. Thinking about players GLOBALLY isn't \"making sure China is okay with it first\". It's a two way street for every country. You can't just sit there and change splash art to make it \"globally friendly\" then go back on that and say \"China specifically does not want him changed, so we decided leave him as is\".\n\nHe has the potential to be a great character no matter what country, but the fact that China is holding the leash forces him to always be the Chinese champ. Honestly if that's how it's going to be then why bother releasing him globally in the first place? He's not EVER going to be used in LCS, his merch and skins are tailored to Chinese audiences and now even his GAMEPLAY is decided by china? so why bother giving us Wukong if everything about him is dictated by Chinese players?
