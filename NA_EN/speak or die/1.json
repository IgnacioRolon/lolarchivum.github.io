Now it's Kennen being a teacher and Shen being... also a teacher. But I don't feel any emotion attached to them in regards to Akali's POV. \r\n\r\nBeing best buddies throughout life would've been a great dynamic for Akali and Kennen, we don't really have that with any other champions. *sigh*","replies":[{"poster":"CoolRadius","date":"2018-07-17T22:58:57.576+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well, she did learn alot from the little guy, it's in her bio.
