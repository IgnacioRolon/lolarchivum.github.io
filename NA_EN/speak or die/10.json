Can I know why?\n\nEzreal was a character that I felt had a lot of storytelling potential with a largely untapped personality rich with flaws and strengths. He struck me as  like a young Starlord with delusions of grandeur and something to prove, and a lot of growing up to do. There was something about his overconfidence that seemed to cover a lot of wounds he'd never admit to having -- the way his gauntlet does all the work for him, despite Ezreal's clear talent... he lacked a desire to do the hard work despite being totally capable of it. Ezreal wants to see and do so much that he's willing to take shortcuts and write consequences off as natural collateral damage. I dunno, that's really fun to me. It resonated with me. I have so many Ezreal stories that I've pitched and hope to get to tell, if Riot's will allow me to. I've always loved adventure seekers, relic hunters, mystery-solvers... they want to believe in something more ancient than themselves to cover a present they can't face.","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2018-10-02T23:48:33.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would he get google-eyed like Santangelo did if he ran into Ahri?
