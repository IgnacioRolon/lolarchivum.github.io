Having a character \"identify\" as a given sexuality should only matter if their sexuality is inherent to their character, like Miss Fortune, Evelynn, or even Taric.  Telling us \"champion is lesbian\" does nothing except make the champion divisive between conservative and progressive players when that champ's sexuality won't even be expressed in the game.  Like, if you WANT her character interactions to HINT at it, fine.  Dumbledore was never stated as being gay in Harry Potter because his sexuality had no effect or bearing on the story, but people could infer that maybe he was by small hints in his actions and personality, allowing people to interpret him how they want.  And really, that's the best thing you can do for a character; write them in such a way that they can be interpreted differently by different people, allowing them to have some intrigue and holding interest to a wider audience because people will read into their behaviors differently based on their own tastes.  And when a character has multiple interpretations, it makes them even more colorful and gives them a broader, more nuanced personality.  Given that \"color\" was supposed to be the main theme of the new champ, I think just having a creator just blithely label her as \"lesbian\" is more of a disservice to both the character and her future players than a service.","replies":[{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2018-11-30T08:34:36.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's the point, though.
