You are definitely correct, 005 errors are often caused by antiviruses, but it can also be caused by a [**lack of administrative rights**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104).

I reinstalled the game at least 4 times trying different methods  i found over the internet from people having the same issue nothing is working, and ive read on this very forum a riot employee saying that it could be as you said lack of admin rights or a problem with the windows registry and on my opinion it's a registry problem it'S not the first time i have to temper with it but i had clear and simple instructions to follow and it always worked in the end, that being said i fully aware that the most obvious fix would be to format and reinstall my windows 7 as it have been at least 6 or 7 years my computer have not been formatted but i just cant do it for the moment I will write a ticket as you said and hope for a way to fix it even if it's just temporary.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kixie Boo","date":"2017-05-03T13:57:01.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.
