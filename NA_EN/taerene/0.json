After a few days of playing other mages, i played azir again. But from then on I played him terribly. I mean, I can drift, but whenever I try to shuffle, I screw up in a lot of ways. Be it accuracy, timing, underestimating the enemy, enemy picking, you name it. How do I get good at him again?? i love playing him, despite his win rate, if played well, he&#039;s a god.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-02T04:35:39.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krhhcrHqDpM\n\nScrewing up azir plays is OK.","replies":[{"poster":"Taerene","date":"2017-01-02T04:40:35.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i saw tht too, but with faker, it happens far less than I do. tht's what worries me.","replies":[]}]}]}
