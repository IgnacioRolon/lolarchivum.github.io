I never got a warning about my behavior or anything just went straight to a 2 week suspension. I did not get the standard 10 game chat ban&gt;25 game chat ban&gt;2 week suspension.

Riot is able to identify something called an IP address, (and that doesn't stand for influence points), this is essentially your address when it comes to your Internet access. Even if you are using a different account, they can tell that you are accessing their server from the same Internet service provider. They can tell that you are the same person.
