However, that all changed when someone got access to my account. I'm not exactly sure how they did it but they managed to play multiple games on my account. Once I figured this out I changed my password immediately. I thought the problem was over and I didn't have to worry anymore. I quickly found out I was wrong. When I launched the game to enter my new password, It immediately sent me to the home screen. I thought it was a little odd at first so I waited to see if the password hadn't been updated yet. After hours of waiting it still just let me log in automatically without having to enter the new password. I changed my password again to see if it fixed it and once again, it did not ask me to enter my new password. The person who originally took of my account still has access and is still playing games and I have no way to get them off my account. I have emailed riot support however they seemed to ignore it and just prompt another password change. This is a huge security flaw and needs to be addressed immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-13T22:39:12.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Check your email account for any odd activity and reset the password on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Balderdash1000","date":"2019-11-13T22:43:54.403+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=tHTMBxxb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-13T22:39:12.133+0000)\n>\n> Check your email account for any odd activity and reset the password on that.\n\nYou're not getting the complaint.

I understand why Riot doesn't force everyone to use it (Don't yall have phones??), but it really acts as that final gatekeeper.\n\nThe other thing you brought up is highly concerning. The fact that a password change isn't prompting the client to ask you to re-authenticate and enter the new password is a huge red flag. Sounds like they are just using a login token that never really expires.\nIf you haven't already, create a support ticket and highlight this. Someone guessing your password is one thing, having a password change not force users to enter the new password is definitely a bug (and security exploit)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lordofthepittt","date":"2019-11-14T00:36:42.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least you still have your account.
