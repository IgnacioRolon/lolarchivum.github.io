Especially when going AP.\n\n\nPeople are saying she's apparently strong early too, which is definitely not the case. It's literally that she gets free damage from all the engage and cc. Most engage supports have multiple CCs so her lane phase becomes deadly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mikemcparty","date":"2018-10-07T22:36:17.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Marian Cross,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=scsGmkpI,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-10-07T17:35:57.972+0000)\n>\n> I mean she still has a 49.something % win rate while having a like high 30s pick rate. doesnt seem like shes struggling at all\n\nYou just countered your own argument, man. Less than a 50% win rate with a pick rate that high? Not that tough to deal with. I like the idea of allowing her to itemize with AP. Just wish her ratios were a little lower.","replies":[{"poster":"Marian Cross","date":"2018-10-08T03:30:51.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, the fact that she has just under like 49.27% winrate but has like the second highest pick rate means nothing is wrong? Shes just too good. she scales off of every item that gives damage and when she was released they said they wanted a high risk high reward champ. Which to me hitting 5 items then being able to 1v9 just does not fit that build.

That with the reload means he only can do %missing hp damage every 4-5 seconds, whereas kaisa can do the same every 2 seconds. \n\nShe is also mostly immobile minus her e, like vayne, but unlike vayne can go invis once its evolved (which isnt tough) and doesnt require her ult to be active. Yes, she cant fire during this time, but her attack speed is then buffed after to compensate for the lack of damage, allowing her to further proc her passive even more. \n\nFor her to have a short range, she has a lot of ways to get close to someone, something that wouldnt be a problem if she also didnt have her e. \n\nShe has everything an adc needs to work very well. Her weakness is only “dont get close” which isnt always an option. Whereas adcs, like jihn,cait, kog and mf are rather immobile (lately jhin has been a speedy boi tho, so maybe less him) have a lot of damage but cant get out of situations as easily, someone like kaisa also has comperable (or better) damage without the lack of mobility. Then you have some adcs like vayne or jinx who has rather rough early games but scale well, and while kaisa has a medicire early game, she scaled just as well without the troubles vayne/jinx have. \n\nBut what do i know.
