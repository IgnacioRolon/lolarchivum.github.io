He kept going on and on and I said nothing until he was ike GG thanks to our mid we lose the game. I told him Shut the hell up. thats it he then said something in all chat saying our mid costs us the game to which the enemy jungler told him to shut up and stop crying. he did and guess what we won that game and he said nothing else to me or anyone else and the only other thing I said was a quote from him \"gg thanks to our mid\" at the end of the game. Does Shut the hell up count as flaming? \n\nI am not a flamer people make mistakes, but it is annoying to see the chat flooded with irrelevant information and then going into all chat is the worst thing.

Multiple times over multiple games? Now it's a habit that may be a problem. Really I'd need to see the chat log. A lot of stuff is okay in small amounts but not in large amounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Sheø","date":"2018-10-17T22:56:33.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of legends.. where you can get perma banned for telling to a guy who constantly flames you to shut up... because if you tell him twice to shut up, it becomes an issue.. ok... i told him also garbage, only once, and then proceed on /all chat to ask from enemies to report camille for nonstop flame.. that single word \"garbage\" perma banned my account..

Some behaviors are not swiftly caught and escalated to a 14-day ban or permanent ban, but it's still possible that the individual in question received a chat restriction or points towards a future punishment.\n\n>before you go blubbering put that brain in use first..\n\nFriendly reminder to be civil on the board. I am neither blubbering nor an idiot. I am merely telling you things about the system you can choose to believe or not as you see fit. Your belief either way does not ultimately change how the system works, alter its general reliability, or impact the times when it fails to do its job.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
