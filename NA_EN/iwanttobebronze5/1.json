Assassins shouldn't be safety picks for noobs because of their risky playstyle. Yet Kha'Zix is so noobproof and overpowered that anyone can pick him now. He has 50-51% win rate even in the lowest elos. His pick rate and ban rate both are around 15% in high elo. How is this not above that famous line?","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2019-08-26T20:58:45.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha isnt really that OP. He has a Niche.\n\nLets compare him to something like Kayn who in all but Plat+ he is above 50% winrate (he is at 49.95% in P+)\n\nwhen you play SA you can nuke 2-3 targets all at once since all your damage is AOE. on top of that you then can press R to hide out until your cooldowns come off.\n\nKha leaping on an ADC will do 1/2 their HP with a full combo if they arent isolated. If they are Isolated they will die. This means there is much more counterplay to Kha Zix than that of Kayn. \n\nNow Kha gets a good winrate because he is really fucking good at his niche. \"oh you walked through the jungle without utilizing the buddy system? dead. \n\nThere is basically no surviving that. he will kill you and there is nothing you can do about it, but grouping up and sticking together is basically a 100% counter to the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T16:41:03.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because all the dumb people who try playing him in ranked aren't able to carry like braindead monkeys.","replies":[{"poster":"iwanttobebronze5","date":"2019-08-26T16:49:48.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes they can.
