That was at the end of last season and it maybe changed since then. So my question is, if i climb a couple of divisions during the rest of the pre season will it help me when i will be placed in a division after the 10 promos? \r\n {{champion:202}}   {{champion:55}}  {{champion:55}} {{champion:202}}   {{champion:55}}  {{champion:55}}  {{champion:202}}   {{champion:55}}  {{champion:55}}  {{champion:202}}  {{champion:55}}  {{champion:55}}  {{champion:202}}   {{champion:55}}  {{champion:55}}  {{champion:202}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T18:41:07.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't heard any details yet for the next season, so I couldn't say for sure.  Traditionally, there's a soft reset instead of a hard one, so your placement matches may consider your progress during the preseason.  It's not deal breaker, though, so you could make solid progress with placements alone.","replies":[]}]}
