DC-ing and reconnecting to the game fixes the bug with some positive probability around 0.75, but sometimes it does not and I have to re-client mid-game, which fixes it with some other positive probability.\r\n\r\nI'd post a screenshot or a clip of the game from the client but that would just contain a jinx not using her skills.\r\n\r\nThis _only_ happens on my laptop: I switched computers for a couple weeks and never got the bug, and I hopped back on this one and I started having it again. It's been a problem for a couple years now, and only now have I been not-lazy enough to report it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T03:38:47.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it sounds like your laptop might not be grabbing the server side config settings for some reason.
