First it was the black screen out of resulution error witch I couldn't see the loading screen befora game, and after trying everything the only thig that solved it was to change the game to boderless window. And now on the past week I cannot play without freezes from time to time. My ping is normal bit the game freezes and I can't move for 2-8 seconds and the actions animations sometimes occurs later. This game is messed up for real.. I execute the ping command on cmd and i don't have any package lost altough in the troubleshooting connections erros it says i have a major issue and some package losses during the game. I just don't know what to do in order to solve this. Think im just gonna stop playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T02:21:02.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like you're experiencing some nasty bursts of *Packet Loss* in-game.
