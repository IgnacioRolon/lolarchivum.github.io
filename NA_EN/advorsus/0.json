Might still need some tweaking, but I'm sure you all will grasp the general idea behind it. It's another one that I love to play, but that feels a bit old and outdated as far as abilities and the way you play him. So I wanted to give him a little rework that gives him a few more options other than just, Gold Card into Q constantly. I wanted him to be able to have a few more options for playability, the choices you make while you play him, and the build options, all while still keeping his identity as a Champion. Once again this is without numbers, artwork, or lore. But if you all enjoy, and there's positive feedback, those are things I can add later. As always, I'd love to here any ideas and feedback when it comes to this rework concept. \r\n\r\nAnd without further ado, I give you: \r\n\r\n**Twisted Fate**\r\n_The Card Master_\r\n\r\n**Passive: Stacked Deck\r\n**\r\nTwisted Fate builds up his deck with magical cards over time, adding a new card (up to a max of 5) every few seconds. Killing enemies grant cards as well ( 1 per minion, and 2 for champion kills). \r\n\r\nStacked Deck provides additional damage to his basic attacks and abilities based upon the amount of cards he has stacked up. \r\n\r\nI really wanted his passive to play more into comboing with his abilities. I wanted it to be more rewarding for playing him well, CSing properly and stuff, but a bit punishing if you aren't playing him well. That way it gives him some kind of counter ability in lane. Now this can be tweaked later, possibly more of just a time thing with the cooldown being reduced by kills or something. But you get the general idea of it.\r\n\r\n**Q: Wild Cards**\r\n_Consumes 1-3 charges of Stacked Deck._\r\n\r\nThrows out cards based upon the amount of cards he has stacked in his deck (Max of 3 cards thrown). \r\nWild Cards gains bonus effects based upon his Luck of the Draw card. \r\nBlue Card: No longer passes through enemies, but instead throws cards in quick succession in a straight line, dealing increased damage. \r\nRed Card: Throws cards a short distance that stick in the ground and explode after a short time, dealing damage to nearby enemies. \r\nGold Card: Grants bonus gold for each enemy killed. (This is where the old passive went :D)\r\nTrick Card: Throws out his cards a set distance before returning them to him and reloading those cards back into his deck. \r\n\r\n_I feel like this new Q gives a bit more options and things that you need to consider before just throwing out cards. Sometimes it might be smarter to throw just the one card to slow the enemies chasing you. Other times you may need to throw out all 3 for max damage. But with this new Q it gives you options and  makes you think about the choices you make in lane and during team fights. Also I thought about 5 cards at once, but not only do I think it could be too strong, it could also ruin combos and other abilities. So 3 is enough.... for now ;) _\r\n\r\n**W: Luck of the Draw**\r\n_Enemies can no longer see which card is drawn. _\r\n\r\n_Consumes 1 Charge of Stacked Deck._\r\n\r\nTwisted fate tosses a random magical card into his hand, granting him additional effects to his Wild Cards and basic attacks. \r\nBasic attack effects-\r\nBlue Card: Deals bonus damage and restores mana.\r\nRed Card: Deals damage and slows enemies in the area of affect.\r\nGold Card: Deals damage and stuns enemies.\r\nTrick Card: Reloads 3 cards into his Stacked Deck.\r\n\r\nYes, I know.... A RANDOM CARD?!?!?! AM I MAD?!?!?!\r\n_Maybe a little. But I thought about it and it makes sense, for his character and this new kit. It still keeps the old abilities of his Pick a Card, but now works with his new passive and ties into the rest of his kit. I also took out the ability for the enemy to be able to see what card you have. That way, they never know what you have up your.... Sleeve ;)_\r\n\r\n**E: Ace Up the Sleeve**\r\n\r\nTwisted Fate stores his magic card for later use. \r\nWhile a card is stored he gains bonus movement and attack speed. \r\n\r\n_This one was pretty tricky for me. I had a little bit of trouble thinking of a 3rd ability that fits into his kit and still keeps his identity. But I really feel like this ties into everything that I wanted to accomplish with this rework. More options and the ability to outplay opponents more, and still giving him the options in his item build. This also fixes one of the issues he has, which is very low mobility. In a world full of high mobility champions, it just makes him less fun to play. Now he gets a little bit more mobility, without making him OP, and still gives even more choices when playing him. That way you have to make sure you pick just the right time to pull out your ace!\r\n_\r\n\r\n**R: Destiny**\r\n\r\nGrants true sight on all enemy champions on the map. \r\n\r\nCan be recast to charge up his Stacked Deck to max stacks and then teleport to another location on the map. \r\n\r\n_And of course, the Ultimate. This ability MADE Twisted Fate for many years. Did you really think I was gonna take it out??? It works just like the old Ult, just with the added affect for his passive :)_\r\n\r\nWell that's the majority of it guys. Let me know what you think, I love all feedback. And let me know if you'd tweak or change anything. If you're enjoying my rework ideas, please let me know because I have a few more I'm working on.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-09-06T21:29:50.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The RNG card may not necessarily be a terrible thing if you do it right as the only thing that changes is how you plan to use it. The problem is that having it work otherwise the same way as Pick a Card means the window of opportunity to use that card is shorter than it should be. I'd say make it so the differences between the cards are more pronounced and have it so that the first cast picks a random card and the second cast casts the card as a point and click ability with the card lasting for a good 15 seconds or so before you use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Advorsus","date":"2019-09-06T21:40:32.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I see what you're saying. So my original thought behind it, and I didn't include this in the initial post, is that you would indeed cast it once to draw the card. Then it would be active for 15-20 seconds where you can either cast Q and give that ability bonus effects, auto attack and get the bonus effect, or press E and store that card for later use. Then W would go on cooldown and could be used again once off cooldown even if you have a card stored in your E. So you can essentially combo it together in different ways. For example: You use your Luck of the Draw and randomly pick a gold card, then you press E to store it. Then once your W is off cooldown you could press it again and say get a red card. You could then use your E to empower your Auto attack to stun your opponent, then use the empowered Q from the red card to gain that bonus effect. So there would be different ways you could combo and use your abilities. \nBut yes, the W would last for a little bit before going on cooldown to still give you the option to make choices during teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Advorsus","date":"2019-09-06T21:43:54.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much you can have W and E active at the same time. Or you can use E and then store the next W card. But only one effect can happen at one time. So if you draw a card then W is active, but if you press E that abilities effect takes precedence and then you can use the effect from W. So you don't get both at the same time. You have to actually choose how you want to play your cards ;). But yes, it'll take some tweaking on that part.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Panic Attack","date":"2019-10-03T04:00:19.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your ideas a lot, especially the changes to W. I'm not sure I understand what you want his Q to be. Is it a targeted thing, or is it a skill shot?\nEither way, I really do like the idea of W becoming RNG but not revealing the card to the enemy. It just makes sense. This champ's entire personality revolves around poker, and yet he he has the biggest most obvious tell of any champ short of Sion. I would make one change. I think that W should function similar to Zoe's W: a charge system with minimal cooldown. TF should always be holding a card, and as soon as he spends that card (and some mana) he can cast the next one right away- provided he has additional cards. This would make it so TF could bide his time in lane while building up a full \"hand\" so to speak, and then \"show\" by unleashing card after card in a lethal combo. To me, this would be so much more interesting than how he currently is.\nIf you want to make his E more active, you could call it \"Mulligan\" and let him reroll his current cards for X Mana per card.","replies":[{"poster":"Advorsus","date":"2019-10-08T21:29:00.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Q is still a skill shot. It just has different functions based upon his other abilities now to give him more options when playing him. Pretty much I wanted a more interactive Twisted Fate that worked more around an actual deck or full hand of cards, that kinda also gave a small mini game to his kit. I wanted to make it to where he feels like he has more options when you play him, while not being to overpowered.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2019-10-03T05:56:07.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Twisted Fate is fine, no need rework.\"","replies":[]}]}
