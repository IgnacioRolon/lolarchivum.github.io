Because I think the bug might come from there originally. At least the problem showed up for just after I started using it.","replies":[{"poster":"The KDA is a lie","date":"2017-06-17T16:39:18.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit of a late response from me, but yes I am using Discord. It is very possible for a program reducing external noises to create that kind of problem. I too have been thinking about Discord generating this problem. I suspect that Discord reduces other noises (the same way Skype or any other program would) but sometimes doesn't quite set it back to its original value prior to the call.\n\nSo in short, Discord might be the source of the problem. And going back to Window's volume panel every time it happens is the fix.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aristoïl Anor","date":"2017-05-14T16:35:37.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
