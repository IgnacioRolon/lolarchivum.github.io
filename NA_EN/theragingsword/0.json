They are new to the game and shouldn't be in this elo. They just aren't as skilled as gold players yet. Every single time I get a unranked player or level 30,  they always feed or don't know how to team fight because there NEW! \n\nThey don't have enough experience playing the game. I had an 60% win rate on my main champ and 70% on my secondary champ so I'm not hard stuck until I started getting new players who just feed. Its harder to climb from silver 1- gold 4 then from silver 4 -silver 1. When will Riot actually put them where they belong in like low silver/high bronze and let them climb themselves than by over estimating there ability to play this game?","replies":[{"poster":"gay person","date":"2019-05-23T03:42:42.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been complaining about this forever but they'll never fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kanyoupipu","date":"2019-05-24T23:34:01.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheRagingSword,realm=NA,application-id=GgNYATV4,discussion-id=cz597EBX,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-05-23T02:43:40.434+0000)\n>\n> I just got to gold 4 and its so hard when you get these level 30 players.

Its literally meaningless silver/gold/plat are all a diceroll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sea Slug Menace","date":"2019-05-24T09:32:31.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well at the start of season all new accounts were sent to iron\n\n\nnow all new accounts start their ranked climb/8 placement games at bronze 2~~~  with gold 5 mmr","replies":[]}]}
