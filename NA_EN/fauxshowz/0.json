When locking in my champion, the game then quits out with an error message. Unfortunately, this almost caused a leave buster for a bot game. Never having had one on this account, no harm no foul.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have tried adjusting resolutions, putting the game into low spec mode, ensuring I have all requirements to play, updating Direct X, .net, and all the other recommendations. What can I put on here to help show where my potential issue is; and/or is there something that recently changed over the last 2-3 days? My husband played on this computer from his account on Thursday and the game worked fine. The computer has not been used since then.\r\n\r\nThe game is up to date with the most recent patch.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nFS","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T02:39:38.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely don't want you to get your first leaverbuster just because the client is crashing fo'sho!

Let's try using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to make sure you've still got a clean install of League by running it with reinstall and clean uninstall options. \n\nMake sure to test this in a custom game to avoid any possible penalties, and hit me back up if it doesn't seem to help!","replies":[]}]}
