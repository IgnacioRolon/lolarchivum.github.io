She made herself look ready to play the game seriously in champ select, and her op.gg looked very good, however, she was inting from the beginning of the game to the end. This post isn't to call her out or anything, as I know that's not what the forums are about. This is a post suggesting the concept of adding a limit to creatable accounts. Currently, the only punishment this Akali is likely to receive is a temp ban if this has only happened once, if not there would be a perma ban, as far as I know at least. However this Akali took the liberty to make a new account during the game to prove that reporting her would lead to nothing she wasn't ready for. That's when the idea came to my mind that there should be a limit on accounts that an ip address, or device, whichever works better can create. After all, a permanent ban once might somehow be a mistake or misunderstanding, but if an ip address is seeing multiple cases of bans, temporary or permanent, then that user is clearly hurting the community and should be removed entirely. I just can't help but feel that those who are reported are being brought to justice and I feel if there were a way to actually remove harmful people from the community, the community would see a large decrease in toxicity and injustice. Please comment below if you ever feel helpless even after reporting someone who ruined your game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T22:45:17.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"StevetheMiner pretty much sums this argument up. The main reason we don't limit the number of accounts you can create mostly hinges on the fact that we don't have a foolproof way of making sure those people are banned across the board, while making sure that nobody is unintentionally hit with the ban as well. For instance, if we placed an IP ban then no one else on that connection would be able to play. The opposite goes for device bans, as that person could always use a different pc.\n\nWith that being said, if you have any additional ideas feel free to shoot them our way!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-07-05T06:09:53.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is something Riot would never add. \n\nIf they were going to use IP addresses to limit accounts, there's a big problem if there are multiple people on the same connection. \nIf they were going limit accounts on a certain device, a user can just use multiple devices.\n\nIt's probably would be too hard anyway. And it would be really easy to bypass.","replies":[]}]}
