It&#039;s me again with a waifu request thread!\n\nI have the need of searching for a new waifu, so I will ask all the anime fans here for help finding the best girl ever in anime.\n\nI will give some preferences due to personal taste, but you can recommend me others that don&#039;t fit the criteria, BUT\n\nShe must be one of the main characters in the story, and preferably in the good side  if there is one.\n\nNow with optional preferences:\n\n- Hair long enough to at least reach below the neck (not sure if I explained it well).\n\n- Beautiful eyes, if she&#039;s from an old anime ignore this one, artistic quality was not like now.\n\nUse Chitanda as the closest girl to reach perfection of the two things I said above for my taste.\n\nhttps://animesaimoe.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hyouka_02.jpg\n\n- Preferably not a Tsundere/Annoying attitude, I&#039;m already dealing with Louise from Zero no Tsukaima.\n\n- Purple and blue are my favourite hair colours.\n\n- Preferably duration of the anime from 10 to 50 episodes, if it&#039;s split in different seasons is fine if it&#039;s longer, anything over 100 episodes will maybe get ignored, I will get tired of that anime 99% of the times.\n\nThat&#039;s all, remember that all but the main character one are just optional but I would prefer them, a good waifu can totally lack all of them!\n\nHere is my myanimelist so you can see which ones I already saw (damn, the list keeps getting bigger).\n\nOh! and my \"Planning to watch\" list has a lot of anime Idk about, so don't think I know the characters from them for potential opinions, so saying one of them is totally ok too!\n\n\nhttp://myanimelist.net/animelist/MetaThPr4h\n\nI would appreciate if you posted a pic of the character.\n\nI will stay here a bit more and then I will go to sleep (4:43 AM here Zzz), I will check the ones I miss when I wake up.\n\nThank you in advance!","replies":[]}
