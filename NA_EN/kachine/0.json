There are huge improvements that can be made to the skin.\r\n\r\nEg. Lion head passive symbol\r\nA lion head wall with a similar roar effect to Udyr\r\nLion head Q\r\nLion charging ult\r\n\r\nEtc etc. The concept around this skin is fantastic and there are so much things that can be easily applied.\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;s better to take the skin back into production, add more features to it and up the price. It can easily be made into a 975 or 1350 skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T17:56:42.926+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Kachine,\n\nThanks for the feedback!

Could you _please_ reconsider it? You don't have to change the colors- Keep them ice-blue, but it'd be awesome if you simply changed the Ram head particles (Q and Passive) into Lion head particles.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-12-07T18:14:27.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's fine that they won't change the particles and effects of things in the skin, but they should at least consider making his passive a lion since the rest of his skins have changed his passive symbol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-12-05T10:18:30.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=35GElxEj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-13T17:56:42.926+0000)\n>\n> Hey Kachine,\n> \n> Thanks for the feedback!

Like using a body slam for his ult and he was a 1350 skin. He felt lackluster","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T18:03:16.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the case of El Tigre Braum, he received  new particles, new SFX, a new model and texture, as well as a recall and a respawn animation, which put him him in the appropriate tier of a 1350 RP skin.  The suggestion of a body slam is a cool one, but generally speaking, entirely new animations for skills are reserved for legendary/ultimate tier status. \n\nEl Tigre Braum was actually the reason we reconsidered changing his passive indicator for his 975 RP + skins. Originally, the issue was surrounding clarity, but the discussion came up again and we determined it wasn't something that would dramatically alter gameplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2015-12-05T10:13:07.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=35GElxEj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-13T17:56:42.926+0000)\n>\n> Hey Kachine,\n> \n> Thanks for the feedback!
