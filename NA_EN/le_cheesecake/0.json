Because once this update is over so will the feautre: \r\n\r\nSo basically with the new Bilgewater update that came out, I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all heard the awesome pirate voice over for matches in ARAM and Ranked, also normal and I&#039;m sure Dominion? (I don&#039;t play Dom so I&#039;ll assume). \r\n\r\nWith all this in mind, we do have our preferences...! Some people may hate the new voice over, some people may not like the old voice over ( the default woman&#039;s voice). \r\n\r\n...So how awesome would it be if Riot could possibly ADD an option to OPTIONS to have the option of picking one of said voices? (See what I did there?). Like if we could, that&#039;d be awesome; because personally I am IN LOVE WITH THE PIRATE VOICE. Like... &quot;YOUR ALLY IS FEEDING THE FISHES&quot;?? DECORATING THE SEA BED?? Could we PLEASE make this a permanent option? If you&#039;re tired of hearing the pirate voice then you can switch back to the old voice, tired of the old voice? Well you can pick the new voice!\r\n\r\nAnd the good part about allowing this? \r\nWell from my own personal testimony; I&#039;ve found that I enjoy ranked 100x more, it just makes it a lot more fun, and makes me a lot less stressed. I support people a lot more, JUST because  I&#039;m in a better mood, and for me when I&#039;m in a good mood I tend to do a lot better and be a more positive. It&#039;s something different and my boyfriend I like it a lot. (We keep calling each other salty sea dogs). So, please consider! Hope everyone has their own testimonies and also agree! \r\n\r\n**TL;DR: Let&#039;s have the option to keep both voice overs, through the selection in options! THINK ABOUT THE GENDER EQUALITY...

I've turned the announcer voice off until we get the old one back, which kind of sucks since I feel like I'm missing key points in the game.\n\nI do like the idea of announcer voice packs though, maybe they could make one with Lulu's or Nami's voice.  :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trainwreck2pro4u","date":"2015-07-27T04:57:48.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not awesome , its pure hell and one of the worst game soundtracks Ive ever had to listen to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-26T22:50:39.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they might have needed a little more time to get the original announcer to record the new lines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tysmin","date":"2015-07-26T22:50:18.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the best option here is to do waht dota did and allow us to buy voice over packs so i can have glados as my anouncer","replies":[]}]}
