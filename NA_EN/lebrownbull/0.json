I played this game for 4 years spent hundreds of dollars on my account, &amp; all of a sudden I was too toxic for them. took them only two months to perm-ban me, instantly banning me over one bad word I&#039;d say (complete b.s reason if you ask me). Only way we can get them to change their b.s. rule, that has cheated many summoners from their money and waiting to cheat more of you soon, is by showing them that we think this rule is wrong and that they should figure out another way to solve it. All I&#039;m asking for is for you guys to help me get their attention, retweet &amp; show them we want change cuz so far I&#039;ve been ignored by them.","replies":[]}
