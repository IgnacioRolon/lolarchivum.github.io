I&#039;m just gonna jump right in here. As i reviewed over your megathread, i didn&#039;t see too many questions asked and answered about nidalee (maybe one or two) so I&#039;m gonna throw some q&#039;s at you. How do you feel about nidalee as she relates to her current balance state, and are there any buffs/nerfs/updates that you might be planning to make with her in the future? Personally i think her hunt mechanic is very interesting and thematically fitting to her, but at the moment it feels like her damage is significantly lackluster without a hunted target. In your opinion, how do you feel about her damage output without a hunted target vs with? on a side note I&#039;d like to hear your thoughts on the new challenger nidalee skin coming up.

On the one hand, I like that she gives clear indicators to opponents as to how to beat her (don't get Hunted). On the other, I think that it can also lead to her being one-dimensional. This concern could possibly be addressed by adjustments to Bushwhack to make it more useful in Hunting.\n\n> on a side note I'd like to hear your thoughts on the new challenger nidalee skin coming up.\n\nPretty excited for the skin. I always like it when a champion I've worked on gets a skin, not only because they seem to just keep getting better and better, but also because it means I'm likely to see more games with the champion in it, and I like spying on my people playing my work.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-01-12T06:39:26.052+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"But how do you feel about her being cancer?","replies":[{"poster":"Fanny Forecast","date":"2016-01-13T10:40:55.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"one of the lowest win rates, last i checked (which was early preseason).

Are there any plans on improving her sololane?\n\nHow do you feel about her human-E? I think the AS-buff is a bit out of place and has no connection to the rest of her kit at all.\n\n>I think she's too snowball dependent at the moment\n\nEver considered reduceing her burst but giving her more survivabillity, maybe working with a short duration stealth after cougar-Q vs a haunted target rather than more damage and a heal/shield/defstat-bonus based on the number of champions(monsters?) hit on her cougar E(maybe doubled vs haunted targets)?\nMy biggest issue with her atm is that jumping in as cougar is prettymuch suicide unless you straigh up kill your target, as she is so damn squishy and her escape-W doesn't really get her out of harms way usually. This leads to the hard snowballing, as either i have the damage to oneshot someone, or i can't go in at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Pledgie","date":"2016-01-16T04:42:36.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rush zhonyas and buy offensively defensive items like abyssal and dead mans is sleeper op on nidalee. but i agree. she needs something to survive teamfights. i think she would be great to have her bonus armor and mr with cougar form back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fanny Forecast","date":"2016-01-13T10:36:55.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO, the AS buff on her E isn't out of place.  Her lore says, basically, that she became one with nature and got her powers from mother earth [correct me if im wrong, but thats how i remember it.]  The AS buff/heal is basically her using the earths power to grant herself/an ally life/power.  On top of that, it works REALLY well with her late game, considering shes the opposite of Karma support (supp early game, mage late game for Karma --- assassin early game, support late game for Nidalee).  Her spears still chunk like a mofo, but she typically can't rip people to shreds in cougar form like she can early-mid game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"forresto","date":"2016-01-12T04:02:34.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be wrong, but last time I checked hes still answering questions in said thread.
