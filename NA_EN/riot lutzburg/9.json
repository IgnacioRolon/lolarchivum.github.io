{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T04:16:23.604+0000","title":"Otto, the Hextech Merchant","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: Marksman\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create an AD Carry that could auto attack while moving.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Otto is a short ranged ADC with positioning and movement tools comparable to an Attack Damage version of Orianna. He can set up his Hextech Sentry to initiate auto attacks from locations where he himself is not at. His kit is balanced around this idea entirely.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low. Otto has a powerful theme, incredibly novel kit and a personality type yet to be seen in the League. The largest risk for Otto is in analyzing and diminishing the raw power of a mobile ADC.  Over a year after Otto's original design, Kallista was released, who shares vaguely similar themes to Otto.  That said, I don't believe Kallista's kit or even her mobility are similar enough to Otto's to worry too much.\n\n**Appearance**: A male gadgeteer type from Piltover, similar in appearance to Jayce, though much less rugged and less built. More of an Ezreal type; an explorer/traveler. He also has a background in door-to-door sales, whatever visual style that may or may not imply. Tink, a propellered hextech sentry with a cannon and telescopic eye, floats by his side, venting exhaust.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Commission__Kokichi_by_The_Z_zps69dfb3e3.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/helicopter-robot-cartoon_zpsf2ff26ab.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/49997_orig_zps4368f2cf.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/RC_Nexus_Ratchet_and_Clank_zpse6cb3586.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Otto is an inventor from Piltover who built a prototype personal defense assistant with the intent of one day mass producing and selling them to the citizens of Piltover. His prototype sentry had its fair share of kinks, however, as it possessed quite a sarcastic, dry-witted attitude. Also, sometimes it fired its entire weapons payload wildly in all directions for no reason. So there’s that. Despite his creation’s obvious shortcomings, Otto decided to become a door-to-door salesman in order to peddle his faulty product. After years of failed sales pitches and more lawsuits that he cares to admit, Otto had grown to love his sentry, and now considers him his best friend who he wouldn’t sell even if given the chance. Of course, he still wants to sell OTHER sentry bots; just not his own.\n\nUndeterred and still looking to make a return on his investment, Otto decides to join the League as a marketing stunt, attempting to accrue as much public attention as possible in order to showcase his invention. Having absolutely no real combat training or fighting skills, Otto publicly states that he will survive the perils of the Fields of Justice using nothing but the personal defense assistant of his own design. His proclamation just might go down in history as the best sales pitch ever… if he lives long enough to finally close a deal.\n\n**Theming Note**: Otto and Tink share a jovial friendship and bond somewhat reminiscent of Fry and Bender from Futurama. The two often make wisecracks about Tink's tendency to glitch or bug out, which they always blame each other for. They also share nostalgic stories from their past travels together in passing.\n\n**Strengths**: Safe poke and ability to position for team fights, strong chasing ability, very safe farming mechanics\n\n**Weaknesses**: No escapes or crowd control, very short auto attack range, dependent on sentry positioning\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:61}} {{champion:21}} \n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7148_btn_zps64b85df9.jpg\n**Auto Attack**: Otto’s sentry fires a bullet from range. Auto attack range is roughly equal to that of Urgot’s.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7748_btn_zps624d076f.jpg\n**Passive- Hextech Sentry**: Otto’s Hextech Sentry, Tink, fights on his behalf, allowing Otto to move and auto attack at the same time.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is what Otto’s entire kit is inspired by. The raw power offered by this passive ability should not be underestimated, and the rest of Otto’s kit is intentionally weaker to compensate.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10518_btn_zps5893bc82.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10519_btn_zpsc5b1775b.jpg\n**Q- Flight Path (4 seconds)**: Otto sends Tink to target location, granting vision of the area. Casting the ability again will cause Tink to return to Otto, and it will automatically return if Otto travels too far from it. While in Flight Path mode, Tink becomes targetable (similar to Zyra's plants), and will automatically scamper back to Otto after taking damage from three sources (auto attacks and AoE spells count as one source, targeted spells count as two). Tink becomes increasingly durable as Otto levels up, and gains one extra hit point at levels 6, 11 and 16. Auto attacking when Flight Path is active costs 5 mana per attack for the first five attacks. Subsequent auto attacks cost 5 additional mana each.\n(IE: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc)\nRank-ups lower ability cooldown from 9/8/6.5/5.5/4\n**Design Philosophy**: This lets Otto scout the map and fire his auto attacks from a safe distance of his choice. However, this comes at a very heavy mana cost, preventing this ability from being spammed endlessly, especially by leaving it stationed in the center of a lane indefinitely. This also incentivizes if not flat out requires Otto players to purchase some sort of mana item as part of their core build (another intended consequence of his positioning and mobility power). The sentry is targetable to create better counterplay opportunities, as well as make Otto players be more strategic with their sentry positioning. The increasing health over the course of the game prevents Otto from becoming too much of a lane bully early game, but gives him a chance to successfully fulfill his role as a \"remote sniper\" marksman in late game team fights.\nSample Dialogue when Tink is being attacked: \"Retreat!\" \"Threat levels over 9,000!\" \"I'm gettin' out of here!\" \"Fall back!\"\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_9839_btn_zpsd043ed14.jpg\n**W- Overclock (18 seconds)**: Passive: Otto permanently gains 10/15/20/25/30 movement speed.\nActive: For the next 2.5 seconds, Tink overclocks and gains 25/40/55/70/85% attack speed. In addition, Tink malfunctions for the duration and will not retreat while in Flight Path mode, regardless of how much damage he has taken.\nRank-ups increase passive movement speed and active attack speed.\n**Design Philosophy**: As a continued effort to enforce Otto’s role as a safe and positioning-focused ADC, his W is a simple steroid that grants bonus movement and attack speed. The \"enrage mode\" of Tink gives Otto players a small window of invulnerability so that they can land their auto attacks where and when they want. This is counteracted by an incredibly long cooldown for a non-ultimate ability.\nSample Dialogue for Tink: \"Fight or Flight Mode Disabled!\" \"Warning- Overclock initiated!\"\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10848_pas_zps63db0c33.jpg\n**E- Explosive Rounds (9 seconds)**: Tink switches to explosive rounds, causing its auto attacks to splash bonus magic damage around targets that it hits. This effect lasts 3 seconds.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage done.\n**Design Philosophy**: It wouldn’t be a hextech champion without explosions! This ability grants Otto some mild wave-clearing capabilities, as he is otherwise an incredibly poor pusher. Tristana and Jinx have similar splash damage abilities of this nature.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14920_pas_zps615caaee.jpg\n**R- Light Show (85 seconds)**: Tink malfunctions in spectacular fashion, spraying bullets in a circle all around it for 2.5 seconds and dealing physical damage to all enemies caught in the radius (about the size of Anivia's Ultimate). Tink becomes invulnerable for the duration of Light Show, and enemies are blinded while within range of its damage component. As with all of Otto’s abilities, Light Show can be activated regardless of Tink's location.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is a combination of Command: Shockwave and Bullet Time. It is essentially an AoE physical damage DoT at either a target location or around Otto himself. This ability is just pure fun and cool, while simultaneously encouraging smart placement and position of Otto’s sentry.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-07T22:28:28.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I swear Otto isn't a case of selling you snake oil!
