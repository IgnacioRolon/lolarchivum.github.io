{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T01:43:21.957+0000","title":"Cabar, the Dimensional Phantom","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Role**: AD Fighter/Assassin, AD Jungle\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create an auto attacking assassin themed around the phantom of the opera. Spells are themed heavily around illusion and sleight of hand.  His name is a reference to “Nicabar”, which is a gypsy word for ‘stealthy’.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Cabar is a vision denying, stealth-based, psychologically tactical assassin who uses a suite of utility to confuse and disorient enemy players.  He draws inspiration from a number of Champions, especially those with stealth mechanics.  His goal is to cause mass confusion and chaos before making his move, securing a kill or objective and then disappearing back into the shadows.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Cabar could end up being severely anti-fun for his opponents, though strong communication and pink wards easily counter him (much like Shaco or Eve).  His Ultimate is incredibly novel and unique, and adds a new layer of psychological tactics to the game.\n\n**Appearance**: A tall, slender man wearing a large flowing cape and a concealing mask. He also conceals a pair of thin, serrated blades underneath his cloak, which are connected to his palms by leather straps.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/phantom1-2_zps5a7e7d98.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/1362497018-x1_zps61da4b8f.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/4d08b7481b86e2df3e17b563a947c2d9_zps48e59cc9.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/fantasyartredeyesmagicartworkhoodedhood_wallpaperwindcom_22_zps5df387d3.jpg\n*Cabar using his iconic \"Phantasmal Army\" Ultimate, spawning a series of shadowy specters that appear randomly around the map*\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: amazing burst potential, ability to assassinate high priority targets, ability to see and dispose of wards, has an escape/gap closer and the ability to juke and mind game opponents\n\n**Weaknesses**: Relies on a lack of enemy awareness or knowledge to be effective, shut down by lowering his attack speed, very auto attack dependent for an assassin, Ultimate can potentially be ignored\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:56}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:28}}\n\n**Auto Attack**: Cabar uses thin serrated blades that extend from his palms to deal fast, vicious strikes in melee range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10422_pas_zps77fc85f1.jpg\n**Passive- Looming Threat**: The longer Cabar remains out of the enemy team's vision, the more powerful he becomes. Cabar's next auto attack against an enemy champion within 3 seconds of being seen deals 20-150% bonus damage, capping at 60 seconds' worth of charging time. This effect deals at least 20% bonus damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: As a shadowy phantom archetype, Cabar is at his most deadly when unseen.  As a jungler, this ability will see frequent use, and synergizes well with Phantasm.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_556_btn_zps129f6355.jpg\n**Q- Phantom Strike (5 sec)**: Cabar deals a cunning phantom strike, resetting his auto attack timer and instantly performing a double strike that lowers Phantasm's cooldown by 2 seconds. This ability applies on-hit effects. This ability counts as two auto attacks for the purposes of on-hit effects, though it only deals physical damage (+50% AD) on its own.  Phantom Strike deals 60% bonus damage to monsters.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a mechanically simple ability in practice with quite a few technical considerations in mind.  The ability applies on-hit effects twice and deals physical damage twice, though the auto attacks themselves deal no damage, in order to prevent an insanely high amount of burst.  In addition, this move was necessary to promote one of Cabar’s hallmark features- the ability to see and destroy wards.  The auto attack reset and double hit allow him to near-instantly destroy any wards he finds during Phantasm.  The bonus damage to monsters gives Cabar a fighting chance in the harshness of the new jungle without overloading his kit with unnecessary sustain.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10125_btn_zpsdd15cc04.jpg\n**W- Spectral Slash (8 sec)**: Cabar performs a crossing slash with his blades toward a target location, creating a short range skillshot that intersects in the middle (targeting is similar to Heimerdinger's Rockets). These spectral slashes each deal physical damage, though a target will only suffer 50% damage from the second slash if both connect. If a target is struck in the sweet spot at the blades' intersection, a Grievous Wounds effect is placed on the target for 5 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and reduce cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a simple damage-dealing ability with an emphasis on smart and accurate placement in order to earn the secondary advantage of grievous wounds; a great way of ensuring your assassination target can’t sustain through your burst damage.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_651_btn_zpsb0d950fc.jpg\n**E- Phantasm (18 sec)**: Passive: Taking damage greater than 15% of Cabar's max base health over a short period of time (1.5 seconds) causes Cabar to lose his concentration and temporarily phase into another dimension for 1.5 seconds. While phasing, Cabar takes 30% reduced damage. This effect can only trigger once every 10 seconds.\nActive: Cabar instantly surrounds himself in his cape before vanishing into another dimension, leaving the cape crumpled where he once stood. For the next 2/2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds Cabar becomes stealthed, increasing his movement speed by 15% for the duration, plus an additional 2.5 seconds following the end of the stealth effect). While in this state, Cabar can see other nearby stealthed entities, including wards.  Auto attacking a ward while stealthed increases the active duration of the ability by .5 seconds, including his Phantom Strike.  When the effect ends, Cabar reappears, fearing targets within his melee range for .5 seconds. Note that Phantasm triggers Cabar's passive. Attacking an enemy unit ends the stealth prematurely, though Cabar can still destroy wards while remaining hidden.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increases stealth duration.\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive component of this ability allows Cabar to survive all-ins when man-moding an assassination attempt, similar to Katarina’s Shunpo.  The active component acts as Cabar’s only real engagement/gap closing tool.  By leaving the cape on the ground, enemies near Cabar have an indication that he is currently prowling nearby.  The fear component makes thematic sense while also allowing Cabar to apply some auto attack damage freely before most Champions assuredly try to escape.  Finally, the ward component is a hallmark of Cabar’s kit, allowing him to deny the enemy team vision.  This ensures that future ganks have a higher rate of success, which is especially important for an assassin with no true gap closer or sticking potential.  Due to the powerful nature of this ability, it deals no damage in its own right.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17569_pas_zps8ead688a.jpg\n**R- Phantasmal Army (110)**: Cabar summons 6/9/12 figments or shades of himself around the map globally, which spawn from the enemy's fog of war and begin to chase after nearby enemy champions at high movement speed. These figments look identical to the real Cabar and last up to 12 seconds before vanishing. If a figment reaches an enemy champion, it will disperse into shadows and despawn. Each figment takes a realistic amount of damage from enemy attacks but will also disperse into shadows if struck twice.  Every time a figment disperses, Cabar gains 15% AD until 15 seconds after the last shade vanishes. This effect stacks. Note that naturally despawning figments do not grant the AD bonus; only figments that reach an enemy or are killed by enemy champions grant the bonus.  Allied champions are alerted when Cabar activates this ability, and the figments appear differently to allies.  Note that each shade grants normal vision, as if they were an allied champion.\nRank-ups increase the number of shades and lower the cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an iconic, scary and psychologically powerful mind game ability unlike anything seen in the League before.  By denying the enemy team vision and using stealth to travel undetected among the chaos, Cabar can potentially trick enemies into thinking he is in multiple places at once.  What’s even more diabolical is the intrinsic instinct to attack these shades, which only amplify Cabar’s damage when he chooses to strike.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T22:17:46.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I renamed his Ult to \"Phantasmal Army\" and clarified all the things you brought up.

This guy is too cool! Dimensional phasing is a cool theme and something pretty much unexplored in League. I would agree with FlameHalbrdOkido that there seems to be a conflict between shadow and dimension themes.  I actually prefer the dimension theme over shadow as we already have several champions that utilize shadows. And dimensional phasing is just sweet. I’m visualizing an Invisible Stalker from D&D with this champ, as their from a different “plane” and use invisibility to assassinate their targets. And as usual, sorry for the wall of text.\n\nOne thing I’m noticing with this champ is that he’s missing a few things most junglers should have. I’ll use Nocturne, Shaco, Rengar, Evelynn as a basis here. He has very little sustain relatively, as Nocturne has passive, Rengar has boosted W, Shaco has boxes to distract, and Eve….kinda sucks at the moment because of that. Maybe give him some sustain mechanic (nothing big, jsut enough to survive the new jungle)? And another thing, he has no sticking power. I acknowledge that he has a cool stealth mechanic that can get him to enemies but once he appears, one Caitlyn Net and he’s toast. Perhaps give him a speed up or slow down somewhere? Evelynn has both with her kit, Shaco has a slow and dash, Kitty’s got a jump and slow, Nocturne can speed himself along.\n\nPassive (Looming Threat): This should probably only apply to an enemy champion, as it would suck if you had to auto a ward (applies on hit effects), monster, or minion. You can give his blades some cool visual effect the more charge he has (like they glow brighter or have some cool wispy trail or something I dunno) and have extra dialogue for when he’s at max charge. The timer when being seen should be reset if they only have vision of him for 1 of those 3 seconds.\n\nQ (Phantom Strike): A solid ability. If you want to add an element that I listed above, this would be the go to ability, as the ability doesn’t give him that much extra damage. The ward killing element is fantastic by the way! I would not have made that connection unless explained.\n\nW (Spectral Slash): I would say this move is more similar to Heimerdinger’s W (or maybe they’re the same, I don’t play Lulu). Solid ability.\n\nE (Phantasm): Great ability, my only suggestion is number tweaks. Is the invisibility instantaneous? If so, the numbers are good. However if it's not, I compared it with Twitch’s invisibility and his was longer, had more movement speed, and a large attack speed boost to it. I’d suggest maybe something like 2/3/4/5/6. Of course, Twitch suffers with the problem of having to wait 1.5 seconds before going invisible. If Cabar does too, you may want to buff the ability.\n\nEdit: Oh I just thought of a cool idea! Since you have to go out of your way for killing the wards (and thereby using precious time and your Q to kill it), why not reward Cabar with a little extended invisibility duration (like an extra second) every time he kills a ward during that E?\n\nR (From the Shadows): To deal with the shadow/dimension problem, I’d suggest “Return from a Different Dimension” or “Interdimensional Ambush”, or something along those lines I dunno. Now THIS was the ability that got me so hyped about this champion! It’s so cool and hilarious at he same time. Imagine All-For-One with Cabar and using all the ults at the same time haha! The clones should definitely, when reaching melee range, stretch out their hands and then try and grasp the enemy. While doing so, they disappear into phantasmal wisps and emit an eerie laugh. It’s unfortunate that melees have absolutely no counterplay to this ability besides running away like a pansy, but I can’t think of another way. I like how you give bonus stats for when the clones hit their targets. When Cabar dies, all clones should dissolve.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T21:45:27.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Earthlord Jazz,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9zxzdcT1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-12T20:10:12.541+0000)\n>\n> Wow!

This is some of the best and most helpful feedback I've ever gotten.  Let me address each point-\n\nGood call on having some form of sustain.  Adding it to his Q makes sense.  For mobility, I think I will extend the duration of his speed up for a few seconds AFTER his stealth ends.  That should address the stickiness problem.\n\nGood call on the passive only proccing against enemy champions.  I'm not quite sure what you meant about the timer resetting, though.\n\nAnother good call on the Heimer similarities... makes more mechanical sense than comparing it to Glitterlance (I don't play either champ very much so I am not an expert in how those skillshots work).\n\nThe invisibility is instantaneous, like Shaco's.  I'll make a note of it.  Don't forget that he does get a fear at the end of it, though, which for an AA champion is quite powerful.  I like the stealth extension for killing wards!\n\nYeah, I hear you on the name and the theme- I'll change some things around.  I LOVE this ability.... it's probably one of my favorite single abilities that I've designed.  I really like how far you took it regarding how the shades function and interact with enemies.  I agree that the shades should all disappear if the real Cabar dies.\n\nAgain, awesome feedback and it has really helped make this a better concept!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-12T16:41:06.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it ok if he is just fading into the shadows, or something along those lines, I feel that the shadows is kinda the theme, here but when you introduce the dimension phasing in the E (which is the only place that you mention it besides the title) it still feels like it's like he's becoming more of a shadow and not going into another dimension, even though the two themes can be similar, I don't see the need to have both, in a way they kind do seem at odds with each other, I think that you should focus on one theme here.\nAlso when stealthed by E only pink wards  and champions with true sight items would be able to see him right?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T21:40:35.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9zxzdcT1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-12T16:41:06.926+0000)\n>\n> Is it ok if he is just fading into the shadows, or something along those lines, I feel that the shadows is kinda the theme, here but when you introduce the dimension phasing in the E (which is the only place that you mention it besides the title) it still feels like it's like he's becoming more of a shadow and not going into another dimension, even though the two themes can be similar, I don't see the need to have both, in a way they kind do seem at odds with each other, I think that you should focus on one theme here.\n> Also when stealthed by E only pink wards  and champions with true sight items would be able to see him right?\n\nI see your point about the shadows versus dimensional motif, and definitely want to explore the dimensional side of things.
