{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T03:42:20.158+0000","title":"Frolov, Commander of the Skies","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AD Tank/Fighter\n\n**Inspiration**: The original inspiration was to create an AP Marskman that took down towers and had high siege power. However, this almost immediately evolved into a tank/fighter that exhibited similar play patterns. His name is a reference to the [Frolov Chakra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulbit); a tight loop maneuver first employed by a Russian airman of the same name.  His pegasus companion's name is derived from the same maneuver, also known as Kulbit.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Frolov is a split pushing, objective-controlling tank/fighter, and a solid choice as a solo laner, jungler or support Champion. Frolov is an eclectic mash-up of strengths and weaknesses that I don’t think have been seen on the Fields of Justice yet (perhaps there is a good reason why?). Frolov’s core game play patterns rely on his theme as the commander of the Demacian Air Force, as he is able to summon a fleet of Demacian Pegasus Riders, which he can use for airstrikes, supply drops and courier service. Frolov’s kit allows him to split push and siege towers when fighting alone, but also allows him to support his allies with immense utility.\n\nIn practice, Frolov players can build in one of three ways- as a tanky fighter with a mix of attack damage, attack speed and on-hit items, as a tanky support Champion (similar to Leona), or as a full support Champion (purchasing utility items such as Mikael’s Crucible to synergize with the natural utility of his kit).\n\n**Risk Analysis**: High. Frolov’s kit and play patterns are very novel, as a split push/support hybrid doesn’t really exist in the game today. This untested kit type may prove unhealthy for the game. In addition, Frolov very lightly shares a similar theme to Quinn, which may prove off putting from a lore or fantasy-fulfillment perspective.\n\n**Appearance**: Frolov is a badass, Demacian, Pegasus Air Force Commander. He is the Jarvan of the skies, in terms of rank, manliness and stature. Some of the reference materials below actually use Jarvan as a basis, in order to convey the similarities in societal armor, military backgrounds and general demeanor.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Jarvan_zps29105a60.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/r169_457x256_11907_Joust_2d_fantasy_knight_armor_battle_lava_joust_pterodactyl_picture_image_digital_art_zps63267179.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Joust_zpsf367c891.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/tumblr_mixtaw2LHp1s6oqqxo1_500_zps6ed873b2.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/url_zps41f0ef73.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/200px-Kurdran_TCG_zps7b9b3c46.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Amazing split pushing power and escapes, excels in long range sieges, can fall back as a support when behind\n\n**Weaknesses**: Reliant on auto attacks and on-hit items to deal damage, poor duelist, susceptible to kiting\n\n**Plays Most Like…**: {{champion:106}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:1}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A relatively long ranged melee lance attack. Frolov wields a lance/polearm not dissimilar from those commonly used in jousting matches.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6859_btn_zps199a9168.jpg\n**Passive- Demacia’s Finest**: Frolov becomes inspired whenever a pegasus from his unit flies overhead. This “Inspiration” buff increases his attack speed by 30% for 4 seconds. The effect is doubled when Frolov is near Kulbit. Subsequent sightings will refresh the duration of the buff.\n**Design Philosophy**: In practice, Frolov receives an attack speed buff shortly after he casts Bombardment or Supply Drop. This buff persists when his Ultimate is active and Kulbit is summoned, so long as Kulbit is nearby. This synergizes with his E as well as increases his ability to split push and damage towers.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_1105_btn_zpsd22dfadd.jpg\n**Q- Bombardment (8 sec)**: Frolov paints a large target area with a marker at up to 700 range with a diameter roughly the size of Anivia's Ultimate. 1.5 seconds later, a pegasus rider flies overhead and drops a payload of bombs, variably slowing and dealing magic damage to all enemies in the blast based on their proximity to its center. This ability deals special bonus damage to towers and inhibitors, similar to Rammus' Ultimate.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n\"Let's go on a bombing run!\"\n\"Bombs away!\"\n\"Let 'em go, boys!\"\n\"Look sharp- we got incoming!\"\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is perfect for sieging and split pushing. The slow allows Frolov to reach his targets so that he can begin stacking auto attacks.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10615_btn_zps84b910a2.jpg\n**W- Supply Drop (15 sec)**: Passive: Every time Frolov casts Supply Drop, he stores a little extra in his ration reserves. This permanently grants him 3 health.\nActive: Frolov calls in a supply drop to a target location within 800 range. After 2.5 seconds, a griffin para-drops a health relic to the area. The first Champion (ally or enemy) to touch the relic is healed for 40/70/100/130/160 (+5% target's max health) and 30/60/90/120/150 mana. These supply drops can be stored up to a cap of 3 and can be summoned independently of one another with a short, 1 second cooldown between casts. Receiving the benefits of a health relic places a debuff on the target which lasts for 6 seconds, cutting the effectiveness of subsequent relics in half.\nRank-ups increase heal amount.\n\"My boys always leave me a little extra!\"\n\"Stockpiling reserves!\"\n\"Eat up, soldier!\"\n\"Supplies, incoming!\"\n\"Clear the LZ!\"\n**Design Philosophy**: The passive component of Supply Drop allows Frolov to build some innate tankiness over the duration of a game. This also self-synergizes with the max health components of the relics themselves. The debuff is there to ensure that Frolov or a single one of his allies can’t simply face-tank enemies and heal almost half of their max health instantly.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7445_btn_zpsebe8f484.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11954_pas_zps93397dce.jpg\n**E- Blazing Lance (18 sec)**: Passive: Frolov's lance heats up as it's used, increasing his attack damage by 1/2/3/4/5% with each auto attack. This provides him with a “Blazing” buff, which stacks up to 5 times and lasts for 4 seconds. Subsequent stacks refresh the duration of the buff.\nActive: At any time, Blazing Lance can be activated to deal heavy physical damage to a target enemy in melee range, resetting Frolov's attack animation in the process. This ability deals 80/120/160/200/240 (+30% AD), plus an additional 15% total damage for each Blazing stack Frolov currently has. This vents the excess heat within Frolov’s lance, resetting his Blazing stacks to 0.\nRank-ups increase damage and bonus AD, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability can be effectively used as an execute, similar to Volibear’s Frenzy, by stacking the Blazing buff fully to increase Frolov’s attack damage before dealing the finishing blow. Again, Frolov excels as a split pusher and tower destroyer, and his E further solidifies this role.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_1470_btn_zpsfab83516.jpg\n**R- Summon Kulbit (90 sec)**: Frolov summons his personal pegasus, Kulbit, at a nearby target location. If near an enemy Champion or structure, Kulbit will begin attacking it automatically; otherwise it will remain stationary. Frolov can press R again and right click to control Kulbit, which can auto attack with his hooves and also war stomps occasionally, slowing nearby enemies by 30% for 2 seconds. Kulbit has a base movement speed of 450/525/600 and ignores unit collision. Any allied champion can also right click Kulbit to mount him, gaining his movement speed and taking control of his movements. If Frolov mounts Kulbit, he gains increased auto attack range and bonus attack damage.  Kulbit lasts for 12/18/24 seconds or until killed. Kulbit has stats comparable to Tibbers but is untargetable while acting as a courier. Kulbit’s summon time burns at double the rate while being ridden and his duration ticks away in a resource bar underneath its health bar. Players who are riding Kulbit can automatically dismount by pressing any ability key.  Players automatically dismount Kulbit if they suffer damage from an enemy Champion.\nRank-ups increase Kulbit's movement speed, attack damage and active duration, as well as lower the ability's cooldown.\n\"Anybody need a ride?\"\n\"Kulbit, we need your help!\"\n“Kulbit, get us out of here!”\n“Time to go!”\n**Design Philosophy**: This is an incredibly powerful and potentially unbalanceable Ultimate. It allows Frolov to reach allies or team fights incredibly fast, escape enemies who attempt to stop his split pushing, or lets an ally reach a key objective or escape the front lines in a pinch. When split pushing, Frolov can stand by Kulbit to receive a powerful attack speed buff, which allows the duo to take down towers incredibly fast. Frolov can also send Kulbit ahead of him to attack and slow a fleeing enemy out of position, allowing either himself or his team to capitalize on the situation.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T08:30:58.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"so dose this guy ride on a \"eagle\" or a \"ostrich\"? other that HELL YEAH i like it","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T08:35:14.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JellyJackJak22,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=0tuEf0Mj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-02T08:30:58.012+0000)\n>\n> so dose this guy ride on a \"eagle\" or a \"ostrich\"? other that HELL YEAH i like it\n\nHaha, yeah something like that.

I already have a jousting knight champion concept named [Constantine, the Spectral Rider](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/gLanjA9i-constantine-the-spectral-rider)!  Frolov definitely has strong theming around his griffin and his lance, so perhaps I could make a change where he gains increased AA range and some other stats when he chooses to ride Kulbit, while all others use him as a transport instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-31T19:13:36.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made some slight updates to Frolov, in order to add some clarity to his spell rank-ups and other minor odds and ends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-31T00:22:39.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Griffon-riding lance-wielding siege-master badass?!

This is simply a space to be creative and share ideas with other creative people.  It's about becoming inspired and inspiring others to potentially do something great someday; even if it's outside of League of Legends.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-03-20T13:58:40.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CHOCOBO!!
