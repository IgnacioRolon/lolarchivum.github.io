Admittedly in doing so, I ended up borrowing several themes and tropes from another one of my concepts, [Cabar, the Dimensional Phantom](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/9zxzdcT1-cabar-the-dimensional-phantom).\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Penumbra is designed to be a single target, auto attack-focused fighter with a number of psychological tricks and mind games available to him.  His most iconic skill grants him the ability to create fog of war at a location of his choosing.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Penumbra has one high-risk component from a technical standpoint, which is his Ultimate.  That said, there’s nothing all that compelling about a simple ‘spy’ motif, and the rest of his kit is cohesive and functional, but not all that novel or inherently exciting.\n\n**Appearance**: A tall, slender man with various cloaks, hoods and overcoats, which conceal who knows what.  He wields hidden daggers along the undersides of his wrists, which he can extend to make vicious melee strikes.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/1362497018-x1_zpse7jxit47.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/phantom1-2_zpsuuemikel.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Calm, cool and collected under pressure.  Takes his job seriously.  Uses a dark magic to aid in his spying.  /joke: “I’ll take a Crystalline Flask- shaken, not stirred.”\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful single target damage, targeted gap closer and damage immunity, utility ultimate, ability to play tricks and mind game opponents\n\n**Weaknesses**: No escapes (gap closer must be used to engage only), unreliable stun, no defensive abilities or tankiness/survivability\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:56}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A swift and elegant melee strike with a hidden blade concealed along his wrist, underneath his overcoat.  Critical strikes resemble a dramatized open palm stab.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17869_pas_zpstcrli6yw.jpg\n**Passive- Bad Intelligence**: When at 50% health or above, Penumbra appears as full health to enemies.  When below 50% health, he appears to be at 10% health.  When Penumbra takes damage while in vision of enemies, his true health is revealed for 3 seconds.\nDesign Philosophy: This ability is primarily used as a denial of information against the enemy team.  This passive has a lot of unconventional power, as information in League of Legends often equates to power.  Bad Intelligence limits that information.  Penumbra can use this ability when coming out of the jungle or other fog of war, causing enemy players to either cautiously back away or potentially engage in a fight they weren’t anticipating to be so difficult.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_4478_btn_zpsizdqzkou.jpg\n**Q- Neurotoxin (7 seconds)**: A mid-range targeted ability that deals physical damage over 2.5 seconds.  If the target attempts to use an ability during this time, they are instead silenced for .5 seconds, and the toxin refreshes.  (The silence can only trigger once.)\nRank-ups increase damage dealt and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a simple targeted ability, as Penumbra’s role as an assassin should be more about positioning and timing than skillshots.  The silence component creates some counterplay options for enemies, who can either take the extra damage but be able to attack faster, or hold onto their spells and act only once the DoT has worn off.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17527_pas_zpsbvedby6e.jpg\n**W- Lethal Strikes (9 seconds)**: Passive: Penumbra's auto attacks deal bonus physical damage to targets afflicted with Neurotoxin.\nActive: Penumbra's attack speed is increased by 20/30/40/50/60% for 4 seconds. If a target is struck by three consecutive auto attacks while this ability is active, they are stunned for 1  second.\nRank-ups increase passive damage and attack speed value.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is designed to augment and empower Penumbra’s role as a single target assassin.  By doubling down on a target with Neurotoxin, it ensures that Penumbra is sticking to one target in order to deal his maximum potential for damage.  If able to successfully stick long enough, the stun component will help finish the job.  Requiring the auto attacks as a prerequisite for the stun ensures that players with escapes are able to use those abilities effectively, and that Penumbra doesn’t simply have to use his E to instantly gap close and then stun a vulnerable target.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_4602_pas_zpswzoz0r4j.jpg\n**E- Element of Surprise (14 seconds)**: Penumbra sinks into the ground, briefly becoming untargetable for 1 second, then reemerges behind a target, creating a poisonous cloud around himself upon resurfacing. This cloud deals physical damage to all enemies who stand in it, as well as slows them by 20/23/26/29/32%. This effect lasts 3 seconds.  Penumbra will reach his target as long as he is in range when casting the ability.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is intentionally a targeted one to fulfill the role of a gap closer and not a free escape whenever the Penumbra player feels like running away.  Penumbra is an assassin focused on getting IN and getting a kill; not fleeing the scene.  The slow synergizes with his W, ideally allowing him to stick to a target long enough to proc the stun.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8948_pas_zpspsslbevk.jpg\n**R- Fog of War (70 seconds)**: Penumbra summons a mighty shroud of fog upon a target location (roughly the size of Trundle’s Frozen Domain), denying enemy vision in the area for 8 seconds, even if they would otherwise have vision. This is a semi-global ability.  Enemy units and champions can reveal this fog of war by wading through it, but they suffer stacking magic damage (+30% AP) for every second they do so. The fog is lifted after its full duration, and parts of it are lifted if allied units attack enemy units from within it (functioning identically to actual fog of war).  If the enemy places wards or uses Clairvoyance during Fog of War’s effect, they are granted vision as per normal and the fog in that area dissipates.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a great zone denial and escape tool that Penumbra can cast either over a contested area, or right on top of a chaotic team fight.  He can also employ it as an escape or chase deterrent directly after successfully assassinating a target.  It is somewhat analogous to a Singed Poison Trail that lasts 8 seconds.  Enemy players should not want to chase Penumbra through this cloud.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my unique concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)\n\n> [{quoted}](name=J Wilson,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=WtOJk4li,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-16T04:12:24.638+0000)\n>\n> Riot please employ this guy^","replies":[{"poster":"TheAzeban","date":"2015-03-16T04:12:24.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot please employ this guy^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flexion1","date":"2015-09-08T15:05:55.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dude who makes these champs should be a riot employee holy shit he has some cool ideas","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-09-10T07:14:34.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=icemüffin,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=WtOJk4li,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-09-08T15:05:55.171+0000)\n>\n> The dude who makes these champs should be a riot employee holy shit he has some cool ideas\n\nWhoa, thanks so much!

At least, once you have a few more concepts under your belt.\n\nI have applied to Riot in the past and I know for a fact that my work has been seen by more than a few designers at the studio.  Unfortunately I can't reveal any more beyond that.\n\nI wrote a piece about my own methods for designing champions in my mega thread, so I'll quote it here for you-\n\nPersonal Design Philosophies and Approach\n\nI believe I am a relatively well-rounded designer, though I have a stronger interest and emphasis on mechanics and flow of gameplay. I'm interested in lore, back story, dialogue, etc., but in the interest of time and effort required, few of my champions go deeply down that route. Instead, I have focused most of my effort on creating cohesive and fun kits that flow, have good counterplay opportunities and synergize both with itself and the rest of a team.\n\nI also hold the belief that it's nearly impossible to predict how things such as damage, scaling, range, etc. (the hard numbers) will play out in the real game when the champion can't actually be tested. As such, my concepts are on the light side of the hard numbers and instead provide good frames of reference or baselines to get a rough estimate on the ability in question. For example, I'll often use adages like \"similar in size to Anivia's Ultimate\" in order to create a visual approximation for my readers.\n\nI think it's very important to discuss design goals, philosophies and intended gameplay patterns whenever possible. This is why each of my champions are prefaced with a \"General Design Philosophy\" as well as brief design goals following each ability. These are important because they provide the context of WHY after the WHAT has been explained.\n\nIn addition, I always include a \"Risk Analysis\" section so that I can approach each concept from a business perspective. Would this champion be well received by the community? Does it push the envelope artistically, mechanically or thematically? If so, does it push too much? Are there technical limitations or overtly difficult implementation procedures that increase the difficulty of adding this character to the roster? I try to take all of these questions into account whenever I design a concept, because no matter how cool it is, it still has to be developed.\n\nFinally, when it comes to naming champions, I always try to use interesting words that somehow relate to the core theme, personality or kit of that champion. Riot does an excellent job of this and it's actually one of the common weaknesses I see in many fan-submitted concepts. For example, \"Brand\" is a great name for a scorching fire mage and \"Kog'maw\" is pure perfection for an alien puppy dog who literally has bio-organic cogs in its mouth. If a champion's name has letters in the double digits, or more than one apostrophe, or can theoretically be pronounced in more than three ways, it's probably not a good name.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-07-28T21:01:40.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Penumbra will reach his target as long as he is in range when casting the ability\"\n\nThis wording on the E have me an idea. First question: whats the radius one the poison cloud - 400 units? Smaller? If the cloud is at least 2X his AA range then here is my idea based on your wording. \n\nPen's AAs range gains bonus range on Champions that are within the poison cloud. If Pen AA's a champion he will blink to them within the poison cloud. \n\nI think this still connects to the Spy theme, as I could imagine that a dark cloud it would seem like the spy still know his way around as if he were in broad daylight, and that the victim within the dark cloud couldn't seem to get away no matter what. \n\n\n\nI was just looking thro some of your old ideas and noticed this one, that I think I missed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-27T22:04:48.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Penumbra has a truly penultimate... ultimate.  >_>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radach","date":"2015-03-18T07:57:20.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this champion would be perfect counter for Katarina and let's be honest she needs more counters.

Ideally any non-sentient object that grants vision (namely wards) would actually have their vision removed for the duration.  That said, anything that could move (minions, jungle monsters, champions, Tibbers's) could regain vision of  the area by wading through the fog.  Essentially his Ult would work like a large Sweeping Lens, temporarily disabling them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-17T08:24:16.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you guys like/dislike the most about Penumbra?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T08:21:43.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully people decide to *spy* on Penumbra a bit more tomorrow!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T04:24:28.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and I am on a mission tonight to finish uploading my remaining concepts, but I will definitely take a look at yours tomorrow and post my feedback!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-03-16T04:18:59.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this, I even had the same passive as an ability idea for a champ.
