{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T01:35:59.690+0000","title":"Kajahri, Father of the Blades","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Role**: AD Assassin\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion who used psychic daggers that could be controlled remotely.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Kajahri is an auto-attack centric assassin who excels in the jungle, mid or top lane. His auto attacks can apply daggers into his victims, which he can then extract remotely and recall back to hm, dealing massive damage in the process. He also has a very aggressive gap closer designed to finish off sickly, low health targets with cruel efficiency.  Since Kajahri must constantly be focused on the application and management of his daggers, his abilities do not require mana to cast.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low. While sharing some similar themes to Talon, Kajahri is a relatively unique Champion with several interesting mechanics that synergize well together. There’s nothing completely off the wall about his kit and, at worst, he might crowd out the ‘psychic blade’ archtype that Irelia was originally supposed to be.\n\n**Appearance**: A bald man in his late 30's with a well trimmed beard. He wears a very large trench coat lined with daggers, much like a shady salesman in a back alley wears a trench coat lined with his merchandise. He treats the daggers like loved ones and frequently speaks to them, referring to them as his \"children.\"\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/kanes-warth-ss1_zps76d5b23c.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/600full-command-amp-conquer-3-kanes-wrath-photo_zpsedf0bb8c.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/351472-kane2_zps1b55df2d.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/UncleKane--article_image_zps02f701dd.jpg\n\n\n\n**Lore**: Kajahri acts as a willing host for a series of living daggers. They appear sentient and possess the ability to float and move on their own accord. Each dagger also seems to be capable of vampiric or life-stealing abilities. Kajahri houses the daggers and protects them from those who wish to see their demonic existence extinguished. It is unclear what Kajahri is getting out of this bizarre relationship, but he seems certain that he will be rewarded for his dedication and loyalty.\n\n**Strengths**: long range targeted gap closer, powerful AoE, grievous wounds application, passive speed boost, mild lane/jungle sustain, does not require mana to use his abilities\n\n**Weaknesses**: must manage daggers as a resource and keep track of their locations, high mana costs on abilities, no escapes or defensive steroids to survive post-assassination\n\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:91}} {{champion:429}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A quick and scurrying melee strike with a hand blade.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12276_pas_zps3da8b78e.jpg\n**Passive- Separation Anxiety**: Kajahri's attack speed increases by 5% and his movement speed increases by 2.5% for every dagger currently residing in a target. (Max 40/50/60% attack speed and 20/25/30% movement speed at level 1-6/11/16.)\n**Design Philosophy**: Kajahri relies heavily on his auto attacks to deal damage, so his Passive is designed to help solidify that role. In addition, using his daggers should feel rewarding; not crippling to his power level. To reinforce this, Separation Anxiety actually rewards the aggressive use of Kajahri’s Ultimate.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8808_pas_zpsb1a68c87.jpg\n**R- Equip Dagger (no cooldown)**: Learned automatically at level 1, this toggles Kajahri's daggers on/off. When active, each auto attack drains mana to insert a dagger into Kajahri's target, dealing bonus physical damage. The first dagger also causes a 3 second grievous wounds effect, which cannot occur on the same target more than once every 12 seconds. Kajahri can carry a maximum of 8/8/10/12 daggers in total. These daggers can last within a target for up to 12 seconds before despawning, and also despawn upon reaching a certain distance from Kajahri. When a dagger despawns, it is instantly placed back in Kajarhi’s inventory of daggers.\nRank-ups increase damage done and increase the number of available blades.\n**Design Philosophy**: Kajahri’s kit is based around this toggleable ability. The Grievous Wounds component helps ensure that an assassination target can’t sustain through Kajahri’s damage. Since Kajahri’s main form of damage comes from these daggers, they needed a max duration and tether range to ensure that his resources are steadily available when needed. Kajarhi players will need to be strategic about how they toggle the daggers on and off, as each auto attack has an associated mana cost. In addition, since the daggers are finite in nature, prudent players will conserve their supply and use them only on priority targets.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_8385_pas_zps324fb925.jpg\n**Q- Fan of Knives (7 sec)**: Kajahri twirls his trench coat in a circle, loosening a storm of blades around him and dealing minor physical damage to all nearby enemies. This ability also applies 1 dagger to up to 5 enemies (prioritizing champions) if they are currently active.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage done.\n**Design Philosophy**: This helps Kajahri clear waves and apply a large number of daggers to enemies in a short time span. It synergizes very well with Reparation, as well.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10237_pas_zpsa4167184.jpg\n**W- Reparation (9 sec)**: Kajahri recalls his daggers from their current targets, dealing physical damage to those targets (based on the number of daggers residing within them) and dealing additional physical damage to any other targets on the daggers' return path to Kajahri. Daggers that return from a target heal Kajahri for 1.5% of his max health. (This would be visually reminiscent of Swain's crows returning to him with health.)\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage done.\n**Design Philosophy**: This allows Kajahri to refresh his resource pool to continue dealing sustained physical damage on each of his auto attacks. The mild sustain also helps him stay healthy during trades and post-assassinations. This ability also functions somewhat similarly to Twitch’s Contaminate.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10018_pas_zps1dcd2f2b.jpg\n**E- Bloodlust (16 sec)**: The fitted daggers within Kajahri's trench coat target an enemy and rush towards it, carrying Kajahri with them. (This is visualized similarly to Super Mario's cape ability, with Kajahri being propelled through the air by the series of daggers within his trench coat.) Kajahri ignores crowd control effects until reaching his target. If targeting an enemy champion, the range of this ability is increased based on the enemy's health percentage; the closer the enemy is to death, the further the range on the ability, up to a cap of 1250 range. This ability deals no damage.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase the ability's range.\n**Design Philosophy**: The range of this ability is rather short under normal circumstances, and requires a target to limit its power to strictly initiations rather than escapes through the jungle. This ‘initiation only’ approach allows more power to be put into the ability as a result, so its range is drastically increased against low health enemy champions.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Patton","date":"2015-01-02T03:20:03.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You already know i love this champion.

Endless death!  The real constraint is that W is on a fairly long cooldown for being so core to his kit, and it serves as both his sustain and his ability to regenerate his resources to deal optimal damage.  He can't just press W willy nilly, which is why he has to be careful about who he stabs with his blades... once they're inbedded in a victim, they aren't all that trivial to remove!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-06T05:10:56.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So normally abilities cost nothing, but if he toggles on his ultimate, then the number of his blades becomes his resource, for all abilities, and AA?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-06T05:26:34.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uFKWeKpr,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-06T05:10:56.667+0000)\n>\n> So normally abilities cost nothing, but if he toggles on his ultimate, then the number of his blades becomes his resource, for all abilities, and AA?\n\nWell, yes and no.  His Q and E have no cost, with his Q doing bonus damage and adding blades if his R is toggled on.  He can still auto attack and use his kit normally, but obviously if he has no blades then his R is toggled off, and if he has blades he can choose to turn them on or off at any point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-06T00:12:39.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so question: does he use his blades as a resource, or does he use mana. 2nd, would he be using mana as a resource until he toggled on his ultimate and then his resource becomes his 12 blades, i dont understand :(","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-06T03:02:57.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uFKWeKpr,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-01-06T00:12:39.428+0000)\n>\n> so question: does he use his blades as a resource, or does he use mana. 2nd, would he be using mana as a resource until he toggled on his ultimate and then his resource becomes his 12 blades, i dont understand :(\n\nAh, I guess I never actually specify in the description, do I?

Kajahri is designed to be in the thick of things, akin to a fighter, for the majority of a team fight.  He goes in, lays down his Fan of Blades, deals sustained damage to your point, and sustains himself through the use of Reparation.\n\nHOWEVER, the true strength of Kajahri comes from what inevitably happens next.  How many times does a tank or slippery mage flash out or escape at the last possible second with nary a sliver of health remaining?  That's Kajahri's cue.  He has a Lux-ult-equivalent targeted gap closer for enemy champions who are at low health.  He rushes over to them, immune to all CC and guaranteed to reach his target, who is limping off the battlefield with nothing left, and he ends them.  Clean-up duty.  THAT is why I chose to label Kajahri as an assassin.  Perhaps it's not entirely accurate with the conventional definition of the term with regards to League of Legends, but I think it's a more appropriate theme to draw attention to as opposed to his otherwise generic \"fighter\" behaviors.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-01-02T02:14:57.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how each picture is a picture of Kane from C&C.
