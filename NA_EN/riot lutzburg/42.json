{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T00:00:10.394+0000","title":"Solomon, the Resplendent Arbitrator","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: AP Tank and Jungler\n\n**Inspiration**: To create a champion with an Ultimate similar to Janna's but with an emphasis on withstanding retaliation during the entirety of its channel.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Solomon is a front line, disruption-based tank with an emphasis on keeping himself strong and resilient enough to endure even the most fed of opponents.  After dashing into the enemy team in a brilliant flash of light, Solomon can isolate a target by knocking back other enemies around him.  When retaliation comes and he begins to take focus fire, the Resplendent Arbitrator strengthens his resolve, activating a self-heal that grows more powerful the more damage he sustains.  His passive also allows him a brief window of immunity from crowd control effects, ensuring that he can reach and cast judgment on the target he needs to.\n\n**Risk Analysis**:  Low. Solomon has a compelling kit without any one spell being too extreme or out there. His thematic similarities to Leona should be seen as interesting and immersive, but could also be seen as a little overbearing.\n\n**Appearance**: A large, middle aged and bearded man in radiant Solari armor, wielding a massive paladin's mace and book of laws. Similar to Leona, he is a paladin of the Solari. Where Leona is a tank with crowd control, Solomon is more of a healing tank, much like a paladin would be.\n\nSolomon often speaks in Old English proverbs and mannerisms, \"Lest ye be judged,\" and so on; things that a righteous and truth-seeking judge might say. His quotes reference mistrials, juries, objections, etc.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/art-muzhchina-kniga-magiya-molot_zpsd6968d14.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/warcraft-paladin-fanart-resurrection1_zps7c143427.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Paladin_Tier_2_Judgement_set_by_peetietang_zps26f8984e.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Epic_paladin_zpsb3b7b42b.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Solomon is one of the judges that exiled Diana. He now joins the League to team up with Leona to push Diana into the harshness of the sunlight once and for all.\n\nHis name is a somewhat obvious play on the word \"Sol\" which oftentimes is used as a synonym for the sun. Solomon is also a direct reference to King Solomon of Israel, revered as a wise prophet and visionary of his time.\n\n**Joke**: \"Where's the only place Diana stands a chance on trial? A -night- court!\"\n\n**Strengths**:  Synergizes with health, great team utility and healing power, two forms of crowd control, deals percentage damage\n\n**Weaknesses**: Does not synergize with armor/mr, shut down by grievous wounds, balanced with Spirit Visage in mind as a core item\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:89}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:113}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Solomon uses his gavel-like mace to strike enemies in melee range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5181_btn_zpsd947b2e3.jpg\n**Passive- Magistrate’s Resolve**: After suffering damage equal to 12% or more of his maximum base health over a short period of time (1.5 sec), Solomon gains an enveloping shield of sunlight which prevents the next form of crowd control used against him from taking effect. This does not prevent the effects from dealing damage when applicable, however. This shield lasts 3 seconds once active and has an 8 second cooldown following its use or disappearance.\n**Design Philosophy**:  scaling off of base health allows the ability to proc frequently even when stacking pure health, which Solomon is encouraged to do. The ability itself synergizes incredibly well with his Ultimate, and allows Solomon to either soak up valuable crowd control effects from the enemy team, or deter enemies from using these effects on him, which subsequently allows him to continue his pursuit of justice.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15846_pas_zpsa045eedd.jpg\n**Q- Persecution (7 sec)**: Solomon slams the ground with his mace, creating a sunburst effect around himself (roughly the range of Malphite's Ground Slam). This deals magic damage to all nearby enemies and deals 50% bonus damage to the enemy caught closest to the epicenter of the strike. In addition, affected enemies are pushed back from the epicenter of the attack and slowed by 24/28/32/36/40% for 1 second. The target closest to the epicenter of the ability is not pushed back.\nRank-ups increase damage and slow amount.\nSample Dialogue: \"Overruled!\" \"Objection!\"\n**Design Philosophy**: The bonus damage component allows Solomon to more easily clear jungle camps. The minor knockback is thematically similar to Diana's and allows Solomon to either disengage or push enemies towards his team when used in conjunction with his E.  The isolation effect allows him to keep a priority target from getting pushed away from his team when he sees an opportunity to engage on an out-of-position priority target.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13351_btn_zpsd996ae3e.jpg\n**W- Radiant Glow (14 sec)**: A radiant glow surges through Solomon's armor upon activation, healing him each time he suffers damage from any source. The more damage he sustains over the 4 second active duration, the more healing he receives per attack.\nRank-ups increase healing amount and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: The increased healing based on damage taken limits the passive jungle/lane sustain from becoming too strong but provides great protection against enemy champions or objectives (towers, dragon and baron). In practice, this ability is essentially a self-cast version of Galio's Bulwark in reverse.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5545_btn_zpsae2b3580.jpg\n**E- Blinding Rush (12 sec)**: Solomon briefly assumes a brilliant form of light and dashes towards a target location (roughly the range of Sejuani's charge). Upon reaching his destination, the light disperses, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies and blinding them for 1.5 seconds. The damage this ability deals scales with health.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: The health scaling continues to synergize with Solomon's core build path. The blinding component, while mostly thematic, allows Solomon a brief window of safety once he engages so that his team can catch up and capitalize.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15638_pas_zpsd3eac6b5.jpg\n**R- Judgment Day (140 sec)**: Solomon opens his Book of Judgment and begins to channel for 4 seconds, citing an oath to protect the weak and indefensible while creating a large aura of sunlight around him with a 1,000 unit diameter (slightly larger than Janna's Ultimate). This eclipse drains health from all enemies within its range and converts it into health for his allies, including himself. Enemies within the area suffer magic damage equal to 3/3.5/4% (+.5% per 100 AP) of their current health every .5 seconds while the channel is active. This heals allies based on the number of enemy champions affected by the ability, between 20/30/40 (+7.5% AP) health every .5 seconds (assuming zero enemy champions in range) and 60/90/120  (+7.5% AP) health every .5 seconds (assuming three or more enemy champions in range). Solomon can be interrupted while channeling.\nRank-ups increase damage/healing and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability was the original inspiration for Solomon’s design.  It functions both similarly but noticeably differently from a combination of Janna and Nunu’s Ultimates.  Unlike Nunu’s, the damaging component occurs over the duration of the 4 second channel, and unlike Janna’s, there is no up-front effect.  The healing received by himself and his allies is proportionate to the number of enemy champions caught in the zone of judgment, ensuring that Solomon can’t simply top off his team in between skirmishes.  The rest of Solomon’s kit is also designed to ensure that he can stand vigilant for the entire duration of the channel, including the crowd control immunity of his passive and the increasing heal from his W.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2015-01-12T16:44:21.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big problem:\n\nJanna's maximum amount of healing is 600 + 180% AP on a 120 second cooldown.\n\nYou, by contrast, heal up to 320 health every second for 4 seconds: 1280 health.

You do have to consider, though, that this ability works like Nunu's Ultimate- how often does he actually get to cast the entire thing before people just flat-out walk away from it?  It is highly unlikely that Solomon players will get to experience that \"perfect storm\" of effects where everyone gets to benefit from the full effects.\n\nI agree that the numbers are too high, but I do want to make the \"ideal\" scenario heal for more than Janna's Ultimate does.

Once again, thanks for all the notes and comments.  Greatly appreciate the level of effort you put into your review.\n\nI see your point about the Q/E combo cannibalizing a bit of their combined effectiveness.  In my head, the range of Q's knockback is a decent size smaller than the AoE range of the blind, which should alleviate some of that concern.  Still, it's quite a valid issue that I might need to think through some more.\n\nI don't think Solomon should be able to turn on his W while channeling the way that Galio can.  However, he can cast it and then immediately transition into his Ultimate.\n\nI think you misread the Passive ability, as it actually kind of already does what you suggested and does NOT heal him.  Maybe you were thinking of Uther a bit too much? ;)\n\nTaking significant damage gives him a Sivir Spell Shield, basically.  It's not quite \"untargetable\" but it does give him a much higher chance of being able to channel the full duration of his Ultimate, or at least a fair bit more.  Chaining two forms of CC back to back against Solomon is the best course of action at stopping him; something Nunu never had the luxury of.\n\n-----\n\nAs far as your questions go-\n\nTo use links, copy the URL to your clipboard and then type the words you want to turn into the hyperlink into your message.

You're absolutely right that getting 4 seconds is difficult on ult, but I also try to balance best and worst case scenarios for abilities to optimize gameplay when I think about a kit :) Hey, if the bulk of my suggestions on a kit are numbers (which are arbitrary to a point due to the dynamic nature of the game and inability to sandbox test), you're idea is in a good spot. \n\nI'll see if I can get to more champs if I find some free time :) I love looking at and coming up with suggestions for kits. My suggestions usually aren't \"I think this needs to change or the champ is inadequate,\" but rather \"Hey, this is nice, but what if...[insert angle]?\" Mostly it's me analyzing a kit in all scenarios.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-03-26T08:40:55.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey just thought I'd let you know, you are going to have to revise your lore.

Solomon's lore is obviously not something I have put much effort into yet, but \"exiled\" was definitely the wrong choice of words.  I was only referring to him as an elder who helped pass judgment on her.  He wasn't involved in the killings.  If anything, he's now on the Fields to bring her to justice as a result of the killings.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T07:35:16.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to bathe Solomon in light for a little bit longer before I give up on him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-17T18:27:45.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's entirely possible that Solomon hasn't gotten many views due to his complex title.

What about \"Final Verdict\" instead?  Or something like that?\n\nIt's intended  that Solomon stay rooted as he channels, the same way Janna does.  4 seconds is a long time, but he can still move whenever he wants; it would simply cancel the channel (just like Janna or Nunu).","replies":[]}]}]}
