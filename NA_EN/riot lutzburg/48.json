A recent video by \"Jeremy- Gaming Curious\" inspired me to publish it again, since I figured his video might attract some attention on these boards.  You can find the video I'm referencing [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqlJmpWEt04).\n\n**What’s wrong with Urgot?** {{champion:6}} \nUrgot is suffering an identity crisis, unable to decide whether he wants to be a Marksman, Tank or AD Mage.  His kit provides two conflicting strategies- be a long range sniper or jump into the middle of the enemy team and do your best Renekton impression.\n\nFrom a kit perspective, Urgot’s Passive offers too much hidden power with no counterplay opportunities, and his Ultimate, while iconic, is the biggest offender of his duality issue.\n\n**What can’t change about Urgot?**\nUrgot’s hallmark ability flow comes from his knack for locking onto targets and repeatedly chunking them down from absurdly long range.  This, above all else, must be preserved.  Changes must be handled delicately, as Urgot has a small but extremely passionate fanbase, much like Karma and Trundle.  Any changes made to his core identity may be met with significant backlash.  While many would argue that his Ultimate is equally if not more iconic, it is unfortunately the cause of one of Urgot’s biggest balance issues. \n\n**What are some solutions?**\nUrgot rides the line most closely between AD Mage/Marksman and a Tank.  The most obvious thing to do is to focus on one of these paths and eliminate the other.  This allows Urgot to have a more defined role, with power allocation all pushing him towards said role.  In this example, Urgot’s kit revolves more around sniping and positioning (think Xerath) and away from the damage-soaking melee mage he has become today.  This opens up an opportunity to create a new Champion that can better make use of his ‘switcheroo’ Ultimate as a frontline tank and initiator.\n\n\n------\n\n\n**Base stats adjusted**- lowered armor/MR/attack speed, increased AD per level/mana regen\n\n**Passive- Corrosive Bolts**: Urgot's auto attacks shred the target’s armor by 3% and his Acid Hunter Missiles shred for 6%. This effect lasts for 2 seconds, can stack up to a total of 30% and subsequent stacks refresh the effects' duration.\n**Design Philosophy**: The stacking armor shred incentivizes Urgot to repeatedly chunk down enemies with long range missiles.  This also represents a power shift in his kit, with his former passive being replaced by an effect previously held on his E.\n\n**Q: Acid Hunter**: No change.\n\n**W- Terror Capacitor**: Urgot gains a shield which absorbs 80/130/180/230/280 (+70% AP) damage for 4 seconds. While the shield is active, Urgot's other ability cooldowns are reduced by .5 seconds each time Acid Hunter hits an enemy champion. This cooldown reduction also affects Acid Hunter itself. Acid Hunter's base cooldown could potentially be increased to compensate.\n**Design Philosophy**: As a low mobility sniper, Urgot will still rely on his shield to absorb damage while setting up his E-Q-Q-Q combo.  The cooldown reduction on-hit allows Urgot to create longer strings of combos during team fights and doesn’t penalize him for using his E on a low health target and missing out on 2-3 guaranteed Q’s after that target is eliminated.\n\n**E- Noxian Corrosive Charge**: Urgot fires a corrosive charge, dealing physical damage over time and applying a 20/25/30/35/40% slow for 2.5 seconds to all targets struck.\n**Design Philosophy**: The armor shred effect has been shifted to Urgot’s new Passive.  This allows his Corrosive Charge to carry more inherent power in the form of a slow (formally on his shield).  Since the slow is so powerful and so necessary for the flow of his full combo, it makes more sense to tie it to a skillshot rather than an on-demand effect via the shield.  Furthermore, it didn’t make thematic sense for Urgot to need to turn on his shield in order to successfully pick off fleeing enemies.  If Urgot is chasing enemies down, it’s unlikely that he is taking damage and therefore the usefulness of his shield is diminished.\n\n**R- Kinetic Disruptor**: Urgot fires a paralyzing bolt at a target from moderate range, suppressing them for 1.5 seconds and dealing 100/200/300 magic damage. Urgot must remain stationary during this time but he is free to use spells and auto attacks.\n**Design Philosophy**: This new Ultimate helps create a better synergy and flow between the rest of Urgot’s kit.  The paralyzing bolt can be used to shut down tanky fighters who attempt to rush him during team fights, or pick off a fleeing enemy and land a guaranteed E as they try to run.  Depending on the general power level of this ability and the rest of his kit combined, the Disruptor could either remain a targeted ability as his current Ultimate, or become a Varus-esque skillshot which travels through enemy minions.\n\n------\n\nIf you enjoyed this rework idea, you can find over 70 original Champion Concepts in my [MEGA THREAD!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-12T04:40:05.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I see his kit is his p/q/w/e hold roughly the same power but shifted around.

I was toying with the idea of giving Urgot a way to more consistently mark targets with Corrosive Acid, but ultimately I talked myself out of it for some reason.  This was over two years ago so my memory is a little foggy on the topic.  :p\n\nThe only part of your idea I don't like is the fear, which even Riot admits was a bandaid buff to Urgot and not something I've ever considered core to his identity.  Even just changing it to a more powerful slow, like a cripple, or even a stun, would be better than the fear, I feel.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-12T04:51:14.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't think a soft cc feels right in that situation or for that power level (except maybe a silence?)

I guess of all the Champions in the League that deserve a fear in their kit, Urgot is probably at the top of the list.  I guess I'm just not personally attached to it because I haven't actually played League since Urgot received his buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-12T05:10:12.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can see Urgot using a fear, his current one is just never used though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-05-12T04:44:53.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and one more thing I'll point out is that he's losing his 15% damage reduction, so a power spike to his Ultimate was intentional, in order to compensate for all the hidden power he's losing from his old passive.","replies":[]}]}
