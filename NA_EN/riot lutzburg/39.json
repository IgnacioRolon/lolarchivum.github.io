{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-05-12T09:21:46.503+0000","title":"Ronin, the Shadow Soldier","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"**Role**: Fighter, AD Caster\n\n**Inspiration**: Direct inspiration came from [Titus, the Law of Zuan](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/vh7QH2nt-titus-the-law-of-zaun).  All credit goes to Torshun for the original concept and the primary reference image.  Please go check out their concept!\n\nAdditional inspiration came from Tracer (Overwatch).  The goal was to design a flashy, playmaking kit that revolved entirely around a Passive Ability that provided short but frequent bursts of mobility to an AD Fighter.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Ronin is a highly mobile fighter who utilizes short ranged dashes to execute a hit-and-run combat style.  His evasiveness allows him to poke enemies safely, while a limited but effective set of defenses and contextual crowd control make Ronin an excellent skirmisher.  The Shadow Soldier is designed to be flashy, so his kit was infused with multiple avenues for both mental and mechanical outplays.  This, of course, includes a reset mechanic when killing enemy Champions, as well as an “I dare you” Ability that can divide an enemy team when under pressure.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Ronin is intended to be flashy, which puts an even greater emphasis on kit flow and synergies than normal.  His futuristic and military themes might also prove to be too serious or high tech for the world of Runeterra.\n\n**Appearance**: Ronin is a somewhat bulky but nimble soldier, dressed in a futuristic power suit.  He wears a practical cape, which accentuates his flashy and highly mobile kit.  Most importantly, Ronin dual wields two powerful arm cannons.  Each cannon has a burst rifle outfitted to one end, with a type of energy-based propulsion system mounted to the other.  These cannons can be pointed behind Ronin and used as boost jets to dash across the battlefield.  He can then quickly flip the cannons back around and fire short bursts of energy bullets at his enemies.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Bjorn-Hurri-illustrations-12_zpson48ftgz.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/140603_AB_landing-659x1024_zpskazhz4tg.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/35th_zpscozbw9fj.jpg\n_Ronin unleashing a torrent of excess energy via his Endothermic Vents, knocking back enemies around him_\n\n**Lore**: Missing.\n\n**Strengths**: Excellent at kiting other melee characters, powerful hit-and-run harassment, safe poke, huge playmaking potential\n\n**Weaknesses**: Has trouble sticking to targets, limited and contextual CC, limited burst damage, high skill ceiling\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:236}}\n\n**Auto Attack**: Ronin uses slow but brutal melee strikes, attacking with the butt of his twin arm cannons.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_18320_pas_zpsbewt3bhu.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12158_pas_zps9ayuhni7.jpg\n**Passive- Boost Jets**: While any basic Ability is on cooldown, it is replaced by Boost Jets.  Activating Boost Jets causes Ronin to dash a fixed distance of 300 units in the direction of the player’s cursor, and empowers his next auto attack within 3 seconds.  This empowerment deals +50% base AD and adds a burn effect to the target, dealing minor physical damage over the next 2.5 seconds.  Boost Jets can be used independently across multiple Abilities, but only once in between casts of an individual Ability.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is what Ronin’s entire kit is built around.  It offers short bursts of limited but frequent mobility.  It’s important to remember that each basic Ability houses its own instance of Boost Jets.  In practice, this means that Ronin can cast Q/W/E to use three basic abilities, then use Q/W/E again to dash three times in a row.  However, Boost Jets cost mana just like the rest of Ronin's Abilities, meaning that players can't simply spam Boost Jets without eventually succumbing to the consequences.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7814_pas_zpsgxekikfi.jpg\n**Q- Burst Rifle (4 seconds)**: Ronin fires a line of bullets as a channeled skillshot with a 500 unit range.  This barrage lasts 1.2 seconds and deals physical damage every .1 second.  During the channel, Ronin can adjust his aim up to 45 degrees from the Ability’s point of origin.  Ronin can cancel the channel by moving or activating another Ability, and it is susceptible to interruption from crowd control effects.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is similar to Pantheon’s E, but its zone of effectiveness is a thin line, rather than a cone.  It allows Ronin to CS safely in lane, as the effect goes through targets.  It also acts as the primary harassment tool in Ronin’s standard combo- Pulse Bomb towards an enemy, Boost Jet in, Q, Boost Jet out.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5578_pas_zpsz6plsqfu.jpg\n**W- Endothermic Vents (18 seconds)**: Passive- Ronin gains an overshield each time he uses Boost Jets.  This overshield lasts for 2 seconds and absorbs (20/40/60/80/100 + 5 per level) damage.\n\nActive- While in combat, if Ronin suffers damage greater than 15% of his maximum health, he can activate his Endothermic Vents.  This causes a powerful blast of steam to shoot around him in a 300 radius aura, knocking enemies back a fixed distance and dealing physical damage that increases based on how much damage Ronin suffered before activating the Ability.\n**Design Philosophy**: The knockback can be used both as a self-peeling tool, as well as a way to strategically push squishy targets into closer proximity of Pulse Bombs that are about to explode.  The scaling damage component encourages Ronin players to endure as much punishment as possible before popping their Vents, mimicking a game of Chicken with their opponents and acting like a pseudo Execute.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10329_pas_zps1lzcgrao.jpg\n**E- Pulse Bomb (10 seconds)**: Ronin tosses a pulse bomb at a target location up to 900 units away, which explodes after 1.5 seconds and deals scaling physical damage based on an enemy’s proximity to the center of the blast.  The bomb has an explosion radius of 250 units.  If Pulse Bomb kills an enemy Champion, its cooldown is set to 1.5 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: Pulse Bomb is intended to be Ronin’s highest damage Ability.  By refreshing its cooldown on kills, players can make incredibly flashy plays, swapping between Boost Jets and Pulse Bombs multiple times in order to clean up late game team fights.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12858_pas_zpsjjqlyphj.jpg\n**R- Critical Mass (90 seconds)**: Ronin supercharges his arm cannons for the next 6/8/10 seconds.  During this time, Boost Jet’s range is increased by 150 units.  In addition, Ronin gains 30/40/50% attack speed and the ability to auto attack from 450 range.\n**Design Philosophy**: It was important to both mechanically and thematically tie Ronin’s Ultimate back to his Passive, which was the primary inspiration from which the rest of his kit was built around. This turns Ronin into an even more agile, evasive skirmisher, exemplifying his core mechanics and granting him the ability to make flashy plays.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my unique concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2016-05-15T21:37:24.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not much for me to say about this class, it's very cool.

Congrats to Torshun for making the original! That concept art looks crazy awesome!\n\nHey Jazz!  Your response is everything I've come to expect and appreciate from you.  Thoughts below-\n\nPassive- Yeah, a scaling mana cost could work.  Giving Ronin the Kassadin treatment might be overkill but it should definitely be a tool in the toolbox to potentially use if needed.\n\nW- Yep, an internal cooldown might be necessary.  I'm hoping that merely refreshing the shield with subsequent boosts and enticing the player with an empowered auto attack will keep Ronins from spamming this too much.  It's a difficult balancing act, for sure.\n\nE- Love the idea for improving E, which is something that Lonely Flame has also expressed interest in.  I'll try to incorporate this into the ability somehow!\n\nR- Kayle goes from 125 melee range to 525 ranged when activating her E, so this is considerably shorter than that.  Mostly because, as you know, Ronin should be using Boost Jets to get in and out of position as often as possible.\n\nAnd yes, I'm not a personal fan of PLAYING champions like Ronin, but I can't help but admire players who know how to push them to their limits and exploit all their flashy tricks to great success.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2019-08-30T23:24:14.500+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy smokes you're actually a rioter now!!

I'd recommend that upon activation of Q, it would go on cooldown (much like the new Miss Fortune W). Thus, Ronin would have immediate access to at least one boost as his Q will for sure be on cooldown. However, you would need to increase the cooldown of the ability by at least 3-4 seconds as the channel lasts for a while (if you didn't, you'd almost always have Q up)\n\nAgain, just suggestions. I think Lonely Flame makes a good point though, and this may be a happy medium?

I tried my best to pay as much respect and credit to your work as I could.  The Boost concept was just so immediately intriguing to me that I had to utilize it somehow.  The abilities you mention are certainly good and I don't want to take that away from you.  It's just that they didn't fit with the mechanics and themes that I thought your kit was going towards based off of the Passive.  Stacking health to deal damage is obviously more of a tank trait, and a high mobility soldier with twin rifles just didn't seem to gel.","replies":[{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2016-05-13T00:35:04.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel where you coming from.

I like the idea of not being completely stranded when your spells are on cool down. That said, it feels like a variation on Lee Sin's kit, albeit a bit striped back (ie rather than each ability having its own secondary active, they all share the same ability). This isn't necessarily bad, but just worth noting.\n\n> **Q- Burst Rifle (4 seconds)**: Ronin fires a line of bullets as a channeled skillshot with a 500 unit range.

It also acts as the primary harassment tool in Ronin&amp;rsquo;s standard combo- Pulse Bomb towards an enemy, Boost Jet in, Q, Boost Jet out.\n\nVery simple and straight forward. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Just sort of middle ground. See if you can come up with a little extra to this some how. Maybe if you have your shield active something different happens? I dunno.\n\n> **W- Endothermic Vents (18 seconds)**: Passive- Ronin gains an overshield each time he uses Boost Jets.

The scaling damage component encourages Ronin players to endure as much punishment as possible before popping their Vents, mimicking a game of Chicken with their opponents and acting like a pseudo Execute.\n\nI actually like this idea quite a bit, but feel it could be improved. For the passive, maybe have it so the effect could stack in either strength, duration or both. That way if you quickly cast your kit, you can follow it up with your passive on your Q W and E for a beasty shield.\n\nFor his active, clarify the condition of the 15%. It is 15% off one ability? Or 15% in the last X seconds?\n\n> **E- Pulse Bomb (10 seconds)**: Ronin tosses a pulse bomb at a target location up to 900 units away, which explodes after 1.5 seconds and deals scaling physical damage based on an enemy&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the center of the blast.  The bomb has an explosion radius of 250 units.

I do like the reset on kill aspect and the interaction that has with his passive is actually really well thought out. Other than that, again consider how you could make this a little more special.\n\n> **R- Critical Mass (90 seconds)**: Ronin supercharges his arm cannons for the next 6/8/10 seconds.  During this time, Boost Jet&amp;rsquo;s range is increased by 150 units.  In addition, Ronin gains 30/40/50% attack speed and the ability to auto attack from 450 range.\n> **Design Philosophy**: It was important to both mechanically and thematically tie Ronin&amp;rsquo;s Ultimate back to his Passive, which was the primary inspiration from which the rest of his kit was built around. This turns Ronin into an even more agile, evasive skirmisher, exemplifying his core mechanics and granting him the ability to make flashy plays.\n\nSeems alright, but again very simple. I would actually much rather prefer increased cooldown on his abilities in some way rather than the attack speed buff. His kit is around utilizing the dash from his passive, and you want to be able to spam that as much as possible. Something extreme like \"Ronin's cooldowns are reduced by 50% for the duration\".\n\nOverall, there are some cool ideas here, and I like how you have worked this into your own from the original. My advice would be to think about your minigame. Riot have put a strong emphasis on each champ having some sort of 'minigame' now, Sol has his orbit, Jihn counts to 4, Illaoi has her tentacles and so on. Even the reworked champs get something minor added. My suggestion would be using the 'Booster Jets' as yours. The shield is cool, try to push that more. Maybe if you Booster Jet off your Q it could provide a damage buff instead of a shield, giving you the choice of damage over defense. Managing your abilities and getting the best you can from your Boosts. I dunno I'm just spit balling. Again these are my opinions so they don't need to mean a thing haha. Nice work dude, look forward to seeing this develop.","replies":[{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2016-05-15T06:34:05.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna 2nd the motion of having the Shield on (W)'s passive being able to stack.

Similar to Riven's empowered auto attack between abilities.  if you spam all your mobility at once with Riven, you lose out on optimal DPS.  I think the same idea can be applied to Ronin.  Boost, absorb a little damage, boost again, absorb a little damage.","replies":[{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2016-05-19T01:56:36.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see where you coming from","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-05-18T02:32:55.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lonely Flame,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=kaZhzn6E,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2016-05-14T19:39:46.533+0000)\n>\n> Hey dude! Before I get started I want to say that the comments I make are purely my opinion, and that at the end of the day they&#x27;re your champ and not my champ, so make them however you want :)\n> \n> This is a cool idea for a passive. I like the idea of not being completely stranded when your spells are on cool down. That said, it feels like a variation on Lee Sin&#x27;s kit, albeit a bit striped back (ie rather than each ability having its own secondary active, they all share the same ability). This isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but just worth noting.\n> \n> Very simple and straight forward. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Just sort of middle ground. See if you can come up with a little extra to this some how. Maybe if you have your shield active something different happens? I dunno.\n> \n> I actually like this idea quite a bit, but feel it could be improved. For the passive, maybe have it so the effect could stack in either strength, duration or both. That way if you quickly cast your kit, you can follow it up with your passive on your Q W and E for a beasty shield.\n> \n> For his active, clarify the condition of the 15%. It is 15% off one ability? Or 15% in the last X seconds?\n> \n> Again, the ability itself is pretty straight forward. I do like the reset on kill aspect and the interaction that has with his passive is actually really well thought out. Other than that, again consider how you could make this a little more special.\n> \n> Seems alright, but again very simple. I would actually much rather prefer increased cooldown on his abilities in some way rather than the attack speed buff. His kit is around utilizing the dash from his passive, and you want to be able to spam that as much as possible. Something extreme like &quot;Ronin&#x27;s cooldowns are reduced by 50% for the duration&quot;.\n> \n> Overall, there are some cool ideas here, and I like how you have worked this into your own from the original. My advice would be to think about your minigame. Riot have put a strong emphasis on each champ having some sort of &#x27;minigame&#x27; now, Sol has his orbit, Jihn counts to 4, Illaoi has her tentacles and so on. Even the reworked champs get something minor added. My suggestion would be using the &#x27;Booster Jets&#x27; as yours. The shield is cool, try to push that more. Maybe if you Booster Jet off your Q it could provide a damage buff instead of a shield, giving you the choice of damage over defense. Managing your abilities and getting the best you can from your Boosts. I dunno I&#x27;m just spit balling. Again these are my opinions so they don&#x27;t need to mean a thing haha. Nice work dude, look forward to seeing this develop.\n\nHey Flame, thanks so much for the detailed and thoughtful feedback.  You make some good points, but also raise some issues that don't concern me as much as they seem to concern you.  For instance-\n\nThe Q- I disagree that it's too straight forward or needs some jazzing up.  It's on a short cooldown and is meant to be somewhat spammed.  It already has the added component of the player being able to pivot Ronin while he's channeling, which I believe is already a never-before-seen mechanic in League (unless you want to count Rumble's Flamespitter, but his movement isn't inhibited at all).\n\nThe W- I'm fine with the duration of the shield refreshing upon multiple uses.  As someone pointed out earlier, a ~200 HP shield every 2.4 seconds with some CDR is already pretty insane... not too keen on adding even more power to such a brainless and \"free\" passive component to this ability.  I'll clarify that the only requirement for the Active component is that Ronin suffers 15% of his max health in a single instance of being in combat.  If he tanks a baby wolf for 45 seconds at level 18, it'll activate.  If he gets taken to 1% HP in a single ability, that'll trigger it, too.\n\nThe E- This is probably the only ability that I agree with you regarding it getting spiced up somehow.  Could possibly deal bonus damage to towers?\n\nThe R- I like the direction you're taking this on principle (gaining access to something \"extreme\" for a limited window).  I just feel that raw attack speed, combined with becoming the equivalent of a marksman, combined with increased mobility, is already pretty amaze-balls.  I think it's obvious that Ronin will be a champ who relies heavily on CDR in his most effective builds... I was kind of using the need to build CDR as a gating mechanism that prevents players from going full AD and becoming absolute monsters when they scale up and pop R.\n\nI definitely agree with your observation about mini-games, but I'm also not sure if every Champion they release from here on out really needs one.  I guess you could say the new Champion's \"worked ground\" and wall-riding are both mini games.  I just think that having 7 abilities and an on-hit passive all firing on short cooldowns with a strong emphasis on smart positioning and hyper mobility IS sort of the mini-game.  Ronin is all about jukes, hit-and-runs, knowing when to duck in and dive out... that's a lot to keep track of.  Rock Girl basically stands there with nothing to do except fling mid-range spells at you, so giving her something more dynamic and interactive to experience during a game becomes more important.\n\nAgain, thank you for all the constructive feedback and ideas.  I hope my counters to some of your suggestions don't come across as hostile or defensive.  I spent a significant amount of time thinking them all through and really took to heart everything you said.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2016-05-18T06:51:41.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=kaZhzn6E,comment-id=000b0001,timestamp=2016-05-18T02:32:55.225+0000)\n> The Q- I disagree that it&#x27;s too straight forward or needs some jazzing up.

He's whole thing is dashing after using an ability, so why does he have an ability that roots him for a few seconds?\nAnd there's quite a few champs who can move while channeling. Off the top of my head there's Corki and Vel'Koz.\n\n> The W- I&#x27;m fine with the duration of the shield refreshing upon multiple uses.

This was more of a 'consider trying this' kind of comment but maybe didn't come across that way haha.\n\n> The E- This is probably the only ability that I agree with you regarding it getting spiced up somehow.  Could possibly deal bonus damage to towers?\n\nMmm I dunno about that. He doesn't really seem like an tower taker. Perhaps maybe some sort of armour shred? Maybe the more people it hits can have some sort of effect (not necessarily armour shred but something)? Or perhaps something with cooldown?\n\n> The R- I like the direction you&#x27;re taking this on principle (gaining access to something &quot;extreme&quot; for a limited window).

I was kind of using the need to build CDR as a gating mechanism that prevents players from going full AD and becoming absolute monsters when they scale up and pop R.\n\nThen perhaps, kind of like how Kog'Maw can increase his max attack speed cap, Ronin could increase his max cooldown cap for a few seconds? The max is 40% at the moment, so maybe something like 50%/55%/60%? Really drive home the spam of his kit. You could kind of balance it out that each cast of the ability adds additional cost to cast (kind of like he's moving so fast it's taking a toll on him). I dunno just going a little bit wild here.\n\n> I definitely agree with your observation about mini-games, but I&#x27;m also not sure if every Champion they release from here on out really needs one.

I really do appreciate it.\n\nIf you didn't already see, I posted earlier referring to the shield refreshing as a parallel to {{champion:92}}'s empowered auto attacks in between ability casts.  That might help get my core idea across better.\n\nAs far as the rooted channel, I actually find that juxtaposition quite cool, and not counter-intuitive to his flighty nature.  The idea being that the player needs to effectively abuse their mobility to put themselves into positions where they CAN safely plant themselves down and shoot for a second.  Being able to both identify and then execute on these positioning opportunities is what will separate good Ronin players from great ones.\n\nI will think on the E for a while and let you know what I come up with.  :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-05-14T05:49:15.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rooting for CLG tonight!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-05-13T23:21:46.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's time for Ronin to come out from the shadows of the second page.  >_>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2016-05-13T05:24:30.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This concept is really strong.

A CDR build and quick reflexes could create some pretty unhealthy gameplay patterns. Q's base CD could be raised to compensate, or it could be set at a fixed cooldown. Or the shield effect could be reduced somehow. Or a combination of two of these things!
