{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T23:29:03.495+0000","title":"Leo, the Star of Piltover","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":15,"down_votes":7,"body":"**Role**: Marksman\n\n**Inspiration**: The intent here was to create a pretentious, spoiled celebrity archetype.  My first thought was, of course, to make him an AD Carry.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Leo is a mobility and ability-based marksman with several ways to disengage from enemies. Leo has a lot of timing and prioritizing in his kit that he can take advantage of based on his current situation. As such, Leo has a relatively high skill ceiling.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate. Leo may overlap too heavily with Draven, and his theme in general may prove too cheeky or hammy. His kit, however, is quite compelling and unique.\n\n**Appearance**: A suave celebrity type, with sunglasses and a cape.  Tall, dark and handsome, but clearly ignorant about how good he's really got it.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/94c871bbe06500d6573deaf397b8e3b0_zps6wzt1sgj.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Captain_Gordon_zpsbz0zxn9y.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/svc-m-bison_zpsr9ell19n.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/V.Joe_zpsf2wekgkg.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Viewtiful.Joe.full.283248_zpsslfs4cys.jpg\n*Leo entering bullet time and dodging the blast caused by his Ultimate, \"Explosion Scene.\"*\n\n**Lore**: Missing\n\n**Strengths**: Max damage steroid, multiple escapes/disengages, lane sustain, decent wave clear and AoE damage.\n\n**Weaknesses**: Steroid, sustain and AoE potential are all tied to a single ability with long cooldown (must choose how to best utilize its effects), high skill ceiling, relatively short range for a carry\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:67}} {{champion:41}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A single shot with finesse fired from his hextech pistol at 500 range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16068_btn_zps1pyhixgu.jpg\n**Passive- Feelin’ Lucky**: When taken below 25% health, Leo gains 40% chance to critically strike with his auto attacks for the next 3 seconds. This effect cannot occur more than once every 60 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: Leo is an action star through and through, and nothing says action star like a last-minute turnaround from the brink of death.  This ability lets Leo take his opponents down with him, similar to Kog’Maw or Zyra, with the bonus of not actually having to die first in order to pull off the comeback.  The power of this ability, supplemented with the rest of his kit, relegates it to a one-time use, long cooldown passive that has no bearing on gameplay for a large majority of the game.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10896_pas_zpspjib0m23.jpg\n**Q- Lock ‘n Load (7 seconds)**: Leo’s next auto attack deals bonus physical damage and his attack timer is reset. If the target is under the effect of Spotlight, the round explodes, dealing AoE physical damage upon impact. The single target component of this ability applies on-hit effects.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage done.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a standard physical damage ability similar to Double-Up or Parrrley and an excellent trading tool in the laning phase of the game.  The interaction with Spotlight allows Leo some AoE and wave-clearing potential at the expense of healing or damage amplification.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_2231_btn_zpscnwblmmn.jpg\n**W- Stunt Double (12 seconds)**: A stunt double stands in place while Leo becomes stealthed and does a combat roll towards the player’s cursor before unstealthing at his new position (this takes roughly .3 seconds). Additionally, his next basic attack deals bonus physical damage and slows the target by 50% for 1 second. The stunt double remains for 2 seconds before vanishing, taking realistic damage from enemies similar to a LeBlanc or Wukong clone.  After 2 seconds, the stunt double will perform a flashy maneuver before vanishing, such as putting on shades, running his hands through his hair, casually saluting the air, firing a shot into the air, or flipping his hair back charismatically.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase bonus damage on next attack.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is similar to Vayne’s Final Hour and Tumble.  The bonus damage is very negligible, as the primary function of the ability is positioning, disengage and kiting.  This ability also has very strong theming to the ‘movie star’ archetype.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7646_btn_zpsfactm54k.jpg\n**E- Spotlight (16 seconds)**: Leo casts a spotlight from the sky down onto a target location that lasts for 6 seconds. Enemies who stand in the light take 5/7.5/10/12.5/15% bonus damage from Leo’s basic attacks. Additionally, Leo is healed over time when standing in the spotlight.  The size of the spotlight is comparable to Anivia’s Ultimate.\nRank-ups increase damage modifier and increase heal amount to 15/25/35/45/60 health per second.\nHidden Passive: If Leo taunts while under the effects of Spotlight, the ability lasts for one additional second, the intensity of the light increases and a crowd cheers in the background.\n**Design Philosophy**: Spotlight is a versatile ability that allows Leo a lot of options and power.  The key is that this ability must be timed and placed properly to capitalize on its layers of potential functionality.  The damage amplification component is what Leo uses to become a hyper carry late game, and works most optimally when paired with hard crowd control from his allies.  The healing component can be used to soften the blows from bruisers or fighters who lock him down and force him to stand and fight.  It can also be used from a distance, but this creates counterplay opportunities for opponents to zone him out of his own spotlight.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6588_btn_zpsmwipx68a.jpg\n**R- Explosion Scene (140 seconds)**: Leo summons a massive bomb at his current location that counts down from 3 seconds (in game time is actually closer to 1.75 seconds, as the 3-2-1 is primarily used for effect). The radius around the explosive acts as a 70% slow to all enemies around it, like a bullet time effect. Following the countdown it detonates, dealing physical damage. A time distortion and heartbeat sound accompany the ability.  Leo can move freely once the explosive has been set, but will automatically combat roll away from the blast if it detonates while he is still in range.  If this happens, his stunt double dies in the explosion in a dramatic, comedic fashion.\nHidden Passive: Explosion Scene does 10 bonus damage if Leo is facing away from the explosion at the time of detonation, because cool guys don't look at explosions.  (Thanks SargontheDeadly for this awesome suggestion!)\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage done to 225/350/475 +70% AD.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Leo’s primary disengage tool and dive deterrent.  This ability immediately grinds aggressors to a halt and allows Leo a chance to position around them with Stunt Double while they remain slowed.  The damage from the ability should also not be ignored.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T00:32:56.901+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the first image **IS** an incredibly badass picture of Captain Falcon.\n\nDeal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"LordTekron","date":"2015-03-12T12:15:46.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=z0IdpUyA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-11T00:32:56.901+0000)\n>\n> Yes, the first image **IS** an incredibly badass picture of Captain Falcon.\n> \n> Deal with it.\n\n[Leo~~'s Stunt Double~~ legit leaked trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkP_sJty7EY)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-12T17:56:56.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordTekron,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=z0IdpUyA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-12T12:15:46.243+0000)\n>\n> [Leo~~'s Stunt Double~~ legit leaked trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkP_sJty7EY)\n\nHahahaha!\n\nPhreak- \"Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight, featuring Leo!\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Qahnaarin","date":"2015-03-12T12:43:43.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the ulti needs to deal bonus damage if he is moving away from it when it detonates, 'cuz cool guys don't look at explosions.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-12T17:57:23.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SargonTheDeadly,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=z0IdpUyA,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-03-12T12:43:43.316+0000)\n>\n> the ulti needs to deal bonus damage if he is moving away from it when it detonates, 'cuz cool guys don't look at explosions.\n\nHaha, yes!

Still, having even one ability that is so similar is definitely a ding against this concept as a whole.

That said, I wanted to give Leo some distinct and obvious weaknesses, while also opening up counterplay and team synergy.  As a result, his kit really works best to kite away from enemies but he has trouble initiating or making plays on his own.  His spotlight in particular was designed to piggyback off of things like Leona lockdown, Jarv Cataclysms, etc.\n\nThat said I LOVE your idea to mind game opponents with Spotlight and Stunt Double.  Enemies might see him standing there and healing and they could overextend or commit resources to diving him, only for him to appear under his tower a moment later, or even on the enemy's flank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KillerFromDark","date":"2015-03-12T21:07:42.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven is already kinda pretentious and spoiled celebrity no?{{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-12T23:20:37.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KillerFromDark,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=z0IdpUyA,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-03-12T21:07:42.174+0000)\n>\n> Draven is already kinda pretentious and spoiled celebrity no?{{champion:119}}\n\nYes he is, which I discuss briefly in the Risk Analysis section.  After designing Leo, the similarities were hard to ignore but the kit that spawned out of the archetype was too compelling to scrap.  As it stands, though, I doubt Leo could ever exist as he is in a world that already has Draven.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2015-03-11T05:28:39.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its Captain Falcon, Mr Bison and that Capcom guy lol not a new champ","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T05:30:35.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Manolishill,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=z0IdpUyA,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-03-11T05:28:39.385+0000)\n>\n> Its Captain Falcon, Mr Bison and that Capcom guy lol not a new champ\n\nUh, you do know what reference images are, right?
