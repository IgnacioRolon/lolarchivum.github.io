{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T00:06:00.210+0000","title":"Galahad, the Storm Knight","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage\n\n**Inspiration**: I originally had ideas for kits that borrowed from Karma's ability-augmenting ultimate, Jarvan IV's flag interaction, and Anivia's frostbite->E combo.  These were all separate inspirations that eventually ended up coming together into one cohesive kit.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Galahad is a melee oriented mage who relies on powerful stuns and the back-up of his allies to stay safe in battle.  The core of his kit revolves around charging up his sword in order to augment one of his basic abilities via his Ultimate, which has no cooldown otherwise.  Galahad has a lot of inherent power baked into his kit, which is tempered by his unsafe laning phase, mana reliance and lack of mobility.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Galahad is possibly a little tired in terms of tropes and themes, which is really his main weakness in my mind.  His kit is somewhat complicated when all of the moving parts are working together, but overall provides great synergy and easily identifiable and exploitable strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Appearance**: Galahad is a classic knight archetype with an emphasis on his ornate and metallic armor.  He wields a two handed sword called the Conduction Blade.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/7cd09f232f5110_full_zpsuch5ljix.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/d14e1da7cc15a14a99706c027123d685_zpskdojlujb.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/lightning_knight_by_victorgarciapq-d7g7wl4_zpsuxj60wa8.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/20678-230026322_zpsmhyvehil.png\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/StormKnight.14203127_std_zpsg0fameqj.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Elemental_Blade__Lightning_by_Unkn0wnfear_zpsxj9kf9xd.jpg\n\n**Lore**: *Galahad is a proud member of the Storm Knights, a troupe of skilled noblemen who have sworn their allegiance to a small city-state in Ionia.  This region in the mountainous foothills rests atop a massive, metallic gem that stretches high into the sky.  Heavy storms frequent the area and lightning oftentimes strikes the strange stone, filling it with electrified energy that spreads across the town like a shockwave.  Having grown up in this area for centuries, the townsfolk have adapted and even learned to harness these powerful forces of nature.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/the_castle_of_storm_by_vihola-d3eympb_zps8orednk7.png\n\n*Galahad trained his entire life for the chance to serve his people, and considers his position a resolute honor that fills him with pride and energy.  He spent many long days training with his twin brother, Gael, who also aimed to serve his people.  The two had a fierce but friendly rivalry, and they constantly pushed each other to do better than their counterpart in every challenge and trial they faced together.*\n\n*The Storm Knights are well versed in the art of hand-to-hand combat, primarily with their swords and rapiers, and Galahad is no different.  Like his brethren, Galahad fights with poise, elegance, fluidity and cunning.  His sword strikes are as fast as lightning and their damage as powerful as thunder.  He would gladly give his life for his King and for his fellow Storm Knights without a second thought.  His life is to serve and to protect; a tradition not honored so fiercely in many other regions of Runeterra.*\n\n*When Galahad was summoned by the Council to participate in the League of Legends, he took the call to action with humility and unrestrained respect.  With the blessing of his King and his fellow Storm Knights, Galahad accepted the call and was inducted into the pantheons of legends shortly thereafter.  It was hard to say goodbye to his brother Gael, but he hoped that they would someday meet again on the Fields of Justice.  Now, on behalf of his brother and representing his people, Galahad strikes with restraint, focus and honor; the touchstones of the Storm Knights.*\n\n**Love Interest**: *Not even the noble Galahad can  resist the temptations of love, and he has his eyes set on Janna, the Storm's Fury.  While her title is a tad concerning and her reputation as a seductress and \"tease\" have reached his ear many times, Galahad hopes that the chivalry and earnest interest of a Storm Knight might just be enough to sway her into calling him her \"knight in lightning armor.\"  He knows that his brother Gael is also after the heart of Janna, further fueling their lifelong rivalry both on and off the Fields of Justice.*\n\n**Strengths**: Strong poke and targeted abilities, reliable slow and mid-range AoE stun, consistent damage threat\n\n**Weaknesses**: Mana-reliant, melee auto attacks, no mobility tools or gap closers, Ultimate is tied to aggressive play and casting spells constantly\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:43}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:34}}\n\n**Auto Attack**: Galahad slashes with his knight’s sword in melee range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10716_pas_zpspyylyfw2.jpg\n**Passive- Conduction Blade**: Galahad's auto attacks deal bonus magic damage which scales with his level and 20% of his AP.  In addition, Galahad stores an Electrical Charge within his blade every time he uses a basic ability and after every 6th auto attack (attacking enemy champions counts as 2 auto attacks).  Electrical Charges are used to power his Ultimate, Static Overload.\n**Design Philosophy**: A majority of Galahad’s kit and theme come from his Conduction Blade, so it makes thematic and mechanical sense to tie his passive to it.  As a melee mage who has trouble last hitting, the bonus damage  allows him to effectively farm and also win extended trades against more AD-oriented bruisers and divers.  Finally, allowing Galahad to build up charges by auto attacking incentivizes the player to get into the middle of the action.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_680_btn_zps5gqc65he.jpg\n**Q- Lightning Wave (5-9 seconds)**: Galahad fires a bolt of lightning in a line, dealing magic damage to all enemies in its path. The range of this ability can be adjusted by the summoner, similar to Olaf's Undertow. The longer the range of the cast, the longer its cooldown becomes.  The max range of this ability is 750 units.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability offers a level of customization not often seen in the game.  variable cooldown of the ability incentivizes Galahad to use it in close quarters, where he can also auto attack and more reliably set up his full combo.  Lightning Wave can also be used as a siege, poke or last hitting spell, but doing so comes with the consequence of more downtime between spell casts.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17767_pas_zpsqvnd1tnh.jpg\n**W- Relentless Storm (9 seconds)**: Galahad summons a rainstorm at a target location up to 900 units away, which deals minor magic damage over time and creates powerful gusts of wind, slowing enemies within it by 15/18/22/26/30%.  This storm is roughly 1/2 the size of Anivia’s Ultimate and lasts for 4 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage and slow amount, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: With no gap closer or mobility tools, Relentless Storm gives Galahad a way to pin down his targets to better aim his Lightning Rod/Lightning Wave combo.  Casting it on himself also provides him a method of kiting away from other melee threats.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6411_pas_zpsp6dklgex.jpg\n**E- Lightning Rod (10 seconds)**: Galahad targets an enemy and impales them with his Conduction Blade from up to 600 range, dealing magic damage and granting vision of the target for 4 seconds. If this target is then struck by Lightning Wave or Thunderous Maelstrom, they emanate an aura that deals additional magic damage, stunning the target and all other targets within range of the aura.\nRank-ups increase damage, lower cooldown and increase stun duration to 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is inspired by the interaction between Jarvan’s polearm and his flag.  As a short ranged mage, this targeted ability makes trading with Galahad and attempting to abuse his short range a dangerous proposition.  By stunning his impaled target, he can close the gap and initiate Electrically Charged auto attacks in melee range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16096_pas_zpstcjvaijk.jpg\n**R- Static Overload (variable cooldown)**: Galahad imbues his next basic ability with an additional effect, which costs 20/18/15 Electrical Charges to cast.\nRank-ups increase damage done for all augmented abilities and lower the number of charges needed.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10338_pas_zpspkr9tyuy.jpg\n**RQ- Lightning Wave** becomes **Chain Lightning**,  which arcs to all nearby enemy champions once reaching the end of its cast range, dealing 175/350/525 +40% AP magic damage to each enemy champion struck.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13935_btn_zpskji6gsyl.jpg\n**RW- Relentless Storm** becomes **Thunderous Maelstrom**, which increases the size of the storm considerably (roughly 1.25x the size of Anivia's Ultimate) and causes lightning bolts to periodically spark across the area, dealing bonus magic damage.  While within the effects of Thunderous Maelstrom, Galahad’s suit of armor becomes infused with electrical currents, increasing his armor and magic resistances by 40/70/100.  This ability can also proc Lightning Rod's stun, even if Thunderous Maelstrom is cast first.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5595_btn_zpstvghjgib.jpg\n**RE- Lightning Rod** becomes **Pillar of Light**, which summons a massive focused lightning bolt at a target location, similar to Veigar's nuke. This bolt stuns all affected enemies for 1.5 seconds while also dealing 225/400/550 +60% AP magic damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: Thematically, Galahad is collecting static electricity before unleashing the charge through one of his other abilities.  Mechanically, Chain Lightning creates a range-dependent burst of AoE damage and synergizes with the adjustable cast range of Lightning Wave.  Thunderous Maelstrom provides much-needed defensive stats for a melee mage and creates a second way to interact with Lightning Rod.  Pillar of Light acts as a massive orbital nuke which is best used after initial crowd control and lockdowns have been used by Galahad’s allies.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)\n\nIf you'd like to see a cool twist on Galahad, check out [Gael, the Keeper of the Tower](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/zGURZERq-gael-the-keeper-of-the-tower), designed by SpectralWraithX!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2015-03-17T20:35:01.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lutzburg,\n\nThere's some really cool stuff in this concept.

It makes sense that you would find yourself drawn to the electrifying personality of \"The Storm Knight.\"  (Mwahaha, I can play that game, too.  :p )\n\nI think for Galahad, the original inspiration was to develop a \"Knights of the Round Table\" theme.  His name is even a direct reference to one such knight.  As a result, I think themes such as chivalry, formality and comradary can all be played up here.  I think of Garen as this hulking, larger-than-life leader who calls the shots and takes the brunt of whatever opposes him straight on.  By comparison, Galahad should be used to fighting back to back with his fellow knight in the trenches of combat, using finesse and cunning strategies not dissimilar from a character like {{champion:114}} \n\nThis is one of the reasons why I encouraged another creator who provided feedback, SpectralWraithX, to publish their own kit inspired by Galahad.  I really like the idea of Galahad being part of a troupe or division of Storm Knights, as a completely separate entity from Demacia.  Perhaps somewhere in the mountains, near the home of the Ursine and {{champion:106}} , the Storm Knights can be found.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DEN TEL0S","date":"2015-03-16T04:46:16.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wan't to see a lance.

Up until very recently, his E actually was more of a lightning rod that he planted into the ground.  However, I thought this made him TOO similar to Jarvan and I wanted to promote his niche as a melee mage, so I changed it to a mid-range targeted ability instead.\n\nOverall I think this is a great kit that can stand on its own.  I like it but for different reasons than Galahad's current kit.  Honestly I think you should publish this kit and label it as a spin-off of my own.

I think a better alternative would be to map the range to a variable cooldown instead.  I want Galahad to feel incentivized and rewarded for getting into the mix of things, and having an improved or more reusable damage source for being in close range makes sense to me.\n\nI don't see how you find his W useless, as it's an AoE slow from range which helps him set up his \"needlessly complex\" combos.  I also don't see how a Jarvan'esque E/Q combo is needlessly complex when it's one of the more satisfying and popular combos in the game.  \"Flag and Drag\" gets used constantly as an endearing and universally understood mechanic.  Brand has similar functionality by synergizing two spells together.  It's odd to me that you find spell synergy and kit flow to be overly complicated ideas, when these concepts are so vital to creating satisfying champions (See Morgana or Leona for prime examples of kit synergy and flow).\n\nI also don't think you're on point with any of your criticisms after that, either.  He's not an assassin and isn't meant to be, he has an AoE slow and single target stun with the potential to become an AoE stun.  He can farm the same way that Rumble or Kassadin can and there are tools in place to make this easier for him, which are clearly defined but come at the expense of other things.\n\nI also have no idea where you're coming from in terms of \"thinking of everything from the point of a character in a story.\"  This is incredibly off-base.  There is a giant \"Missing\" blurb right next to his lore and I specifically mention his lack of personal identity in the Weaknesses section near the top.  I specifically explained the mechanical foundation of Galahad in the Inspiration section, as well.  I wanted to create an AP champion that used Jarvan's E/Q combo and I wanted to pair it with a charging ult mechanic, which has been seen before in Karma, Heimerdinger and a few others to a lesser extent.  These are not ridiculously complex systems and are in fact ones that the player base has already learned and accepted as part of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-03-16T13:22:05.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I just looked at some other things you might want to adjust. In particular, the range of his q. I know he's supposed  to be a poke champion but is he supposed to be extreme long range like xerath or more mid range like viktor? Viktor's siphon power has a range of 600, his gravity field has a range of 700 and his death ray has a range of 525. Also Viktor's ult cast range is 700. It kinda sucks I know but you'll definitely have to lower the range of his q otherwise he just turns into a shorter range xerath. The range of his e is acceptable, because hey, mid range mage. Jarvan's flag has a range of 800. If he's supposed to be mid ranged than I would also change the cast range of his w to about 625, to be similar to Anivia's ult. If he's supposed to be long ranged than ignore everything I have just said lol. Although you said his q was similar to undertow. Undertow has a range of 1000. In which case, his q would be the long range poke that can be dodged and his other spells would be the mid ranged. Sheesh, I'm confusing myself with all this range talk lol. Thoughts? I honestly think it would probably be good to bring the range of the q and w down a bit though. Or would it be better to not? If people just sit there poking with q at max range they would run out of mana in 3 casts at lvl 1. Probably make the max range of q about 800 and bring the w down to 625? Once again, the final decision is up to you. Just giving you some range comparisons of other ranged people. Another thought, thunderous maelstrom sounds a little too much like Kennen's ultimate which is Slicing maelstrom. An alternate name would be Raging Tempest? Also, was just watching the old xerath champion spotlight before the rework. Your q and e are almost exactly the same. Same combo as well. E, and any other damaging spell for stun. You might have to make a different e effect. And maybe change the entire dynamic of your q and e. Maybe make your q a single target projectile that when it comes it contact with the lightning rod, charges it causing aoe damage. It can also be used for last hitting and harrass, although not through minions anymore. If the rod is placed in aoe effect of w and q is also activated than causes the storm to create electrifying arcs throughout the storm. The rod stays in place for 4 seconds, in which he is unable to use his basic attacks (after all, his sword is acting as a lightning rod). I dunno.

I was running a marathon tonight in uploading about a dozen different concepts in a single night, and Galahad required a lot of last-minute changes that I didn't get to think on or vet fully.  His balance took a hit as a result so I'm glad you guys are calling me out on it.\n\nI'll make some number adjustments before I go to bed tonight.  :)\n\nP.S.

Based on your recommendations and points of criticism, as well as Spectral's below, I've made the following changes:\n\n1- Galahad's Passive has been completely reworked.  The bonus damage on auto attack is now static and scales with level and AP.  Bonus Electrical Charges are now stored after 6 auto attacks (3 against champions), incentivizing Galahad to get into the middle of the action.\n\n2- Min/Max mana costs for Lightning Wave have been added, as well as max range, for clarity's sake.\n\n3- The size of Relentless Storm has been decreased dramatically, as has its slow amount.\n\n4- All damage on Galahad's empowered Ultimate spells have been reduced.  AP ratios have also been added.\n\n5- Thunderous Maelstrom's size is now listed as just slightly larger than Anivia's Ultimate.\n\n6- The shield of Thunderous Maelstrom has been removed, but the resistances it provides have been slightly increased to compensate.","replies":[]}]}]}
