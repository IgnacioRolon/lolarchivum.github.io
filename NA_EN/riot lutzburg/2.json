This is something I've been wanting to do for a long time, and I finally got around to building it.  Using an awesome tool on a website called Last Gasp, I've created a **[Random Champion and Ability Generator](http://lutzburg.blogspot.com/2014/06/blog-post.html)**!\n\n**Why Did You Make this?**: I think this is a great way to challenge ourselves as creators and designers, and it also gives us a very specific set of parameters in which to focus our ideas. It should also allow us to more freely and easily stumble upon novel, unique new mechanics, even if we only do so by accident.\n\n**How It Works**: Clicking that link will take you to a hastily thrown together blog, which has a javascript link that loads up the Generator. Every time you click the link, it will randomly choose from a huge list of options from seven different categories. I've tried to account for as much stuff as possible, with an emphasis on mashing up various mechanics in the game. Some of the categories have \"weights\" to them in order to make some choices more common than others. For example, \"Snare\" should appear much more often than \"Suppression.\" \n\n**Spread The Word!**: Please share your random Champions in this thread and use this area to discuss new ideas and mechanics for League of Legends! Also feel free to use the Generator to create new moves for your existing Champions. Crediting/Linking to me here would be nice, but definitely not necessary!\n\n**My Work**: If you want to see some of my work, please check out my **[Mega Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)**, which contains over 80 unique Champion concepts!\n\n**The Categories**:\n\n**Champion Role**: Tank, Support, Marksman, Fighter, Bruiser, Assassin, Mage\n\n**Damage Type**: Attack Damage, Ability Power, Mixed Damage\n\n**Ability Targeting**: Allies- Area of Effect, Allies- Single Target, Enemies- Area of Effect, Enemies- Single Target, Passive\n\n**Ability Mechanic**: Skillshot, Target Location, Targeted, On Next Hit\n\n**Ability Primary Component:** Heal, Stat Buff, Shield, Speed Augmentation, Damage Nuke (Weak), Damage Nuke (Medium), Damage Nuke (Strong), Damage over Time, Utility, Gap Closer/Blink, Other (Wildcard)\n\n**Ability Crowd Control**: None, None, None, Slow, Slow, Stun, Stun, Fear, Snare, Snare, Silence, Suppression, Knock-Up, Knock-Back, Displacement, Blind, Polymorph\n\n**Ability Special Properties**: None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, Grievous Wounds, True Damage, Regeneration, Re-castable, % Damage/Health, Aura, Global, Summon/Pet, Stat Steroid, Dual form, Rebirth/Cheat Death, Stealth, Taunt, Reduces Cooldowns, Stacking Stat, Triggers On-Hit Effects, Untargetable, Tether, Execute, Scales with Stat, Decoy/Illusion, Non-Mana Resource, Crowd Control Immunity, No Unit Collision, Affects Towers, Eff.

You'll have to really think outside the box to make this work.\n\nIf I were tackling this, I would make it a self-cast ability that reset the yordle's auto attack timer.  Perhaps the \"polymorph\" puts some sort of balloons on the target that weighs them down, and subsequent auto attacks pop the balloons to deal burst AoE magic damage.  While the yordle is honing in on the marked target, he himself is immune to CC because he's in a state of focus?  It would work somewhat similarly to Poppy or Olaf's Ultimate.  Makes me think of a carnival or arcade theme, where the yordle is some sort of crack game player, with ski ball and bumper cars and all sorts of other fun stuff!","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-10T23:08:18.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man...\nThanks for getting my creative juices flowing LOL\nAlso, did you get a chance to look at my one champion concept yet?
