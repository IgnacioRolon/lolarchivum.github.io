{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T09:39:13.774+0000","title":"Imena, the Dreamwalker","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage, AP Support\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion that plants and then cultivates the dreams of enemies to inflict damage or heal allies.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Imena is a typical mage/support archetype with an interesting resource mechanic tied to the capture of dreams and nightmares.  She uses her basic abilities to both create and capture dreams, and then consumes those dreams in order to cast her short-cooldown Ultimate.  Imena has powerful healing and a powerful skillshot stun, as well as the potential to deal considerable burst damage when building as a mage.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Imena doesn’t do much to completely break the mould of what a mage or support can be.  She has two methods of healing, which will need to be carefully balanced, and her resource mechanics will need to be monitored closely.  The theme of dreams is an interesting albeit slightly cliche one.  Overall Imena is a safe, low skill ceiling mage, which is both important for the health of the game but also bland and unexciting.\n\n**Appearance**: Imena dresses in robes and a veil, and is always seen with a crystal ball that floats ominously in front of her.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/the_fortune_teller_by_jerry8448-d378fed_zps3cwzoav7.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/dream_catcher_by_brandrificus-d72w033_zpsgcetd1yp.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/259905438d3ff5aeffc7d209b99ae12a-d647x3u_zpsjmf21ncw.png\n\n**Lore**: Imena was once a fortune teller and hypnotist from Zuan, but sought a higher calling to interpret the dreams of those who needed her unique talents the most.\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful slow/stun, strong burst potential, consistent healing potential\n\n**Weaknesses**: No gap closers, no escapes, Ultimate requires the acquisition of additional resources\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:134}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: Imena fires a bolt of energy from her crystal ball at range.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_6670_pas_zpsujn7qp6e.jpg\n**Passive- Dream State**: Imena gains 3 AP for every dream and nightmare she is currently storing.\n**Design Philosophy**: Sometimes Imena will experience lulls in the action where her Ultimate doesn’t need to be used.  This ability encourages her to continue farming dreams and helps allocate power to her kit that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16495_btn_zpsuyl049cg.jpg\n**Q- Incubus (4 seconds)**: A targeted ability that can be cast on both allies and enemies.\n**On enemy cast**: Incubus places a nightmare within an enemy’s mind, dealing magic damage and marking the target with the “Nightmare” debuff for 4 seconds.  This debuff can be consumed by the Dreamcatcher ability.\n**On ally cast**: Places a dream within an ally’s mind, healing them slightly and marking the target with the “Dream” debuff for 4 seconds.  This debuff can be consumed by the Dreamcatcher ability.\nRank-ups increase damage/healing and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Imena's way of creating the resource she needs to power of ultimate. It is a low-cooldown, targeted ability which allows her to more consistently generate dreams and nightmares in combat.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_17044_pas_zpsvl6st3i5.jpg\n**W- Dreamcatcher (4 seconds)**: Imena creates a large Dreamcatcher at a target location.  It has a short cooldown and can stay active indefinitely, costing mana per second to use.  This vortex reduces the magic resistance of enemies within it and is roughly 1.5x the size of Anivia’s Ultimate.  It consumes any Dream/Nightmare debuffs from targets affected by Incubus, storing them and ultimately using them to power Reverie.  Imena can store up to 10/11/12/13/15 dreams and 10/11/12/13/15 nightmares at a time.\nRank-ups increase the magic resistance shred to 10/18/25/32/40 and amount of dreams which can be stored.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability synergizes powerfully with her Q and Ultimate, as it allows her to ‘collect’ the resources she creates with Q to then spend with her Ultimate.  The Dreamcatcher is large and easily recast or sustained through in order for Imena players to consistently capture dreams and nightmares whenever they use Incubus.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14564_btn_zpsfdnw53jo.jpg\n**E- Sleep Cycle (10 seconds)**: Imena fires a skillshot line nuke that deals magic damage to the first target it reaches.  This target is then increasingly slowed over the next 1.5 seconds until they eventually become stunned for an additional 1 second.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: Thematically this ability functions like a sleep dart, slowing an enemy until finally bringing them down.  This also gives Imena a small bit of hard crowd control; a feature typical among most mages of her archetype.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5585_pas_zpsfakyfw24.jpg http://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5586_pas_zpslju6s8mj.jpg\n**R- Reverie (12 seconds)**: Reverie requires at least 8 dreams or nightmares to cast, which are consumed upon activation.  Any additional dreams or nightmares are also consumed.  This ability can be cast on both allies and enemies.\n**On ally cast**: Heals an ally for 150/250/400 (+50% AP), and heals for more based on the number of dreams caught.\n**On enemy cast**: Deals heavy magic damage to a target, and deals more damage based on the number of nightmares caught.\n**Design Philosophy**: Reverie is the ultimate ‘tap’ to the resource-collecting ‘sink’ of her kit.  This allows Imena to harnass the dreams and nightmares she’s been collecting in one of two ways.  The ability is gated by a 12 second cooldown to prevent Imena players from essentially ‘double casting’ their Ultimate as both a heal and a heavy damage nuke back to back.  It's important to note that Dreams and Nightmares are considered two separate resources for this ability, and are spent independently of one another based on whether the ability is cast on an ally or enemy.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my unique concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-14T23:50:54.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...And don't it feel good?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-27T22:01:43.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm dreaming of more discussion about Imena!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-18T17:53:15.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imena is walkin' on sunshine, oooh-oh!","replies":[]},{"poster":"owa93upyZG","date":"2015-03-12T18:22:13.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the concept. I'm wondering, though, if by separating dreams and nightmares you are making the double-resource system too complicated. I know it would sacrifice thematically, but maybe her dreams could be a single resource instead of being separated into two. To make the rewards different between allies and enemies (since they will be harder to harvest from enemies) you might get extra dreams from enemies.

I'm definitely concerned about it but I also really like the dual-casting nature of her Ultimate.  If played as a mage, she will likely have a lot of nightmares but not as many dreams, and vice versa when played as a support.  Managing both evenly and storing them to make epic back-to-back plays is a concept I really like and find unique.  I agree that it comes at the expense of some added complexity and it might be too much, but for now, in the concept phase, I think it's worth exploring.\n\nI agree that her Q could use another unique element to it.  I'll work on that now!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2015-03-10T16:57:13.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit she's a nice champion however I don't know if its written but will she be a mana user or entirely just Dream/Nightmare based?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T18:03:39.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rhyto,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=BtwxOccK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-10T16:57:13.943+0000)\n>\n> I'll admit she's a nice champion however I don't know if its written but will she be a mana user or entirely just Dream/Nightmare based?\n\nThanks for the nice words.
