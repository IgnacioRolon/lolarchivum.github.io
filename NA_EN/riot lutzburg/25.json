This got me thinking about split pushing, siege comps, poke comps, etc.  The common thread between all of them revolve around towers as meaningful objectives to win games.  So how can a team counter these strategies?  Elixirs for towers!\n\n**How It Could Work**- Players buy an elixir from the shop for ~500 gold, not all that dissimilar from the old Oracles Elixir.  Each player can only have one elixir in their inventory or in use at a time.  Using a mechanic like Azir's passive, players walk up to any active tower in the game and use the elixir on it.  This buffs the tower for a few minutes, in one of the ways listed below.\n\n**Thornmail Elixir**- Every time an enemy champion auto attacks this tower, they take damage (true, max health percentage or magic?).  Lasts 3-5 minutes.  Counters split-pushing.\n\n**Rapid Fire Elixir**- Increases the attack speed of a tower dramatically.  Lasts 10-30 seconds.  Counters all-in dives.\n\n**Regeneration Elixir**- Grants a heal over time effect on the tower that heals it up to 50% of its max health over 60 seconds.  If the tower suffers damage during this heal, the effect is canceled.  Counters hit-and-run tactics and normal laning phase tower decay.\n\n**Sniper Elixir**- Increases the range of a tower dramatically.  Lasts 1-3 minutes.  Counters poke comps and long ranged siege.\n\nAgain, this is quite a radical idea but something that I think could really change the way League is played.  Maybe something to consider for next year's Preseason changes?  :)","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-12T01:12:43.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it's cool imo the game will be too long because the losing team will simply refuse to die unless ofc, running out of gold.

Which imo, a little too extreme because for me it would actually limit the strategy diversity instead of promoting them.\n\nBut all my opinion.\n\nSomething that can heal tower to a certain segment of it's hp would be great, like Aliens: Colonel Marine's (it's a very disappointing game I know but let's not talk about it here) hp meter would be good, but they will cost a bit more than other argument potions.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T01:24:55.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=83rge4e7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-12T01:12:43.766+0000)\n>\n> While it's cool imo the game will be too long because the losing team will simply refuse to die unless ofc, running out of gold.

I don't think it would take many games for players to learn that this only delays the inevitable and leads to them being completely gold-starved.  The actual benefits of these elixirs would have to be weighed against the gold-efficiency of using the same amount of resources towards finishing a {{item:3078}}  or something like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"f00G3MxfPP","date":"2015-01-12T08:44:22.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There used to be a summoner spell that did this.
