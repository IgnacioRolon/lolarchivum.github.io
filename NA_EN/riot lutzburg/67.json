{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-14T09:47:25.962+0000","title":"Echo, the Maven of Silence","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":32,"down_votes":4,"body":"**Role**: AP Assassin, AP Jungler\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a Champion themed around sound and echoes.  Sound good?  I also wanted to explore a possible relationship with Sona, and expand on her back story in a very dark but meaningful way.  This resulted in the penning of one of my most elaborate Champion lores to date.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Echo is designed around a very strong, if somewhat gimmicky ‘sound’ theme.  Her kit allows her to stick to and assassinate single targets quite effectively, kill them quickly, and live to tell the tale.  However, her ability to do this without employing the perfect use of her Ultimate is quite limited.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate.  Echo is somewhat mechanically complex mixed with a dark storyline and a somewhat gimmicky theme of \"sound waves.\"  Considerations will need to be given to the somewhat eclectic nature of her abilities and how or if they work well enough together in unison.\n\n**Appearance**: Echo is a brooding Ionian woman in her early 30's, with swirls of distortion and manifested sound cascading around her.  This may look similar to the ice shards surrounding Lissandra.  This physical sound props her up, allowing her to glide across the Fields of Justice.  She carries a massive tuning fork as a weapon, which she wields like a trident.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/space_sound_wave_l_wallpaper_by_xtuzil-d7yfd1h_zps0f2a8d2d.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/append_sound_wave_by_vchen79-d4ih1un_zpsc05d3f79.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/doek_ariel_ii_by_steevinlove-d74dcaa_zps85a1b179.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/On_the_waves_of_sound_by_iPoppet_zps2f6a73f0.png\n*Echo as a teenager, experiencing her ability to morph into a form of pure sound energy for the first time.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/fictional_blades_7_zps9809b3d2.jpg\n*Echo's weapon of choice- a tuning fork that takes on the appearance and deadliness of a small trident.*\n\n**Lore**: Even as a child, Echo had a phenomenal power to control the forces of sound around her.  She could hone in and harness these sound waves to produce physical and occasionally dangerous resonance around her.  Echo’s parents loved their child and saw her unique capabilities as a gift, but they were rightfully frightened about the kind of destruction it could cause if Echo were left to her own devices.  However, before they could formalize a plan to protect their daughter, their fears were realized in the worst possible way.\n\nOne night, Echo was playing with her newborn sister, Sona.  Their parents looked on with a sense of pride and joy as their daughters frolicked on the carpet of their humble den.  Suddenly a bolt of lightning cracked through the night sky, followed by the intense boom of thunder.  Startled by the bellowing sound, Sona let out a sharp cry.  Echo, thinking this was a game of some sort, cried back.  Their mother rushed to Sona, scooping the infant up into her arms and doing her best to comfort her.\n\nSona, however, was inconsolable.  She let out another cry; louder this time.  Echo, somewhat jealous of the attention her sister was receiving, shrieked back.  Her cry was so powerful that it rattled the wine glass held in her father's hand.  He looked down at Echo nervously, asking her to stop.  Sona’s cries only got louder, though, and Echo wasn't about to be upstaged.  After a deep gasp, she let out a powerful shriek, creating a small shockwave of energy that pulsed around the room and knocked her parents off their feet, the infant still in her mother's arms.  Now frightened beyond measure, Sona let loose a terrible scream that would unknowingly be the last sound she would ever make.\n\nEcho, in her fit of childish jealousy and impish understanding of the true power she wielded, reared back and shrieked with all her might.  The shockwaves caused by her voice were so powerful that her entire house practically ruptured into fragments, shaken apart by the mere voice of the young girl.  In an instant, her parents were gone; violently torn asunder by Echo’s innocent but deadly game.\n\nOnly in the aftermath, standing in the derelict remains of what was once her home, did Echo realize the carnage she had unwittingly unleashed.  Scared and all alone in the rain, she fled.  By the time her neighbors reached the wreckage, Echo was long gone.  Digging through the remains of the home, Ionian officials found young Sona, somehow still alive, shrouded in the protective arms of her dead mother.  Now an orphan, the officials had no choice but to place her in a foster home.  A search for Echo was conducted, but she was never found, and the true cause of her parents’ murders and the destruction of their home was never discovered…\n\nMore than two decades later, Echo has suddenly appeared to fight on the Fields of Justice.  No one knows the kind of life she must have lived in the streets and wilds of Iona all these years.  A series of dark, guilt-plagued secrets lie in the heart of this young girl, but she swore that fateful stormy night that she would never tell a soul.  That was the night that Echo became...\n\n *The Maven of Silence*.\n\n-----\n\n**Strengths**: Very strong sticking power, moderate utility including a silence, ability to isolate a priority target, long range teleport\n\n**Weaknesses**: No sustain in the jungle, no real defensive abilities, dependent on skillshots to continue sticking to targets\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:28}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:4}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A moderately ranged melee attack, striking enemies with a trident that resembles a tuning fork.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_14008_btn_zps99cb1837.jpg\n**Passive- Echolocation**: When an enemy Champion uses an ability within 2000 units of Echo, they are revealed for 2 seconds.  This effect cannot be triggered on the same Champion for at least 6 seconds.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability lets Echo counter jungle very effectively, as well as provide awareness against ganks when in lane.  This ability is also very effective during team fights that take place in the jungle, where brush is typically prevalent.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_5770_pas_zpse535db1d.jpg\n**Q- Sonic Beam (4 seconds)**: Echo emits a powerful sound wave forward in a line, dealing up to 80/120/160/200/250 (+60% AP) magic damage to the first target it strikes.  The damage this ability deals decays the further that the beam has to travel before contacting a target.  It then ricochets back towards its point of origin before disappearing. If the ricochet makes contact with Echo, the beam disappears but Sonic Beam's cooldown is refreshed and Echo gains 40% movement speed for 1 second.  This ability has a max travel distance (including its ricochet) of 1,200 units.  Enemies affected by Sonic Beam also have a debuff placed on them called “Reverberating,” which lasts for 3 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lowers cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability allows Echo to stick to targets similarly to Mundo’s cleavers.  The ‘echo’ portion of the ability allows Echo to essentially ‘draft’ behind her targets, which makes her attack trajectory rather predictable.  The “Reverberating” debuff is an important element of Echo’s Ultimate, which is described below.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16710_pas_zpsad21911d.jpg\n**W- Amplify (12 seconds)**: For the next 4 seconds, Echo’s auto attacks deal 10/20/30/40/50 (+10% AP) bonus magic damage and shred the targets Magic Resist by 5/8/12/16/20 per auto attack.  This shred lasts for the duration of the ability’s activation.\nRank-ups increase damage and MR shred, as well as lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**:   As a Champion with excellent sticking power by way of landing multiple Sonic Beams, Echo has the luxury of kiting with her enemies and applying constant damage through auto attacks.  The MR shred helps ensure that her assassination target does not survive her constant barrage of Sonic Beams.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_4700_btn_zps4649937d.jpg\n**E- Piercing Shriek (9 seconds)**: Echo lets out a screech, dealing 60/90/120/160/200 (+70% AP) magic damage in a 250 unit radius around herself and then creating a ring of energy in a 500 radius shortly afterward, like a ripple.  Enemies caught in this expansive ring are silenced for 1.5 seconds.  (As a point of reference, if an enemy takes damage from Piercing Shriek and stands still, they will not be hit by the silencing effect.  Running away, however, will likely both damage and silence a target.)\nRank-ups increase damage dealt and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability functions similarly to Nautilus’ Riptide, and discourages players from fleeing Echo once she has reached them, while simultaneously discouraging them from standing in place, as the damage she deals against a stationary target is immense.  The intent of this ability is to prevent enemy Champions from assisting their soon-to-be-murdered ally, or fleeing with their own escape tools.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7823_btn_zps79e5fcf5.jpg\n**R- Reverberation (120 seconds)**: Echo unleashes a massive shockwave of sound that quickly expands around her, dealing up to 200/400/600 (+90% AP) to enemies based on their proximity to the blast.  The shockwave decays down to 40% of its base damage as it expands towards its 800/1200/1600 unit diameter.  The sound wave created by this ability then persists as a ring at the fringes of its effect range for 8 seconds.  In addition, enemy targets within the 300 range epicenter of the blast are knocked back 600 units.  However, if an enemy champion is affected by the “Reverberating” debuff, they are not knocked back.  Finally, while the ring from the shockwave persists, Echo can recast Reverberation and left click anywhere within its diameter to morph into a form of pure sound energy, instantly teleporting herself to the location of her cursor.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a mechanically complex ability on paper but isn’t as daunting as it seems when applied to a real scenario.  Essentially, this ability allows Echo to push enemies away who might try to thwart her assassination attempts, while also dealing a fair bit of AoE magic damage during her chaotic engagements.  Echo players won’t want to cast this ability until they have marked their prey with at least one Sonic Beam, however, as this applies the Reverberating debuff and prevents that target from being knocked back with the rest of their poor, helpless allies.  The optional ability to teleport out allows Echo players to make a clean getaway following their assassination attempt.  Tying the ability’s range with its rank will steadily increase Echo’s options to follow-up on secondary targets if need be during late game team fights.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Saixos","date":"2015-01-14T21:32:40.175+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well....congratulations. You've managed to make a concept intriguing and interesting enough for me to actually want to give feedback xP\n\nFirst off, the very beginning thoughts. I love the idea of another sound champion named \"Echo\", with a link to Sona's background, expanding on her lore. The use of echos in a champion intrigues me. I like the first picture that you've put up especially, the violet eyes combined with dark hair fit perfectly to my idea of a psychologically damaged woman with a dark background. Since she has such a black background, giving her more serious tones and a more serious attitude than Sona would fit well I think. \n\nI'm not too much of a fan of your allocation of the roles of a champion which would fit this theme, but more on this later.\n\nLore: If I am to be completely honest, I expected a bit more out of the lore after hearing the description. While I immensely enjoy the idea of Echo and Sona being sisters, I dislike your background. A young child so young that she doesn't understand her powers, mistakes made by parents despite them knowing about Echo's powers, the jealousy towards a BABY.... I'm not a fan. Plus, to me all that this explains is why Sona is mute. Where did the instrument come from that Sona was found with? If state officials found Sona, then why was she put with the instrument? Why was she \"found abandoned\"? Why does she have such a connection with the instrument even being mute? All of this just doesn't add up for me. I think the champion concept and idea behind her background is excellent, but the execution could be so much more. Especially considering Ionia's (seemingly) mystical capabilities I think there'd definitely be something that could have resulted in Echo and Sona. \n\nSide note here: I dislike the title \"Maven of Silence\". To me that's way too similar to Sona's title, and I dislike repetition like that. In addition, considering Echo has massive power over sound and Sona is mute, shouldn't Sona be the true \"Maven of Silence\"?\n\nNow onto her actual champion abilites and the like. First off, I dislike that she's a melee champion. To me, this is completely contrary to her theme. The way I imagine her is kind of like, Sona has great abilities with sound, but she needs to use her instrument to do things. It is never clarified whether the instrument has the magic, or Sona has the magic, or maybe both have some of it. And we could explain Sona's abilities in different ways, sound is just vibration of air molecules after all, so I'd explain that Q/autos are vibrations strong enough to rip things apart, w is a soothing sound that makes allies forget their wounds, combined with air pressure to their wounds to stop bleeding, and a minor shield from the vibrations that can somewhat weaken enemy attacks by bumping into them and absorbing energy, and e is just a melody which causes the brain to pump adrenaline. Her ulti would be a melody which activates a primal part of the mind, causing enemies to dance. Sona is music as a weapon by using an amplifier. You've given Echo a tuning fork as something similar. I find this completely unnecessary - the way I view Echo is the LIVING EMBODIMENT OF SOUND. That means she doesn't need an amplifier at all, she can cause strong sound attacks simply by waving her hand or yelling or something. And to me, this means that Echo should be a ranged mage, not a melee one.\n\nNow secondly, to me sound by definition is an AOE type thing. If you're talking, you could be talking to one person, but everyone will hear it. It can be louder in one direction, but I think that Echo's abilities definitely need to be AOE rather than single target - this speaks against the assassin nature, which I didn't really like that much for this reason. Personally, the role that I would give Echo would be as a champion which can be played most effectively mid and jungle, but rather than being an assassin style being more AOE mage style, a powerful teamfighting champion. The difference between her and Sona as teamfighting champions would be that Sona primarily uses music and supports her teammates - the amount of damage she deals is fairly decent, but doesn't really turn the tide of a battle or burst someone down nowadays. Echo on the other hand could be more of the champion that can deal massive AOE damage to enemies and fights more by harming the enemy than helping her teammates. Fitting for the older, damaged, dark theme.\n\nOnto her abilities (ignoring my dislike of her being an assassin for the moment):\nPassive:\nI absolutely love the idea of this passive, it is definitely my favorite part of her kit. It gives her a unique mechanic which can be useful both in lane and in the jungle. My concern would be that since she is unable to turn it off, enemies could use the reveal marker in order to predict where she is. I would say giving vision of the area whenever an ability is used rather than giving a reveal marker would probably be better function wise, albeit making her less useful in teamfights. I wouldn't necessarily stick to this passive either, there are a lot of other possibilities for one.\n\nQ:\nI REALLY dislike this ability of hers. To me, this seems like a worse mundos cleaver in that in order to chase someone and kill them, she needs to not only land these, but also get the return ability. It would make her extremely predictable due to the return of her Q's, preventing her from dodging skillshots and then continuing to chase. It's...ugh. Ingame I don't think this ability would be very useful at all, especially not at higher tier play.\nW:\nTemporarily deals more damage and lowers enemy resistances. Great. This is similar to a lot of older champions, but it's a very boring ability that doesn't really add much to her I feel, and I think that, looking at recent champion releases, this ability is too linear and too bland to ever stick with it.\nE:\nIt's the most interesting of her basic abilities for sure, but I'm not sure whether it would really fulfill it's intentions. Most champions have some form of mobility at the moment which would allow them to escape from Echo, and the silence would really only be useful in a teamfight I feel. Once the enemy has reached 500 distance, they're at a range where Echo wouldn't be able to attack them any more, and only need to dodge a q/land a cc skillshot on the return in order to escape from Echo. In addition Silence is only useful when preventing the enemy from fighting back, not when they're running away, so...\nR:\nThis ability seems really interesting, I kind of like it but I don't really feel that it fits to the rest of her kit much. I dislike the teleporting aspect as well, it doesn't really seem necessary to me, and might be a bit too powerful (How will anyone ever kill her considering that she can ult out of any situation and put her 1600 units away from them). It seems far too powerful to me, and it seems to me that Echo would only ever be useful when she has her ultimate, and with her current cooldown and power of this ultimate... I dislike that it puts Echo into one of 2 extremes, and doesn't really have a middle ground.\n\n\nThe way I would design her abilities, as already said, would be more as an AOE mage with some fairly powerful abilities, but requires some skill to use properly. I'd like it if she could be placed similar to Syndra on the threat level of mages in the mid lane. An ability idea/concept I was reminded of while I was reading this was an ability similar to the pokemon ability \"Mirror move\" which caused the player to copy the last move the enemy used, and then use it against them. The way I would modify this ability for league and Echo would be as follows: Allow Echo to activate her ability, and for the next ...lets say, 1.5 seconds, any enemy spells used on her would be copied to ALL enemys within...lets say 700/800 radius? This would be onhit/targeted and have a 0.2 second delay after the ability hits echo, and include an amplified sound effect of the ability, while displaying unique sound echo visuals. It would be like a spellshield, except instead of absorbing the spell, it would take the spell and apply its damage and crowd control to Echo along with all other enemies in the spells radius (Yes the echo would copy CC as well). I think this is the kind of unique one of a kind playstyle and ability League is looking for with new champions, and would fit her theme incredibly well and be interesting to play with and against. It could be done as taking the damage Echo takes prior to having it reduced by her resistances and deal that to enemy champions, allowing her to build AP mage, assassin AP mage, and tank mage depending on her playstyle. etc, etc, etc.\n\nTo sum up once more, I absolutely LOVE the concept and base idea that you've created, and it would be absolutely amazing to see something like this ingame. HOWEVER, I think your execution didn't really fit the concept and base idea, and it could be done much better. I would love to see you redo this champion concept, and I'd definitely be willing to provide both feedback and ideas if you want them.\n\nDayum I wrote a lot.

The R is op either way.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unclesatan","date":"2015-01-14T14:00:41.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it already, i frequent these boards and it's one of the more compelling and fitting champions i've seen posted, hope you get more views on this one\n\nas for numbers they probably should be tweaked but when i see champion concept i don't get picky about numbers so that's normal.\n\none thing i suggest for sonic beam though for sake of it just being on paper, having a spell like that be able to refresh indefinitely, there should be stacks or something reducing the sonic beam's damage for a short period of time every time it's caught, or make it so it can't be caught more than 5 times in a period of time, especially if it's placing debuffs and giving you 40% movespeed (upwards of 150-200 bonus movespeed at times) every time it's refreshed.  just a thought\n\nother than that, it's very nice :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-14T18:49:28.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unclesatan,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=oynvPHZF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-14T14:00:41.198+0000)\n>\n> i like it already, i frequent these boards and it's one of the more compelling and fitting champions i've seen posted, hope you get more views on this one\n> \n> as for numbers they probably should be tweaked but when i see champion concept i don't get picky about numbers so that's normal.\n> \n> one thing i suggest for sonic beam though for sake of it just being on paper, having a spell like that be able to refresh indefinitely, there should be stacks or something reducing the sonic beam's damage for a short period of time every time it's caught, or make it so it can't be caught more than 5 times in a period of time, especially if it's placing debuffs and giving you 40% movespeed (upwards of 150-200 bonus movespeed at times) every time it's refreshed.  just a thought\n> \n> other than that, it's very nice :)\n\nThank you so much for the support and detailed feedback!  I agree that Sonic Beam might be a little too sticky at the moment, but I also think it will depend heavily on exactly how wide and fast the skillshot travels.  In order to make those indefinite recasts like you were referring to, the Echo player essentially needs to land two skill shots every ~2 seconds; one that hits her enemy and then \"catching\" the rebound.  I imagine that will be pretty difficult to replicate multiple times in a chaotic team fight environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Unclesatan","date":"2015-01-15T02:57:36.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=oynvPHZF,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-01-14T18:49:28.085+0000)\n>\n> Thank you so much for the support and detailed feedback!

I swear I’m not stalking, just lots of people like your ideas so they show up where more people can see so I feel obligated to check/comment on them. Oh, and obligatory apology for long-winded review.\n\nPassive (Echolocation): Sounds pretty good to me. Ties in with the theme. Very useful for when you counter jungle.  Nice job!\n\nQ (Sonic Beam): Name sounds similar to Lee Sin’s “Sonic Wave”. I’ll try and think of something different but I’m having trouble. I personally like this ability. Saixos Yewark mentions that at a high tier of playing it would be easy to predict her movements and capitalize on this. While this is true, moves like this SHOULD have counterplay. Gnar and Draven have the same mechanic, and yet they’re seen at higher levels. Fabbby is a perfect example of someone who mains Draven at a really high level and can still perform incredibly well. And another example of counterplay, if Cassiopeia poisons you, the enemy KNOWS she only has the option of solely “bursting” the poisoned target as the E resets on poisoned targets. This means the rest of the team can collapse on her. The same concept can be applied here, except grabbing the reset isn’t IMPERATIVE on Echo as it is on Cass since you’ll probably build her with a little more bulk so she won’t pop so easily. And Echo doesn’t really lose out on too much if she misses the rebound, especially since this is only a 4 second cooldown. Echo is only punished (and rightfully so) if she tunnels too hard and only focuses on HER interactions with the rebound and not the enemies (I do this all the time with Cass). Even then, if you’re a smart Echo player, you can bait out abilities and “counter” the counterplay by pretending to go for the rebound and then juking at last second.\n\nAs for the other stuff, I feel like it’s a little unrewarding for the skillshot to deal less damage the further it travels, since it’s harder to hit her Q the further away an opponent is (gives them more time to react). Also, I feel like the Q should be not fully reset as if you’re melee range you can just Q Q Q Q Q Q in 1 second and rarely miss (that combo just did 1500 + 360% AP). Maybe reduce the cooldown to .5-1 second to give the enemy a little breathing room in between Q’s. These two changes in conjunction with each other should even each other out. Did you ever consider making this move have no activation time? Oh, and the cooldown should probably not be lowered upon leveling since it’s already at a low cooldown and it has resets.\n\nW (Amplify): A necessary ability to have for a jungler for consistent damage. I do agree with Saixos Yewark that this ability is a little bland but I feel like it’s essential for an AP jungler to have.  Here’s something to spice it up a bit: Get rid of the MR shred on every AA and. on activation, this move “amplifies” Echo’s next ability or auto attack. Q: Reduces enemy’s movement speed by X% (scales)   Auto Attack: Shreds magic resist for either a base amount (scales) or X% (scales)   E: I’m confused with this ability, but when the enemy is silenced are rooted as well (this discourages them from breaking the circle moreso than the silence) (or they can take more damage I dunno).\n\nE (Piercing Shriek): I’m confused with this ability, does a wall of sound appear afterward? If the purpose of this move is to punish players that try and escape Echo, their movement should be hindered, though I see how silence should be a theme (see Amplify suggestion).\n\nR (Reverberation): Haha, when I visualize this move I think of an epic sonic nuke that blows dust everywhere. Now this move makes more sense for dealing less damage being further away since it’s less of a skillshot. I really like the idea of being able to teleport within the shockwave, that’s really cool and encourages an assassination component. If she’s building some damage and will most likely “Xin-Zhao” her way into the enemy, she needs some sort of escape (something that Xin Zhao lacks, unless of course he’s building tanky then he just doesn’t care). Knockback is cool too.\n\nThe tuning fork as a weapon is just splendid!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spirangle","date":"2015-01-14T20:35:31.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Echo's kit has a lot of potential, but her lore is really shaky, so I'm going to start there. I'm sorry that this feedback is going to be kind of harsh.\n\n**Sona** - Echo's lore contradicts Sona's lore. If officials placed Sona in the orphanage, then people would know where Sona came from. Also, Sona had her etwahl when she was found on the doorstep.\n\n**The Screaming Match and the Storm** - With what I know about kids, this event does not make much sense at all. The event requires that Echo was not a baby but was too young to understand consequences but also old enough to ignore her parents. Kids start walking around 1 year old. Kids start saying words around 1.5 years old, but they don't really start to talk until 2 years old. Usually the earliest a kid will have the realization that they don't have to what they're told (i.e. say \"no\") is 2 years old (hence the terrible twos). Kids are actually pretty smart at 2 years old and they can understand consequences. I have issues believing \"Echo kept screaming louder and louder even after her father told her to stop AND she knocked her parents off their feet\". Echo shouldn't be so unaware of what she is doing and what is happening. The older she is, the less likely the situation becomes unless Echo is really poorly behaved toddler. I also don't believe Echo would have survived being alone in the storm.\n\n**Etwahls and Foils** - However, I don't think Echo's lore will be that hard to fix while still keeping her story dark, especially if you want to make her a foil to Sona. I'm trying to avoid walls of text, so I'm going to go into bullet points.\n\n* Sona was left on the doorstep of an orphanage with her etwahl.\n* Sona cannot make any sound, i.e. has no voice.\n* Sona has a deep connection to her etwahl. You could say her etwahl is her voice.\n* Etwahls are an unfamiliar instrument (the orphanage didn't know what it was).\n* Sona cannot be separated from her etwahl (as it would always find a way back to her somehow).\n* Etwahls have some sort of power as both an instrument and a weapon via sound manipulation.\n* But, the etwahl is not unique to Sona (as Lestara knew what it was).\n* Echo has a connection to Sona.\n* Her sound manipulation is based mostly in her voice and amplifying sound (based off her kit).\n* She has had her powers since she was young, but she did not know how to control them.\n\nEcho and Sona already have a lot of opposites. Sona's beautiful music vs. Echo's horrible screams. Sona cannot make sound on her own, but Echo sure can. Sona learning about her powers when she was a teenager vs. Echo having hers since she was a child.\n\nThis is getting really long, so I'm going to try to wrap this up with a couple possibilities for Echo and Sona's connection:\n\n* Echo and Sona have the same powers because they are family. Echo lost control of her powers when she was a child and feared the same thing would happen to Sona, so she bound Sona to the ethwal and left her at the orphanage. Echo is Sona's older sister or maybe even her mother.\n* This can also go a fairytale route with magical gifts and curses. Sona was a good child and was blessed with the etwahl and beautiful music (Maven of the Strings). Echo was a bad child and was cursed with her voice and terrible screams (making her unable to talk -> Maven of Silence).","replies":[{"poster":"Spirangle","date":"2015-01-14T21:08:56.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That lore feedback ended up being longer than I intended, sorry. I don't have much kit feedback, though.\n\n**Q** - This is a cool skill, but it may be feast or famine based on matchup. For her Q to ricochet, Echo's target needs to be within 400 units, so not far outside her melee AA range. But, if her target has cc or is mobile, they can easily break her pattern. This may end up being healthy counterplay, so I'm not sure there's any problem here.\n\n**W** - Again, Echo will struggle against mobile enemies, but that may be a healthy weakness. Assassins can be hard to balance.\n\n**E** - There's a typo. You typed 500 diameter instead of 500 radius. Otherwise, this is cool.\n\n**R** - Well thought out mechanics with Echo not knocking away an established target; sounds good","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-14T21:31:16.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spirangle,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=oynvPHZF,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-01-14T21:08:56.232+0000)\nsounds good\n\nHa!
