{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T00:38:49.430+0000","title":"Moira, the Stargazer","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage\r\n\r\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create an astral or space-themed champion.\r\n\r\n**General Design Philosophy**: Moira is a rather mechanically simple Mage, designed with a good mix of team utility and crowd control, high damage and burst, and survivability.  Her astronomer theme grants her a strong visual identity, with all her attacks taking on a cosmic and galactic vibe. She excels at top lane. \r\n\r\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Moira has a fun mashup of existing abilities, and aside from her Ultimate doesn’t do anything too wild.  Her kit does include two separate abilities that require vector targeting to fire, but this should be offset by the simplistic nature of her kit overall.\r\n\r\n**Appearance**: Moira is an elegant astronomer type.  She carries a hand-held telescope in one hand.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Sanctuary.Knocker.591812_zpsivdo2ut2.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/bkqTu_zpsbwkisxz6.png\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/tumblr_inline_mjv86hqwgf1qz4rgp_zps34hvsdqd.jpg\r\n*Moira after first discovering the doomsday meteor destined to smash into Runeterra*\r\n\r\n**Lore**: Moira is an astronomer who desperately tried to spread awareness about a massive, world-shattering cosmic event she believes will unfold sometime in the distant future.  However, when no one believed her, she knew she had to take matters into her own hands.  She joined the League to showcase the true power of the cosmos, and demonstrate the damage it could wreak even on a microscopic scale.\r\n\r\n**Strengths**: Powerful zone controlling Ultimate, strong AoE shielding, mild team utility, long range\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**: Long cooldowns, unreliable gap closer, shield is stationary and predictable, Ultimate can suffer from Nunu/Pantheon “just move” syndrome\r\n\r\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:112}} {{champion:68}} \r\n\r\n**Auto Attack**: Moira fires a bolt of cosmic energy from her hand-held telescope.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_3358_pas_zpsmblg5cgx.jpg\r\n**Passive- Gravitational Pull**: Enemies who attack Moira are affected by a powerful gravitational pull, slowing their attack speed by 20% for 2 seconds.\r\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a thematic ability that deters enemy carries and fighters from focusing Moira, especially in conjunction with other team-wide items such as Frozen Heart and Randuin’s Omen.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_13640_pas_zps3pklduvw.jpg\r\n**Q- Cosmic Force (7 seconds)**: A comet encircles Moira and makes several loops around her in increasing diameter over 3 seconds. Enemies hit directly by the comet suffer magic damage per hit (-50% damage for subsequent hits), and all enemies within the ability’s aura suffer minor magic damage over the duration.\r\n**Design Philosophy**:  This ability is somewhat similar to Nautilus' Riptide.  Moira can use this ability to transform herself into a mobile wrecking ball.  Both Moira and enemies must jockey for positioning based on the location of the comet as it encircles her.  Its orbit increases over the duration of the ability to hit escaping enemies multiple times.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_1575_btn_zpsyljle484.jpg\r\n**W- Ray Shield (14 seconds)**: Moira creates a domed ray shield at a target location that absorbs damage on behalf of any allied units inside. After sustaining too much damage or after 6 seconds, the shield shatters.\r\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is essentially an AoE shield that does not target allies directly.  This ability creates more gameplay scenarios and counterplay opportunities than standard shields, as it requires allies to position themselves in a certain way to receive its effects.  However, the shield itself can have a far greater strength to compensate, meaning that if only a single target is inside, they can sustain through a very large amount of damage.  Friendly champions have to be careful when inside the dome, however, as it doesn’t offer much wiggle room in terms of dodging skillshots.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_4376_pas_zpsll0bfzo7.jpg\r\n**E- Asteroid Belt (9 seconds)**: Using vector targeting, Moira summons a belt of volatile asteroids in a line, which last for 4 seconds. Enemies caught in the belt are slowed by 80% while inside it and suffer magic damage every .2 seconds.\r\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability acts as a miniature Rumble Ultimate, with more emphasis on the slow than the damage capabilities.  The slowing effect allows Moira to reach enemies in order to connect with her Cosmic Force ability.\r\n\r\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16119_btn_zpsh4fqkofq.jpg\r\n**R- Doom’s Day (120 seconds)**: Moira summons a massive meteor to a target location using vector targeting.  Following its landing, the meteor then travels 1500 units over 2 seconds in the direction provided by Moira. The initial impact deals heavy magic damage and any enemies it contacts along its path of destruction take additional magic damage and are pushed to the side of the meteor as it travels, and then slowed by 50% for 2 seconds. The meteor takes several seconds to land after casting with early warning/detection similar to Pantheon's Grand Skyfall.\r\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability acts as a massive zone denial and teamfight-changing super nuke.  It deals massive damage to any enemies caught directly in its path and also displaces and slows them, creating a huge opportunity for taking a positional advantage over an entire enemy team.  This ability is perfect for disrupting objectives.\f\r\n\r\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2016-03-09T20:59:31.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moira's Cosmic Force ability is now being explored and executed on by the new dragon champion...

I definitely like some of the unique things she has going for her (orbiting \"skillshot\", AoE shield at a target location, impassible terrain that moves) but for some reason she still comes off as somewhat bland.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-31T19:15:19.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gazed at the forums and didn't see Moira anywhere!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-03-26T02:14:06.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this one, i always felt that we needed an champ that was more strictly based on astronomy related things\n\nSo how fast will Cosmic force travel around Moira, can it make 1 revolution in 1 sec, or is it slower, also whats the max, and min diameter?\n\nI luv that the meteor slides after touch down, that was a nice well thought out addition","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T07:33:52.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Ficxl3Ox,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-26T02:14:06.193+0000)\n>\n> I like this one, i always felt that we needed an champ that was more strictly based on astronomy related things\n> \n> So how fast will Cosmic force travel around Moira, can it make 1 revolution in 1 sec, or is it slower, also whats the max, and min diameter?\n> \n> I luv that the meteor slides after touch down, that was a nice well thought out addition\n\nI'd say the Cosmic Force travels at a speed that's halfway between Diana's old W and new W speeds.  So yeah, about one revolution per second.  The min is Diana's W range, the max is probably about 1.2-1.5x Nautilus' Riptide.  It's kind of a hard spell to envision so I'm definitely open to experimentation with ranges and speeds.\n\nThe sliding of the meteor is one of my favorite parts of her kit!  Impassible terrain that also moves is a very powerful and never-before-seen idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-03-16T05:40:35.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting concept.

If memory serves, the only two champions to use vector targeting right now are {{champion:112}} with his laser and {{champion:68}} with his ultimate.  In the past Riot has said that they are very cautious about using vector targeted abilities too often, as it apparently has a low adoption rate and has been found too difficult for a more general audience to master.\n\nI have seen a lot of concepts on these boards involving a \"copy\" ability and I've always been hesitant about them.  There are a LOT of things that can go wrong and so, so much technical engineering and edge case testing that would have to be done.  For those more game development reasons, I don't think creating a champion like that would be a good idea.  Thematically it'd be awesome, but it would be a huge pain in the ass.  :p","replies":[{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-03-16T09:40:33.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough. lol.
