{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T02:30:41.359+0000","title":"Percy, the Devious Opportunist","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Role**: AP Mage (mid or top lane)\n\n**Inspiration**: “*Anything they can do, I can do better!*” Designed to be a self-made success story, Percy provides no utility, crowd control, or other team-based assistance. He relies on his own abilities to survive, and is way too arrogant for escape maneuvers. Percy robs enemies of their own stats and turns their offensives against them.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Percy was designed around the principles of thievery and deviousness. Using mechanics such as Malphite’s speed steal or Viktor’s Q shield as a springboard, Percy takes those ideas and literally runs away with them.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Moderate. Percy’s theme and theft mechanics may prove too anti-fun for lane opponents, and his Ultimate may be unnecessarily complicated. That said, his theming and kit are strong and unique to League.\n\n**Appearance**: A short, adolescent boy with an impish and snide persona. He has a constant smug look on his face that seems to allude to an immense sense of self-entitlement. He dresses in raggy garbs, looking how can only be described as fashionably homeless. Percy has a hilt on his belt for a small dagger, which he wields in one hand. The dagger is gem-encrusted and looks quite valuable, and is enchanted with a powerful magic; the source of his power.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Sword_to_Alibaba_zpsd466aacc.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/pop-4-concept-art-490px_zpseb565390.jpg\n\n\n\n**Lore**: An impish, adolescent thief with a snide attitude and sense of immense self-entitlement. Percy feels unwarrantedly proud of his ability to manipulate and take advantage of others, almost like a much more cynical Aladdin. As a child, Percy managed to steal an enchanted dagger from a powerful prince. He now wields the dagger himself, and uses its powers with selfish, devious intentions.\n\n**Strengths**: Kit and sustain allows him to survive the front lines, great sustain in general, strong burst potential, most abilities are targeted and not skillshots, is innately tanky for a mage\n\n**Weaknesses**: Short range on abilities, melee auto attack, no escapes, no crowd control, must be in melee range to maximize damage potential\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:68}} {{champion:112}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A melee strike with his enchanted dagger.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_12046_pas_zps5cfd1a6e.jpg\n**Passive- The Kindness of Others**: Champion kills grant Percy 5 permanent armor or MR based on his victim's primary damage type. Assists grant 2 armor or MR, respectively.\n**Design Philosophy**: The thievery theme begins with his Passive. Granting passive stats on kills and assists promotes a sense of self-perpetuated glory; a hallmark of Percy’s personality. As a mage intended to have a stronger late game presence than a mid-game one, this also grants Percy innate tankiness that grows over time, allowing him to better survive the front lines.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_9304_pas_zpsfaba31bf.jpg\n**Q- Greed is Good (6 sec)**: Percy slashes his dagger vertically, creating a lined skillshot that deals magic damage to all targets it reaches. Upon casting Q the first time, his dagger begins to glow and the ability begins to charge for up to 5 seconds. Percy’s movement speed is increased by a percentage which scales upward the longer the ability is charged (10-30%, or 5% per second of charge). In addition, the longer the ability is active but not yet cast, the more damage it deals but the shorter its range becomes. Cast Q a second time to fire the ability. At max damage, the ability is essentially in melee range. Firing the ability earlier than its max charge starts its cooldown immediately. After 5 seconds of charging without casting, the ability automatically fires and goes on cooldown. Percy cannot cast any other ability while his dagger is charging.\nRank-ups increase the damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability functions similarly to Vi’s gap closer, though Percy actually gains movement speed during its cast. At low charges, this skillshot can be used to poke or easily last hit. Longer charges are ideal for gap closing and dealing high damage during an all-in. This ability can also be comboed to devastating effect with Flash, or Teleport/Homeguard Boots.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7803_btn_zpsf2999536.jpg\n**W- Beggar's Choice (9 sec)**: Percy extends his free hand, creating and propelling a globe of energy towards a target of his choice. This deals magic damage and siphons a portion of the target’s current health and mana regeneration for Percy. Percy retains this regeneration for 10 seconds or until the ability is cast again. The enemy’s regeneration is unaffected by this ability. (This ability functions similarly to Viktor’s Q.)\nRank-ups increase damage and the percentage of the health and mana regeneration earned to 60/75/90/105/125% of his target’s.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Percy’s most iconic ability. Players will need to look for the best opportunities to cast Beggar’s Choice during both laning phase and team fights. Casting Beggar’s Choice on a mid-lane opponent who has just used a health potion or procced Catalyst will net a large amount of free sustain. Additionally, using it on champions like Dr. Mundo mid-ultimate will grant ridiculous health regeneration. Furthermore, items like Athene’s Holy Grail and Warmog’s Armor can be used against their owners to devastating effect.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15563_pas_zpsbdc41d6f.jpg\n**E- Sharing is Caring (14 sec)**: Percy targets an enemy (1200 range) with his dagger in an accusatory fashion, creating a spell shield around himself which grants him immunity from disables and causes the next ability used against him by any enemy champion to deal 80/70/60/50/40% damage. The shield lasts for 2.5 seconds or until absorbing a single spell. Additionally, Percy ‘shares’ the remaining damage (20/30/40/50/60%) with his target, as well as deals bonus magic damage to them. This ability must be cast on an enemy for the shield to take effect.\nRank-ups lower cooldown, increase bonus damage, and increase the amount of damage that is shielded.\n**Design Philosophy**: An important distinction needed to be made for this spell is that the enemy champion who it is cast on does not need to be the one who casts an ability on Percy in order for them to suffer its effects. One strategy is to cast the spell shield on an enemy Carry, baiting a disable or other spell from a tanky initiator, causing Percy to suffer no consequences while simultaneously dealing heavy damage to his squishy target. This brief immunity to CC also allows Percy to quickly close the gap between himself and his priority target. Since the spell shield only blocks one ability, the best way to counter Percy's advances is by baiting him into wasting his shield on a non-CC move and then immediately following up with crowd control. Supports with good peeling potential can also shut down Percy's freight train assault with smart use of their own abilities, as well.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11963_pas_zps0f685b18.jpg\n**R- Pay It Forward (80 sec)**: Percy selects a target in melee range (about the range of Skarner’s Ultimate) to impale with his dagger, causing him to instantly gain a 300/450/600 health +.3AP shield for the next 6 seconds. This creates a tether of swirling sand between Percy and his target, with a 1000 unit leash range (the same as Morgana and LeBlanc's tethers). So long as the tether holds, 50% of the damage this shield absorbs is converted to damage against Percy's target. If the tether breaks, the damage is no longer converted but the shield remains. If the shield sustains enough damage to shatter before it naturally disperses, the target takes an additional 75/125/175 +.5AP magic damage. In addition to this effect, Percy also gains 50/80/125 bonus AP for the duration, regardless of the status of the tether or the shield.\nSample Dialogue: \"Stop hitting yourself!\"\n**Design Philosophy**: Pay It Forward is designed to keep Percy safe during his vicious melee all-ins while also filling out his role as a single target mage. Not only does the shield protect him from damage, but it also discourages the enemy team from focusing him while the shield persists (similar to Zilean or Yorick's Ultimates). The passive AP gain provides Percy with better means of assassinating his priority target, while also giving his Ultimate a guaranteed positive effect in instances where his tether instantly breaks due to CC, gap closers, knockbacks, etc.\n\nSpecial thanks to ProxyShic for suggesting a new direction for Percy's Ultimate!\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat)","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Patton","date":"2015-01-02T03:44:31.609+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in love with this champion as well.

You're absolutely right about tower dives- the perfect play for someone as greedy as Percy.\n\nI have often thought about incorporating gold-related abilities into the game (and do so with a few of my yet-to-be-released concepts), but it's always a touchy subject when it comes to balance.  Stealing gold directly from another player is very thematic, but it comes at the expense of a lot of fun for that player, who may have been saving up for a BF Sword or the like. Since it detracts from fantasy fulfillment, I think ultimately the iconic fun factor gets overshadowed by the balance implications.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-03-26T03:37:20.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The second pic is from Prince of Persia.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-26T05:31:37.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpectralWraithX,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=fdjF4yEU,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2015-03-26T03:37:20.398+0000)\n>\n> The second pic is from Prince of Persia.\n\nYes.
