Since our players are a curious bunch, many of you have already stumbled upon my fan work already.  Please note that while I'm able to reference my old creations in my day-to-day work, few if any of these ideas will ever actually be implemented into the game.  If nothing else, I encourage you to view this body of work as a testament to the power of hard work and dedication.  If there's something you want out of life, go and get it!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\nHello, my name is Lutzburg! I'm a professional game designer and enjoy designing champions in my free time. Over the last three years or so, I have come up with over **70 unique concepts** in varying degrees of polish and completeness. As a professional in the game industry, I kept these designs private given the very slim chance that they might actually see some real world use someday. However, enough time has passed since I first created them and they've just been gathering dust on a 200+ page Google Doc. I think it's finally time I shared these ideas with the League of Legends community in the hopes that the community can both find inspiration in my work and also help me improve and continue honing my craft. Thanks for reading!\n\n**New Releases**\n[Ronin, the Shadow Soldier](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/kaZhzn6E-ronin-the-shadow-soldier)\n[Rabadon, the Death Mage](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/dbp1iwNM-rabadon-the-death-mage)\n[Melicent, Conduit of the Swarm](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/oZ0j37UL-melicent-conduit-of-the-swarm)\n\n**Lutz's Top Picks**\nSeeing a **+** next to a Champion on the list below indicates that it is one of my personal favorite concepts.\n\n**Champion Index**\n\n*Note: Some of the concepts you may read can be over three years old. The game has changed a lot in that amount of time, so some concepts may no longer be as relevant or novel as they once were, and some concepts have since been explored by official champions introduced into the game.*\n\n**Marksmen**\n[Alcarus, Shard of the Void](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/nioNsrhu-alcarus-shard-of-the-void)\n[Otto, the Hextech

I'm not a designer though, so I don't feel equipped to provide any intelligible, direct feedback. :P However, maybe there's something small I can share with you about how we analyze our champions that might be useful for you.\n\nSo, we think a lot about what it's like to play as a champion and establish a clear goal for that. Going further, we also think about what it's like to play with (this was a BIG DEAL during Kalista's development) or against that champion. Articulating those experiences help us understand what a champion contributes to the overall game. It's also useful in feedback sessions so people are aware of the expectations.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-03-18T02:14:00.031+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zero C00L,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=uuQxluoH,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-17T21:25:25.501+0000)\n>\n>We also think about what it's like to play with (this was a BIG DEAL during Kalista's development) or against that champion.

That said, your theme sounds really interesting so I'd like to dive into it and see what I can do with it.  :)\n\nOkay I checked out your page and I'm definitely intrigued.  My main concern is this:\n\nBy using a reward mechanism that shifts between two ends of a spectrum can lead to some very unfun gameplay.  For instance, what if the Maiden is nearly full of her \"guilty\" resource and suddenly an ally needs to be healed?  She either has to give up her progress towards being guilty or straight up refuse to heal her ally.  This is an interesting idea for a single player game, but I don't think it will work for League, specifically.\n\nWhat if, instead, all of her abilities kept their full power during normal circumstances, and she had two \"progress bars\" representing Innocence and Guilt, as you designed.  However, these bars start in the center of her resource bar and ONLY move outwards; when she casts a spell of innocence, that side of the bar fills towards the far left side, and casting a guilty spell pushes the guilt bar towards the right.  This can take between 3-12 spell casts of each type, depending on how powerful or Ult-like you want the rewards to be for filling each bar.\n\nIn my head, it makes sense for this to be on the level of Karma's Mantra, at a roughly 20-40 second dynamic cooldown through basic spell rotations.  Filling a bar all the way would then augment the next cast of a spell that fit the guilt or innocence category, respectively.  I think this is what you were going for in the original design, yes?  Then she can stance dance between her two forms rather frequently (every 2-4 seconds) and raise one of her two scales up accordingly as part of a visual cue that she is in a particular stance.  The scales could even have a white and black flame burning in each one, and her spells could be inspired by this holy and dark energy.  Perhaps she even gets a sort of \"yin yang\" super ability if she manages to max out both ends of her resource bar within a short time of each other.\n\nAs far as basic abilities, let's think about words that could be thematically descriptive of her character- judgement, fairness, justice, blindness, truth, pursuit of knowledge, conviction, protection of the innocent, unwavering....\n\nUsing those words and then mapping game mechanics on top of them, I am envisioning abilities like...\n\n* A passive component that increases the Maiden's tenacity\n* A targeted ability that \"judges\" the actions of the marked target for a few seconds, followed by an effect based on their actions\n* Something that deals true damage.  I mean come on, you could even call the ability \"Truth Seeker\" or something like that.  This stuff writes itself.\n* A heal of shield that increases in power based on how weak or close to death the target is\n* A \"path of light\" style ability that shows the pathing of enemy champions over the last few seconds (similar to Rek'sai's tremors passive, but rather than showing where they are, it shows a path that they recently took; perfect for tracking down stragglers trying to flee through the jungle)\n\nWhat do you think?  Is that enough to get your creative juices flowing?","replies":[{"poster":"ArbiterOfTruth","date":"2015-01-02T08:10:46.437+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback and I understand fully well that you have a lot to do with your own champ concepts. I like what you suggested for the resource bar and augmenting an ability. For the \"Judgement\" I can see that working easily when used on an enemy, if the enemy attacks they get dealt some of it back (along the lines of retribution), maybe for ally cast it increases the amount of damage they deal (conviction).

I'm happy to answer any questions you're curious about.\n\n1- I have been a professional game designer for 7 years now (since I was 20 years old) and got my start at a studio called Simutronics Corporation.  They're best known for developing the Hero Engine, which is being used by Bioware's SW:TOR, and their text-based MMO's DragonRealms and GemStone.  While I was there, I designed a comedy MMO RPG called Fantasy University, a tower defense gamed called Tiny Heroes, an endless runner called One Epic Knight, and several other projects that never saw a release.  After that I moved out to CA at a studio called Cie Games (now a part of Glu Mobile), where I worked on an online drag racing game called Racing Rivals (which has over 20 million players and has been the #1 racing game on the mobile market for the last 11 months).\n\n2- That's the age old \"which is your favorite child?\" kind of questions!  I can only narrow it down to my top 3- Atlas, Verica and Rafa (who I haven't released yet).  Ironically of all the Champion roles, I am most pleased with my Marksmen as a group across the board.  I say it's ironic because Marksman is my least played and least favorite role in League.  I have to imagine the reason why they're my favorites is because I tried to make each one of them different and unique from any of the ADCs in League today.\n\n3- I love champion kits that flow and synergize with themselves.  You look at five moves and go, \"Wow, that works with this and using that springboards you into being able to use that!\"  Those are my favorite.  The best examples of this, in my opinion, are **Leona**, **Morgana**, Olaf, **Galio**, **Blitzcrank**, Lux, **Orianna**, **Rek'Sai**, Riven, **Skarner** and **Urgot**.  I went ahead and bolded the ones I frequently play.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoffmisc","date":"2015-01-08T20:37:48.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really have made a lot of champions O.O\n\nIt's cool that you're putting them all here on the forums, i'm a little scared to.\n\nSo far I've posted 2 on the forums but I haven't really gotten any feedback on them...\n\nI just checked and I have 14 unfinished champion concepts on my Google drive, I should really get around to finishing those...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Player Nine  TFT","date":"2015-01-06T22:01:17.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all completely amazing.

I want to answer each of them as I can, so waiting artificially for the sake of spreading out my posts seems kind of silly.\n\nThis issue is compounded by the fact that answering threads with responses means I'm not bumping older posts, which subsequently means the older threads will continue to fall into obscurity and get lost in the shuffle.
