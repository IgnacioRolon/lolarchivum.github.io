{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T08:40:04.276+0000","title":"Rafa, Guardian of the Flame","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"**Role**: Marksman\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion that could interact with brush by setting it on fire.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: In a vein similar to how Rumble is a mage that uses mechanical objects, or Gragas who uses body slams and barrels of wine, Rafa is a marksman with an emphasis on the magical more than the semi-automatic.  Not all marksman need to use guns or physical objects, and Ezreal has been hogging the mage-y marksman role for too long.\n\nAs a Champion, Rafa functions as a mixed damage and attack speed-focused marksman.  By skillfully switching between his abilities and his auto attacks, Rafa can rack up massive damage over time by setting his opponents ablaze and watching them burn.  Similarly to Kalista and Twitch, Rafa also possesses an ability to instantly “burst” the damage over time by extinguishing it with his only means of escape, leading to interesting trade-offs during team fights.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Rafa has powerful lore, an immediately identifiable theme and archetype, and a fast, fluid and fun kit that’s easy to learn.\n\n**Appearance**: Rafa is an adolescent male heavily inspired by tribal influences.  While minimalistic and ornate by nature, Rafa’s appearance clashes against a technologically advanced suit of armor which houses an immensely powerful flame, which he wields in combat.  See Rafa's lore for more details and reference images.\n\n**Lore**: *In a nameless village nestled below the Ironspike Mountains, there exists a tribe founded and steeped deeply in the arts of worship and tradition.  Going back centuries, before even the most ancient of elders in the tribe could remember, The Flame has been the source of all life.  The Flame is a powerful entity that grants healing properties to the villagers who are courageous enough to bathe in it.  However, it can also be wielded as a deadly weapon, burning the tribe's enemies to ashes.  The Flame somehow seems to know the difference, as if it were alive.  Some believe it to be magic; others in the tribe believe that it is the very spirit and essence of mother nature herself, purifying her children in its warm glow.  Whatever its origins, the tribe’s people have grown to depend on it.  As such, obtaining it has become their only priority.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/2eca32db0ac00c13c7196a6c02f04078_zpstw0qg7bb.jpg\n\n*An ember of The Flame lasts but a single generation.  Luckily, another ember always appears again exactly when it is needed.  High in the mountains against which the village rests, powerful machinations lurk and groan, and smoke pours from pylons protruding from the mountain’s rocky surface.  During the most silent of nights, the faint whir of industry can be heard, though the true nature of such constructs is lost on the tribe.  As is tradition, once per generation, a terrible machination begins to patrol the valleys of the mountainside.  Within the ironclad heart of this machine lies an ember of The Flame.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/majane_looks_on_by_lalilulelo2003-d3ekdql_zps8tt8lrhf.jpg\n\n*Every generation, the tribe raises and trains its youth to become powerful warriors capable of taking down the colossal machination as it lurks among the mountains.  The warrior who singlehandedly claims The Flame from the heart of the terrible machination is bestowed the honor of becoming The Flame's Guardian.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Majane_2_by_Lalilulelo2003_zpsilpqkzn6.jpg\n\n*As there is only one Flame to a generation, so can there only be a single Guardian.  As such, the title is treated as the ultimate honor within the village and with it comes immense responsibility.  It is the Guardian’s duty to ensure that The Flame is protected and used for the good of the entire village, healing the sick and defending the village against any threats that might encroach upon it.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Fireball_zpsezy78a3r.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/tumblr_m0unvssxeb1r8kbtn_zps3vmxsvr6.png\n\n*Rafa was training to become a Guardian his entire life.  No one in the village worked harder or wanted the honor more than him.  However, he was dismissed for his age, and he felt cursed for being born between generations.  Rafa wouldn’t let that stop him, though, and on the night of the great Festival of Flame, he proved himself worthy.  While his older and stronger tribe mates prepared to journey into the mountains after enjoying the festival, Rafa slipped away undetected.  With immense focus and unbridled bravery, Rafa completed the mission of his people and claimed The Flame.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Majane_3_by_Lalilulelo2003_zps3kn3a2vx.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Majane_5_by_Lalilulelo2003_zpsuryhpy4v.jpg\n\n*Physically exhausted but spiritually renewed, Rafa returned to his village with The Flame nestled in his hands.  His tribe gasped in disbelief as the warm glow of The Flame flickered and danced around them all.  Respectfully, the elders of the village approached Rafa with the Guardian’s iconic body armor; a garb designed to house The Flame and dignify the Guardian with the adoration of his people.*\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/scan0005wj1_zpsj3ao1qrm.jpg\n\n*Rafa smiled strongly as the over-sized suit was fitted around him.  Never in the history of the tribe had one so young and so small achieved such greatness.  As his people cheered his name, Rafa raised his palms and let loose a funnel of the purifying flames high into the air.  It was that night that Rafa became the **Guardian of the Flame**.*\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful mixed damage over time, ability to see in bushes, ability to deny enemies of bush control, incredible steroid Ultimate\n\n**Weaknesses**: Limited escapes, dependent on attack speed, does not scale particularly well with attack damage\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:29}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:42}} \n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/9175eb35-c21d-4e7d-8c33-db977eb0c6fc_zpsdwr2hzia.jpg\n**Auto Attack**: Rafa launches a moderately ranged auto attack (575) using orbs of fire, which appear above the wrists of his gauntlets.  Rafa then uses his gloves to “scoop” up the hovering orbs of fire before tossing them at his target.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10973_pas_zpsbrd5ze3k.jpg\n**Passive- Seething Burn**: Rafa’s basic abilities cause fire to appear on the battlefield in various ways.  If Rafa makes contact with these flames, he sets himself ablaze.  He then transfers these flames to his gauntlet, causing his next auto attack to deal bonus magic damage over 4 seconds.  This effect stacks with each auto attack (so long as he is still ablaze) and the damage dealt scales with level and bonus AD.  In addition, Rafa gains 20/25/30/35/40 bonus movement speed while ablaze, which scales with Rafa's level.\n**Design Philosophy**: A bulk of Rafa’s kit is based around his Passive.  These ticks of magic damage essentially allow him to act as a DoT-based marksman, similar to Twitch.  Since this damage stacks, Rafa synergizes incredibly well with attack speed.  The bonus movement speed allows Rafa to stick to targets when adeptly using the rest of his kit.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15872_btn_zpsbmx8h03h.jpg\n**Q- Trail of Flame (7 seconds)**: Rafa resets and empowers his next auto attack, creating a trail of flame along its travel path that lasts 3.5 seconds.  This deals 30/50/70/95/120 bonus magic damage (+50% AD) and the flame trail itself deals minor magic damage (15/30/45/60/75 +20% AP) to enemies who stand in it every .5 seconds.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: After casting this ability, Rafa can then chase his targets through the trail, continually applying Seething Burns with each subsequent auto attack.  The travel path functions like an automatically locking skillshot, as an auto attack will always reach its target.  The trail will follow its target through dashes and other movement tools, creating dynamic trail lengths for Rafa to capitalize on.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11960_pas_zps8bzz37pg.jpg\n**W- Backdraft (16 seconds)**: Rafa claps his gauntlets together, forming a powerful cone of wind that knocks enemies back a distance based on how close they are to him.  Closer enemies are knocked back further.  Additionally, any stacks of Seething Burns are extinguished on targets affected by Backdraft, removing the debuffs but dealing their entire duration’s damage instantly.\nRank-ups lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is Rafa’s only escape tool, and is only effective against a single target or a group of clumped chasers.  Extinguishing the Seething Burn debuffs allows a more offensive-minded Rafa to burst down a priority target, much like Twitch’s Expunge.  Deciding when to blow this long cooldown ability to snuff out a priority target versus using it to push back whoever happens to be in your face is an interesting decision point for Rafa players.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_10356_pas_zps8gpszyre.jpg\n**E- Wildfire (12 seconds)**: Rafa conjures a fireball by clasping his gauntlets together before throwing it towards a target location (up to 900 range and roughly the speed of Nami’s bubble).  This creates a patch of fire roughly 350 units across that deals 20/40/60/80/100 (+15% AP) magic damage every .5 seconds for 4 seconds.  If cast in a brush, it grants vision of that brush and the ability’s effects spread to the entire size of the brush.  The duration of the ability is also increased to 6 seconds when in brush.\nRank-ups increase damage done and lowers cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is designed to create an interesting bot lane dynamic by discouraging enemies from hiding in brush, as well as giving a marksman the ability to see into brush without the need for their support to constantly ward.  Additionally, walking through this ability provides Rafa with an additional way to trigger Seething Burns.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_9010_pas_zpsyb1x0xw3.jpg\n**R- Purify (70 seconds)**: Rafa lights himself ablaze for the next 5/6/7 seconds, causing all of his auto attacks to apply Seething Burns for the duration.  Additionally, he gains 50/65/80% attack speed and 20% bonus movement speed for the duration.\nRank-ups increase ability duration and bonus attack speed.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is essentially a massive, albeit temporary steroid.  It makes Rafa an incredible duelist in 1v1 fights, and also allows him to literally melt single targets in team fights.\n\nSpecial thanks to Lalilulelo, a wonderful artist who I discovered while looking up reference images for Rafa.

If Rafa makes contact with these flames, he sets himself ablaze. He can then transfer these flames to his gauntlet, causing his next auto attack to deal bonus magic damage over 4 seconds. This effect stacks with each auto attack (so long as he is still ablaze) and the damage dealt scales with level and bonus AD. This is visualized by the flames surrounding him to be condensed and isolated to a single orb on his gauntlet.\nDesign Philosophy: A bulk of Rafa’s kit is based around his Passive. These ticks of magic damage essentially allow him to act as a DoT-based marksman, similar to Twitch. Since this damage stacks, Rafa synergizes incredibly well with attack speed.\n\n\n1) Aside from his ultimate, only way to generate fire for his passive are through his Q and E. \n\n\nA) His Q is OP, even without his passive. You say the trail follows them, does this mean that the whole trail lasts for 3.5 seconds? Or would it last for 7 seconds? (the flames follow the target, making new flames. Do these new flames also last for 3.5 seconds? If so, that would make this flames last for 7 seconds and would be amazingly powerful provided it has only a 7 second CD at max rank, which is lowered per level) You would have infinity flames on any target you want to take down at rank 1.\n\nAlso consider this: If built AP or AD, it would do incredible amounts of damage. Trail follows them first off, so if you were able to land this ability in a teamfight, every single enemy hit (even if not autoattacked) would take a total of (2.1 AP) damage over the duration or (2.1 AD) + the base damage over the duration. You say leveling his Q lowers the CD... if I were to play this character, I would abuse the hell out of this ability by building full AP because there is no way for them to escape the flames.) Is there a delay before the flames would appear? Or is the enemy constantly under fire? I would create a delay. This way, the enemy can stay out of the fire if they keep moving, and you can still continue to apply your passive on them.\n\n\nHow I would fix it: I like that it scales of of both AP and AD! I would drastically lower the ratios though, because the strength in this ability is not in how much damage it does, but how it constantly applies your passive to the enemy, allowing you to do more damage through your passive. I would also change the damage from dealing set damage (30 / 50 / 70 / 95 / 120) to doing % damage based on the enemy's max or current HP, similar to Brand's passive, every .5 seconds. I'd change the fire trail to where it would follow to enemies the 3.5 seconds then extinguish, all at the same time. I would also raise the CD to 12 seconds and lower it based on level to 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 seconds. It would still be up on targets ~35% of the time at max rank before getting CDR, allowing you to do a solid amount of damage in trades in bot lane. Also, I would make it to where there was a delay of about .25 seconds before the flames would actually appear where a target moved, that way the fires still followed them for 3.5 seconds and you still got your passive from it, but it didn't constantly apply the damage every .5 seconds of the ability. This would allow for counter-play\n\n\nB) His E would make him similar to Rengar in that, if his passive has no reset timer, he would destroy anyone he encounters in brushes. Which is cool! Again though, the AP ratio is extremely high. If the enemy was stunned/stood in the brush, he would take a total of 320% of your AP in damage, 80% every second. I like where it sits with a 12 second CD, I do not believe it would be balanced though if it were any lower. 12 seconds with max CD = a 7.6 second CD. Your lane opponent would almost never be allowed to enter a bush as is as you'd keep it lit up.\n\nHow I would fix it: Do not lower the CD of this ability based on level. Give this a similar treatment as your Q, but change it up a bit. Lower the AP ratio, even 30% could work, and do damage based on the enemy current missing health. Your Q would burn for damage based on their current/max health, and your E would burn them for their current missing health. This would make the bushes especially scary if your enemies were trying to run away from you and would showcase the different nature of the flames created by you Q and your E since they have different burn effects for different situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-27T08:29:20.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LifeCyclesTWA,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=iYuGdWxF,comment-id=001c,timestamp=2015-04-27T01:59:22.182+0000)\n>\n> I really, really like this champion! :] Major props!

I'm really glad you like Rafa- he is one of my favorite creations so far!\n\nI have two really simple things to say that unfortunately might negate a lot of what you wrote, unfortunately.\n\n1- The Q only leaves a trail of flame from Rafa's location when he fires an auto attack UP TO wherever that attack makes its point of contact.  The trail is only as long as the \"bullet's\" travel distance, so to speak.  It also doesn't set the target on fire; it's most similar to a Corki Valkyrie- an immobile patch of fire on the ground, only this is much thinner.  It's very unlikely that an enemy champion would stand in it for longer than 1-2 seconds per use.\n\n2- The AP ratios are written incorrectly relative to your expectations.  The ratios listed refer to the TOTAL DURATION's AP scaling.  So since E lasts 4 seconds, for example, it would deal 40% of Rafa's AP if the enemy stood there for the entire 4 second duration (which is again unlikely).  The damage here should be respectable but ultimately minimal in the grand scheme of things, a la Corki.\n\nAll that said, I do think changing E so that its cooldown doesn't scale with level might be a solid idea, and I'm really glad you like Rafa so much!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-17T08:31:18.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last bump for the night.

I really like the lore, but now I'm confused since I just read your most recent comment. So is it a tribe or a factory? I personally like the tribal aspect. I'd be interested to see interactions with Brand. Now this may just be me, but while I like the gauntlet idea, Ezreal already uses one. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean Rafa can't use one as well (since lots of people use swords and axes) but I feel like this is the perfect opportunity to have a sling user.\n\nThink about it. He comes from a tribal background (I think), and the sling could be made out of molten lava that heats the stones to an incredible level. This also would make sense for him being an ADC/Marksman. For his Q+when he's on fire, his sling would explode with flames as he throws it out and it'd be ablze. His W is just a pushback with his hands, so it wouldn't necessarily interact with the sling. Maybe he'd make a sweep with it horizontally, pushing hot air from the sling that would push enemies back. For his E, a pool of molten lava would pool into the sling as he lobs it at an area (that's what I think when I think of Nami bubble, a lob). For his ult, another cool animation would be him twirling his sling at a super high rate, thereby giving another visual cue for his ult being active. Plus, how badass would it be seeing a guy on fire chasing you zombie brand style while having that demented whooshwhooshwooshwhoosh sound trailing you. \n\nEdit: For his lore, you could say that the flame takes on different weapons. In this case, Rafa was a slinger, and when he proved his worth his the humble sling, the flame occupied the sling.

An enemy will never stand in the flame for long, and while the trail does proc your passive, it's just a DoT that isn't upfront damage (something an ADC needs). Maybe have it inflict bonus damage as well? Nothing big, but just enough to make him on par with other ADCs. I was going to suggest giving him bonus movement speed on the trail, but you added it to ult which is appreciated.\n\nW (Backdraft): Necessary self peel, I like it. Good interaction with passive.\n\nE (Wildfire): I'd make sure to give this move a long range, as if it's used to check bushes, the ADC should not have to put himself in danger if he's sacrificing an ability to do so. Also, 4 seconds isn't really that much for this zoning ability. I'd increase it to 10 seconds if it's applied to a bush (since it has fuel to burn more). This time is similar to Cass and Ziggs Poison/Mine zoning tools.\n\nR (Purify): YES YES YES! So glad you gave him movement speed@ So glad you gave him a much needed attack speed steroid!

I had been thinking about adding champion synergies and interactions but I wasn't sure if it would be well received or not.  There's a bit of a thematic break because The Flame truly is a special kind of entity and not just some random clump of fire.  I'm not sure if Rafa would be able to \"control\" or harness the fire being applied by his fellow champions.\n\nI think in this case it's best to stick with special interactions, dialogue, etc.  In fact, if anything I think it would be Brand, Annie, etc. who were jealous of Rafa and possibly don't respect him for merely using the power of this entity in combat, rather than harnessing or creating it himself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xane The Insane","date":"2015-03-10T19:40:45.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrm, I rather like the concept, passive has more than one application, and that the passive is duration based means you can spread the dot rather nicely.\nI'm also curious to see how some builds would turn out, I'm thinking a attack speed build along Runaan's and/or Wit's could destroy enemies rather quickly, although I have this suspicion the regular Crit->AttackSpeed->Arm Pen would dictate for quite some time. \nI'd like to see how he'd play in a solo lane where he'll have some more build freedom in addition to asserting bush dominance over some previously ruling champions(Think Garen, Rengar, Nidalee etc)\n\nNow, the only thing I'd be slightly concerned about is how he'd fair in a \"Drain-tank\" sort of fight, were both members just wail on each other, feels like against some lifesteal heavy opponents he might just die first with the opponent only maybe dying from the dots post-kill. \nOn a personal note, on a Playing Against basis, I rather like when a champ has their steroid attached to their ultimates, means it can feel powerful but you then also have a good window to strike back when it's down.\n\nOverall I'd like to see how he would play out, seems to be he'd have some fun pick off potential as well as being dangerous in jungle choke holds, yet slightly suspicious he would take time finding a place with the player base in terms of role or lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T02:43:25.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xane The Insane,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=iYuGdWxF,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-10T19:40:45.255+0000)\n>\n> Hrm, I rather like the concept, passive has more than one application, and that the passive is duration based means you can spread the dot rather nicely.\n> I'm also curious to see how some builds would turn out, I'm thinking a attack speed build along Runaan's and/or Wit's could destroy enemies rather quickly, although I have this suspicion the regular Crit->AttackSpeed->Arm Pen would dictate for quite some time. \n> I'd like to see how he'd play in a solo lane where he'll have some more build freedom in addition to asserting bush dominance over some previously ruling champions(Think Garen, Rengar, Nidalee etc)\n> \n> Now, the only thing I'd be slightly concerned about is how he'd fair in a \"Drain-tank\" sort of fight, were both members just wail on each other, feels like against some lifesteal heavy opponents he might just die first with the opponent only maybe dying from the dots post-kill. \n> On a personal note, on a Playing Against basis, I rather like when a champ has their steroid attached to their ultimates, means it can feel powerful but you then also have a good window to strike back when it's down.\n> \n> Overall I'd like to see how he would play out, seems to be he'd have some fun pick off potential as well as being dangerous in jungle choke holds, yet slightly suspicious he would take time finding a place with the player base in terms of role or lane.\n\nHi Xane, thanks so much for your detailed and uniquely focused feedback!\n\nI love your thoughts about Rafa being played as a top laner with dominant bush control.

Regarding Rafa's lore:\n\n> I definitely took some creative liberties and pushed things further down the tech route than ever before.  The theme I was going for was this mysterious lab or factory that is hidden away in the mountains.  Nobody in Runaterra know that it's there and thus they've been able to operate uninterrupted for centuries.  If you look at a town like Piltover or Bandle City, there is definitely a lot of tech and industry going on there.  Maybe I oversold it but Jayce has a technologically transforming hammer that they built in a lab, and then there's scientific experiments like Zac.  I think a few industrial revolution-era steampunk robots aren't that farfetched.\n\n>Also, to be clear- Rafa and his village have no technical understanding or grasp of what the machinations really are.  They live in total isolation from the rest of Runaterra and have never seen \"technology\" before.  This is why they believe that the \"monsters\" that they're hunting and killing are some sort of demons or trials sent to them by their deity.  Think of it like a Fern Gully kind of story.  Their village are nestled against the base of the mountains.  This mysterious and ominous \"factory\" are up in the mountains themselves.
