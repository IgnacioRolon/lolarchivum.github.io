{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-11T11:26:24.404+0000","title":"Penrose, Pride of Bilgewater","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Role**: Marskman, AD Caster\n\n**Inspiration**: I wanted to create a champion that used a very unique weapon or system of weapons in combat; in this case, bladed tops and a whip.\n\n**General Design Philosophy**: Penrose, or Penny, is a unique new type of ADC with the ability to toss bladed tops out onto the battlefield, which spin in place wherever she casts them.  Penny can then auto attack these tops with her whips to continually rev them up, creating zones of whirling death.  Overall, Penny relies heavily on the positioning and maintenance of her spinning tops to deal sustained AoE damage to enemies.  She has no real steroids or escapes, which puts her more in a role of an AD caster than a true hyper carry.\n\n**Risk Analysis**: Low.  Penrose has a fun, upbeat and universally loved theme, with completely new combat mechanics backing it up.  Her biggest challenge is in balancing the risk/reward of maintaining/supervising her tops and ensuring that they provide fun and rewarding play and counterplay opportunities.\n\n**Appearance**: A young woman from Bilgewater with a slender frame. She shares similar fashion and mannerisms to Graves and is for all intents and purposes a steampunk cowgirl. She uses a whip/lasso in combat as well as two steampunk spinning tops with blades adorning the sides.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/JessieToyStoryfull436849_zps4108f25e.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/4d8670c632899a450dd7c6e1782edddf_zps440a045e.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/veronica-steampunk-real-girls-dont-rust_zps454ea983.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/Cowgirl____Take_II_by_fishcapades_zpsd589f3e9.jpg\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/1321108083m_SPLASH_zps2939c925.jpg\n\n**Lore**: Penrose, or Penny for short, is Bilgewater’s premiere entertainer and the pride of the whole town.  She can wrestle alligators better than the local fishermen and wear the prettiest gown to the ball all in the same night.  The town adores Penny and she’s all the merrier to be a part of it all.    Her most famous and popular act involves a daunting display of precision and danger, as she winds up deadly bladed tops using a whip in front of huge crowds.\n\nGrateful, youthful, adventurous and humble, Penny’s a class act who jumped at the opportunity to join the League, eager to have a little fun entertaining the largest crowd Runaterra has to offer.\n\n**Joke/Taunt**: \"Let 'er *whip*!\" (Thanks Okido for this suggestion!)\n\n**Strengths**: Powerful and indefinite zone control/denial, AoE slow, targeted knockback, consistent damage threat\n\n**Weaknesses**: slow damage ramp-up and virtually no burst, no escapes or mobility steroids, low defensive stats\n\n**Plays Most Like...**: {{champion:119}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:412}} \n\n**Auto Attack**: A ranged attack using her whip, although this range is quite short (525).\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15537_pas_zps02b599ed.jpg\n**Passive- Friction Burn**:  Auto attacking a top causes Penrose's whip to catch on fire, causing her next auto attack to deal bonus magic damage, which scales with her level.\n**Design Philosophy**: This ability is designed to reinforce and reward the gameplay pattern of continually whipping the tops to extend their spin cycle.  Effective Penrose players will be able to alternate auto attacks between the enemy and their tops to maximize DPS.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_11209_pas_zps1c6b459b.jpg\n**Q- Spinning Top (10 sec)**: Penrose tosses a spinning bladed top to a target location, dealing physical damage as it lands and slowing nearby enemies by 70% for 1.5 second. The top will then continue to spin for 10 seconds, dealing minor physical damage to any enemies caught in the blades’ path. Penrose can have up to two spinning tops on the field at once, but they cannot overlap and will bounce harmlessly off of each other if they collide. Casting the ability a third time causes the older of the two tops to disappear. Tops last indefinitely and cannot be targeted by enemies. Recalling or dying causes the tops to despawn. Penrose can auto attack these tops with her whip, winding them up and causing them to spin for an additional 6 seconds, reactivating their ability to deal damage. The tops grant vision.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is what Penny’s kit revolves around.  The slowing component allows her to chase opponents down once she has landed the top onto them, as well as allows the top to get in some additional ticks of damage before the enemy can manage to escape from it.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_15731_btn_zpsa8702e1e.jpg\n**W- Whiplash (8 sec)**: Penrose cracks her whip in a line as a 900 range skillshot, dealing 100/150/215/280/350 (+80% AD) physical damage and pushing any tops the whip connects with forward a fixed distance. This ability has a significant wind-up time, similar to Thresh's Death Sentence or Caitlyn’s Piltover Peacemaker. Tops that are pushed retain their previous state, meaning that a spinning top will continue spinning while being pushed and vice versa. If a pushed top connects with an enemy, they take a small amount of physical damage and are slowed by 70% for 1 second, regardless of if it’s spinning or not.\nRank-ups increase damage significantly.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a powerful ability with a wind-up time to compensate for its heavy damage.  It’s best used as a follow-up to a stun or root in lane, from someone like Nami or Taric.  It also allows Penny to push her tops deep into enemy lines, similarly to Syndra pushing her orbs to activate a stun.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_16183_pas_zpsf0f0b7ef.jpg\n**E- Wrangle (14 sec)**: Penrose targets an enemy with her lasso and pulls them a fixed distance toward her, dealing physical damage in the process. (The further away the target is, the further away they will remain after being pulled. A close range target will likely be pulled into melee range of Penrose.)  Alternatively, Penny can Wrangle one of her spinning tops, which are pulled in the same fashion.  While this ability also momentarily disables Penny, she can still cast Whirling Dervish while pulling her selected target.\nRank-ups lower cooldown and increase damage.\n**Design Philosophy**: Wrangle offers a lot of utility, acting as both a way to manage Penny’s tops as well as pinning enemies down inside an active top.  Penny can cast her Ultimate during this ability to help streamline the combo of wrangling someone into her tops.\n\nhttp://i1298.photobucket.com/albums/ag47/Lutzburg/icons_7882_pas_zpsb7d49e58.jpg\n**R- Whirling Dervish (50 sec)**: Penrose causes any tops on the battlefield to overclock, extending additional blades and automatically causing them to spin for 10 seconds. In addition, this roughly doubles their range of attack and damage.\nRank-ups increase damage and lower cooldown.\n**Design Philosophy**: This is a simple and effective Ultimate designed to offset the complex rotations and skillshots needed to optimize the rest of Penny’s kit.  It essentially acts as a steroid for her tops, granting her immense but temporary power when successfully positioning her tops during a battle.\n\nIf you liked this Champion, you can find over 70 more of my original concepts [HERE!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat&page=1)","replies":[{"poster":"TrentBatNA","date":"2015-01-11T11:38:02.593+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There needs to be a skin where the top is replaced by Garen","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-11T11:44:26.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TrentBatNA,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=2dpWAp45,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-11T11:38:02.593+0000)\n>\n> There needs to be a skin where the top is replaced by Garen\n\nHaha, that's awesome.

I love the idea of Penny being the \"pet\" champion you mentioned.  As far as your suggestion, I don't think it's necessary to do for Penny.  With champions like Azir, his abilities cannot function whatsoever without soldiers being there first.  Even though Penny's W and E can interact with her tops, they have additional functionality that she may want to leverage during levels 1-3 that don't require them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-07-02T18:32:11.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got a lot of pride for Penny, so why not give her another chance to shine?","replies":[{"poster":"GoodHotFreshFly","date":"2015-07-14T00:22:54.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=2dpWAp45,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2015-07-02T18:32:11.381+0000)\n>\n> I've got a lot of pride for Penny, so why not give her another chance to shine?\n\nHi Lutzburg!

They grant vision because they're a physical object that belongs to the allied team in some capacity, in the same way that Heimer's turrets are.  Yes, enemies caught in the range essentially take damage every .25 seconds that they're within its range of whirling death.  I'm not sure what the radius is... probably 150-200 units?\n\nYes, love the Beyblade reference!\n\nI think Azir is quite different from Penny, but I did see enough similarities to add him to the list of champions she plays like.  Honestly I think she's pretty damn unique in her own right, and none of the champions I listed fit her that well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nauthes","date":"2015-01-11T19:48:41.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only issue is auto attacking the tops.\n\nIf you auto the top then you're not autoing the enemy champion.

Of course, she can auto attack a top when she's not in range of an enemy and then push/pull the top into an enemy as she's running to them.  She can also automatically rev her tops with her Ultimate, so she definitely has tools at her disposal to compensate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-11T19:24:42.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today's the day that Penny is gonna shine brighter than her own namesake!","replies":[]}]}
