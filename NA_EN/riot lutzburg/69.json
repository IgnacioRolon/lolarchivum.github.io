Thanks to everyone for your feedback!  This kind of thing is highly subjective and varies for all sorts of reasons.  We ultimately agreed that the burden of asking players to re-learn spells was too high of a cost, even though there were benefits to the changes (especially for new players).\n\nHi everyone,\n\nFor the last few weeks, the team and I have been experimenting with a potential change to the way a handful of area-based spells work.  To explain, let's use Miss Fortune's E as an example:\n\nIn the LIVE game, casting E outside of its maximum cast range will cause Miss Fortune to move towards the desired target area, then automatically cast the spell.  On PBE, this spell (and the others listed below) will be \"constrained to cast range.\"  This means that, if cast outside of max cast range, the spell will instantly be cast at max cast range instead.\n\n> **Why are we trying this?  Here are our goals:**\n> \n> 1. Create a more intuitive and instinctive aiming experience for players\n> 2. Create a higher percentage of \"success cases\" when these spells are cast\n> 3. Preserve player mastery opportunities and skill-based aiming\n\nAfter a bit of internal testing, we came up with a list of criteria to help inform which spells could benefit from this change.  From there, we arrived at the list we're pushing to the PBE for player feedback:\n\n* Heimerdinger E and RE\n* Miss Fortune E\n* Singed W\n* Twitch W\n* Varus E\n* Ziggs E\n* **GANGPLANK E**\n* **VIKTOR W**\n* **SYNDRA Q**\n\n**Couple of notes and thoughts to consider:**\n\nThese changes are highly subjective, and there will be a meaningful cost of \"re-learning\" how these spells work.  We're willing to accept a little bit of this cost, but not much.  If reactions are mixed or negative, we'll revert them.  This is an experiment, after all.\n\nThat sentiment is especially true for the last three spells written in **BOLD**, which we think are riskier than the rest.  These were changed to potentially alleviate player input issues with things like Gangplank's barrel combos and Syndra's Q/E hit confirms.  We're especially interested in how these feel to players who play these Champions a lot, so please let us know your thoughts!\n\nThanks,\n\n-Lutzburg","replies":[{"poster":"Shnabbydoodle","date":"2019-10-22T18:11:13.334+0000","up_votes":122,"down_votes":2,"body":"If this gets pushed to live, please let it be an OPTION in the gameplay tab.

Whilst I appreciate the ones that are being changed, I won't be happy until I can play completely without it. I just personally prefer any non-unit-target skill to come out on the frame I input it, it's a skillshot in my mind.\n\nWhen I press a button to cast any \"non-unit-target\" (i.e. skillshot) ability, it is because I am confident that it is within range to land. **This includes champions at the edge of a ground target ability AoE**.  However, when casting with max-range cast on, if I want to land the skillshot immediately, I have to cast it short of the enemy champion. This is always more frustrating for me.\n\nThe \"wall\" scenario is the worst one though. If I want to cast at max-range and there is a wall between me and the enemy champion, pathing may choose for me to head **away** from the enemy in order to path into range, completely ruining my play despite the fact I was probably **right** about the ability being in range.\n\nThere is simply never a case where I want to wait until my champion is in range of the *center* of the ability AoE. I think about range in terms of edges, rather than centers. It's also just a source of clunkiness when learning a champion; it's a dealbreaker on Orianna for me.\n\nIn fact, I really don't think I can hammer my point home enough, whilst I 100% believe people's reasons to want to keep this setup on champions they have mastered (that is their preference), those reasons will **never** apply to me. It's not a matter of trade-offs and small preferences that can be compromised on; if an ability, has max-range constraining, it **will* frustrate me. I am so, SOOO happy you are removing it from my main boi Singed, it is my least favorite part of his kit.\n\nIt's 100% preference, there is no objectively better way. Changing some existing abilities for everyone is just going to frustrate many players with mastery, which they absolutely don't deserve, and it still won't satisfy those who prefer it the other way in general. If this is being held back for \"game design ideology\" (this exists and I have had many IRL arguments with game designers about it) as opposed to \"don't want to commit engineering effort\" reasons, then I am begging you to reconsider.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pylot","date":"2019-10-23T06:32:35.371+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding this to Zilean Q would be a massive QoL buff to him, please look into it.

I can correct my own movement but want reliable ability aiming. Imagine trying to play AP Kog with this. I'm already far enough back that it's OK for me to move a few steps to hit at max range. However, it is NOT OK for me to waste R and get the mana penalty while hitting absolutely nothing. \n\nPlease do not make the new behavior default. It ruins precision and makes some champions feel terrible. Let's say I'm trying to steal baron with AP Kog R and am not quite in range so it just wastes it at the Baron wall. That would be unintuitive and annoying. For some champions I suppose it can be more reasonable but then you have one set of rules for part of the roster and another for the rest. That inconsistency only adds to the learning curve when switching champions and the arbitrary nature of it seems clunky/unintuitive.
