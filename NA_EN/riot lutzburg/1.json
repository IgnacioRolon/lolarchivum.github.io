My name is Lutzburg, and I recently joined Riot as a Champion Designer. We're doing a quality-of-life pass for one of League’s oldest champions, Malphite, for the near future. While we're largely considering these changes as quality-of-life updates, we're also making a few mechanical changes to modernize Malphite’s kit without taking away that rock-solid reliability he’s known for. We'd appreciate feedback on the changes! For more context, we had two **high level goals**:\n\n1. Improve the visceral satisfaction of Malphite’s abilities (i.e. make it more fun to push buttons!) W in particular was unsatisfying to use, as it lacked an immediate impact and its long duration made it hard to appreciate its power\n2. Retain Malphite’s broadly appealing accessibility and reliable team-fighting prowess\n\n**Full Changelist**\n\n**Passive - Granite Shield**\nMalphite now glows when his Shield regenerates. This should make it more clear when Malphite has access to his Shield as a combat resource\nMalphite’s size now scales with his Armor! Become a literal mountain like you always dreamed of\n\n**Q - Seismic Shard**\n1. Range increased from 625 >>> 700\n2. Missile speed increased from 1200 >>> 1400 (and spawns closer to its target on cast)\n3. Cast time increased from 0.25 seconds >>> 0.4 seconds\n4. AP Scaling reduced from 0.6 >>> 0.4 \n5. Malphite no longer “steals” his target’s movement speed. Instead Malphite now slows his target by 20/25/30/35/40% and increases his own movement speed by 20/25/30/35/40% \n6. Speed duration reduced from 4 seconds >>> 3 seconds\n7. Malphite no longer summons his earthen saw blade from behind himself, and instead casts it from his right arm. This also increases how fast the missile reaches its target\n8. Targets affected by Q are covered in a molten rock effect for the duration of the slow\n9. Other miscellaneous values adjusted. Too many to mention in detail here, but overall this Ability should have more weight to it and ‘feel’ like a rock monster hurling a chunk of Summoner’s Rift at his opponents\n\n_Q saw a ton of micro tweaks that should amount to a more satisfying and useful button press. Malphite should now have an easier time reaching (or fleeing) targets affected by his cheese wheel o’ death._\n\n**W - Thunderclap (renamed from Brutal Strikes) **\n1. On cast, Malphite resets his auto attack and deals 40/55/70/85/100 bonus Physical damage, scaling with 0.2 armor and 0.4 AP\n2. In addition, Malphite’s auto attacks create ‘aftershocks’ for the next 6 seconds (including the initial AA reset). These are frontal cleaves (think Titanic Hydra) that deal 10/20/30/40/50 physical damage to all enemies in range of the cone, scaling with 0.1 armor and 0.2 AP\n3. REMOVED - Malphite no longer gains 3x his bonus armor while his shield holds\n4. Still grants +10/15/20/25/30% Armor permanently\n\n_Brutal Strikes wasn’t fun to use, and its power was hard to appreciate. The AA reset creates some room for optimization without requiring too much mind share, and the cleave gives Malphite something to do after unloading his wombo. Conveniently, it also helps Malphite farm under tower in bad lane matchups (which are most of them.)_\n\n_To balance out all this new power, we had to remove Malphite’s 3x armor multiplier. While it was fun to see huge armor numbers, this passive component wasn’t practical enough to justify keeping. Since a lot of Malphite’s damage scales with armor, it was also inadvertently increasing his burst potential when building full tank. However, these changes are designed to be burst-NEUTRAL, as Thunderclap’s initial hit will make up for the highly situational damage that was lost._\n\n**R - Unstoppable Force**\n1. Malphite’s Base Skin now features an impact crater. IT CAN’T BE STOPPED!\n\nWe’re currently exploring the possibility of upgrading Malphite’s abilities' VFX to coincide with this gameplay update. So as always, keep in mind that everything in the above list is tentative, including any new VFX you see on PBE. Let us know your thoughts!\n\n-Lutz\n\n{{champion:54}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-05-03T17:53:20.050+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":6,"body":"Passive changes are ok..\n\nThe Q changes are ok...

Not so much, old W gave more damage per AA.\nIt will work for quick melee ranged trades, Q, then walk in for the AA reset and E for a steronger burst than now, and if you stay for AAs it's close to live(probably a bit better since the dps loss on W isn't very noticeable early on with low armor and W rank 1)\n\nWhat will be noticeable is the lower aoe burst as he won't have the heavily increased armor for his first E and some W procs after ult, while the new AA reset is only singletarget(atleast is says nothing about aoe on the **initial **attack)\n\nHe also looses some freeze and waveclear potential with less aoe from W and no longer increased armor while the passive is up.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-05-03T20:56:38.206+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sire Hippington,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=WpJn3mE8,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2019-05-03T20:44:15.931+0000)\n>\n> What will be noticeable is the lower aoe burst as he won't have the heavily increased armor for his first E and some W procs after ult, while the new AA reset is only singletarget(atleast is says nothing about aoe on the **initial **attack)\n> \n\nThe initial auto attack from the reset creates an aftershock, too.  That means that casting W and connecting with an enemy damages them in three ways simultaneously- Malphite's normal AA damage, the bonus \"Thunderclap\" damage that scales with AP and Armor, and the aftershock AoE (which also scales with AP and Armor).  In addition, by making it all Physical damage, lane opponents will have a harder time itemizing against Malphite with pure MR.\n\nThe end result is that W's damage is way up compared to Live, at this current tuning.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Endorcer","date":"2019-05-03T18:13:09.926+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Big Malphite enthusiast here, love the ol' rock monster guy. And most of these changes are things that I approve of, but I feel like I have to voice my opinion on some details of this list. \n\n1. Malphite is the only champion in the game with a legitimate movement speed stealing effect. This allows the malphite player to use Q more creatively in skirmishes or fights, targeting the champion with more movespeed or mobility, allowing himself to use that level of quick thinking and planning to his advantage by getting the most out of the situation. This change completely removes that sort of interaction, and i'm also worried whether it's going to make malphite too easy to kite or run away from when he doesn't happen to have his ultimate up. \n\n2. The passive armor increase, while can be looked at as a simple stat bonus that you could slap your opponent with, made Malphite's passive more interactive for both Malphite, and his opponent. It makes a lane situation much more exciting and allows for more skill expression, depending on who wants to do what, whether Malphite wants to preserve his shield, or his opponent wants to destroy it, and what moves and sacrifices come with that sort of standoff. While i agree that it could be tuned down in order to avoid malphite being overly oppressive into certain ad laners, it's removal isn't warranted, considering the recent rampancy of true damage in the game, along with ap toplaners and well, very effective counters to malphite. If i run through the numbers between brutal strikes and thunderclap, this seems like an overall nerf to malphite in terms of both defense and damage, and he's already in a fairly odd or even weak spot both in terms of soloq and proplay. Honestly, it would be fine if the passive armor increase without the shield was removed, but removing it from the shield makes his passive and consequently his kit very, very dull and uninteractive.\n\nDo tell me if i'm wrong, but the passive armor increase ins't removed, only that bonus being tripled when Malph's passive is up, right?\n\nEdit: My overall point is, I love the updates to his visuals and his \"SMOCK\" factor as an idea, but at the same time I feel like this update takes away more from the depth and enjoyment of Malphite than it gives. I as a player would have less room to make creative, smart moves with this updated version of the monolith.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-05-04T02:44:19.340+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey gang!  Thanks again for all the kind words, support and insightful conversations based around these changes.  As we always try to mention, the PBE is often used for experimental stuff that we want the community's feedback on.  You all made a few things VERY clear today and I'm super appreciative and receptive to your concerns.\n\n**As a result, I'm happy to share a new iteration of Malphite, which should be hitting PBE around Monday midday (PST)**.  Sadly it can't be sooner, as we don't push things to PBE over the weekend.\n\n**Revisions:**\n\n* Q- AP scaling reverted to .6 from .4\n* Q- fixed a typo regarding the cast time (was written as .5, is actually .4)\n* Q- adjusted the animation considerably to look/feel less clunky\n* W- 3x Armor multiplier when Granite Shield is active has been REINSTATED\n* W- the bonus damage on the initial Thunderclap hit has had its ratios reduced to compensate (.3 AP from .4) and (.15 Armor from .2)\n* VFX updates on Passive shield regeneration, Q missile/trench, W up-time/impact, E and R (**BASE SKIN ONLY FOR NOW**)\n\n**Context:**\n\nQ- Believe it or not, these changes were specifically designed not to nerf AP burst mage builds.  We felt like the combination of extra Q range and bonus AP scaling on W would be perceived as a win here.  Since that wasn't the case, I'm reverting the AP scaling on Q but nerfing the new W's ratio to compensate.\n\nAnd while I personally do think that Q spam is a little unhealthy, those who came before me were smart enough to gate it behind a high mana cost.  I still think this is an elegant solution because the ability is most oppressive in the early game, and its gating mechanism slowly evaporates as Malphite levels up and purchases a mana item.  Hopefully this will satiate all the cheese wheelers out there without frustrating your opponents too much.  :)\n\nW- We underestimated how attached players would be to the 3x Armor multiplier.  As a designer, it felt a little tacked on, and granted power in fairly obscure ways.  However, there's no denying that preserving Malphite's niche as THE anti-AD tank is important to all of you.  It's clearly a resonate fantasy and one I'm happy to bring back.\n\n**Clear-Ups**\n\nA few common questions/concerns have come up, so let's address them here!\n\n* Malphite's abilities won't gain range based on his size- sorry!  I wanted to do this, but it was OP OP\n\n\n* The initial AA reset from Thunderclap triggers an Aftershock.  This means it deals three instances of damage simultaneously; the AA, Thunderclap bonus damage, and Aftershock AoE damage.  The result is a pretty meaty burst of damage!\n\n\n* The new speed differential between Malphite and his target are significantly buffed.  Assuming you Q a target with 400 MS on LIVE, the delta between you would be ~225.  In this iteration, that delta explodes to 350+ once you get some boots.  The combination of a longer range Q, easier target accessibility, and improved burst damage from W should allow Malphite to participate in skirmishes and team fights without always relying on his R.\n\n\n* Scope for this project was super limited, and for good reason.  I'm still new, I'm learning the tools, and bandwidth from art/tech was already accounted for in our project pipeline.  Maybe Malphite will get a full VGU in the future, and maybe I'll be the one to do it, but that's currently not in our slate.  ...Get it?  Slate?  Cuz he's a-- nevermind.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Next week I'd like to add a check to Q that uses your target's move speed if the amount you'd steal from them would make you faster than the base values.  This preserves my goal of making Q consistently good, while retaining the playmaking potential of stealing from a particularly fast foe\n* We'll also be monitoring Malphite's overall damage output/power.  I'm happy to reinstate the things you guys said were important to you, but that likely means that Malphite is now overtuned.  Please keep in mind that we'll likely have to trim power from _somewhere_.\n\nKeep the discussion going!  I'll be active here and on Twitter over the weekend.\n\n-Lutz","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2019-05-03T18:03:58.648+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"This looks like a nerf too me.\n\nQ has 0.25 extra cast time, that desnt help chase.

As this is my first public project at Riot, the sudden exposure has hit me like a Malphite ult, so I apologize for not being able to answer everyone individually.  Lots of great comments being made here, so I wanted to add more context to some of the biggest talking points I've seen so far:\n\n**Power and Build Paths**- these changes aren't meant to nerf Malphite.  He actually has one of the healthiest and most balanced win rates and play rates in the game, if you look at it holistically.  If the values are off, we will definitely adjust.  As a goal of the project, AP and jungle builds are meant to be power neutral, too.\n\n**Triple Armor Buff**- For clarity, Malphite's W would still permanently increase his Armor by 10/15/20/25/30%.  It was only the 3x multiplier when he had his shield that was on the chopping block.  Seeing \"900 Armor\" is a fun aspect of his fantasy, though, and it's clear that people really loved socking it to those AD-heavy teams.  Finding a way to bring this back in some form is my #1 takeaway from the feedback so far, so stay tuned on this one.\n\n**VGU versus Small Scale Updates**- For context, I was given a unique opportunity to work on a Champion I thought could use some love, partially as a way to ramp myself up with the tools and processes of the team.  Since I'm so new to the company, it didn't make sense to upend everyone's existing pipelines and schedules to accommodate my experimental side project.  While we obviously feel like there are plenty of Champions who could use larger scale reworks, this was a low risk, low scope way of helping Malphite out with the resources I had available to me.\n\n**VFX Updates**- One of our amazing VFX Artists was nice enough to sneak some Malphite work into his existing work schedule.  He hasn't gotten to all of them yet, but it's already looking awesome and should be on the PBE next week.  Keep in mind that you'll only see these on the BASE SKIN for the time being.\n\n**Next Steps**- I'm going to put together a revised proposal later today- stay tuned!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kraken Knight","date":"2019-05-03T18:05:10.177+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm really sadenned by the removal of the x3 armor, that was my greatest pleasure playing malph.

His growth spurt now caps out at ~700 Armor\n\n**Q- Seismic Shard**\n\n* AP ratio reverted to LIVE value\n* Cast time reverted to LIVE value\n* Q now checks if \"stealing\" move speed would result in a faster Malphite, and uses that value in the rare cases when it does\n\n**W- Thunderclap**\n\n* The much beloved 3x Armor multiplier has been retained\n* Mana cost increased to 30 from 25\n* W's sustained damage and dueling potential was listed as a major red flag during internal testing, so it's seen a number of nerfs over the last two weeks\n\n**E- Ground Slam**\n\n* Mana cost decreased by 10 at all ranks\n\n**Base Stats**\n\nHere's the Base Stat clean-up I'm trying; definitely no promises that these will all make it through, as they're almost all buffs and we're worried this update is already pushing Malphite pretty far.

Just as growing stronger is a deeply psychological desire, growing in size provides similar satisfaction on a pretty subconscious level.  In fact, this change has gotten some of the most positive feedback out of everything once players try it in-game.  If you're building Armor you're probably a tank, so absorbing skill shots and making it easier to have damage directed at you can actually be considered a buff.  AP Malphite is unaffected because they aren't building Armor (except maybe Zhonya's) but the size increase should be negligible for them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2019-05-15T14:50:42.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  the definitive anti-AD tank\n\nJust for clarity, I thought that was Rammus's role?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-05-15T19:46:23.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=WpJn3mE8,comment-id=00800006,timestamp=2019-05-15T14:50:42.993+0000)\n>\n> Just for clarity, I thought that was Rammus's role?\n\nThis may be semantics, but I'd consider Rammus to be the anti AUTO ATTACK tank.

Appreciate the continued discussion around Malphite; clearly he holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts as one of the first Champions they ever played.  I have a small update with where we're at:\n> \n> 1. We're effectively mechanics-locked as of the latest iteration, and have entered the tuning/number tweaking phase\n> \n> \n> 2. To that end, yesterday I did some bug fixes and am currently testing a minor Base Stat clean-up.  Those should be on the PBE today\n> \n> \n> 3. Riot Beardilocks did an amazing job on updating Malphite's VFX across all his skins- check them out if you haven't had the chance!\n> \n> \n> 4. Since this is an opportunistic change list, we still don't have a specific release patch in mind.  Stay tuned!\n> \n> While not exhaustive, here's a breakdown of some of the major revisions I've made since posting the original change list.  Still seeing a lot of people talking about outdated values and mechanics, so I'd like to dispel some of that now.\n> \n> **Passive- Granite Shield**\n> \n> * Size scaling has been refactored to account for the massive Armor values Malphite can get through his W.  His growth spurt now caps out at ~700 Armor\n> \n> **Q- Seismic Shard**\n> \n> * AP ratio reverted to LIVE value\n> * Cast time reverted to LIVE value\n> * Q now checks if \"stealing\" move speed would result in a faster Malphite, and uses that value in the rare cases when it does\n> \n> **W- Thunderclap**\n> \n> * The much beloved 3x Armor multiplier has been retained\n> * Mana cost increased to 30 from 25\n> * W's sustained damage and dueling potential was listed as a major red flag during internal testing, so it's seen a number of nerfs over the last two weeks\n> \n> **E- Ground Slam**\n> \n> * Mana cost decreased by 10 at all ranks\n> \n> **Base Stats**\n> \n> Here's the Base Stat clean-up I'm trying; definitely no promises that these will all make it through, as they're almost all buffs and we're worried this update is already pushing Malphite pretty far.  Goal was to further solidify Malphite as the definitive anti-AD tank while indirectly nerfing his late-game AA damage potential, which was getting pretty nuts when building Triforce + Wit's End.\n> \n> * Attack Speed growth reduced to 3 from 3.4\n> * Base Armor increased to 40 from 37\n> * Armor growth increased to 4 from 3.75\n> * HP rounded up to 575 from 574.2\n> \n> {{champion:54}} \n> -Lutz\n\nHow about his mana pool?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-05-15T00:13:25.690+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rule,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=WpJn3mE8,comment-id=00800003,timestamp=2019-05-14T22:59:11.928+0000)\n>\n> How about his mana pool?\n\nE costs 10 less, which should help traditional tank/fighter Malphites in top as it's their primary tool to survive the lane.

It already feels bad to be charging in to gank someone and stop to cast your slow, to have the stop increased will make him feel more clunky, combined with people ducking into FOW as it gets cast and cancelling it, opening that window up is going to be annoying.\n\nThe Loss of the movement speed steal removes one of my personal favorite bits of mini strategy in the game. When ganking bot, do you use it on the ADC or the Sup, does one of them have boots? Does one of them have a movespeed buff up at that moment? Do I just want to leverage the slow? Making it a flat slow/speedup removes that interaction and strategy. Is it a teamfight and they have an ulting Yi? Make him pay and zoom around yourself!\n\nReducing the amount of time the speed buff lasts will also make it harder to stick to opponents, since his other abilities don't grant him target access or stickyness (no tenacity increases, no other speed buffs, no other slows, ONLY the ult) reducing the amount of time he goes fast will just make it harder for him to get to people.\n\n**W thoughts:**\nPlease don't change the name! I personally happen to love it\n\nThe loss of the armor boost (the 3x one) removed an interesting bit of strategy. Similar to how Garen can use an ability to increase his tankyness, being able to temporarily make yourself vastly more defensive was a huge plus in certain matchups. Also curious how this will effect the jungle clear as for the duration you took less damage from monsters and I'm a little afraid he'll eat a lot more from camps especially during his early clears.\n\nI personally don't want him to be a burst champ, he's a tanky and I think as a Living Mountain as you have emphasized, he should be focused around being tanky, not doing high damage. Removing a tanky tool makes me frustrated, as it leads me to have one less actually interesting tank interaction in the game.\n\n**Other thoughts**\nMalphite's a mountain, he doesn't need to throw a quick stone, I'd take a longer travel time and a larger slow personally. He's a mountain, I'll take a tankyness increase over a burst/damage leveling any time. HE'S a MOUNTAIN, when he builds armor it's like making it harder for people to climb over him, so they should take more damage from his abilities OVER TIME, not in a burst. HE'S a mountain, he wears people down, and then crushes them in an avalanche (unstoppable force), not just through a mountain at them.\n\nI appreciate that you are looking at him, and I'm glad you are taking feedback before committing the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-05-04T03:21:14.268+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rastarogue,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=WpJn3mE8,comment-id=0056,timestamp=2019-05-04T02:52:57.953+0000)\n> \n> I appreciate that you are looking at him, and I'm glad you are taking feedback before committing the changes.\n\nThank you for taking the time to write this up, you're clearly a seasoned and passionate Malphite player!  We're in a weird spot because Malphite is so old, and beloved by so many.  He also comes with a LOT of baggage, which means we can't do a lot of things we'd do if we were designing a brand new Champion from scratch.  Thematically there is a big disconnect between \"literal mountain\" and squishy burst mage that turns himself into a missile.  But that's what he is to many of our players, so we have to work within those constraints.\n\nBelieve me, I think it's a missed opportunity for sure!  If I had my way, mega Gnar's Q should have been Malphite's Q.  He should be tossing hunks of Summoner's Rift around like it's nothing because he is LITERALLY Summoner's Rift.  Imagine if the entire battle took place on his shoulder or something, straight out of Final Fantasy or God of War.  Alas, sometimes we've gotta work with what we've got.  :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DefiantNipple","date":"2019-05-03T18:47:16.090+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like nerfs.  I'm especially unhappy about the Q AP ratio going down and the cast time going up - the ability to build AP on Malphite is really fun and necessary in a lot of matchups, and the Q damage is very important for that because how else can he all-in ranged champs without poking them a bit first?  These Q changes are not a good trade for a longer range and faster missile speed.  I like the W giving an auto-attack reset, but I dislike the armor being removed while the ability is in use.  It might be cool to have give him dramatically higher armor for a BRIEF moment, so that he can use W to block an AD ability the way Garen can.
