If you are so good, you should have been able to notice it like you suggest.\n\nReally, your argument against it isnt all that great. You need to keep track of the minion wave, yasuo, his Q counts, trying to figure out if he landed one or not, the minimap, etc. \n\nThere are players who play on lower visual settings and without their volume on or are just listening to music instead.
