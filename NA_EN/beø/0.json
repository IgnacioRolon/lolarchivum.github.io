How to report outside of game.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me, how do you even report players outside of the game. Like two people just send me a link telling me that riot decided to give out free mystery chest. The links were false and made to look like the real one so that if I'd sign in, they would take my password. I'm smart enough to not type in my password, but others might. How do I report these people? I tried to submit a request at Riot Game Support, but none of the requests were about scammers, c'mon dude.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T17:04:23.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sending in a report via a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) was the right path to take.
