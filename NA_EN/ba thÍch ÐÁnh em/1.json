But when I got on, it said in the Quests that I had redeemed it already. I checked my orders and it said no orders were placed, does this mean I can no longer purchase the jacket?\n\nEdit: It isn't in my shopping bag either.\nEdit: It now shows up in my orders, but it is cancelled, still says \"Redeemed\" in the quests.","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT NBS","date":"2016-08-11T05:42:01.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey..
