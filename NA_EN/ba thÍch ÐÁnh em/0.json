Is there any way to fix this because it seems like I'm the only one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-05T17:06:57.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, sorry for your ears.  :(  Your config might be corrupt and failing to save your settings.  Resetting that should fix things up:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"BA THÍCH ÐÁNH EM","date":"2017-08-12T16:42:26.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the confusion, it's not the in game volume mixer, but the mixer controlling all of my laptop's audio.","replies":[]}]}]}
