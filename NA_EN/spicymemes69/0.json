Then I go and check my highest rank on the champion and instead of the S+ that I got I see N/A. The most recent issue is with Sona{{champion:37}} . You can check my account I got a couple of S ranks with her in my recent games but still no chest. When I go and check a chest is available. Does it just take a really long time or is it a glitch? If you need proof just let me know i'll send screenshots.\r\nThanks for your help in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T18:12:29.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, but wasn't able to discover anything out of the ordinary!
