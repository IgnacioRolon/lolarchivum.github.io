Windows Media Player","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used the recorder from the updated client's replay feature and I use Windows Media Player by default. However, when I try using that app/program to watch my recordings, the picture is more pixellated &amp; the frames are lower (than from watching the replay in the client itself) and there is no audio. How exactly am I supposed to be watching my recordings? What should I do to get the best viewing experience? I'm on Windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Severi","date":"2016-11-30T22:43:51.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/9hm6ILK-ubs\n\nI think WebM files work better with a browser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T17:31:21.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replays are still in testing, so you'll want to report this to the client devs.  Post this over at the [client discussion b](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)oards and share your feedback.
