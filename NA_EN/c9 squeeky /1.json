We report other players when they've exhibited behavior that goes against the rules, and the system decides whether they need to be punished or not. One report does not necessarily equal a punishment, and even when players are punished, the system does not give punishment notifications frequently. If that kind of thing happens to often, then people feel rewarded for reporting others, and that's not the point of reports.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2019-06-10T00:57:45.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Not getting a feedback makes me wonder if I should even bother using the Report a Player feature.
