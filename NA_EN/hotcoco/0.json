I can confirm as well my ping was 58-60 before the patch and is now 78-80 ping after the 7.18 patch. I have seen many people post about it and a friend of mine has confirmed it as well.

There could be a routing issue going on that's causing a snag.  When you get a chance, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and use it to run a route to the NA game server 104.160.131.1.  Run it for about 5 minutes and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"hotcoco","date":"2017-09-13T23:39:36.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am good to copy paste what i got from the WinMTR?

I double checked with our tech guys and confirmed that it may give your general location but not personal IP unless you're on a mobile connection.  If you want to double down on safety,  it's totally fine to remove the IP on your first two hops.  Just keep the packet and ping info!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hotcoco","date":"2017-09-13T23:30:29.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry i took a nap. my isp is spectrum. ill try the other stuff in a sec","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dedahhh","date":"2017-09-13T19:40:32.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Same thing for me. They are just probably going to send u some stupid troubleshooting stuff that doesn't solve anything.

If that's the path you want to take, cool, but don't discourage other players from following guides that will more than likely resolve their issue.
