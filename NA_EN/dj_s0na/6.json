But i&#039;m only asking if you can add an Arclight&#039;ish VO processing similar to Vel&#039;koz? I really really loved to have a different tone of voice for our good Yorick.\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"red panda z","date":"2017-09-14T09:01:30.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out TricolorStar on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP3Gd8tBEkdb_kXdyrISE3Q\n\nHe makes voicepacks for champion skins that are completely free and legal to use. You can also find a video of his that showcases the simple and easy way of installing them. He doesn't have Archlight Yorick now, but he has made voicepacks for Archlight Vel'koz and Vayne in the past. Keep an eye out for a future update for Yorick. This does NOT contain the actual skin and obtaining them for free is NOT legal.\n\nIt's important to know that these are fan-made are are not recorded by the official voice actors; however, each voice actor for these voicepacks has done a really good job of imitating the original champion's voice. Only you will hear the new voices in games unless other players also have the same voicepack installed. Because of the way voices in League of Legends work, installing a voicepack will replace the classic voice, but it's very easy to turn them on or off whenever you want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-09-13T23:17:13.737+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi DJ Sona,\n\nThanks for your feedback! There are currently no plans to add VO processing to Yorick. The idea behind this is that Yorick is still a human, whereas Vel'Koz is a void monster, so I think the processing suits him better. Yorick is simply wielding Arclight magic.","replies":[{"poster":"Xantus","date":"2017-10-03T10:02:22.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But canÂ´t you change things about him, im mean he is Holy now and still very dark :/","replies":[]}]}]}
