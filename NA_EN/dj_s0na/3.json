This issue usually happens if there's something local to your PC that prevents you from reaching that page. You should be able to resolve this with one of the steps below:\n\n**1.** First, [**clear your browser's cache**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies), then login to your account from the [**Landing Page**](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/), and finally, visit the [**PBE Signup Page**](https://pbesignup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe).\n\n**2.** If the above step didn't work for you, then you may be able to temporarily use a VPN such as [**Hotspot Shield**](https://www.hotspotshield.com/) or [**Cyberghost**](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us) to workaround the issue. You can safely uninstall the VPN afterward.\n\nLet me know if either of these worked for you!","replies":[{"poster":"DJ S0NA","date":"2017-01-11T13:16:51.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello. I've tried both ways, and tried in 2 different computers, but still no success. Tried with my account logged off on both PCs and didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T23:17:10.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I've never heard of either of these not working before. If you have access to another network in another location (such as a coffee shop with free WiFi) or a friend or family member's house, I'd recommend trying to access this page from another network entirely. These issues are usually network-specific, so I think this could work as a temporary bypass.\n\nHit me up if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
