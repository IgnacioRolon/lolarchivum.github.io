I always want Zoe to have more skins. Part of me was always nervous about Zoe someday getting a Gemstone skin, because even though I'd be happy with the addition, it be difficult for me to acquire.\r\n\r\nBut I **_dread_** the day Zoe gets a Prestige skin.\r\n\r\nWhat about the rest of you, though? How would you feel if your beloved Champion got a Prestige skin announcement? Would it excite you? Or if your Champion is one of the ones who've already gotten a Prestige skin, how did it make you feel? Was it a rewarding experience?\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm asking is, do you _**want**_ a Prestige skin to be made for your Champion?\r\n\r\nBecause I don't think I do. And that's not a good thing.","replies":[]}
