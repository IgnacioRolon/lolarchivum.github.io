Someone has to be.\r\n\r\nSo if Ryze is the best at clearing waves, why not just let him be the best at it? If Mordekaiser is the best at melee-range duels, why not let just him be the best at it? If Nautilus is the best at locking down a single target, why not let just him be the best at it?\r\n\r\nPeople constantly complain about Champions who happen to be good, even the best, at something. Not all Champions are made equal and designed the same way, though, so it is an unavoidable fact that _**someone**_ will be the best at some particular thing.\r\n\r\nWhy do people have an issue with that? Do you _**want**_ everyone to perform identically and have there be no variance in what makes a Champion strong?","replies":[]}
