Aphelios Isn't That Complicated.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":15,"down_votes":11,"body":"...To understand, at least. He will take practice to get accustomed to playing him, I'll grant that.\n\nI will attempt to make Aphelios' kit as simple and straightforward as I can.\n\n**Passive**: he gains stats instead of skill points when he levels up. Simple enough.\n**W**: Switch to your other weapon.\n**E**: Does not exist.\n**R**: It's a bomb.\n\n**Weapon 1 (Calibrum)**: It shoots farther. Click marked things to hurt them with your other gun.\nCalibrum Q: A skillshot that marks things.\nCalibrum R: Consumed marks hurt more.\n\n**Weapon 2 (Severum)**: It heals you a little. Gives a little shield if you're full.\nSeverum Q: Move faster and shoot a bunch with both guns, for less damage.\nSeverum R: You get healed.\n\n**Weapon 3 (Gravitum)**: It makes enemies slower.\nGravitum Q: That slow suddenly becomes a root.\nGravitum R: That slow is a bigger slow.\n\n**Weapon 4 (Infernum)**: This is a flammenwerfer. It werfs flammen. (It leaves a painful area behind enemies.)\nInfernum Q: A wave of fire, then shoot with your other gun.\nInfernum R: Creates a painful area around enemies instead of behind them.\n\n**Weapon 5 (Crescendum)**: You can attack again when this gets back to you. Crescendum does more damage if it's your other gun.\nCrescendum Q: Your other gun becomes a little friend.\nCrescendum R: We'll pretend like you hit three enemies for doing more damage, even if you didn't.\n\nThe only other thing to understand is that a weapon will move to the end of the line once 50 Moonlight has been used up.\n\n**_CONCLUSION_**: Think of it as Apehlios having five 'mini-kits'. That's a lot of mini-kits, but none of them are particularly complicated. The intricacies come in Moonlight management to make the next gun-pairing one with good synergy.","replies":[]}
