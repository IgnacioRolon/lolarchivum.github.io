Is it some kind of coding error, or accidental oversight? With Brand getting a new skin and a new splash art, it&#039;d be great if one of his oldest cosmetic bugs gets fixed as well.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-07T22:49:21.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya xXPlasmidXx,\n\nThis is actually working as intended. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-10-08T09:16:59.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=NHns8gmk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-07T22:49:21.609+0000)\n>\n> Hiya xXPlasmidXx,\n> \n> This is actually working as intended. :]\n\nw...wat\njust wat :O\n\nthis might be the case of uber top secret riot shenanigans but... caaaare to explain why?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-08T22:51:48.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not super secret - it's just how we did fire particles (he's a pretty old champion).","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-10-09T08:10:14.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"soooo you are saying that even annie, before her graphical update, had rainbow particles in her hands?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-09T17:57:17.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a case by case basis and different developers worked on different champions.
