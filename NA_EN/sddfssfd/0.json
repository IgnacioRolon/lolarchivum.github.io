Most of the smiting on this board is done by the Arbiters. I mostly just hang out here to offer my thoughts and to try to help people reform or at least understand the reasons for their punishments. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-10-14T03:00:13.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Za17Wb9e,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-10-14T02:58:15.425+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t know about SMITING.
