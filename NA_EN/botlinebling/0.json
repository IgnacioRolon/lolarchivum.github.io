I'M FREAKING HONOR 5, I almost never flame, and I play my own goddamn game. I submitted a ticket to riot player report and all they had to say was o sorry we can't do anything about the dodges you've made for your team against a troll or whatnot. I even saw it happen to another player and all I could do was watch him suffer, these players don't even apologize in any situation (unless they've truly made a mistake). Why do we not have a kick system so that players can vote to kick the troll in champion select. This would lower the chances of trolls affecting games by a large amount. Look I don't mind if you think Yasuo is broken or OP, but if you think banning your own teammate out is going to win you the game then clearly you're not mature enough to play the game. There needs to be something done, or at least riot needs to listen to pleads with hard evidence.\r\nThanks, \r\nBotlinebling","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-12-31T17:44:45.890+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because at some point you have to decide between \"everyone gets to ban whatever champion they want\" and \"everyone gets to play whatever champion they want.\"\n\nSince there are other games where you can play anything you want (blind pick), Riot has chosen to allow players to avoid situations they find personally frustrating or characters they have no fun playing against/with.

No reason to split it further. It's entirely opt-in, and if you don't want to deal with banning then play Blind Pick.\n\n>What I'm requesting is someway to remove the trolls before the game begins like a unanimous vote to kick the person holding champ select hostage.\n\nThe problem with this is that it's super exploitable. What if I want to play something unique and no one wants me to? Say I'm honestly REALLY GOOD at mid-Teemo. I somehow manage to win 75% of games with him, and I one-trick him. Suddenly I can never find a game because people keep voting to kick me for playing something not part of the \"best\" meta.\n\nIt enforces meta picks FAR more than troll-banning does, because it gives teams the ability to pick and choose their teammates based on the champions they play.","replies":[{"poster":"BotLineBling","date":"2017-12-31T18:18:03.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Honestly, It's hard to believe when you say that the ranked community is smaller, but since you're a mod i trust it.

I don't think it's right and when it does happen in champ select the thing left to do is dodge and hope you're not stuck with another player as such?

[There are about 1.9 million ranked players in NA last season.](http://na.op.gg/statistics/tier/).But we also know that NA is one of the largest servers, and *League* has between 75 and 100 million monthly players.\n\nSo even if NA is just 20% of the total that's still about 15-20 million players, meaning about 1/10 play Ranked.\n\n>If you do reply and disagree I think you should have an idea to refute what I had considered.\n\nI agree it's frustrating. But the opposite (having allies able to troll-hover powerful picks to let your enemies snag them and prevent you from banning them) is also super frustrating. There's no good solution, but this way at least there ARE game modes where you can play what you want, so you have options.\n\nSince Ranked is entirely opt-in, the fact that it has one or two potentially negative experiences in terms of what you can/can't play is much more acceptable, as you CHOOSE to participate in a game mode where that can happen.

I often ban Zoe if we don't have first pick. Infact, I ban her 100% of the time of we don't have first pick because playing against her is my own personal feeling of helpless hell. Will I be punished for banning something that I legitimately have a hard time playing against even though I am in a mode that allows me to do so?

Period.

So, I'm not asking about personal feelings on a champion ban, i'm instead suggesting a way to kick off assholes before the whole team is forced to play with them for maybe an entire hour.
