I've restarted my computer and still doesn't fix it. I've also restarted the client, but sometimes it crashed 4-5 times in a row. So I have to repair the client, but it is only a temporary fix. I have to repair the client atleast 3 times a day to temporarily fix it. Can someone please help me on how to fix my client permanently? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Runethor","date":"2016-08-21T23:05:31.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, i get unkown error alot today aftr 1pm est. everything else is fine.
