We were told we'll be getting a Harrowing story, but will there be a harrowing event? I think the reason a lot of people are upset about this year's harrowing is honestly because the Harrowing is something unique to League. Its a take on halloween that lends more mystery to the Shadow Isles, raises several questions about their nature, and is honestly an incredibly interesting take on the halloween season.\n\nI'd also argue that opening the Harrowing to being \"Able to strike at any time\" actually does far more to injure that uniquity than it does to help it. If the idea is to make the Harrowing scary, the whole \"Indeterminite Timebomb\" thing from a playerbase perspective just feels a tad lazy. Sure it opens up the Harrowing to other times of year, but since Harrowing is League's traditional Halloween event, it just seems a bit tacky to throw it out say after Valentines or Saint Patrick's Day. The idea of the Harrowing being a deliberate time of year to prepare and fear is much more intimidating, more akin to Futurama's Murderous Robot Santa.\n\nIn Futurama, Santa never quite loses his fear-factor because everyone knows what he's capable of, and when he needs to come. Its less about being scared all the time (A feeling which would get tiring before long) and more about being concerned about how to deal with this unavoidable threat. The Harrowing falls into that latter category, being an event that should take potentially months of deliberation to ensure that especially Bilgewater is prepared to deal with the encroaching assault. Its a unifying force that threatens everyone, and is able to do so, because people have to work together to overcome it.\n\nCan we have Harrowing events in the year that aren't harrowing related? Yes, lord yes we can. Not every aspect of the Shadow Isles is tied to the Harrowing, and the lands have more than enough wiggle room to tell interesting stories about their inhabitants, and their history. But Harrowing should not be one of those stories. Harrowing is meant to be a big deal, if it can literally come out at the drop of a hat, its less important, less intimidating, and from a lore perspective, less managable.\n\nTL;DR\nI understand you guys want to try something new. I understand you want to open the Shadow Isles to more options. But decoupling the Harrowing from being a proper seasonal event in exchange for \"looming spoopiness\" is a poor decision that hurts the event far more than it helps it.. Sure plenty of people are disenfranchised with the whole zombie deal, but the reason they're disappointed is because the Harrowing is so interesting and unique.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-10-21T01:38:29.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even though it's not the Harrowing we're use to, props to the folks to made this.

Basically the content may be made for the players, but its not made by the players.\n\nNow such a feature would be incredible useful if players were allowed to essentially vote on what kind of content they wanted to see happen next, and I sorta hope that's what Riot is leading up to with special events not being tied to a certain season anymore, However I also see where such a voting system could be abused by trolling players or trolls in general and Riot has usually been quite cautious about anything that would allow such abuse. Still, I can definitely admit a more noticeable heads up about the change in the event would have been nice.\n\nAnd to possibly better explain the whole \"don't say we\" thing is that I feel very strongly about using the right words to describe what I mean to someone, and if I can't find the right words I tend not to say anything rather than be misunderstood.
