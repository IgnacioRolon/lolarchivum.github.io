Then, when I try to start a game, clicking on anything involving starting a match in the client just grays out after I click it, and nothing happens. It lets me jump between game modes (with difficulty) and that's about it. What's up with this? Never happened before. And before someone says check your internet, it's working for everything else 100% fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-26T21:08:11.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be a connection problem, because regardless of having 100% internet you can still run into problems reaching specific sites or services.  In this case, though, it sounds like your update may have become corrupt or not installed properly if your Play button is graying out.  In this case, I suggest downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and performing a reinstall.  This will make sure that both your recent update as well as the transition to the updated client is in good health.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"High Lord Blaze","date":"2017-04-27T01:22:03.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, no idea what went wrong, but I restarted my computer twice and that seemed to work for some reason. Thanks anyway","replies":[]}]}]}
