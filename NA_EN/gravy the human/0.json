Nothing helps.  \r\n\r\nI constantly get the \"Connection Timeout: The request to the PVP.net server timed out.\" message.\r\n\r\nIf it happens while waiting for a game I'm unable to click \"Accept\" therefore I can't play because the queues take too long.  \r\n\r\nIf I finally get into a game, there is no problem whatsoever.  \r\n\r\nPLEASE.
