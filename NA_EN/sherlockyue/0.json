My internet is completely functional because I can watch videos on YouTube and play other online games except lol. I tried almost every DIY method to fix the problem (DNS, dumping cache, reinstall) but none of them work. By the way, I can use Lan to play but I couldn't do it frequently, because it is inside my Canadian landlord's office. I assumed that there is something wrong with Riot's serve and they are controlling the number of oversea users who try to play internationally in order to ensure their local players' interest. I noticed that few days ago the NA serve was super crowded.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T23:17:14.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be upfront and honest, we do not control the number of players internationally playing on NA whatsoever.  If you wish to play on NA, no matter where you are in the world, you can.  It will be up to your ISP to get your connection there.  Additionally, there is no population size for NA compared to how MMO's are run.  There sometimes might be a login queue, but this is rarely related to the population of the server.\n\nRegarding your issue specifically, if you are having problems connecting, it might be due to playing on WiFi as it is inherently unstable for games like League of Legends.  While it will allow websites and youtube to load perfectly fine (Because they can buffer connections), League needs a constant and steady connection to play normally.\n\nAre you playing at home?  At work?  Did it use to work perfectly fine?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"SherlockYue","date":"2016-05-11T02:47:54.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And there was no way to connect it through wifi since then.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T20:59:00.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kind of problem do you encounter exactly?  Where during League do you experience the issue?  In the patcher?  the client?  The Loading Screen?  Champ select?  Do you get an error message at all?  What does it say?  Do you have a screenshot?\n\nWith a bit more information, I should be able to help out!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SherlockYue","date":"2016-05-11T02:46:44.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play it at home.
