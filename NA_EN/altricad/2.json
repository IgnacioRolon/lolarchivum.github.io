Ap {{champion:5}}  is totally over-bearing, and hence let&#039;s hit his ratios. LCS plays and abuse led to his nerf, and now he&#039;ll be balanced.\n\n-kappa\n\nOn a serious note, prepare yourself community, for what may be the most stupidest period in league history.

Thats a considerable nerf, for Ezreal atleast.\n\nSated Devourer will actually be pretty fine. It only works on autoattacks, so champions like WW and Ez can't abuse it. And it doesn't do bonus damage on its own,  it only procs on-hit effects, which means it has minimal impact without other items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pE4CbxDPQO","date":"2015-07-04T17:53:29.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a lot of people that cannot adapt this patch will be a killer.

Sounds like fun to me. For a long ass time last season we went through prolonged months where the meta just stayed the same and balance patches might have thrown a champion or two into the spotlight, but were mostly just boring ass nerfs with incremental changes.\n\nI prefer this season's philosophy of drastically changing the meta with every few patches. Reminds me of Season 2 where the ability to adapt to changes quickly was an important trait. This game will never be 100% balanced with as many champions that are in the game. I'd prefer it if they just aimed to keep things fresh and fun instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-07-04T14:28:27.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\nI just wish they had a intermediary place for testing new patches before they hit rank aside from pbe. \nLike a summoners rift advanced game mode. before its applied to rank. to really iron things out. like the ryze snare problem could be picked up before it hits rank. \nPBE would be for testing a vast range of things, whereas this would be for testing practically ready to ship stuff, with a player base size that is large enough to give accurate feedback/data.

There are so many people just trolling around in the PBE to check out new skins or test new champions. Many of them aren't there trying to balance and interact with the development team. It's just the nature of the gaming community. Even beta testing in new games is a lot like that, where people just want to play the content, not contribute to polishing the experience.\n\nThe best players in the world are busy scrimmaging and playing solo queue on their streams all week. They are worried about what the current patch (or in some instances on stage, the last patch) has available for them to get their next win. Those players are the ones that expose the game breaking situations like the Ryze stun lock, but they do it after the patch has released and they can solo queue or scrimmage it against live opponents to figure out the best ways to get an advantage in the current meta. Until it hits live, Riot just has to react to what the elite players find as exploits and fix them. That's the nature of the beast.","replies":[{"poster":"Altricad","date":"2015-07-04T14:53:54.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"If anything, the community's warnings are correct 9/10 times. We've seen it in the past, and it's about to happen again.\n\nWe said 450g for the jg item was a bad idea, and riot does it anyway. They did fix things up a bit by nerfing the damage dealt by the camps in the end and the release of Cinderhulk, but it took forever for them to fix it.\n\nIt just takes so much time to fix things after the damage is done due to how angry the community gets and useful feedback being lost.\n\nOr at least, split the patches up into 5.13 -part 1 and 5.13 - part 2\n\nThere have been patches where literally nothing but 2 skins and a few bugs are fixed. \n\nGranted, Riot does it's own playtest/data analysis etc, but would it hurt for them to heed our warnings?","replies":[{"poster":"TotN Titan","date":"2015-07-04T20:58:38.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't see any Riot staff finding the Ryze passive being overbearing until it hit competitive, though. Those playtesters don't operate on the sheer number of hours and skill that much of the gaming community puts in. You are right, though, about it taking a while to rebalance things after certain damage has been done. But that is one thing that will always exist in this type of experience.\n\nAs a gaming community, we have seen PvP like this for years: Something will be overpowered and it will be used for a couple of weeks to gain tremendous advantage. Then we will see a patch to bring everything back to order again, only to have chaos ensue somewhere else as a result and spend another two weeks adapting to that. It does make for a very interesting season, though. I admit that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-04T16:33:37.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The community is actually wrong most of the time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2015-07-06T03:54:14.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When everyone is OP, no one is OP.","replies":[{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-07-06T04:09:07.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Salazarth,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L0mr5L7y,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-07-06T03:54:14.603+0000)\n>\n> When everyone is OP, no one is OP.\n\nExcept people who can 100-0.\nThe concept of attrition is lost in league, because its league of burst.\n\nWe really need garrison on the rift...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2015-07-04T14:29:23.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can anyone link me to the patch notes?
