Now, I might not be 100% accurate with my numbers here, I'm working off my memory and the post from Meddler was 2 weeks ago when a discussion started about the PBE reveal of the nerf to Jinx's ult.  However, I do remember what he was trying to convey.\n\nFirst, you are saying that you have yet to see an ADC main play her a solid amount.  Um, that is what Meddler was pointing out.\n\nJinx is a champ people like to main, so when you do see her in ranked, its usually because an ADC main is playing her, and that person also just mains Jinx.  Now think about how picks work in ranked.  Mid, top and Jungle are sought after and argued about.  ADC and support are often left for the 4th and 5th pick people who take based on what's still available and what they can play.\n\nJinx mains don't have that happen to them as often, so while a zed main might not get his champ or even his lane 60% of the time, a Jinx main might be able to pick Jinx 90% of the games they play.  This means that Jinx mains tend to have 3-4 times as many games on their champ as any mid lane main manages.  Experience matters and jinx players will almost always get the experience they need to do well.\n\nThen again remembering that ADC is not sought after, many times the ADC player is not an ADC main, and the non-mains seem to rarely take Jinx.  So again, the odds that any Jinx you face is a Jinx main and highly experienced tend to be good.\n\nThat appears to be what Riot noticed.  The statement I read from Meddler implied that they see her as overall balanced with some well defined weaknesses and a few dominating aspects to her game.  They noted that the current meta is one she is naturally strong in and that the fact that many players who main her run her often is a major factor in her winrate.\n\nAnd I'd note that if you look at any champ, even ones that don't have a good overall win rate and look at the 5-6 players who play that champ the most, the most experienced players usually have win rates above 55%.  If Riot is seeing correctly that most Jinx players are Jinx mains and getting more wins thanks to their greater experience.\n\nOf course, I've noticed that you have just blown off any conclusion that doesn't agree with you, so I'm not sure you'll have read my post.

This means that Jinx mains tend to have 3-4 times as many games on their champ as any mid lane main manages.  Experience matters and jinx players will almost always get the experience they need to do well.\n\nAgain,that's just not the case.\n\n> Then again remembering that ADC is not sought after, many times the ADC player is not an ADC main, and the non-mains seem to rarely take Jinx.  So again, the odds that any Jinx you face is a Jinx main and highly experienced tend to be good.\n\nActually,even non adc mains seem to play her quite often,I just focused on adc mains because it reflects how strong the champion is considered.\n \n> That appears to be what Riot noticed.  The statement I read from Meddler implied that they see her as overall balanced with some well defined weaknesses and a few dominating aspects to her game.  They noted that the current meta is one she is naturally strong in and that the fact that many players who main her run her often is a major factor in her winrate.\n\n\"Riot noticed\"? so you mean \"from the people who nerfed sona for no apparent reason,now comes: logic?\"\nyeah,no.\n\n> And I'd note that if you look at any champ, even ones that don't have a good overall win rate and look at the 5-6 players who play that champ the most, the most experienced players usually have win rates above 55%.  If Riot is seeing correctly that most Jinx players are Jinx mains and getting more wins thanks to their greater experience.\n\nNah for those champions those are often one trick ponies and things of that sort,for jinx it's just people play her a lot,because they pick her a lot,because they see her as really strong.\n\n> Of course, I've noticed that you have just blown off any conclusion that doesn't agree with you, so I'm not sure you'll have read my post.  But I stand by my statement that Jinx is not a problematic champion.\n\nShe is and she isn't,she's too strong under the aram mentality solo q has,and I'm sick of riot balancing the game around it,enough with this idiotic winrate balancing,either focus your balancing around the competitive scene,or make aram the competitive game mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BestTristMyHaus","date":"2015-05-06T15:06:25.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=manbearswine,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OW8cTlxA,comment-id=001a000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-06T05:26:00.795+0000)\n>\n> She really doesn't,I have yet to see an adc main who doesn't play her a solid amount.\n> \n\nI'm an outlier, but I'm an ADC main and I REFUSE to play her, because she's always had an overloaded kit and seemed to be DESIGNED to be almost an \"F' YOU\" to Tristana mains.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-05-06T16:03:51.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mahou Girl Mami,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OW8cTlxA,comment-id=001a0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-06T15:06:25.464+0000)\n>\n> I'm an outlier, but I'm an ADC main and I REFUSE to play her, because she's always had an overloaded kit and seemed to be DESIGNED to be almost an \"F' YOU\" to Tristana mains.\n\nJust pair up with a guy who refuses to play thresh then.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
