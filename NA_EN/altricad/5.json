If I was gonna take advice, then that would be CLEARLY COMPARED, SOLID advice that CHANGES my opinion. You're not gonna convince me with a pitchfork bud! \r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, MANY of the upvoted threads that are visible are ones that seem to \"excessively\" curse out the balance team/whine about their champion being unviable.\r\n\r\nYeah, you're gonna get a TON of attention, but take that sh*t to bugs and fixes, you're not gonna get a comment for that thread.\r\n\r\nI used to be one of the ragers on the forums, who would constantly upvote \"Nerf lee sin\" or \"Delete Akali\" threads without further thought. Of course, we can crack jokes about some champions being annoying such as calling \"Morgana 3-year snare\" etc. or 'Remove Teeemo\", yeah they're annoying and we joke about it.\r\n\r\nJOKES, REMAIN JOKES. Don't bring your sh*t into legitimate threads that point out what Riot have said, and plz NUMBERS and QUOTES. Hardly, have I seen a legitimate thread that quotes stuff from other posts or number changes.\r\n\r\nMeddler posted about Zed having counterplay, with respect to his Ulti duration being long enough, and WHAT did you guys do?? Downvote him to oblivion instead of explaining. Meddler then argued by comparing to other obnoxious AP assassin, mainly Ms. No cd {{champion:84}} . What did you guys do? Yesh, Downvote him again, saying that Zed's split pushing was too good.\r\n\r\nSo, ofc, they nerf his attack speed so that he can't split push that good. AND OMG, SOOO many QQ threads complaining that Zed isn't getting nerfs WHEN HE JUST GOT NERFED.\r\nObviously we weren't clear, WHERE we wanted Zed nerfed, so Riot went with what they believed was the problem. You can't just rage at someone when you weren't clear. And that thread about being disappointed with a dumb as f*k meme had the highest upvotes when the threads that REASONABLY explained why zed's harass should be nerfed dissappeared under it.\r\n\r\nAnd on the Lee Sin QQs, when Phreak posted about him \"Feeling\" strong, many of you agreed and yet there are still \"Lee SIN is OOOP\" threads going on.\r\n\r\nBruhs, Do you even READ? You say he \"only feels strong\" and then you say \"he IS strong\". And people say Fearless is inconsistent when he is TRYING his best!\r\n\r\n Inb4 people say \"Sona needs buffs\", yes I agree, base stat wise Sona is weak, but really, and with completely honesty, do you think any champion can press an ability  from a certain range and just deal guided damage to 2 targets?\r\n\r\nNo, that is just stupid. And that was \"pre-nerf\" sona. They nerfed her range and buffed her passive damage. Bad idea, the \"DAMAGE\" is much more \"VISIBLE\" than the weaknesses. Riot saw that and decided sona needed nerfing. VERY False. The damage is \"Visible\" because everything else about sona is \"WEAK\". \r\n\r\nA detailed post explaining this would be nice, but NOOOO. All we get on gameplay and balance are \"{{item:3070}}  R.I.P sona\" Without a GOOD reasoning on how to make her less frustrating outside of just All-inning her and killing her in lane.\r\n\r\nJust now, Meddler posted that they are going to try to change Mordekaiser into a more tanky kinda guy. But, ofc no one notices it since you're all busy making, \"MUH QQ\" threads instead of searching for \"Intelligent\" posts on balance. And when moredekaiser gets changes, ALL of you will QQ \"R.I.P assassins Mordekaiser\". \r\n\r\nFizz changes were discussed by another Red waaay before pbe and that his \"troll pole\" was meant to be a frustrating aspect that they had no plan to remove and that they were gonna nerf his q's damage as it was too high. but NOOO Dumb as sh*t idiots think they moved the 20% damage increase from Ahri to Fizz and STILL QQ about it without reading patch notes, and want his troll pole to be removed/ changed.\r\n\r\nSrsly, it's stuff like this that makes me lose hope in the community.\r\n\r\ntldr; Stop being so harsh on the Reds, if I had to point out all the stupid practices of the community I'd run out of my lifespan, learn to post intelligently. And @Reds, pls don't give up on us. Many of us are stupid ( me included), but we need you to post despite the backlash.

It's a matter of cause and effect, most people will not unjustly attack somebody.  The players that speak to you in an angry tone, are in fact angry because your personal actions and/or words are what's angering them.  They're innocent bystanders, but they feel they must take an aggressive stance because you have offended them in some way to make them feel threatened.\n\nAs to what specifically you've erred in a manner that offended the players, I can't say.  It could very well be a combination of things, but the fact of the matter is that you are the party at fault.  You are the independent factor and the players are the dependent.  At this point, your reputation is already stained, the best you can hope for is redemption and if you're lucky enough, eventually forgiveness.\n\nTo get there though, you first need to set your arrogance aside, stop nerfing Sona and admit the \"rework\" was a nerf outclassing that of Olaf and rivaling Evelynn.

However, I'm not so optimistic as to the results. Right now, the dominant climate on the boards is one of self-perpetuating negativity, where it's not only easier to rant than to make a productive discussion, but also more rewarding, since you're more likely to get higher upvotes, approving comments and visibility by like-minded players. Most of these posters I'm pretty sure also have no intention of changing or even genuinely contributing to the game, no matter how indirectly, and so would never improve their behavior unless forced to. In a lot of ways, it would be more likely to expect players to improve their behavior on their own within League itself, and without a report system, than to have them do the same here, and it's clear from the community's in-game behavior that that would never happen.","replies":[{"poster":"LongFur Fox","date":"2015-01-30T11:21:08.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh I am sorry if I seemed optimistic about it.

Now of course this would be a bad decision but it is just an example that the community unfortunately are not always happy with the correct change.\n\n The problem with balancing a game is that it is not an easy task and it is not always obvious what has to be done. Let's look at your examples:\n\nLee: I have yet to see a thread that actually proposes what to nerf about him. To be honest I don't think he needs to be flat out nerfed. He needs to be moved from his generalist role where he can do almost everything and fit with every team comp and into a more specialized pick. This brings the problem of moving him away from being able to do something and since riot want to keep his highs and do not want people to feel like they changed lee sin to a new champion it is not a simple thing to do.\n\nZed: I honestly do think zed is a healthy assassin. He could do with a slight nerf to his waveclear maybe but other than this he falls off heavily during the late game where people get qqs and zhonyas. This is why he begins split pushing since he can no longer teamfight and that is what riot nerfed to make sure that he actually falls of late game. All in all I would say they hit perfectly with their nerf.\n\nSona: Come on riot explained this in length. I am not going to do it again here since I rarely play support and I therefore have not paid enough attention to remember their explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-01-31T14:31:13.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had me agree with except on the Lee thing. \n\n\"riot want to keep his highs and do not want people to feel like they changed lee sin to a new champion it is not a simple thing to do.\"\n\nYou are right it's not a simple thing. But most of the complaints against Lee Sin has to do with how he is hurting jungle diversity. Would you agree with this? If he is, and they keep champing the over all jungle (items/monsters/smite) but not him, then the work they keep doing is at best a side shift and not a move forward of backward. So we can't have half the Rioters come on the forms and say \"he's in a fine spot right now\" and the other half come in and say \"we understand he needs to be changed for the health of the jungle\". If there is that much double speak from Riot people, I believe have the right to question the quality of the balance team.","replies":[{"poster":"LongFur Fox","date":"2015-01-31T14:38:09.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i agree that he should be changed.

That is why i said \"riot want to keep his highs and do not want people to feel like they changed lee sin to a new champion it is not a simple thing to do.\" since it seems riot wants to change him but not how to.\n\nOn questioning the ability of the balance team then they would also get flag for doing another olaf'ing where they just nerf him until they get a good answer so I until I begin seeing catastrophical failures from them i will question people posting on these boards before their balance team.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-01-31T14:57:50.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you and I are not on the same page with the term \"balanced\". It seems, I may be wrong, that you think of unbalanced champs as those that are face-roll or OP burst? I think of unbalanced champs as those without a weakness and no counter play. (not counting the same counter play you can use for every other champ ie \"just stun him\") If a character can do so many things well, fit into every team comp, and has almost zero counter play I do think he's unbalanced. \n\nWhen they Olaf'd Olaf (man that just doesn't sound right), they at least admitted that he was a problem and were going to have to look at him. Same with Poppy or Galio or Urgot. Champs that have to be kept down to prevent them from warping the game experience of others. Take Lucian last season in the LCS. He had a sub 50% win in the LCS and yet kept getting picked because he had almost no counter play and was never weak at any stage of the game. They saw their mistake and changed him (lowered auto attack range, dash, ect...). Even Kassadin after a while got a change. The one champion that did get slight nerfs and stayed at a top 3 pick all year was Lee Sin. That, to me, is the whole crux of the argument. If you have a champ go through that and still stay a top pick, then no real meaningful change was done. \n\nAnd if they do these love tap nerfs and he keeps staying on top while half of the Reds you see saying his balanced/maybe under powered and the other half of Reds on the boards say he is a problem you can understand the frustration and mistrust in the balance team.\n\nHope I didn't come across as too combative.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-01-30T10:34:36.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LongFur Fox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VEgEbuEj,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2015-01-30T10:17:22.606+0000)\n>\n> Problem with that is that most people do not realize they are ranting and not contributing anything to the discussion.\n> Look at the cassi threads and tell me how that would be different if we had a rant/qq forum.\n\nAnd?

I'd love to see more criticism of Riot, especially on things that don't just revolve around board flavors of the month like {{champion:238}} or {{champion:37}} (the state of marksman itemization could be a great subject for discussion, for example), but right now it's difficult for that to happen when an overwhelming number of threads and posts are basically tantrums. It's also bad that said tantrums are pretty much always more popular (and therefore more visible, in the boards' current format) than any kind of well-written, mature discussion, so the toxic climate we currently have just feeds into itself, reinforcing similarly negative comments while pushing away higher-quality posts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2015-01-30T04:00:49.883+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"No words for this post, no words . . . oh well back to playing the same 20 champs again.
