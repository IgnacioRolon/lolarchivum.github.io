Just because the skills are simpler, or don't involve jumping over 7 walls and your mother, doesn't mean you can't make plays with them. Putting your E with them in the center forces them to make a choice. Do they burn mana or cooldowns to flash or jump away? If not, they have to guess. Can they react in time to walk out, and do they have enough movespeed to do so? If not, they stay put. If so, they go for it.  I have stuned many people who thought they could make it out, and couldn't. The new buffs to W help a lot too. The q is now a skill shot, so it isn't good? Bullshit. Not only can it farm about 1.3 times as fast as the old one (which is why they nerfed the ratio on ult), but you can now throw it out of vision to clinch kill the enemy after they flash away, and many other things. You can be running away, and poke from a longer distance than the cast range, because the projectile has a movespeed, and you are moving away. This allows for kiting in a chase, as opposed to simply a math game, who is faster. All of these mechanics help you make plays, and ALLOW for plays to be made by the enemy. No champion should be based purely on whether the player can hit one instant ground targeted skillshot. None.

This was way too powerful for an instant cast ranged ability on such a low cooldown. \n\nThe thing about Veigar's E is that you're either stunned or not. \"Practically get stunned\" doesn't exist. The inside of the cage covers actually a large area—to the point you can move easily inside the cage to avoid partial damage (if not all) from the W. Since Veigar's abilities are close ranged, you're free to fire off your arsenal inside the cage. If you're an ADC, he's likely dead with four autoattacks. \n\nIn addition, the E was not and still isn't, an instant cast ability. There is a very minor cast time on it (I think it was .25 or .5 sec? I don't remember). Veigar counters dashes and excels at locking down certain areas. Fitting as he is **useless** after he places his stun and bursts a squishy. All his spells have relatively long cooldowns for basic abillities and have absurdly high mana costs (I think one of the highest for any champion) that overpower his passive early on. After he uses all his spells, his cooldowns shut him down for the rest of the teamfight, as teamfights are relatively short, forcing him to autoattack. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Chaz5,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nk2IbgxX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-02T01:50:11.959+0000)\n> So here is my question to you, would you have preferred it having a small delay to add counterplay, or putting it on a 40 second cooldown for how much power it had? Honestly I think the change was smart, as this will allow them to add power to the rest of his skills without breaking him.\n\nI'll answer this question for him. I'll rather have his old kit because it synergized better and, actually, made sense. His current kit is a mess and assumes that your opponent has the intelligence of a household plant. The old one was far from perfect as it relied away too much on his E (which is why it was powerful in the first place). You don't land an E? Well you're dead. But, the old kit was superior.\n\nYou argued that the change allowed him to add power to the rest of his skills. In fact, it's just the opposite. His Q made his laning phase worse; Veigar's only reliable harass was his Q and now it's a medium speed, low range, and easily dodge-able skillshot. Everyone knows that once Veigar used his Q, you're free to go ham on him as all all he can do is auto attack. So now he's even more likely to be pushed against the turret. You might argue that he gets more AP from the double shot. The amount you get is not even close to double. There is a finite number number of minions that spawn in X minutes. In addition, minions are rarely perfectly lined up and your opponent has more power over you after this Q change. His W is worse; without the reliable stun, the lower mana cost and slightly lowered cooldowns are worthless. His E, well there's enough discussion about that. It's obviously worse. His R has its ratio nerfed quite a bit, mana cost lowered, and cooldown lowered. Riot lowered the ratio, erroneously thinking that his new Q doubled his AP farm. It didn't. It also was quite contradictory to Riot's emphasis on Veigar's late game and burst potential. The cooldown buff is minor at best as you don't really use it that often as the length of a teamfight is short and teamfights themselves are rarely back to back. In conclusion, even after his core item was removed, his entire kit was **nerfed** (although his Q was a mixed bag).","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-03-02T07:04:23.861+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Old Prophecy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nk2IbgxX,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-03-02T02:39:45.111+0000)\n>\n> The thing about Veigar's E is that you're either stunned or not. \"Practically get stunned\" doesn't exist.

Since Veigar's abilities are close ranged, you're free to fire off your arsenal inside the cage. If you're an ADC, he's likely dead with four autoattacks.\n\nYes, this. Ask any Veigar main what happened to Old Veigar if he missed his stun: he got obliterated and contributed nothing to the fight. Well, New Veigar just always misses.\n\nAnd I agree on laning. Veigar is now an easy lunch for any decent mid. He always was, but at least before he had SOME ability to fight back:\n\n* Old Veigar could use his Q to harass back, whittling the enemy down so that they couldn't dive him, and potentially setting up a kill if he managed his mana carefully and could afford a full rotation (or got a good gank). That's no longer true, both because his new Q is terrible for harass and because he has no ability to lock down the enemy for a full burst.\n* Old Veigar was actually pretty good at helping his jungler in ganks. New Veigar cannot stun someone 1v1 unless they're either already stunned (and he throws his stun on top) or the enemy literally chooses to **run into the stun and get stunned.** It's not like Cho's Q, where it covers a large area (filled circle) and you have to react immediately and decisively to get out; it's a ring, and you need to move hardly at all to avoid being stunned.\n* Old Veigar could intimidate the enemy a bit once he got his ultimate and a reliable mana source, at least if the enemy decided to go glass cannon and stick around at 30 MR. He could basically force them to either start building more defensively, or to land their killing combo first; if they just derped around and ignored his threat zone, he could 100-0 them if he landed his stun. None of that applies anymore.\n\nAll in all, it's not just that Veigar is weak, though he is. He's just…less interesting. He can no longer 1v1, so all that high-tension dueling is gone. In teamfights, well, he throws his stun somewhere (doesn't really matter where) and hopefully someone doesn't notice and walks into it, or gets split off from their team (although again, it's a huge area, and standing in the middle of it hurts you in no way whatsoever). Then, he just lobs damage around and hopefully hits something. If a squishy gets low, he can R them, assuming he somehow manages to get close enough to do that without getting pounced on by the front line.\n\nThese changes are so, so bad. So terribly bad. It's almost a parody; it's like you're now being forced to play Veigar badly. Previously, those were the two hallmarks of trash Veigar players: you try to farm all lanephase instead of fighting off the enemy, and you toss your stun indiscriminately rather than hitting with the edge. Well, that's New Veigar. You're basically being forced to play bad Veigar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kail271","date":"2015-03-02T22:37:46.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted tbh. Veigar's stun was way too powerful previously. I agree, something needed to be done. My issue comes in with the execution. Reddit has had a couple great ideas about how to work this out in a way that helps Veigar, rather than making him unplayable. My favorite thus far has been the thought of cast time increasing the further away it is cast. For example, the stun would drop almost instantly if Veigar dropped it basically on himself, then gradually increase cast time as it reaches max range (.75 second cast time). This allows for Veigar to defend himself from the high mobility assassins he has so much trouble with in lane, but keeps him relatively balanced for teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"JusticePauldrons","date":"2015-03-03T00:08:53.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't really matter to me that much, I know I gave a good and well thought out response, just because other people would like to cover their ears and scream to drown it out doesn't make it any less true.

That's all there is to it, the skill is not reliable at all and that means Veigar is dead.\n\nBring back the old Veigar!","replies":[]},{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-03-02T21:55:29.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't even mind them DELETING THE ENTIRE ENEMY AP RATIO OUTRIGHT if it meant they would revert all of the 5.4 changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2015-03-02T08:38:35.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Revert teh stun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hetchy","date":"2015-03-02T15:32:09.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Um, there was recently a Red expounding on the abolute necessity of LCS-centric balance.\n\nThat ship has sailed.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-03-02T22:03:23.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sauce?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-03-03T21:22:31.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Altricad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Nk2IbgxX,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-02T01:36:32.514+0000)\n>\n> Let's start the movement! #RevertVeigarNerfs\n> \n> I'm sick and TIRED of this #LCS BIG PLAYS and mobility meta that riot heavily favors.\n> \n> I've had enough of Chasing down this stupid champion across my jg while eating her long range poke and letting her outrun me anyway {{champion:76}} \n> I've had enough of \"Jukes\" ( 5 second dashes and blinks)  by {{champion:7}}  who also had LOADS of cc\n> I've had enough of getting kited to oblivion by {{champion:429}}  and being unable to smite-steal ANYTHING while she has her rend\n> I've had enough of {{champion:64}}  ALWAYS having a \"backup\" escape through ward hops and how he didn't get ANY NERF this cycle while vi and J4 got hit\n> And you know what?
