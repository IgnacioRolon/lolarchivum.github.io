She was a popular pick in S2 and early S3, mostly by Scarra. Pro players just tend to be scared of picking high-risk champions. It's like there's some kind of... dislike of high-risk champions. Kassadin had his damage moved with his W to give him some risk and the pros ran away from him. They nerfed Eve's ult in S2 and everyone ran away from her as an assassin. They gave Zed an escape with his R and he became incredibly popular. They nerfed Rengar's ability to one shot as a tank and he lost all credibility. Made Zix have to not be tanky to be able to remove carries from a fight and he lost popularity. They made Gragas have to get close to his opponents to do the most damage and he lost viability in pro play. \n\nOverall, it's about time a Pro Player actually showed some TRUE skill and used a champion who is reliant on their team. Who is incredibly powerful, but has some ACTUAL risks. The True Assassin method is positioning, timing, and being opportunistic. Pros have shown they're scared of champions who take this level of thought process and inconsistency.","replies":[{"poster":"Altricad","date":"2015-03-29T01:35:50.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pros are PAID to win, in that circumstance I wouldn't take a risky champion either.
