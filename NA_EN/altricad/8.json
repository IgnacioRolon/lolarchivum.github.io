Bad move\n\nI agree.  I don't even understand why there are items at all.\n\nWhy not have a \"manual calibration\" option, so that instead of buying items, you simply buy AP/AD/CD/MR/AR according to the base gold value that each skill is worth.  \n\nIf the items themselves are mispriced (overvalued), then this is an advantage to buy an item, but there should still be an option to just increase the skill level per the amount that your current gold can buy.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks.\n\nLOL4Life","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-11-11T03:37:42.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to build {{champion:266}}  first item {{item:3172}}  but when adc items got 80ad over several items spike  with increased life steal and defensive items were nerfed several times this year. even with having a spare life i couldnt stay in lane and survive and when i rarely could i pooped as soon as i met a 2 item adc from bot lane when you go mid to help push","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeagueOfNautilus","date":"2015-11-11T03:12:31.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zephyr shall be missed by this devout Udyr main {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyer Beast","date":"2015-11-01T21:33:30.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If I'm hearing that crit adcs are taking over and other adcs are dying, without {{item:3172}} wtf am I gonna do on {{champion:429}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-01T22:36:33.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista is being nerfed by this patch.
