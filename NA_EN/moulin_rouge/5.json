It was the most fun I had ever had in LoL before. Even now, there's no champion that could compare to the fun I had with her. But now, she's not the champion I loved. She's not even Evelynn anymore. \r\n\r\nNow, she's relegated to the jungle as a AD tank. Like, are you kidding me??? She's a mage. Not an tanky AD. She shouldn't have to be built as an AD bruiser to be viable! Please riot. Do something with her, but make her fun again. I want to play her mid lane once more. \r\n\r\nP.S. Get rid of that stupid effing ult. It's no good.","replies":[]}
