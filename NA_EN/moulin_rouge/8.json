Morello once said something to effect of wishing he was never released. If you weren't around when he was strong consider yourself lucky. The the only reason he isn't dominating every lane right now is because Riot took him to the GP School of Nerfing; they just cut his numbers and nerfed his items until he was weak enough to not win lane early. \n\nReally though that was the only option without doing a full-scale rework because his kit, like Sona's, has no mechanical gameplay. You walk forward and press 2 buttons while standing in the general area of your enemy. \n\nI'm not saying he needs to be nerfed, but you can bet if his pick rate and win rate start to creep up Riot will squash him instantly because of the nature of the kit-- which is exactly what's happened to Sona. I can't say that it's the correct or ideal way of balancing, but I find it kind of ridiculous that people seem to be baffled why Riot is doing it.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-06T17:57:03.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are so many people asking why there are nerfs to Sona, as opposed to champions like Zed, Fizz, Yasuo, Akali, Katarina, etc.\nVladimir isn't going to have any increase in win/pick rate just because there are other champions that make lanes more painful, and people are going to pick those champions more often than Vlad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-07T01:50:13.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's talking about s2 vlad.\nThe most broken top lane next to irelia was vlad.\n\nyou could go 3 spellvamp quints and out trade people even pre six at vlad because you'd just heal back up with CDR gylphs+cdr masteries\nComplete and utter joke.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-07T03:37:25.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does sound scary O_o\nThat's almost like a 100% Lifesteal Nasus/Warwick...\nNot to mention Nasus's Q-stacks...","replies":[{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-07T03:52:31.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah now its just renekton who's the \"broken\" bruiser/tank/ap tank top laner\nEveryone else is just Meh compared to him.\nespically since tiamat cancels his wind up on his W/Qmaking him auto/animation cancel into more free damage in a trade lol","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-07T03:55:28.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I literally haven't seen Renekton in AGES!

Saying RIP SONA or better nerf Sona is such an overreaction that makes me think people on these forums are barely 12 years old.\n\nWith that out of the way, lets analyze most common points these overreactions base on:\n\n**-She can't 1v1:** well... what support can? not only that but given the chance, out of ALL supports, Sona is the one who CAN 1v1 -.- simple as this, if the enemy ADC has low health, who can one shot him? Soraka? Nami? Braum? Thresh? not even Karma can, Sona CAN. I bet my arm that while playing Sona you've KS'd more than release Darius! UNINTENTIONALLY.\n\n**-She's squishy like a minion:** I agree, she is, but why? well, as we all know there are 3 types of supports (Real supports, leaving mages out), healers, shield and peelers. Karma has a shield in order to reduce harass, same as Janna and Lulu, Soraka, Taric and Nami reduce harass by healing, Leona and Braum peel their adc... Sona does it ALL, she heals, shields and peels, with 2 skills, why on top of it all should she be tanky?\n\n**-She can't teamfight:** Really? giving damage to everyone near, a shield every 10, haste every 12 and an AoE Stun sounds like a great teamfighter to me, you can't be in the front (YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE FRONT ANYWAY) of course but if you stay back and protect your adc you're a freaking support machine.\n\n**-She has to be with someone all the time:** When did I start playing Street fighter? O.o of course you can't be alone, this is LEAGUE OF LEGENDS a TEAM game, you SHOULDN'T overextend with any champion. Each champion has an extension range, somewhere you can move freely and where you can escape taking in account your movement skills and your opponent's, for example: Tristana has a bigger extension range than say Ashe. For supports this is true as well, Soraka has a very small extension range, barely beyond her AA range, Karma's on the other hand is HUGE thanks to her haste/slow/snare, Nami's is situational but can be very big if you hit your bubble, Janna's is huge as well, Taric's is tiny, Sona's is medium because of your haste which brings me to my last point.\n\n**-Why nerf Sona's movement speed out of all:** by removing 5 MS, Sona's efective extension range becomes shorter by like 5% ._. you'll need to be a biiiit more careful but it's not like you don't have almost 20% MS buff at lvl 1 song of celerity (with 100AP). In reality this nerf is aimed at how easy it is to poke with Sona, which people does by activating song of celerity anyway -.- so all in all the change is gonna be barely noticeable but deserved since being a rocket at lvl 3 is pretty stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2015-01-06T18:44:42.281+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">if the enemy ADC has low health, who can one shot him? Soraka? Nami? Braum? Thresh? not even Karma can\n\nAll of those supports have cc to lock the adc down, and if they do, they can kill an early game adc.\n\nSoraka can use Equinox, doing damage once it's casted, and once it locks the enemy. throwing an additional perfect Q, aa, and the adc is probably dead.\n\nNami can throw her Q, wich additionaly stuns the adc, can use her W to poke the adc, and additionally cast her E, working like an Sona e powerchord.\n\nWell.. Braum has not alot damage by himself, but he can locks down the adc if he triggers his stun and do extra magic damage too.\n\nLet's. Not. Talk. About. Thresh.\n\nKarma is also quite a strong mage support, who has a on click snare (if the tether does not break) and her Q. let's not forget her empowered Q, wich does damage on hit and after a short delay.\n\nAll those supports can kill the adc, just because Sonas Powerchord have no counterplay for now, it's considered as op? mostly at early game, because she's right now a poke support?\n\n>well, as we all know there are 3 types of supports (Real supports, leaving mages out), healers, shield and peelers.\n\nLet's think about it.. Sona has no reliable cc pre 6, like Braum, Leona, Thresh and the most Peel supports. Her Shield is way too hard to utilize for now, because it's 1.5 seconds long, most other supports shield last about 5 ~ 7 seconds. So Sona is left with her heal. But wait, her Heal is extremly weak, even if she heals two targets, and you count taric as healer, who does also heal himself and an ally. So Let me ask you. What kind of Support is Sona, if she can't peel, heal, and shield? \n\n> Really? giving damage to everyone near, a shield every 10, haste every 12 and an AoE Stun sounds like a great teamfighter to me, you can't be in the front (YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE FRONT ANYWAY) of course but if you stay back and protect your adc you're a freaking support machine.\n\nHow many champions can actually utilize the on  hit damage? Mages can't at all, tanks can neither, bruisers could, and of course, the adc would benifit the most out of it. Her ultimate is the only ability, that remained unchanged after the rework, wich explains pretty much why it's the strongest ability right now in her kit, but positioning is quite important for Sona.\n\nAbout the Sona has to be always with an ally part; so, lets say your team needs wards, and you as squishiest support go in your jungle and ward around. if you get caught by an enemy there, YOU'LL be dead. No exception\n\nAnd about the Sonas movement speed; Phreak did state by himself, why Zyra has such a low movement speed. And he compared her with Malzahar, who is as Sona, a quite immobile champion, with no reliable cc pre-6, thinking it's fair for him having such high movement speed as mage. But then I'm wondering, why does Sona recieve one, if she can't peel by herself, except at lvl 6 with her ult, having a much higher cooldown and mana cost? We just don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2015-01-06T23:16:36.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> All those supports can kill the adc, just because Sonas Powerchord have no counterplay for now, it's considered as op? mostly at early game, because she's right now a poke support?\n\n-yes\n\n> Let's think about it..

Experienced players will find easily a way to kill her anyways.\n\n> **All**, mages do have autoattacks that they use in between skills, orbwalking is a must in ALL roles, not just ADC.\n\nThen, why most of them don't use them? When I play together with mages, they use their auto attacks either on their minions, or just use their abilities instead.\n\n> Same is true for almost every support, more importantly the ones who can ward safely are mostly supports with haste, Sona has a haste that works wonders, now if you like playing chase the frog in the jungle while the rest of the game is going forward I have bad news for you. Honestly you can ward effectively as Sona, who says otherwise needs to really check the way they're playing, now if there's no enemy in sight and you just so happen to remember you have sightstone and decide to ward dragon at 40 minutes alone... really? come on.\n\nSo, let's think about it. You just did go b to heal yourself up, you go next to your teammates, and one of them requests that you ward around. I as support main would ward the bushes in the river, wich is extremly risky if no ones around, yet no one wants to come with me, because they're clearing waves or clearing the jungle. \nYou're forced as support to ward alone most the time, because your teammates have to do also more important stuff and should not babysit their support all the time.\n\n> Sona is NOT an immobile champion, more specifically, she doesn't even need to move to cast her skills and thanks to Song of celerity low cost and high uptime she has an effective movement speed relative to the likes of Janna, if you can't click to move that doesn't mean Sona is immobile ._.\n\nJanna gets passively alot of movement speed by her own, and considering that she also builds an Talisman, she's running quite fastly around. Sonas E has a 12 second cooldown and lasts only 3 seconds. It sure gives a burst of movement speed, if Sona builds shittons of AP. Yeah, many people would say the argument that she has the mobility boots, wich give more ms, but if it happens, that an enemy finds you and attacks you, you'll be extremly slow, and there is nothing Sona can do against it. If the enemy has a gapcloser, she's pretty much lost, either with or without speedboost.\n\n\n> I'm sorry if I sound rude, it is not my intention but people against Sona's nerfs need to be a tad more objective about their complains and actually sit down and play with Sona not to compare her kit with her old self but to master her highs and lows and THEN come and complain for valid things like:\n> \n> -Song of celerity sometimes moving you out of range from a teammate\n> -Aria of healing mana cost\n> -Q aura uptime being too short.\n> -Hidden power in her ult that people barely notices should be in her natural scaling\n\nThe Speedboost for allies is only 1.5 seconds. Her new celerity is extremly selfish, because she benefits the most out of it for now.\n\nThe Aria mana cost is absurdly high, thats true, but  her shield is extremly hard to utilize, and the healing amount is extremly weak too.\n\nThe Q aura uptime is alright in my opinion, and the hidden power in her ultimate is also quite weak, I really hope they come up with something better .\n\nIt's alright to disagree, but I play her extremly often now, even with those nerfs, and in my opinion she's now even weaker than before. I feel awkward to say this, but I really wish that more people would actually try her, mostly support mains, because many people seem to judge her from that what they read, but not from what those spells really do.","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2015-01-07T02:43:59.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"there are things we disagree on and that's ok, though that last paragraph is where I can agree, I'm support bot, meaning that I main ADC and support, (I play in LAN, so this account is here so I can weight in discussions from time to time) and most of the problems people outline I feel like I don't have them.\n\nIn Sona's specific case I've been pretty successful with her, to the point that since her rework I've lost barely something like 20% of the games I've picked her and in none of those I've felt like a nuisance.

More importantly STAY IN THE BACK, use E to go in and out as necessary but never too far in.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-07T03:44:35.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just read the other replies you had for Emoto, and there is reason in what you're saying.\nI played Sona for quite a while, but then again, I played her before and after the gameplay update, and I also haven't played as Sona or even LoL in over a month, so I probably forgot what she is like powerwise, and I am just reading the numbers on her balance changes.\nSo, yes, glass cannon support, but I sometimes prefer some more oomph behind the offensive spells, or just have more offense, if I were to go glass cannon, but that's just me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-07T01:48:32.799+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"i wasn't around so idk wtf I'm talking about\"\n\"but heres my opinion\"\nLMFAO\nI can't breathe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2015-01-06T18:44:32.583+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee Sin is still dominating jungle after 3 seasons?\nGnar is a top lane powerhouse?\nIrelia is semi-playable?\nOlaf is still Olaf?\n\n***Better nerf Sona***","replies":[{"poster":"Nicarasu","date":"2015-01-06T18:52:44.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't played Olaf since he got Olaf'ed.
