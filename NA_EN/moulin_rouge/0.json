Getting a tear will only prolong your zhonyas rush which is crucial against talon and especially zed who will delete you otherwise. \n\nThat's why a armor+manareg item would be a huge help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stiv1234","date":"2015-08-17T12:43:14.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive also thought about such an Item, like maybe built out of Glacial Shroud and Idol or something like that.
