And before that they were primarily ARAM as well. \r\nShe has zero interest in botting or anything of the sort, she is very specifically playing ARAM because she doesn't want to tryhard.\r\nThe only possible explanation we can come up with, because as expecting Riot is only saying \"we are right and we won't tell you why\", is that some other random app in the background is confusing them. \r\nShe isn't running anything out of the ordinary, Discord, LINE(voip/chat app), chrome/edge, nvidia control panel, on WIN10 on a HP laptop.\r\n\r\nOf course they don't care about anything she has to say about it.\r\nYou have been warned. DO NOT RUN ANY\r\nPROGRAMS AT ALL IN THE BACKGROUND.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T22:22:18.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hmmmm there's not much I can say about what happened without having her account to look into, but it's pretty rare for someone to be unintentionally banned for having third party programs running.
