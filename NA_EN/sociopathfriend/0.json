I'll tell you for an ale...","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or not- I'll do it for free!\nOur lovable Titan of the Depths recently got his [lore update with some of the Bilgewater natives](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/nautilus-color-story/) and this passage caught my eye.\n\n> The ship tipped to starboard, right-sudden. It was the weight of the Titan himself, hauling up onto the deck. Perhaps once it’d been a man, but it weren’t no man I saw that night, risin’ from the waves. I has our captain by the throat. “This is your doing!” I roared, as I chokes the bastard, his eyes wide. He can see Nautilus is comin’ for us...\n\n> So I shoves the captain away, down the slanted deck, and **this thing catches him in one hand, if you can believe it! It was so big, the fingers closed completely around ‘is body and the captain weren’t a small man by any stretch.**\n\nKey part bolded. Now I'm a mere lover of numbers, not necessarily good at it, but I enjoy the process.\nI think that actually makes him even bigger than he was in a New Dawn truth be told. This is a tad vague of a process so exact numbers aren't something you should necessarily look for.\n\n\nNow assuming the captain is average (_\"weren't a small man\"_) that would mean he's 5'10. A bit of Google-fu revealed the average-height American adult male (5-foot-10) has an average hand size (measured from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist) of 7.44 inches.\nFor the fingers to close completely around him, Nautilus' hand would have to be twice his height I thinks, since your middle finger is roughly the length of your palm. So from wrist to the end of the finger he could cover the man completely.\nThe other interpretation I'm getting is that Naut is so large that his fingers and his fingers ONLY can cover the man's body completely, which would be roughly double again for the height.\n\nSo to convert to inches (sorry metric boys, Riot's MERICAN) an average adult is 70 inches tall with a 7.44 inch hand.\nNaut's hand would have to be 140 inches tall.  That should make the Titan of the Depths... 1317.2 inches in height?\n109 feet and 9 inches in other words. About 33 meters and change for the metric crowd.\nIf it were only his fingers and not his palm covering the man, you'd double that result or so.\nAgain, this is a patented ballpark calculation, but I enjoy the number-game. Can we get Nautilus into one of those robot skin lines? It's Kaiju-hunting time boys.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-09-27T16:21:35.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviving necro- threads which already had their time to shine is against [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE) and as such I will be locking this thread to make sure it lands at the bottom of the howling abyss.

A bit of Google-fu revealed the average-height American adult male (5-foot-10) has an average hand size (measured from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist) of 7.44 inches...\n\nI'm more of a personal fan of Ifneth's calculations, but there are two complicating factors I wanted to point out about the approximate size of the captain. \n\nFirst, it's tricky to assume that a common captain would have the kind of nutrition that the typical American has - and so that might make the captain shorter.  Hard to say though, as Runeterra has pretty heroic scales.  There's some fascinating studies done into heights of populations over the centuries - and how stress and nutrition at specific pivotal points in development can have huge, genetics-independent, influence on height.  \n\n(I.e. someone growing up in a warzone with poor nutrition will _statistically_ be shorter than someone getting the right nourishment without excess stress, even with the same genes.  I say statistically, because you'll still find some short unstressed/well-fed people and some tall stressed/malnourished people, even with the same genes - but over entire populations, skewing happens.)\n\nSecondly, I suspect that the narrator was using [litotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litotes) (which is a word I just learned about in the last 10 minutes) which means rhetorical understatement.  In the same way that a particularly restrained Brit might describe an incredible turn of good luck as being \"Not the worst thing in the world\", I believe the narrator may have used \"_weren't a small man by any stretch_\" to suggest that the captain was very much the opposite - but in this case, small might not mean height so much as girth, seeing as it is considered relevant to Nautilus' grasp.\n\nNeat topic :D\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2018-06-01T07:51:49.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always enjoyed playing with numbers for some odd reason.

I don't know why you would call it 'wrong' when it's a written work- filling it in with imagination is the point.\n\nI was assuming Nautilus grabbed him with the middle finger more or less vertical or near the shoulder instead of horizontally around the waist as presumably his smallest finger and ring finger would be more towards the waist/legs. However, I was also assuming \"closed completely around his body\" to mean the captain was no longer visible at all- which would mean the grip would completely encompass him. \n\nA fist that was only a bit above a foot in width (16 inches or so) was not capable of such a thing. I was also operating under the (admittedly not stated) premise that your middle finger doesn't really cross half your hand's length when you grab depending how you do so. \nFor the middle finger to go around his waist- Naut's hand must be significantly longer than the waist itself, especially when it must go around the waist, not in it.\n\nI will say I was also taking some glances at his artwork- which while 'alternate' did frequently portray him as capable of covering a person with his entire hand such as [Worldbreaker](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/9d/Nautilus_WorldbreakerSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170118203827) and [Subterranean](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/f/f0/Nautilus_SubterraneanSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170615204937). \nThe [Chinese Subterranean](http://www.leaguesplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Subterranean-Nautilus-Ch.jpg) in particular makes him out to be **massive**. If I were basing my perceptions only off of New Dawn and New Dawn alone, I might've taken your route and aimed for smaller numbers.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2018-06-01T15:40:37.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skin splash arts are inconsistent.

Sailors can embellish a tale to be sure, but we know Nautilus exists and we know he is indeed large- though how large we couldn't say. He's not a mythical creature, but a real being that others can see. As such, the principle disbelief of him even existing is already gone. That leaves only analyzing our records and seeing what stands out.\n\nCinematics, while cool, are not actually lore per say (imo) because of how they're more like trailers for the game itself.\nTryndamere in canon is not in his demon-blade form, yet that's what clashed with Garen in a Twist of Fate. Leona herself is apparently some new tier of aspect-god-thing that didn't even exist as of then. Malphite is apparently supposed to be a small mountain, yet he's basically Jarvan's size in the Dominion cinematic.\nTimes can change.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-01T14:12:27.509+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">And the captain weren’t a small man by any stretch.\n\nTo me this is a polite way of saying \"a big man,\" so I'll make that assumption.\n\nI'd also say \"its fingers closed completely \"around\" his body means \"encircling\" rather than \"completely covering,\" especially as later it mentions that \"Nautilus still held the captain, squirmin’ and wrigglin’ like a stuck worm, but there were no escapin’ that grasp,\" which implies that the captain is visible -- something that wouldn't happen if a hand were closed around him, as he'd be invisible.\n\nWhich means we're looking at a waist size of \"large,\" which I'd suggest that based on US sizes is probably around 38 inches.\n\nThe average grip diameter of a human hand is about 2 inches (for a circumference of about 6.3 inches), and my search for average hand size is 7.24 inches around the median point. So grip diameter is about 85% of total hand height (approximately).\n\nI'll give Nautilus a bit of leeway and say he has some room to spare, so we'll aim for a 41 inch circumference grip, which would mean a 48 inch hand, which would make him 6.5x the height of a human, or 455 inches, or 38 feet tall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crow Nebula","date":"2018-06-01T09:28:31.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can anyone explain why Nautilus is so big?
