{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-03-27T22:22:53.671+0000","title":"Champion Concept- Efreet, the Burning Vengeance","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Work in Progress\n**Yes I know that's already Brand's name, what are the odds- I've never so much as touched Brand... frustration!**\n\nAlternative titles, suggestions would be welcome, \nEfreet-\nthe Burning Fighter\nthe Reborn Flame\nthe Raging Hunter\nthe Fiery Killer\n\n**Appearance**\nI imagine him (or her, could very well work as a female) looking like a mix between Kougaiji (Saiyuki) and Ifrit (FF8).\n(Hopefully the pictures show up somewhere around here, never used attachments before)\nMostly human, with long crimson hair and small horns coming from his forehead. \nLightly dressed in order to have the greatest freedom of movement.\nMore animal than human for movements and attacks.\nFire particles are, of course, mandatory.\n\n**Role**\nEfreet is meant to be a Fighter, specializing in getting to an enemy and staying with them to keep up the fight. As an all-in champion with little sustain, he needs to do well in trades or he&#039;ll be in for a rough time.\n\n**Abilities** \nInnate: \nEvery enemy that takes damage from Efreet&#039;s abilities are marked for 3 seconds. Efreet can dash to the affected units if they are within  450 / 600 / 750 range of him to auto-attack them, consuming the mark. He cannot jump to another target within 5 / 4 / 3 seconds.\n*Efreet&#039;s primary mobility tool, I have a feeling this is going to be hard to successfully balance*\n\nResource:\nInstead of mana or energy, Efreet uses &#039;Fury&#039; as his resource. Using an ability will take an appropriate amount of Fury, which can be restored by attacking marked targets. \n*This is meant to limit Efreet from just endlessly jumping on his enemy laner- without triggering some marks on minions, he&#039;ll soon run out of Fury to use his abilities.*\n\nQ: Mobility\nPassive: For every marked minion, Efreet gains 10 MS, this bonus is 15 MS for enemy champions.\nActive: Efreet attacks the targeted enemy twice, restoring health if they were already marked. (On-hit effects included)\n*Might switch to percentage instead of flat MS. This is meant to work alongside his other abilities to give him that little extra &#039;boost&#039; he needs to reach his enemy and commence the sticking*\n\nW: AoE\nEfreet strikes the ground, causing a burst of flame to strike the area around him, slowing and damaging any unit in 500 range. All enemies struck are marked.\n*Efreet needs some way to mark plenty of units to let him get around, might introduce a shield mechanic to add some durability- if so, the slow is getting removed*\n\nE: Projectile\nEfreet fires forth a bolt of energy in a 1000 range straight-line skillshot. This attack has two different effects based on how far it travels, though both will deal damage and mark the target:\nIf it strikes an enemy within 500 range of launch- the enemy will be stunned for a short duration\nIf it strikes an enemy beyond 500 range- the enemy will instead be slowed\n*Efreet&#039;s Projectile Attack can be used in two ways: to fire from a distance to hopefully slow the enemy so he can catch up to them, or at point-blank after he has already become engaged to keep his enemy where he wants them.*\n\nR: Ultimate\nEfreet creates a massive fireball that he rides into the air for 2.5 seconds. Within this time he can aim and hurl the fireball at enemies within ( 1250 / 1500 1750) range. He will not follow the fireball to its destination.\n*Yep, soon as any of you who know FF8 heard of &#039;Ifrit&#039; you thought about this didn&#039;t you? Combined with the passive part of his Q, this allows Efreet to deal damage and gain the MS to properly jump onto his target.*\n\n\n**Background**\nThe Shuriman Desert is a desolate place, full of danger and inhospitable to native and visitor alike. But there are people who persevere to make a living in this land- {{champion:15}} mercenaries mostly, though some also rob the tombs of the former rulers {{champion:268}} of Shurima&#039;s Empire. With the recent rebirth of Shurima, many tribes and travelers have begun to return to the capital. The way is full of peril; monsters and bandits are daily worries for those who wish to see the resurrected Empire.\n\nOne tribe in particular was meant for a darker destiny than to return to their ancestral home. Already weakened by the loss of their seer, {{champion:90}} the tribe was without the foresight they had become to base many of their decisions on. In the absence of the one who they depended on, the tribe turned to their greatest warrior, the one who protected them from the evils of the world; pleading for him to take up the mantle of leadership. Unsure of his new position, the young man order the tribe to travel to the new-rising leader of Shurima in hopes of finding a new future and hope for their tribe. This was a mistake that would have dire consequences.\n\nTemporarily leaving his tribe to scout ahead, the warrior returned to find devastation and sorrow. A group of bandits had descended on the caravan, looting what few possessions they had and killing everyone- resisting or not. Fury boiling in his heart, he followed the bandits and descended upon them during the night. When dawn finally came, the bandit corpses littered the remains of their stronghold; despite his grievous wounds, the man did not die. For it is said that he who sheds the blood of men in vengeance and hate loses a part of himself every time, and instead something new enters his heart.\n\n*\"A new dawn rises over the birth of a new power.\"* Efreet walks off towards the rising sun, eager to see how Runeterra had changed since he last gazed upon it.\n\nOh right, legal stuff- \nRiot; if you in any way, shape, or form want to take any part of this concept- go for it. I&#039;m just making it for fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-03-27T22:39:40.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Brand, The Burning Vengeance\"\n\n{{champion:63}} *We have a problem.*","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-03-27T23:18:14.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double whoops","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-03-28T14:54:46.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clearing up some of the writing for abilities","replies":[]},{"poster":"ActuallyArrow","date":"2015-03-27T23:02:27.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, but isn't {{champion:63}} \"The Burning Vengeance\" already?","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-03-27T23:22:17.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-27T23:15:40.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, in that case, it's more like,\n\n*\"The Burning Re-vengeance.\"*","replies":[]}]}
