Could, for instance, the visual of pings within a radius be drawn into a central position of the first ping?  As a lazy player I tend to look at my map when I hear a ping but this becomes very hard when one particular teammate thinks they need to be a goon and spam ping a bush because someone was spotted crossing a ward.  Rather than a mass of big red 'get your butt back to base' blips blocking what champ was there can we make it more a rapid pulsing sort of ping to keep visibility up?","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-11-20T02:10:08.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a better solution to this problem and many others is reducing the amount of ping spams to 3, with the same CD.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2014-11-20T02:40:03.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like this idea as well, but without being able to see it in game I could not say how much it would help.","replies":[]}]}]}
