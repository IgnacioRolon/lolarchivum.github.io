Keeping this in mind I would like to suggest that we update the scoreboard to better reflect what we veteran players already know by heart at this point.(or at least should know)\r\n\r\nMy request is that the scoreboard be updated from a Kill/Death/Assist format to a Takedown/Death/Objective setup.  I feel this would boost the feeling of teamwork during game and help hint to players that they still need to be thinking about pressuring towers and dragon/baron.  This would also take a lot of pressure off of newer players to perform well immediately and allow them to focus on what they feel they are able to contribute with the champion they have picked rather than matching the KDA of the pro or youtube personality they just watched in hopes of learning only to be discouraged that they are performing poorly.  I also feel this would boost interest in trying the support role as participation would become drasticly more visible with this format.\r\n\r\nI fully admit I may not be thinking of all the positives and negatives of this change and any help bringing them up would be appreciated.  That being said I still feel the scoreboard should provide better information for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"xPhantomDancerX","date":"2017-11-27T17:34:06.155+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should definitely have scores for objectives.
