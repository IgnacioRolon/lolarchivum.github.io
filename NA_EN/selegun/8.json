With all the talk of nerfs I&#039;ve seen none seems to hit on what he needs most.  Harvester of Sorrow doesnt give enough counterplay to opponents.\r\n\r\nTo make Morde feel less overwhelming with this skill could it be changed to only give the move speed to allies and not Morde himself?  I feel i can stand anywhere and then just charge in for trades and all ins with this skill far too easily while also using it to escape ganks that should have cost me my life many more times than should have been allowed.","replies":[]}
