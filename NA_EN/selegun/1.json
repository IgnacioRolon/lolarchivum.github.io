It's frustrating to look for info online as more often than not the posts are not up to date or don't have the info I'm looking for. With a wiki available in client it would be fast and safe for players to share info while giving a resource for new players to reference should they wish to learn about something but not know where to look for it.\r\n\r\nI guess in a way I'd like to have a resource in-client to reference at my fingertips rather than googling it and taking away my time from the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-11-01T00:08:52.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And one bump for views XP","replies":[]}]}
