A little while ago I was talking with a friend about Azir and how great the champ was.  Not knowing much about him I looked over his release info and a few patch notes and something kinda stuck out and got me thinking about his tower creation passive.  In a nut shell, why not let Morde use Children of the Grave against dead champions?  I feel this could smooth out a bit of his win hard/lose hard playstyle if perhaps even letting Morde only ult the dead for up to 5ish seconds after death.  This could keep his early game about the same while allowing his late game to be a bit more flexible if he falls behind.\r\n\r\nAlso, small extra question.  How would Morde feel as a champion if his passive was replaced with Xerath's old passive?  (I think that was the one that gave extra armor for building AP)","replies":[{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-01-16T23:25:48.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Way too powerful with that ability. You can't buff anything about him tbh unless you nerf his late game. As I'm sure you know a full build morde is probably the scariest champ in the game since full build opponents still struggle a great deal against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-01-16T22:59:20.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can actually ult Sion's corpse, but it won give a ghost.\n\nRito plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2015-01-16T06:53:05.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give him a better innate sustain!","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-01-16T22:53:42.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see this a lot and I used to agree with it for a long time.  However, I actually think Morde has to much sustain and because of this his overall and potential power suffers for it.  \n\nI'm also curious to see what reducing Morde's speed could give him in potential power.  Not a flat nerf mind you, that would be silly.  I'm talking something along the lines of an additional spell cost that makes his speed decay with each cast and returns when he is out of combat.","replies":[]}]}]}
