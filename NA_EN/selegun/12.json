I know very little about this image so this is what I was able to find.\r\n\r\n1. The photo originates from France.  It is of a projector that was set up to cycle League splash art at a convention about a year ago.\r\n2. I first found this image on a League news site similar to Surrender @ 20 but can no longer find it myself.  On the site it teased this image as the Sion rework.  (lol, silly internet)\r\n3. After Sion was proven to be different than the photo it was then relabeled as a teaser for Kalista.\r\n4. After Kalista was officially teased and released the hype for the image kinda just died off.  A few speculations came up but nothing real interesting ever was debated.\r\n\r\nSo now a year later, ripped from the dying circuits of my old phone, does anyone know anything about this?  If a Rioter sees this, you dont have to elaborate at all, I&#039;m just curious if this is real or fake.","replies":[{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-09-04T03:20:32.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just an art demo i think. there were a few practice pieces that have been up in the past including and Exterminator Twitch concept and a Battlecast Kog'Maw concept (which made it through to production albiet looking a bit different)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohail316","date":"2015-09-03T23:51:30.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly forgot about it, maybe thats the 'they are coming' thing with others?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-09-04T00:01:20.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could be interesting.

If I recall right Riot never claimed it was anything more, and brought up again that it was a practice piece on the boards. That's why the hype died, it was never suppose to be a teaser.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-09-03T23:42:38.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aww, thats kinda sad.
