Minions melt before them and and champions eagerly give up their gold when these two press in around them.  Trust me when i say you need to have a friend to help you handle this pair.\r\n\r\nClick bait out of the way, I&#039;m talking about Mordekaiser and Darius.  XP\r\n\r\nSeriously, this lane was fun.  One Apprehend into Harvester and the entire minion wave was gone leaving our minions to push tower while we took a stroll into jungle for a quick smite of the enemy Brambleback with enough time to get back for the second wave.  The sustain with these two is awesome and it really makes you smile to see the enemy flee from a full minion wave after liquidating theirs.\r\n\r\nThanks Riot!  This combo would never exist without your gentle nudge!","replies":[{"poster":"Tyren","date":"2015-08-21T16:03:10.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I supported a Mord with Thresh last night, the lane went well. The game not so much, because other people going \"hurr durr\".","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-21T16:29:10.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Morde might have needed to move around alittle more.  Not being in your game i cant say much but i highly recommend taking {{champion:45}} mid if you want to see people panic lol","replies":[]}]}]}
