I feel bad sending in these pictures for that slutty RP and to satisfy their need for these drawings but, Every summoner has their needs. Im sorry guys. Kappa. The First is Ecokko, He is Ekko&#039;s Brother from another time stream. The second is RoOvEn, the slightly less but still up to par executioner. And last is Velkooz, Hes just there because he has a funny name. I included some bronze gates. Yay I need exactly 9 RP for a 975 skin and if we can just keep this between Riot Support and I thatd be great LoL community.","replies":[{"poster":"Automatis","date":"2016-05-20T00:04:47.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/y04FN5N.gif?noredirect","replies":[]}]}
