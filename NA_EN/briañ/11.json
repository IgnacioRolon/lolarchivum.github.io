I have internet that keeps me at a constant 70-80 ping in game, my FPS stays at a constant screen capped 60 fps only drops when everyone ults at once, and I have been constantly dcing at timed intervals in game. I dont know if it is the servers or if it is something I am doing wrong but when Im clearing  a jungle camp at 13 minutes in and a lane requests help, Id rather not dc when I am in the lane and feed a kill. Any suggestions as to what I can do? {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Miezner","date":"2015-03-14T21:21:16.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing has been happening to me, my ping is normally between 90-120 highest i'll get is maybe 140 simply cause I live on the east coast.  My fps is around 40 not the best and certainly not the worst.\n\nBut since patch 5.4 I have been consistently dcing in all of my games. While I'm in lobby, I just get disconnected from the pvp.net server at random.  The dces aren't just lil hiccups either they last a good 10-20 seconds making everything in the game just stop moving.  \n\nI've also been getting quite a few bugsplats during loading screens.  I have been disconnected from the server three times in a row before it finally loaded me into the game.\n\nI can't go into ranked knowing I'll have this problem.  Cause now it's now a question of \"IF\" the dc will happen, it's \"WHEN\".","replies":[]}]}
