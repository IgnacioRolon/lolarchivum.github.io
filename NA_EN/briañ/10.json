When in bronze 5 I gain roughly 20 for a win but when I get to bronze 4 and I still have a win streak for like 5 games I only gain around 13 LP. I understand that rito has done their best to get this system flawless but I have increased my skill level. And the system wont let me go any higher. It is just really frustrating, I have consulted with plat diamond tiers from a tourny I have regularly done for 8 months now and they said the best thing to do is to just go with the flow. Sorry for rant im just salty","replies":[]}
