My ping is usually 30-40 but ever since last week my ping has been jumping from anywhere between 150-1600 and I know it's not my internet because I haven't changed service or providers. So I was wondering if anyone know why it was happening.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-09-17T06:11:30.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is most likely your internet.

That's most likely the source of the ping spikes you've had, and unfortunately packet loss is typically caused by the route that your ISP is directing your connection. I'd suggest reaching out to them with this data as well as a traceroute if possible to let them know something might not be working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"RSP4Lyfe","date":"2017-09-26T00:31:58.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Apataker","date":"2017-09-17T11:44:56.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its is been laggy this week lately","replies":[{"poster":"RSP4Lyfe","date":"2017-09-21T13:35:59.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea it was","replies":[]}]}]}
