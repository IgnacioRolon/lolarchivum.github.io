Well, to put it simply...\n\nYou're making a big stink over something that doesn't even exist. There's no such thing as intentional feeders. Everyone gives it their best. It's just that their best isn't always good enough. So, yeah, the rule against intentional feeding is absurd and needs to go, not only because it's a rule against something that doesn't even exist, but I can't even imagine how many innocent players have gotten banned from the game all because they get killed a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T02:00:13.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be great if this were always the truth, but sadly there are some times when some players feel the need to turn to the dark side and begin throwing games either out of anger or for 'fun'. Since it still happens sometimes and can be attributed to bots as well, I don't think that system or rule will be going anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackRocket4543","date":"2018-01-11T09:20:13.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, it should. That way, people can't accuse innocent players of intentional feeding or threaten to report them for it. You don't report people for things that don't exist. If a player dies a lot, they're just having a bad time. Happens to everyone. ...Which, now that I've said it out loud, makes me feel kinda stupid for repeatedly uninstalling the game because I'm kill fodder most of the time. But, on the other hand, you can't really blame me for getting upset. It's one thing to get a killed a couple of times, but to get killed again and again and again with no end in sight? That would upset anybody. Bottom line, I'm sticking with my belief that kill-feeding doesn't exist and that there shouldn't be a rule against it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-11T11:57:51.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are inexperienced in the game, play against bots. Learn how to play the game without dying every 40 seconds due to extremely aggressive actions. You shouldn't have any more than 2 deaths in any bot game. If you are, you should learn and know the reasons for your deaths at that point. Learn when you should play passive, and when it's a good time to play aggressive. If you're constantly being killed to the point where you feed in the majority of your games, it's usually due to things you could have avoided, but didn't care or were too slow to avoid. Intentional feeding exists, whether or not you want to believe it.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackRocket4543","date":"2018-01-11T21:47:05.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, it does not.

I myself have been accused of intentional feeding several times. It's not like that. I don't feed myself to an enemy champion. They either outsmart me and kill me or they catch me when I try to run and kill me then. Either way, I don't feed and I wish people would stop accusing me of feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-11T11:50:37.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentional feeding: Player A runs down mid level 3. They run past the enemy champion without touching them. They run into the range of the enemy turret and stand there while the enemy champion is attacking them. They do not retaliate to either the champion or the turret both killing them. They die for no reason. They repeat the process, thus feeding their opponent. Does it happen? Quite often. But like you said, you deleted the game and don't play anymore. So. Why are you even here questioning something about a game you don't even play anymore? Obviously you don't know what happens in games.\n\nDo people falsely accuse others of intentional feeding? Yeah, they're upset. Even if they decide to report them, it could be labeled as false reports. If for some reason it slips up and thinks you were intentionally feeding, you can dispute it with support, and they will review it, and most likely lift the punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackRocket4543","date":"2018-01-18T13:42:24.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's something else.\n\nWhy are THEY upset?

Other players get killed a lot and they're still there playing, even with the false accusations of feeding.\n\nKeep honing my skills so I can get killed less and maybe even end more games with more kills than deaths. I know there's ways to outsmart those enemy champions. I've done it before.\n\nGet it through my head that the enemy champions are just a barrier to the main goal. It's the enemy Nexus we really want.\n\nBut, I'm still calling for the removal of the rule against feeding.

If you include assists and look at the overall KDR, the average is just above 2:1, so you should put your aim around there. For example, if you were 4/9/15, it shows you were in a good amount of team fights, but weren't necessarily the person who got the last hit out, and were probably being focused by the enemy because they might have seen your champion as a threat. It may not be the best looking score, but it's about average. It varies based on what role you're playing of course. I've had games where literally all 4 of the other players on my team went negative, and below a 2:1 KDR, but we still stuck together and pulled out for a win. Sometimes all you need is one good team fight and the will to push all the way. Regardless of what you think though, intentional feeding does exist, and it ruins the game for other players. Intentional feeding is when players intentionally suicide and give free kills, and often happens because they're either trolling or are upset with one of their teammates. Simply having a bad game is not worthy of a report, but it's an attitude that is usually reflected in their chat behavior. When people say \"kill me, free kill\" or \"open mid\" or \"i gave you that turret\" - those are signs of giving up and letting the enemy take free kills or objectives, and is not a behavior that other players would support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-11T02:19:33.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just less than a week ago, 2 opponents in my game decided to spend the majority of the game running through jungle and directly towards my fountain.
