When my MMR was around 1150, I won 14/15 of the next games and then I had around 1300 MMR. I then lost one game and my MMR dropped to 1225. After around a 70% WR in the past 30 games, My MMR has gone down to 1150. During this time, I have ranked up from silver 5 0 lp to Silver 3 30 lp. I have lost approximately 70 MMR for each loss. I realize that OP.GG may not be correct, but I am still playing with bronze and low silvers. When I had 1300 MMR, I was playing with Silver 4 to Silver 2. I believe I am better than the other players I play with, but it is really hard to improve my rank when I gain so little LP per match because of my low MMR. My MMR was so screwed up that it took around 10 wins in a row to rank up from S5 to S4. I am worried that when new season starts and I do my placements, I will get like 7-3 and go to  \r\nlike bronze 3.       \r\n\r\nIs there any way to gain more MMR, and is this issue normal?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T03:17:27.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldn't read too much into what a third-party site lists your MMR at.
