In the moment I pushed the Button someone wanted to trade with me. After that the &quot;Skin Boost&quot; Button was grey and it read &quot;Processing&quot;, but we didn&#039;t get the option to choose our skins. In the afterchat was a notice that i paid the RP and get the IP Boost. The RP are now gone, although we couldn&#039;t choose our skins. Would be nice if I get the RP back, you can also have your IP back. :) And please fix. Thx. Sry for bad english.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nGofodos","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-26T01:28:23.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Gofodos! \n\nBased on what you're describing, the boost did go through.
