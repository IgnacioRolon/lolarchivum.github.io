Afterwards, you wouldn't be able to reconnect anymore and will get a leavebuster. At the moment I'm writing this, it just happened and lost LP. Can't Riot make it that when it happens to you, if you can't reconnect, make the others also leave the game but no one will lose anything. This is really unfair cause I lose LP that I work for, get a leavebuster and have to wait for the game to fix itself. This happened several times before and it's really unfair. \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, do something about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T21:00:57.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not a whole lot we can do when one person leaves the match when their client crashed, we can however guide you through some steps that should help stop that from happening again.
