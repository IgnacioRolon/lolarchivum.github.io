I know that there have been other people with similar problems and i wondered if anyone actually came up with something to fix that bug? Because its really frustrating \"losing\" your promo because of things like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T20:27:30.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever see these kinds of errors again, try not to queue up for things like ranked where it could hurt your promos or rank by getting disconnected/kicked from the lobby. It's best to start troubleshooting as soon as you notice something might be wrong. \n\nWe've noticed some issues with the client crashing if you're using the Discord overlay feature. First things first, let's disable that overlay if you're using it. Second, go ahead and run through the steps in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) as well as running a repair through the client options. Test it in a custom or practice match, and let me know if that doesn't help so we can dig a little further.","replies":[]}]}
