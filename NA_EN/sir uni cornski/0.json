It would definitely make him easier to balance as a botlane role, as ADC&#039;s couldn&#039;t poke him as effortlessly as now. I don&#039;t know sh*t about balancing, but maybe it would be a thought to linger upon","replies":[{"poster":"sneezing slug","date":"2016-06-20T21:26:29.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly Morde is fine how he is. His play in the bot lane really isn't that popular and isn't his main function. He's mostly a top laner, and if done right, and I am speaking as a Mordekaiser main, he's an amazing top laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-20T21:23:37.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or why not just give him a small sivir/vayne range and make him an short range bruiser adc.","replies":[{"poster":"sneezing slug","date":"2016-06-20T21:25:30.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I am Pacman,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gg3E8c4W,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-20T21:23:37.107+0000)\n>\n> Or why not just give him a small sivir/vayne range and make him an short range bruiser adc.\n\nOr we could not.\n\nHe's not meant to be an ADC.
