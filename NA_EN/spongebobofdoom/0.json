The high ping was there after the updating the patch but the lag spikes appeared after I uninstalled some program called game booster. I also lag while plaaying low performance games like Cartoon Strike online on the browser. What do you think the problem is? I'm currently in Iraq and play on NA. Here are the results from my speedtest.net while being connected with ethernet.\r\n\r\n PING\r\n8 ms \r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD\r\n8.79 Mbps\r\n\r\n UPLOAD\r\n1.31 Mbps","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T16:29:26.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a network issue like packet loss that can cause sudden spikes like that.  Your physical distance from the NA server is also very far, so you're generally going to have higher ping.  You can run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection, but keep in mind it's not really possible to exceed that distance.  If possible, you may want to look into a transfer to a closer region just in case.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
