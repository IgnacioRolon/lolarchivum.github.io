Then runes are eliminated with no compensation (i understand that Riot is considering a method of compensation).  Seems a little unfair.  Is Riot obligated to make it 'fair'?  Of course not.  But they can and most often do try to make things fair.\n\nI don't know, it's not that big a deal in any case, but that's how i see it.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-01T20:52:38.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats funny the skins/champs etc you buy in game with RP (aka real $$$ ) is not owned by you, they are property of riot and riot just lets you use them (aka license ) to you as long as you are in good standing with your agreement of TOS (account) \n\nso that is how when you see people cry over bans and say i spent X amount $ they are to dumb to realize nothing in their account is theirs not even the account","replies":[{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2017-07-01T23:00:37.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you say here is true, but misses the point. Riot loses little when they permanently ban a toxic player who happened to have paid money for content. It can be reasonably argued that Riot gains from doing so, by improving the player experience such that other players are more willing to purchase RP. Indeed, an incredibly small fraction of players are permanently banned. Most people don't care that the toxic player receives no recompense, or that the toxic player is upset that they receive no recompense. \n\nWhen Riot changes the runes system in the upcoming preseason, literally every single active player will be affected. If Riot chooses to provide no compensation, they create a LOT of consumer ill-will. It's a completely different situation. Instead of a tiny fraction of upset people, you suddenly have a near-universal percentage of players upset at a lack of recompense.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-02T02:18:19.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but as a player who has played since end of season 2 and has all champs, 20 rune pages, more runes then i need i wouldnt care that i didnt get a \"refund\" of ip \n\nwtf could i use it for in game? \n\nhell a week ago i had over 25k in IP and blew it getting mystery champ shards to turn into blue essences","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-01T17:23:12.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They haven't said how they plan on compensating players who spent IP or RP on the old runes, but they have said that they're working on something.
