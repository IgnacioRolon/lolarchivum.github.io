Is there no way to buff it/reorient it for a respectable late game niche?\r\n\r\nI would love to see some components replaced with Stinger so that the final item has 10% CDR, and tack on some flat MS onto the recipe. This gives it some nice synergy with DPS items that grant % MS like shiv or zephyr.\r\n\r\nMain problem I can see is that it presents some issues with Teemo, but I honestly think that if 1 champ is holding an item back from being used by everyone else, the champ should be dealt with rather than the item (Gunblade and Akali anyone?).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-06-29T19:29:56.937+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love exploring different options for items. Runaan's is tricky; before Kayle started using it, it was completely neglected.  \n\nI do see a slight lack in synergy in your proposed stats: CDR allows for more spellcasts, whereas the item is otherwise wholly focused on auto-attacking.  I know we have created this perception of synergy between attack speed and CDR through the likes of Kayle and Teemo, but I'm tempted to say we should break that mold.","replies":[{"poster":"Borand","date":"2014-06-29T20:47:17.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've done this on nashors too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-06-29T19:47:36.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Want to hear my opinion?\n\nI think you guys limited the scope of the item a tad too much. \n\n\nThe biggest issue is that this item is a complete waste of space if you are fighting anything less than 2 champions at the same time, and even in a team fight it doesn't mean you will always be making use of those extra procs.\n\n\nThe idea is technically great on paper(double my overall damage AND apply a limited range of on-hits? Sweet!), but the problem is that there are far too many cases where the item isn't getting it's gold's worth.\n\n\nThere are two ways to tackling this item. *1) give it something more for those moments where you aren't hitting more than one champions* and *2) increase the range of champions who can use this* or *3) make it less risky*.\n\n\nSo far I have three solutions...\n\n\n**1.** Let this item work with **\"on next attack\" abilities** like Sivir's{{champion:15}}  Ricochet, Draven's{{champion:119}}  Spinning Axe, Sheen{{item:3057}} , Lulu's{{champion:117}}  Passive, Twitch's{{champion:29}}  Ratatatatat, etc.\n\n\nNow, does this sound a little OP? Maybe. But you'll never know till you try is what I always say. But look at how many champions this is a noob trap on. You would THINK it'd be cool on Jinx, but nope, sucks, hella fun! But I got called a \"fucking troll cunt\" in the past for it, and I had people troll me intentionally because of the assumption that I was trolling for building this item. So ergo, no go on Jinx. And remember, those bolts are WEAKER than your normal AA, so those extra ricochet attacks on Sivir isn't nearly as brutal as you'd think, and said Sivir already sacrificed a much stronger item in favour for this anyways. So imo, it's really not nearly as OP as you'd think.\n\n\n\n**2.** As for solving the other issue. How about **give Runaan's some sort of innate stat that decreases the more bolts you fire out?**\n\n\n**3.** champions who uses Runaan's tends to want to stay within a relatively dangerous range if they want to truly maximize the bolts, therefore **make it provide survivability instead of or along with AS?**. Make it so that a Varus player could justify risking himself to apply his W to multiple targets.\n\n\n\n\nSo? How does solutions 1, 2, and 3 sound? Any possible issue? 1 is a little risky, but you can not deny how fun it will be right? Wouldn't you want to see Pix get off his lazy arse and fire 3x his bolts?\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2014-06-29T20:05:38.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the item that focus all about attack speed and making auto attacks priority, it gives nothing to make you want to auto attack. It supposed to be wave-clearing/attacking more than one thing but most ADC have spells to wave-clear and uses static shiv for hitting multiple enemies. \n\n\nThe only reason I get it on certain champs is because the bolts apply on-hit effects so things like Black Cleaver and frozen mallet effect more targets. But that requires to build other things before or after Runaan's to make it feel useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe if Runaan's had it own on-hit effect.......","replies":[{"poster":"innervation","date":"2014-06-30T00:02:43.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Maybe if Runaan's had it own on-hit effect.......\n\nYeah, given that the bolts apply on hit affects, this seems like a logical thing to add to the item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-06-30T08:34:38.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the recurve bow should be replaced with a mini Runaan's so the build path is smoother as right now you get literally no benefits until you finish Runaan's. Actually I lie because you still need some AD to make the other shots do damage, maybe the base damage should be increased.\n\nIn general Runaan's is conceptionally fine it just needs some tweaks and buffs as the extra bolts do 0 damage compared to the explosive damage crit gives and the radius for the bolts is still too small. Lowering crit damage would also naturally make Runaan's more enticing as an alternate build but would still need other tweaks.\n\nHere's an idea.\n\nMini Runaan's: Builds from Long Sword, Dagger + 310g (total 1220g)\n\nStats: 25% AS, UNIQUE PASSIVE: Your basic attacks fire minor bolts at 2 nearby targets, each dealing 10 (+ 25% AD) physical damage and applying on-hit effects. Bolts have 400 range.\n\nRunaan's Hurricane: Builds from Mini Runaan's + Dagger + Dagger + 180g (total 2300g)\n\nStats: 70% AS, UNIQUE PASSIVE: Your basic attacks fire major bolts at 2 nearby targets, each dealing 30 (+ 50% AD) physical damage and applying on-hit effects. Bolts have 400 range.\n\nThere are flaws but I think the direction is good. The big question atm is AD from Long Sword disappearing because the base damage for the bolts does not apply on your base attack. Maybe that base damage could be turned into a second Unique Passive so basic AA's and the bolts get the benefit. An alternative for Mini Runaan's is to keep the %AD at 50% but have only 1 bolt until you upgrade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-06-29T19:58:52.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to phreak, Hurricane was meant more for AP/On hit champs than as a pure ADC item.  It took off on people like Kayle and teemo because they were the intended group for it.\n\nThis would also explain why there's no CDR on it: AP champs are the most likely to max it out anyways.  LB would be a better item for CDR because it encourages you to mix spell casts with AAs more than Nashor's.\n\nI agree the item is weird and needs work (I've talked about it in the past) but right now I dunno what should be done with it simply because it isn't meant for ADCs specifically even if they can make use of it.","replies":[]}]}
