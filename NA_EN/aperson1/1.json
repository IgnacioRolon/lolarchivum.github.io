Riot takes high ban rates very seriously and the vast majority of the community is clearly not afraid of Lee at all considering they never ban him and the chance of him being picked on the enemy team is high. You wanna know what the difference is between Lee being popular and Sejuani being popular? Sejuani being popular pushes her banrate above 80%. Lee's banrate never goes up no matter how popular he is.

The answer is an absolute shit ton. I've had so many games as Ashe where literally the only reason we ever got anything done was because I started fights with arrows. When you hit that 2-3 second stun on someone on the enemy team, you force them into making a very unpleasant choice: Try to counter-engage while someone on your team is stunned, or leave them to die.

But straight buff and nerfs to champions get really repetitive and irritating and I'm really tired of the \"underplayed=weak and needs buffs\" trend Riot and this community has taken the last few years. I remember back during early Season 4 when Riot gave Tristana small buff after small buff for like 4 patches and then suddenly she's the best adc in the game by far as soon as the adc items change. I remember when Elise was considered terrible, they gave her small buff after small buff, finally relented and gave her a big buff, and now she's pick or ban in every single game. I remember when they buffed Sejuani multiple times at the beginning of Season 5, made her broken when Cinderhulk came out, and had to absolutely gut her burst damage to compensate for it. Hecarim also got small buffs over time until he became a completely dominant top laner and had to be nerfed multiple times to bring him into line. We're at the tail end of the \"Buff Lux slowly until she's OP\" trend. And guess what's going to happen to Xin Zhao 3 patches from now? He's going to get nerfed hard because they're giving a huge buff to a fairly balanced champion now. Ashe will be the same once they decide to buff her. Mark my words on that one.","replies":[{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2016-02-10T01:01:18.880+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree buffs are dangerous and people shouldn't call for buffs just because a champ is no longer FotM. I've played Ashe for a long time and love playing the champ (my 2nd highest mastery) and will continue to play her regardless of what happens, but I can clearly see she is not nearly as good as before the preseason. Her slow got nerfed hard (5-25% vs 5-35% is a big deal, a decaying critical slow does not make up for that), her Q got nerfed, thankfully they didn't touch her ult (they probably never will, it's a good ult) but it really hurt the OTHER reason you would pick Ashe for, which is her easily applied slow letting you chase enemies and helping your team to clean up fights.\n\nThe reason I think Ashe can handle a buff is two-fold:\n\n1st, she is very specialized. She very much has a lot of her power budget in ECA and Hawkshot, so as a result her DPS is good, bur not as good as other carries who specialize in DPS like Draven or Vayne. She has essentially ZERO burst, not even the ability to get lucky crits, so champs like Lucian or Corki beat her in that easily. Her reach is not that great, compared to her auto range Volley is pretty long range compared to her autos, and it helps her lane a lot, but you look at other carries' options like Corki's rockets, Ezreal's Mystic Shot, Lucian's Culling etc. She doesn't have the option to contribute DPS to a fight when it's unsafe to autoattack, at best she can contribute 1.0 AD to the enemy frontline every 4s, that's it.\n\n2nd, she has exploitable weaknesses. Which is kind of based on her specialization. She has ZERO mobility. No blinks, no dashes, no movespeed boosts, and the lowest base MS in the game. She CANNOT handle an assassin or bruiser diving her and gibbing her. Her specialization means she has no way of really retaliating, even with perfect orbwalking, many bruisers like Vi, Xin, etc. will catch up to an Ashe with impunity and kill her before she kills them. At best she can try to point-blank stun them, which is a good defense, but is heavily reliant on her biggest and most impactful cooldown and only deals with one threat for one second. There's also the fact that there are a lot more abilities nowadays which can counteract her initiation. Doesn't matter that you landed a great arrow on the enemy ADC if Tahm just eats them and walks away, or Kindred ults them and turns your engage on its head. \n\nWhat does this all mean? It means Ashe has a \"release valve\" on her kit. Even if her numbers are so strong that she becomes a hotly contested pick, counters will naturally pop up to ensure she never totally dominates the meta. That's why I think it's safe to buff her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-02-09T23:18:38.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless they completely revert to relaunch Ashe (when she was first reworked) she will never reach OP. Her laning phase is atrocious since she has ONE ability until level 6 and then she gets a whopping 2. She has to literally get carried out of lane by her support and will STILL do less damage than most carries on similar items. She is outclassed in kiting by Ez and Kalista by a LONG shot and does significantly less damage than the other \"immobile\" ADCs such as Jinx and soon to be buffed Sivir.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
