He is more like a young Indie Jones. The guy who is hooked on the thrill and danger, likes to snatch artifacts, would kill without remorse and enjoy daring into tombs and hate to comply with authorities.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2019-01-30T23:54:07.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perspective that inspired Ezreal: Indiana Jones is the world's worst archaeologist. He breaks his own rules, wantonly destroys priceless artifacts, and decimates countless possible UNESCO world heritage sites. And he's rarely reprimanded for such. Despite teaching that one should never trust folklore over fact, he never abides by that golden rule. He is also my very favorite film hero for all of his flaws. He doesn't need to be good or make reparations for his escapades. He is pure pulpy escapist fun. That's what I find so enchanting about Ez -- he's naturally a magic user but refuses to allow that to make him special alone -- he wants accolades and fame -- which is exactly where Jones is early in his career. He hasn't been tempered by the forces or darkness or witnessed humbling divinity. \n\nIf the Lore Lords have their way, I will one day get to return to Ezreal, as I already have a very long arc of stories sketched out for our favorite gauntleted almost-hero.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2019-01-31T15:33:42.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I look forward to seeing those stories, hopefully sooner rather than later :)\n\nIs there anything you can tease for Ezreal right now?
