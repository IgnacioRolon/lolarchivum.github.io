We're lucky we get loss prevention at all, and then people get spoiled and want it for every little disconnect that happens... even if it's just a person rage quitting on their team.\n\nIt just can't happen because it would be exploited to death. If the servers literally crash, then yeah, loss prevention for all, because the game isn't functioning properly. But if someone just decides to AFK, Riot can't just loss prevention the game due to that being easily exploited to avoid losing LP or whatever. Even if multiple people on your team leave... All you'd need is to have a duo team both AFK in your game and then boom, loss prevented and no LP lost. Exploited.\n\nYou are justified in being mad that you lost LP in a game where you didn't have a full team... but you can't be mad at Riot for it... be mad at the people who left the game or whatever, but don't expect Riot to magically know the game got screwed because of an ISP going down briefly.","replies":[{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-03-28T00:18:54.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give this man a cookie. \n\nAlthough, I think the mercy system should be implemented.
