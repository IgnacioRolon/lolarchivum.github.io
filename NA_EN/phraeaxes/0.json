Please explain.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, I started trying out for ranked yesterday and carried on today. I played support in all three roles, first game, admittedly was a whitewash because our team actually chose to work as a team, but my second and third games, I wished I&#039;d dodged in champ select (but didn&#039;t thinking it would screw my rankings), and have have two games back to back where we&#039;ve been trolled so hard by people who you&#039;d deem toxic, but that&#039;s par for the course? In all three games I asked for support because it is the least wanted role, and in two of those three now, we&#039;ve had the worst kind of arseholes I could have asked to play with. People who run up mid lane and die under the enemy tower over and over and over and over until the opposing mid is 5-0 up and then swaps up to top lane to repeat the process, people who deliberately choose to pick something antimeta and feed like an all you can eat at Old Country... and then get upset about losing to something more intelligent. People who troll their teammates in champ select to set off whatever triggers the moron who decided running up to the tower over and over and over in the first place.\n\nAt what point should this be screwing over *my* placements? Why are these people so unafraid of the consequences of their behaviour? Because, the system screws over someone who gets angry and says, something out of turn. Now I&#039;ve yet to have a chat restriction, but I can well see it happening if this is the way forwards.\n\nProblem is, I suspect the first game, that we had where we worked as a team, communicated and generally did smart things was the outlier in this scenario, not the norm. I mean, people in normals have bad behaviour, but this? Seriously this goes beyond anything I&#039;ve seen so far. Why Lyte is champ select behaviour not deemed important enough to punish? Why is dodging people who&#039;re clearly setting out to upset their own side, deemed more accepable than say swearing in the heat of the moment when stuff is going wrong?\n\nAnd most importantly, in my placements, can I dodge this, because it&#039;s rediculous? I&#039;d happily wait half an hour for a second chance at not having to deal with this kind of behaviour. Because I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s a one off occurance and would like a better than 50/50 chance of having to deal with griefers in my placements.","replies":[]}
