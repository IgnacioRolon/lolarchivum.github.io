We play some, and a few days after coming back I get a message that I've been perma-banned. WTF?!?!? I've never gotten chat restricted, never gotten a 2 week ban, nothing, unless I got the ban in the months that I was gone. The email sent to my account gave no information, only saying that I violated the Code of Conduct. I've seen a few people say they were wrongly accused for \"3rd party software use,\" but if anyone or Riot checks my op.gg and watches my games, they will sure as hell know that I haven't been cheating. I have sent a support ticket to Riot, but just wanted to know if anyone else has had this issue or know anything about it. Here's a pic of my banning. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/06f1a28d88680b78a3a04858080586e1.png","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T04:15:38.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like there might have been a period of time where your account was being used by someone (ie hacked/compromised). It's entirely possible this happened during the time that your account was compromised, which is why you don't remember this ban happening. This punishment will likely stick as the use of scripts was detected, but you're always welcome to talk with the agent in your [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more information.","replies":[{"poster":"A27Killer","date":"2017-10-09T04:39:39.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like you have seen my account info, can you tell me which game and program of scripts was used? i have played 9 games since 9/16, which is the last time i remember playing, but I'm not that great of a player. Just watch my games and anyone will be able to tell that I'm not a scripter. This is just ridiculous and I'm really frustrated that some automated machine probably banned me for something I never did.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T04:40:53.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be sure to hit us up in that [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for any further details since this starts to encroach on personal account details.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"G FUEL Guzzler","date":"2017-10-09T03:26:08.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"hmmm sounds like rito needs to get their shit together...","replies":[]}]}
