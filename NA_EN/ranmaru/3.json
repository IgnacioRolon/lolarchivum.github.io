When a champion has the tools to easily engage their targets, they should compensate for this by giving their opponents more time and opportunities to outplay them from combat range. Instead, not only has this not been implemented in these champions' designs, but their current level of damage gets bursty far too easily. As such, it doesn't at all feel like mobile champions pay any sort of cost for their increased target access. As you mentioned, mobile champions should be more opportunistic, as they can engage at any time, and should have a genuine reason not to just go ham every time. As it stands, however, most mobile champions can not only engage at will, but can frequently outduel anyone else as well from any amount of health, which has contributed to a meta in which most mobile champions just make a beeline for their target and stat-check them to death.\n\nOn top of that, immobile champions have typically been balanced relative to mobile champions by just having bigger numbers, rather than access to some unique mechanics others can't have. Unstoppability, for example, is a mechanic I think deserves to be seen much more often on juggernauts, yet so far the champions who most frequently have it are divers, usually on their dash ults. This too makes balance more difficult, because no amount of raw damage or durability can compensate for being hard-countered by the sheer amount of CC and kiting in the game right now. We need to get to a place where there is a clear tradeoff for features like mobility, range, CC, high damage, and so on, and where there is a visible difference between champions who either have or lack those effects, one where a champion can be lacking in several of these strengths and still have unique advantages that make them worth picking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2018-06-17T19:16:25.397+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":3,"body":"Evelynn together with shaco?
