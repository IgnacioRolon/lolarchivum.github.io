You get trolls and feeders, you don't always meet them but they are common. Common enough to ruin your climb. Sure someone like you can climb out of it, but someone like us who can't carry 4 people loses and stays behind but really if we have a team with the same skill level as us and someone that actually plays properly then I'm sure most of the people can climb out of sliver. League is based on team work, not individual skill. Even if you are the best in the world and your team is just doing random stuff and raging. It's not gonna help, the enemy team would much more advantage, and that is not fair. These type of stuff only happens in lower elo, because no cares about low elo. Filled with feeders and trolls, which holds everyone behind.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-29T03:47:17.900+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being stuck anywhere with an 80% winrate is impossible, and rigging matchmaking is also a logical impossibility.\n\nNot to mention riot would gain absolutely nothing via rigging matchmaking.\n\nAccept you are bad and have a 50% winrate, maybe even try tracking every game instead of making it up.","replies":[{"poster":"SkinArea","date":"2018-09-26T21:51:54.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Logical impossibility? Do you know what programming is? Do you know what it's capable of? Saying something like that I very much doubt you have any fucking clue what Riot could do with their team. Rigging matchmaking is VERY EASY for a team of skilled programmers, which Riot has access to by the way.\n\nRiot would gain nothing? How about proving their bullshit statistics? Ever think of that buddy? Toxic players lose more games? That's funny because Reginald, Hashinshin, The Rain Man and multiple other high tier players were TOXIC AS FUCK and they WON MORE GAMES. I find it funny how after they released those stats that it became pretty much the truth, don't you? It would be very easy for Riot to not only rig matchmaking but rig in-game stats to give the \"winning team\" more damage. Your attack damage says its 150? Nah, it's actually 80 which is why you don't do any damage and you're getting shit on by the Lucian who's 2 levels behind with 3k less gold because he's on the \"winning team\".\n\nI'm not saying that any of this is what's actually going on, but you're basically talking out of your ass with that \"logical impossibility\" horse shit. Remember, most Master and Challenger players are friends with Riot employee's and Riot only does soft resets so it's very easy for them to keep their ELO with a 49-51% win rate. Also, if Riot was rigging matchmaking it would be very easy for a Challenger player to call up one of the Employee's on this list and drop the name of the account he's going to be using / boosting to put himself on the \"winning team\" so they can say \"See, look, he made it back to Challenger on a smurf so it's totally possible for ANYONE to do it if they're 'good enough'\".\n \nUse your brain bro. Riot makes money on this shit and they will do anything to make that cash, they don't give a fuck about the small players. When Tencent bought the company it was pretty much over.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-09-27T04:48:31.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i do.

Not sure how you came across the idea of people not being able to do such thing. You would know this is rather possible if you actually worked with data structures etc. I mean, take the simple fact that they give 5lp when you win, but you lose 35lp for a loss... So care to explain how it's mathematically not possible to rigg stuff like this? I mean, it's also a pretty rigged thing to say '33% more games are won when you are positive', when we all know that the winning side IS positive 9/10 times, while the losing side is tilting 9/10 times, let alone in this game.\n Their measurement on this statistic is rigged to the bone buddy. Not sure why you are even bothering to defend such thing. \n\n> Most toxic players tilt, and lose as a result. That is not even disputable.\n\nWhere are your facts exactly? Many have actually won and not because 'they are good'. \n\n> Yes, i do. I am a developer with quite a lot of experience working with statistics and data structures.\n\nyou would also know then that casinos their stuff is set to be RIGGED. So there IS a possibility to make stuff rigged, unless you are working with statistics which are full of crap and data structures that suck and have no logical reasoning behind them. \n\nYou look rather like a person that has done a couple of tutorials on youtube. Next time give us some facts, because I am interested in why you think a game cannot make a win/lose system rigged, unless I am misunderstanding you?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-14T00:21:29.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One team wins, one team loses.
