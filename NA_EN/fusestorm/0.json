I was wondering if I did something wrong in the game, maybe I glitched it somehow. I know this discussion was up long ago but I just want to hear something that I could do to fix this 'missing RP'. Do you guys have any idea?","replies":[{"poster":"FuseStorm","date":"2016-04-10T21:17:03.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reminder.

If that's the case, new players no longer receive 400 RP for reaching Summoner Level 3, but instead receive the New Player Chest for reaching Summoner Level 5. More context about this change can be found in Riot Socrates' post here:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZGErnvY4-hextech-crafting-new-player-chests-to-replace-400-rp","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-04-07T18:39:36.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't use the blue essence in that chest to perm the garen and ashe shards. You can instead get Garen for free from following Riot on Twitter, the essence is better saved for a shard for a more expensive champion, and the shards are better used for champion rerolls.","replies":[]}]}]}
