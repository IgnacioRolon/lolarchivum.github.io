Anyway, I logged on yesterday, then got kicked off when someone logged in.  Thankfully, they hadn't changed my email, so I just went and updated my password.  It turns out they played a lot of ranked games, and I was hoping I could get it all reversed.  Also they bought skins, but I put in a ticket for that.  Sorry, I couldn't find a subject at the ticket center that pertained to this issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have a lead on who done did it, thanks to two testimonies from his alleged friends whom he had added to my list (before he added me to try and get me to not report him), though I'm not sure I should post it here publicly.  Also they could be trollin', ya never know.  But could you compare IP addresses between usage on my account while it was hacked and the alleged perpetrator's main account?  Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T20:14:57.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was definitely a good move not to post their info here publicly. We can continue to work with you on this when a specialist is assigned to your ticket, since we'll be dealing with some rather sensitive information.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
