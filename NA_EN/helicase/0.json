It generally lasts about a second or two, but as we all know, that can mean the difference between life or death in League of Legends. The worst is when it's during a teamfight as you can well imagine.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's specifically because someone dies, but it seems to be triggered by some sort of global event happening, i.e. someone dying, a turret going down, a dragon dying, etc.\r\n\r\nI've ruled out latency issues because again this only happens SPECIFICALLY when something happens during the game and not just at random times. Also, when it does happen, I am still able to move my mouse around my frozen screen for the brief period that the game is lagged out.\r\n\r\nI also don't believe it's my rig, as it's built to handle much more intensive games. I'll post specs just for kicks.\r\n\r\nI've also tried the repair function or whatever and also completely uninstalled, ran CCleaner, and reinstalled to no avail.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWindows 10 64-bit\r\nIntel i5-4690K @ 3.50 GHz\r\n16 GB Ram\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 970","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T16:10:42.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your game is experiencing stutters or delays in displaying game assets.
