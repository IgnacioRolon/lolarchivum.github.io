I can understand him wielding his shield in his left hand if he was a defensive fighter but since Pantheon is known as one of the most aggressive early game champions that are able to snowball the game, I think it makes good sense for him to hold his weapon in his dominant hand. And besides, by holding a shield in your left hand, you expose another vital organ, the liver.
