I got a 14 day ban that I consider unjustified by riot (They claimed I was intentionally feeding) I went round and round with their staff until they basically shut down my support tickets on the matter. Since then I have played normally to win but after months I am still honor zero. I figured oh well they probably locked me until honor resets and I was fine with that. Now though I&#039;m finding that honor for 0 and 1 is NOT going to reset. So what am I supposed to do? I find it very frustrating that you can&#039;t see &quot;honor&quot; gain or progress making it hard to tell anything. I also don&#039;t play with friends typically mostly solo so I don&#039;t get easy honor from them. Would a dev or mod care to enlighten me on my status and what needs to improve?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-12-18T19:12:34.339+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I got a 14 day ban that I consider unjustified by riot (They claimed I was intentionally feeding)\n\nYou said you were going to feed, you fed, you kept saying it was the fault of Ryze that made you feed.

Has the honor insignia on your profile unlocked yet?  When you initial receive a penalty, it places a lock over the insignia and you are ineligible to earn honor.  That lock stays in place for a while after your punishment is over.  If the lock is gone, then you are in the process of earning honor again.  It's a slow process in the beginning.  \n\nYou will actually gain more honor from non-friends than you will from friends, and if everyone on your team honors someone in the match, you will get a little bit of extra honor in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Depths","date":"2017-12-17T21:32:38.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It unlocked several months ago in September.","replies":[]}]}]}
