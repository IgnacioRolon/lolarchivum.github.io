My friend and I picked for each other so I would not be countered, he picked Darius for me and I picked Nautilus for him. I only have a Darius skin and he only has a Nautilus skin. After we switched and the game started both our skins loaded as base even though we both have our skins selected.\n\nKind of sad when you paid money for a skin and it forces base on you...\n\nAnyways just wanted to add the flipside to the bug that's not as great as using skins you don't have in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimspeake","date":"2016-01-18T07:58:22.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a glitch if u trade u get there selected skin","replies":[]}]}
