Please Riot, Leaver Buster is unfair for those who have connection issues and should be replaced entirely. I have to wait 20 minutes to test if my game works correctly and if it doesn't i have to be punished again and maybe even wait twice as much for something i have no control over. I'm not a person who dc's on purpose, i rarely dc at all unless its because of connection, this all started during this patch and its very annoying to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T22:28:21.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intention, a disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a key reason why disconnections are all treated equally and why penalties cannot be modified for any reason.\n\nI strongly recommend trying a factory reset of your router if it's causing these issues, or try a different router entirely. Let me know if you need assistance in further troubleshooting the cause of your disconnections.","replies":[{"poster":"Light Sovereign","date":"2016-10-13T01:19:03.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it was a Bot game thought, and even if it was Pvp, they would have just used /remake which i find a problem when someone tries to reconnect but remakes ends the game before they can join again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T21:15:04.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of game type, it doesn't change the impact that it has on the other players in the match.\n\nI recommend looking into the issues with your router either with the steps I've provided or by reaching out to your ISP.
