It just randomly happens and it has made me lose so much lp and a lot of games, I then decided to finally uninstall League of Legends buy clicking, Control panel --> Remove program --> League of legends ---> Uninstall. However, the league of legends icon was still on my screen.\r\n\r\nAfter a while it uninstalled, I went to this website to reinstall it https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload.\r\n\r\nThe old client was appearing when i downloaded it, so I cancelled the download. Then I try to download the game again and managed to double click the old looking icon, but it simply won't open.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, I need help on how to remove every single file of league and start a FRESH new reinstall or any way that is possible.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-03T16:16:15.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like not everything is clearing up with the uninstall, but no worries!

You go to add and remove programs, and uninstall league. Then you find the folder the game was at and delete that too. Restart your PC, redownload the game, and LET IT DOWNLOAD WHEN YOU OPEN THE PATCHER, LOL DOWNLOADS A 16GB FILE AFTER UPDATING THE OLD CLIENT (1.2GB)","replies":[]}]}
