Every time I play league, my game suddenly freezes allowing me to do nothing, I can't even open task manager. \n\nAfter this, I reboot my computer (thank god SSD). Then I usually get a DirectX error after trying to reconnect. Then I just close it and Reconnect again.\n\n\nAfter all this, it works for the rest of the game. But it is like this everytime... I'm running league on a computer with gtx1060 and I5 4690k processor so my performance is fine. Please, can anyone help me, my friends don't even want to play ranked with me anymore because of this. :( \n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-05T18:16:20.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No peepees in boards!  You've been a real trooper if you've been dealing with this for so long, and glad you came by for an assist.  The freezing thing could be happening for a few reasons, and the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is a huge culprit if you're on Windows 10.  Make sure to disable that, as it's auto-enabled after updates and the cause of freezing issues for many players.\n\nIs the DirectX issue a recent error?  There's been an issue for players with custom resolutions causing this as soon as the match starts.  The following steps should help with that:\n\n> **For PC players**:  This may come up as a DirectX error\n> \n> Delete your **Config folder**.  This  is typically found at C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n> \n>As a heads up this will reset your resolution, settings, and keybindings to default.\n> \n\nLet me know if these steps help, but make sure to do it in a custom game so you don't get any leaves or penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadlySnowball","date":"2017-05-05T18:19:37.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try disabling the xbox game bar first, thanks for the fast response.
