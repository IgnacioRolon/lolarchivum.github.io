I feel like aside from nid, eve, sej  and nunu next?  there isnt alot to choose from are there any plans on doing a different buff? I think buffing the ap rfom 60-65 could be really good. Might not look like alot but its something.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-01-14T00:33:44.411+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, we're considering a different approach. Looking for one that helps out struggling Runic Echoes users more than it does AP champs who already do well in the jungle. One option we're considering is amount of mana restored as a result, given the strong performers generally aren't very mana limited already.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-01-15T03:15:40.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't the problem with AP junglers is the fact that they are limited by not being able to auto as well as normal junglers and can't survive mobs like tanks can?  It seems like buffing a finished item would happen too late to help them out much.  If anything I would think the problem lies in {{item:1039}} not being good enough to help AP champs on their first clear combined with the fact that {{item:1041}} doesn't work with their main damage plus they can't go precision for the AS buff that would help them out.\n\nTheoretically, something like a minilich bane or mini-nashors would work well on them since they need to auto and those effects would help out their weakness, or perhaps an effect which lets their spells do 35% more damage to jungle creeps.  Still, even those things come too late.  I also wouldn't want the mini-lichbane because Ezreal will somehow bleep it up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D2Vincent","date":"2018-01-15T23:46:26.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may put my 2 cents in here\n\nAs someone who likes to play JG Karthus, I feel like one of the reasons I almost never upgrade to Runic Echoes is because of the fact that it's just not as useful to me as say, just upgrading to Blue Smite (sometimes not even do that) and then work on either Tear or Haunting Guise. \n\nPerhaps the problem is the fact that Runic Echoes itself is just a slightly watered down version of {{item:3285}}, an Item that is popular on Burst Champs, but not so much on DPS champs, which correlates to the fact that Junglers who use Runic best are champs like Elise, Nidalee, and other AP Burst champs/assassins. \n\nMaybe the solution lies in making a new JG Enchant? Something that is a good fit for DPS Mages but not as much for Burst? (and something Ezreal can't break preferably lol) I'd consider either putting in Guise (because it's literally only ever used for 1 item), or Catalyst (because a JG Catalyst item would be cool)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2018-01-15T21:06:32.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think it might not be the items rather the lack of mobility/ spells for damage is the issue.  It seem more like their Kits are to par.\n\nThe amount of CC mobility and damage is why they aren't good imo.  Adding more damage isn't the problem.  (sure everything have assassin damage but this is a whole other issue)\n\nLook at the kits of the good junglers what do they all have in common.  Look at the AA and animation what do they all have in common.\n\nAs a fiddle man Damage isn't his issue. (besides it only coming from one spell if nothing is close to bounce off of.  Everything is in favor of AD for the jungle.
