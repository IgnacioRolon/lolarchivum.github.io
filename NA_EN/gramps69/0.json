Hell, at one point I could name every source of true damage on one hand (Vayne, Darius, Irelia, Ignite), now any champ can get it through keystones or the new IE that&#039;s coming out.  \r\n\r\nCall me crazy, but damage that is only negated by stacking health (which most melee auto-attackers can easily counter with Bloodrazor or Bork) sounds like a great way to push us back to the League of Warmogs era, right after the League of Cleavers when that item was first released.  Just my two cents, hoping a red can hop on to provide some clarity to these changes and how true damage will be regulated/why introducing a means to true damage to all champs was a direction they wanted to go.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-02T20:16:28.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"New IE says hi.\n\nInstead of fixing armor scaling, riot seems to be making everything do true damage. Giving stuff apen instead would make more sense..","replies":[{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2018-05-02T23:11:49.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't disagree with that.  If the plan is to give all champs significantly increased health/level then fine, but just introducing that after conqueror just came out seems downright bad for game health, even though I'm glad IE is being reworked, I'd settle for just giving it more damage and doubling the crit chance","replies":[]}]}]}
