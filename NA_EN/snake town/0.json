Bard was pretty good on release as far as supporting goes, offering mobility and bonus XP to his ADC. New champs are called broken because the general community does not take much effort to learning the champions abilities or interactions. In the off chance that there is a game breaking bug the champ is usually disabled.\n\nBottom line is, if anyone gets wrecked by a new champion, it has more to do with lack of knowledge than numbers. Personally tired of people complaining that a new champion is OP. Community cries to Riot, they release nerfs, and the champion's original identity becomes murky, as seen with Aatrox, Rek'Sai, Azir, Gnar, Yasuo, and soon to be added Ekko. Which is the true tragedy.","replies":[{"poster":"ZileanUltJesusOP","date":"2015-06-18T20:42:32.578+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol are you serious? ekko was compeltely broken on release and riot knew it. Im sorry but if you can instantly gap close to an adc and kil lthem instantly you are an assassin. I have seen ekkos kill an adc with just their q e and passive like it was nothing. Secondly, bard was absolute trash tier on release and still is pretty bad. Why would i play him when i can just play soraka or sona who do his job 10 times better than he does. Had they had a patch of testing to the general public, maybe these things could of been avoided. Before you say ekko cant 100-0 an adc ill try and find the reddit post where they compared ekkos level 11 burst with every other mage in the game and he was 3rd behind malzahar and veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"Keon Kamori","date":"2015-06-19T00:05:36.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Never said he couldn't burst other champions. I said he couldn't assassinate them. Assassinations in league have three parts. The pick, the kill, and the escape. If anyone lets an enemy champ, Ekko or anyone else, kill them in under three seconds and they aren't horribly behind, they need to learn how to ward and where to position themselves.\n\nI find it simply hilarious whenever someone says a champ who is rendered useless by CC as weak as a snare is broken. Ekko wasn't broken, the champions who counter him enough to shut him down were forgotten.\n{{champion:143}} Zone potential, Snares, ranged poke,\n{{champion:127}} Zone, Gap Close, Ranged poke, Snare, Point and click ult stun.\n{{champion:45}} Walking Tactical Nuke.\n\nEkko is a melee champ with high mana costs and a low mana pool. Arguing that his is broken based on the amount of burst he has isn't a good case. Especially when the skill floor to pull of his combos successfully, securing the kill, getting out alive, returning  applying pressure to his or other lanes, is so high.\n\nI guess actually understanding his kit makes it difficult for me to see him as broken. A bit strong in the current meta yes, but still has a ton of counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"TheUntitledKing","date":"2015-06-19T05:38:20.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:90}}  Oh my Mr. Ekko, it seems you want to engage in close-quarters combat with me.

Also for the record zyra does not counter him. Maybe pre 6 because her poke is annoying but not after that. Also an good ekko can dodge veigars ult with his ult and he will never be able to land his stun as ekkos blink goes through it and its on a much lower cooldown and veigar has 0 escapes. Lissandra i could see but simply listing someones counters doesnt make them weak lol thats like saying zed is weak because lissandra and kayle counter him.

At least way more than 1 sec. The real damage of that q is its 0.6 AP scaling on the return. His passive also does a lot of damage too, but how is one supposed to stack 3 stacks in an assassin fitting time?\n\nYou can either stack double q, and e, but that takes a long time because the q return takes too long, the e has a dash before hand before casting the blink. Takes too long for an assassin.\n\nOr you could autoattack twice, and then q, but how long is that going to take when attack speed isn't good on ekko?\n\nOr you could input your w, which takes a whoppin 3 seconds to actually go in, and by the time, the entire team probably avoided the w, and that takes too long to.\n\nOr you could cast your ult somehow into the enemy team and do tons of damage, but then you've lost your escape, and the ult's indicator is right there.\n\nHe fits his champion select quote perfectly, its not how much time you have, its how you use it. Ekko lacks the ability to do damage in a short amount of time, and therefore doesnt care how long it takes him to get a target. What he really cares though is how he uses the utility from his kit to kill priority target.\n\nEkko does a lot of damage for an assassin, but he lacks the speed to do all the damage at once. He is a pure utility assassin, using his utility to do damage, unlike other assassins who rely on burst damage. As long as one constantly moves around when ekko is near, Ekko has pretty much no match against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Keon Kamori","date":"2015-06-19T23:07:21.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I applaud you. +1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keon Kamori","date":"2015-06-19T16:17:58.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't feel like extending this argument any further.

You are saying \"learn to play against the champ and you wont have problems\" that can be applied to literally any champion, doesn't mean its viable. Zed in my opinion is the best all around mid laner in the game. Idc what you do there is no shutting down a good zed. Watch high elo games, zed is too good at everything, he will always be relavent in the game. Ekko si near the same, his kit allows him to always do a lot of damage and be relatively safe, with two great aoe team fight abilites that stun and heal him with a nuke. Ive played as ekko plenty of times and if you go look at my profile you will see i stomped with him in all but 1 game. My first game ever with him in ranked i got 22 kills, and funny thing is i was against veigar. Couldnt hit me with his stun ever because i would just e directly to him, so he would have to kill me with just q and e through my 300 shield at level 6 while hes stunned for over 2 seconds. Just can't do it. Also ekko is one of the best roamers in the game, if you counter him he will just roam and shit on other lanes or your jungler. There is a reason he has been out for only 2 weeks and his win rate went from 43 percent to 50. which is the 4th highest in league history behind Diana, Xin, and Rek'sai for WP increase afte rtwo weeks according to champion.gg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-06-19T00:19:21.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dont forget Ahri.

All about knowing your range to you hit him with it at the apex of the orb throw,dealing both damages right away.
