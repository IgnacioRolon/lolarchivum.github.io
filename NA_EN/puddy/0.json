Main thing we wanted to avoid was builds that went Trinity into straight tank stats. The champion update team did spend a lot of time discussing what the costs and benefits of TF as a dominant, feasible and suboptimal choice were though.

I think people are vastly overestimating the usefulness of a bruiser build. I've found much more success with the AD-stacking build (akin to Riven) with the only item that gives \"defensive\" stats being Black Cleaver.\n\nI just plain do not like Trinity Force on Fiora IMO and I agree that it is not mandatory at all on her. It is an overused item on bruisers and stacking AD and CDR allows Fiora to hit hard against tanks, no matter what they build. Nothing is more satisfying than able to duel and defeat a tank who has 3000 and 300+ armor in the same amount of time as you would kill a squishy carry when you have 400-500 AD thanks to her true damage passive.\n\nIf you were to make changes to Fiora after this patch, I would totally agree with encouraging the full AD build over the copycat bruiser build. I like seeing things like Ravenous Hydra, Bloodthirster, and even Essence Reaver on her. I like boot choices like Boots of Swiftness and Boots of Lucidity over Ninja Tabi or Mercs. I like that no matter who her opponent is, she is able to duel them, provided she has skill and precision.\n\nA bruiser build is reserved for champions like Garen or Darius who withstand the brunt of long fights.

Since her rework i played her 22 times, won 18 of those and hit mastery level 5. In at least half of those games people were complaining about how OP she is, and freaked out when i told them of the plans of buffing her.\nI honestly don't think she really needs those buffs, she's just really really difficult to do well with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ilt","date":"2015-08-16T13:26:33.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she IS strong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Broken Wings","date":"2015-08-16T09:16:33.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1439589555/Fiora1.jpg\n\nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1439589557/Fiora2.jpg\n\nComplete freeelo at the moment, he picked fiora up just after the hotfix and simply 1 v 5s everygame in master and he didnt even learn her properly.\nRiot overbuffed her .","replies":[{"poster":"EvanGRogers","date":"2015-08-16T13:26:20.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr Broken Wings,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L4cQxnz3,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-08-16T09:16:33.632+0000)\n>\n> http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1439589555/Fiora1.jpg\n> \n> http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1439589557/Fiora2.jpg\n> \n> Complete freeelo at the moment, he picked fiora up just after the hotfix and simply 1 v 5s everygame in master and he didnt even learn her properly.\n> Riot overbuffed her .\n\nCouldn't help but notice that you cut out the 3 losses to make her look OP.

I find it depends a bit on matchups too much how I do; I won against a Renekton, but got utterly destroyed by Mordekaiser. Usually when I play her I attract a lot of flame for playing a champion that was recently reworked with a low winrate, so I'd like to shut them up a bit more by playing her \"properly\". I don't think I fail to grasp the fundamentals, but could you share some hints on particular tricks (I'd understand if you'd rather keep the best to yourself!) or itemisation hints?

The one thing I find lacking in the rework is that, as someone who uses her mostly in the jungle, that her passive does not work on large & epic monsters, thus taking the sustain away from her early clears.\n\nEdit: I was watching Hai's stream last night, and he said almost the same thing, that Fiora has the makings of a good jungler if her passive worked on the camps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterSomething","date":"2015-08-15T19:33:52.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really LOVE this new Fiora, fun as hell to play.\nRegarding build, I usually start with Rushing Hydra, then building right into Trinity Force.\nAfter wards, depending on what the situation calls for, Frozen Mallet (For a little tankiness and chasing potential), Spirit Visage (the MR is great and the heal buff is really nice), and Boots of Swiftness (More mobility)!
