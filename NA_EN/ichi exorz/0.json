Sorry about the confusion friends. :( \n\nWe'll be releasing in Europe in the next few weeks. Anyone who has the app in Europe may have downloaded the apk from a 3rd party site (which is risky - could be packaged with viruses, keyloggers, etc.). I will ping on this topic as soon as we have our official app store/play store releases with the link to download.
