Now, your first thought is that it's a driver or video card issue, but it's not. Everything is up-to-date and only happens when I use the new client. Old client works perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you use the old client?\" Well duh, it's being retired. How can I fix this? Mind you all is up-to-date.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-22T03:42:17.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm you're right to think that this might be caused by some kind of driver issue, so that's a little strange that updating those didn't seem to help at all. I definitely don't want to send you here or there in hopes that something would fix that, so let's go ahead and get you in touch with our tech guys through a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
