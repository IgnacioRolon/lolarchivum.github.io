You get banned simply by automated reporting, I had chat bans in the past, and now no longer curse or use any bad language in chats and don't even talk that much.\n\nSo my game earlier today, I was support, and ADC trolled pretty hard, he died 2x while still having heal and flash up in early lane, then let me die without using heal as support at around lvl 4.  So i decided he was terrible and I am not going to lane with him anymore, and went to roam the map. then the jungler starts saying &quot;I am going to ban you if you don&#039;t goto lane&quot; and the mid laner started telling me to go back bot too &quot;or he will report me.&quot;\n\nANyways, I didn&#039;t go back bot, roamed and got some assists top, we end up losing the game, everyone did absolutely terrible in stats, I had one of the least horrible stats at least.  Game was over in about 25 minutes .... and sure enough, I get the chat ban the next game after my team ganged up on me and &quot;report support&quot; for giving up on bot lane.  So, I looked over my chat logs, and there isn&#039;t anything offensive at all, I learned from the past about that, nasically the chat logs is just saying that Vayne didn&#039;t use heal, died many times and got me killed without using heal, so I won&#039;t go back bot and am roaming to help other lanes instead.  Yet, this team ganged up on me, and reported me because they were mad they were terrible and scapegoated me that I left bot lane and roamed.  Now I lost all my honor ranking points.\n\n\nSo, anyways, I wanted to say thank you Riot, I was about to buy some Riot points for my holiday personal shop, and you made that decision pretty clear that I should spend the money elsewhere.  Thank you!\n\nYour automated penalty system is absolutely horrible.\n\nEDIT: The system is very bad, because I am not idea WHY I am chat restricted.  All it says is \"negative behavior\" and lists some chat logs which is just argument (no personal attacks or racial slur or homophobic or cussing ever).  I got \"reported\" because my team scapegoated me on this game for losing.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2018-01-05T02:22:48.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance of seeing the logs?\n\nCopy/pasting them here would allow us to help identify what triggered the chat restrictions and prevent further punishments on the account.\n\nHere is how the system escalates for future reference:\nhttps://tkwa.re/leaguereporttiers\nFrom Karunamon's post here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5nLVRHWG-a-quick-visual-guide-to-the-reporting-system\n\nNote that once the 14-day ban stage is reached, any further punishment will result in a permaban (even if that log itself is not perma-worthy)","replies":[{"poster":"Squarepusher","date":"2018-01-05T02:35:29.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LostFr0st,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BB7jlibF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-05T02:22:48.384+0000)\n>\n> Any chance of seeing the logs?\n> \n> Copy/pasting them here would allow us to help identify what triggered the chat restrictions and prevent further punishments on the account.\n> \n> Here is how the system escalates for future reference:\n> https://tkwa.re/leaguereporttiers\n> From Karunamon&#x27;s post here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5nLVRHWG-a-quick-visual-guide-to-the-reporting-system\n> \n> Note that once the 14-day ban stage is reached, any further punishment will result in a permaban (even if that log itself is not perma-worthy)\n\nI will not post the logs, because I know how this forum works, literally anything you post everyone says \"wow you deserved it,\" and there is no context to what I was replying to or how the other people were threatening \"to report and ban me if I didn't goto lane.\"    Basically these people were ganging up on me, saying I lost the game for them in the beginning, all reported me, and I really doubt an actual person review it.\n\nI never threaten, curse or make any racial or homophobic slurs ever.  This was just an argument with the team on why I am moving lanes and it became several lines of chat, so its \"toxic behavior\"\n\nIf a person did review it, they probably were like \"wall of text\" I'm not reading this or somehow that is a justification for banning me.  I'm trying to search for a definition of Riot's chat rules, all I see is \"persistent negative behavior\" which is so vague, basically they make it as vague as possible so no one can question their automated banning system.\n\nAll my honor is gone now, I was at lvl 3.\n\nAlso they pulled some game from several days ago, where I was ADC, and the support was autofilled but he claimed to be \"high ranked smurf\".  So, anyways this support claims he is some high rank smurf, so picks veigar support, and is farming CS right in front of me.  I am telling him to not CS many times, and he just says \"I am veigar, I need stacks for my passive gain\" and later said \"I am smurf, you are noob farm is wasted on you\"\n\nSo, somehow they pulled up this chat log with me telling him not to CS as a reason also lol.

The quote above (emphasis mine) shows you admitting to attempting to repeatedly boss your team around. You don't own the CS - nobody owns any CS/farm in League, and you have no right to tell someone to stop, especially repeatedly. You can ask nicely (\"hey, can u pls not hit farm i am behind\") but if you're bossing someone around repeatedly that's punishable.\n\nYou also do not dispute the other two reasons I gave - arguing and being combative/rude towards others.

I thought I learned my lesson already from a few years ago, and don't cuss or threaten or do racial/homophobic insults at all.\n\nThe purposely make the rules as vague as possible, (just something like, don't be negative or toxic), which essentially is subjective and means your team can scapegoat you and gang up and report you.\n\nRiot makes the system like this, quite simply because it is expensive to actually have real moderation and people to review replays to give real punishment.   So they automated a system poorly with no human interaction, so I can't actually find out what was wrong with my chat log.  Yes, I get it, employees are expensive, however its sacrificing game experience.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-01-05T03:21:53.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rules are actually pretty darn clear.
