It really helped because then for a thread about balance a designer would come on and go 'This is a great idea, shame I don't work for the balance team' or on an design thread member of the balance team would post and go 'This is a great idea, shame I don't work for the design team' so it at least gave us the impression that Riot were engaging with their community in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\nNow, however, there are no such titles. So when someone posts a thread and says 'Hey guys I have this really cool super mega idea you should implement' and Riot MountMctwattyBollocks posts saying 'Yeah great idea!' I have no clue if this person is going to actually do something because it's relevant to his team, or whether he's just posting as Joe Bloggs.\r\n\r\nCan you change it back please to give me the perception that you are actually doing something.\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-10-28T17:04:35.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mouse over their name; the same title from the old forums is there.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-29T23:47:18.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Mouse over their name; the same title from the old forums is there.\n\nYup!

Every single thread that was created that held any importance was on GD before.  Hundreds and hundreds of threads everyday posted on one forum.  How could that be even close to being any easier than the way the current boards are setup where you can go to \"Gameplay and Balance\" to find out the new FotM champs that everyone thinks are OP.  Or go to \"Announcements\" to see the major announcements that Riot makes.  Or go to \"Esports\" to find out the latest that everyone is talking about in that category.
