Heck, I&#039;ve even done this before. A jungler decides to focus down your lane and whenever it seems like your getting a little bit of an edge RKO OUTTA NOWHERE, or in the words of the mighty jingles, surprise buttsex happens. And yes, even I have been guilty of thinking why isn&#039;t the jungler doing anything about this. But after thinking things through I realized riot gave us an ingenious tool to prevent this. Its called a ward. \n\nIf you are just relying on your Jungler to supply vision think about this, including a vision ward and two blue wards a jungler can only have about 6 wards on the field at a time if he bothers buying a sightstone. And, your jungler won&#039;t want to waste time searching a jungle looking for that one dude who is tormenting your lane. However if you put wards down you can tell whether he is ganking or not, and it&#039;ll make searching for that jungler a lot easier for your jungler. Even if your jungler decides, no, I&#039;m not going to attempt to kill that fed Udyr, Warwick, Yi, Nocturne, Jax, etc, you at least have an idea of where he is on the map. \n\nSo, instead of complaining to the jungler about not stopping a dude from camping your lane, be proactive and try to spot the jungler before he ganks, by using wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Mäster Yí","date":"2016-04-19T15:43:11.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Inb4 the thread is downvoted to elo hell by the bronze players saying it's the junglers fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultimate Deadpoo","date":"2016-04-19T15:50:09.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GooberDanger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0RsiQjgj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-19T15:43:11.435+0000)\n>\n> Inb4 the thread is downvoted to elo hell by the bronze players saying it&#x27;s the junglers fault.\n\nI wonder how long until the rangers come and saying it is all the junglers fault.

I'd say try to play near your turrets buy the turrets are pretty much useless now a days. Riot please buff turrets.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-04-19T16:25:30.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Along the same vein, I get really annoyed when people rage at the jungler for not following up on ganks, there are other ways to react to enemy junglers ganking then just immediately making a beeline for that lane.\n\nCase in point\n\nHad a game yesterday where I played as Fiddlestick and other team had a Shaco, Shaco kept trying to gank repeatedly whereas I was still hard farming for six. \nMy team raged pretty hard at me for not following up...well if you check for that game in my match history, you'll notice Shaco was level 14 with I think 12k gold and I was level 18 with 18k gold. Point being, I crushed him in every facet of the game except early game pressure. \n\nPretty much everytime I saw him appear in lane, I went into his jungle to take all his camps, he literally got next to no jungle camps for the majority of the game. \n\nCounterjungling is just as powerful as counterganking, A full side of the jungle clear (which is rare albeit) gives about 300 gold which is the same as a kill. Even if the blue/red isn't there, that's still 200 gold you're denying to their jungler, and if they don't get the kill in the gank, then well that's just setting them back even harder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squidsmastah","date":"2016-04-19T16:11:05.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media2.giphy.com/media/6Ppn6rE37j248/200.gif","replies":[]}]}
