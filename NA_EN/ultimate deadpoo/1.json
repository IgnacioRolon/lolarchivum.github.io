You were toxic, harassed people in chat and ruined what should of been a fun game of league or maybe even their promos.

Better even, the enemy team trolled me as well. I have the chat log, and it's ridiculous.\n\nIt was an auto-chat ban. I went on to continue playing with a person in that game who reported me, because I wasn't being toxic and he was down to play a few.\n\nSometimes, the auto-punish is messed up. People should feel free to dispute their punishment somewhere, and this is the best place to do so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SleepySlayer","date":"2016-11-04T09:48:28.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll scream my head off if i feel i've been cheated by Riot, which is what im doing now on all fronts. Riot is a company that can't admit when its wrong and wont go back on decisions EVER, and thats a horrible business practice. Players are leaving in droves over how they treat their community and how the ban people/punish them. Their Reform card/suspension system is completely flawed and does nothing to actually improve the player its been issued to. Riots a company that only cares about money and squeezing as much as they can out of the addicted people that play. Ban an account because a rule is too vague or the reform card doesnt state what you can do to improve your experience? well thats you're fault and now you're banned, but they'll help you set up a new account for you to spend money on. Pro players and Streamers get an entirely different set of rules to follow and they get unbanned because they make Riot money, but the average player like you or me? Screwed. And im going to keep screaming about it until they change their ways.","replies":[]}]}
