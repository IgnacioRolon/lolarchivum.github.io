Some is the problem of players (no credit for making good plays) while others are definitely more of a gameplay issue (itemization, lack of XP).  I thought it would be beneficial for the support mains to unite and start a discussion of why they like playing support, problems they see with the role and possible solutions.  Maybe, if we give enough quality feedback it could catalyze a mini support update.  Hopefully we can get some red posts to let us know if Riot has any plans or directions for support changes.\r\n\r\nMains:\r\nMostly tanky supports - {{champion:201}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:223}} \r\nI also play {{champion:117}} for fun and am saving up for {{champion:432}} after spamming him on free week.\r\n\r\nWhy I Like Support:\r\n- Don&#039;t have to worry about CS \r\n- I feel that my role is thinking more about overall lane strategy and control as well as focusing on big picture strategy (especially when I play with friends).\r\n- Warding (can&#039;t trust non-supports)\r\n- I like CC and getting picks\r\n- I pretty much love every support ultimate and they can be impactful\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- I feel like {{item:2049}}  is totally outshined by the yellow trinket.

I play a lot of hard engage and disengage champions (Thresh, Alistar, Braum, and the occasional Bard) and I like picking my fights carefully and really controlling the battlefield, whether it's preemptively warding up an area of the jg you want to have a team fight in soon or rotating to other lanes and secure their leads. A good support should feel like the army general overseeing the rest of his or her platoon.\n\nLeveling\nI do undeniably have issues with this meta however. When 16 minutes into the game I'm 2 levels behind the rest of my team regardless of my personal performance, and thus substantially weaker than say their midlander who was 0-3 by 13 minutes. There's a problem.\n\nItemization\nAlthough the sightstone changes were meant to be an improvement on the item, they were undeniably a flop, it's just really not ever worth it to take it over FOtM or FQC. I am a big supporter of the proposed changes to sightstone allowing them to regenerate. The trinket changes were a step in the right direction, however there are still issues like why is it that come late game I have to choose between going to full build like the rest of my team or flat out not buying my last item to keep a spot for a pink ward in my inventory. If there was a pink ward trinket or something this would be great or maybe if you could make an out of inventory holding similar to potions where you had an extra slot just for them.

At Dia 5, I've had supports that randomly \"afk\" at our 1st tier turret during laning phase for  some random reason and this has costed us lane pressure sometimes when we had the advantage or if we were even, this gives the enemy a lead because as the marksman,  I have give up cs because the enemy bot notices this and will zone me.  One person told me they did this because they were watching another lane which confused me.\n     Aside from that, there are multiple occasions where my support expends mana/spell cooldowns when its unnecessary to do so (ex: healing me when i'm 80% hp and have lifesteal). \n      A 3rd common issue I see is sometimes, supports roam too much or don't roam at all when they should.  There are optimal times to roam (ex: when ur adc is  recalled/enemy support is roaming/you know ur adc can handle 1v2). If you roam too much, not only are you vulnerable to a big level deficit but you are sacrificing  lane pressure at bot lane to help another lane. If you do not gain any advantages from the roam, you essentially screw over your bot lane. \n\nBottom line is while I know this isn't every support, don't underplay the role. Support is extremely important to an ADC's success in the laning phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azaleax","date":"2016-04-11T20:21:01.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"hit the nail on the head with the benefits of support, I think.

Games become quiet because many support players actually are pretty whiny, and being the support yourself prevents that.\n\nAnd of course, you can literally fuck up things singlehandedly and still don't get blamed. If anything, people always blame my ADC even if it's my fault, and that as a support mistakes are often easy to wipe away and make up. DC'd because #technicaldifficulties?

So I decided to give it a shot and found my calling. My mains are {{champion:267}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:44}}  with my back ups are {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} . Been playing the role for a long time, I like doing more with less, and with how dangerous  it is to ward sometimes I feel like I'm a real scout (like the way {{champion:17}} should be). \n\nProblems: the nerfs to {{item:2049}} hurt. Bad. 3 charges aren't enough and with no green wards, it never feels like there's enough vision. Having to rely on your teammates to win fights. I can never win a 1v1 against anyone unless I'm insanely fed or they're just that bad. I never get the satisfaction of carrying a game. I'm not saying you can't as a support, but it doesn't feel as good as it is with other roles. Hell, half the time your own teammates won't even notice they're getting carried by you. They would think they did it themselves you allowed yourself to get carried. On a similar point, it feels even worse being on a losing team because you have to rely on your teammates that have already lost lane.\n\nSuggestions: Like OP has suggested, allow {{item:2049}} {{item:2045}} to regenerate charges. I feel like there should be at least one support that should be the 'come back kid' and get better the further behind his own team is. I don't know how to fix the 'feel' of carrying a game. I wish I did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dataless","date":"2016-04-11T23:26:45.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We play Support because non-support players would just fuck it up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-04-11T23:17:48.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main reason I support: I would like to jungle a bit more, but I can only play 3 roles, and leaving a random to support me is way more suicide than supporting a random and hoping he knows the bare minimum on how to pick up a kill or how to cs.

When I ADC I'm focusing on cs and outputting damage in teamfights. Playing midlane is basically the same, cs and do damage. But when I support I feel like I get to do more. I'm a constant threat to the opposing adc. \"Just how obnoxious can I be this game?\" I find myself wondering as we begin laning phase. After laning phase I get to act as a watchdog and fend off the opposing assassins as they click skillfully on my adc in an attempt to kill them, and if I play my cards right I can turn that around. Depending on what champ I'm playing depends on the kind of support I'm gonna offer. Sona being my favorite I tend to scare people away by accidentally ks-ing with a powercord. If I'm Morganna I give them time to take a break by hitting a Q, and if I'm Janna I can just blow everyone in the room to end the fight. \n\nThat's my take on support. It's a completely different game.","replies":[]}]}
