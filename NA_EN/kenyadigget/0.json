Another issue I'm faced with now, is that I'm seeing 2 vitals marked on my target sometimes, aswell. Only one of them works and only one's supposed to be lit up, in case you're going to try and rebuttal with them being my ult..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2015-09-14T17:28:08.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only have I had this happen (I feel like the vitals must not be strikeable right away).

It's understandable that they're delayed but it's extremely annoying when you hit the same spot 3 TIMES in a couple of seconds after you ult somebody and it still doesn't proc even the first vital.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-09-14T10:04:27.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugfix Fiora so she can be nerfed pliez :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kowagatte","date":"2015-09-13T16:41:34.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This happens with Twisted Fates Blue/Red/Yellow cards as well and flash is bugged right now that a second or two after you flash the game thinks your player is still where it used to be and you can be auto attacked.","replies":[{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2015-09-14T17:31:31.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure that's not a bug: if someone has already started their auto attack animation, and their name isn't Kalista, they will finish their animation and still hot you even if you aren't there anymore...
