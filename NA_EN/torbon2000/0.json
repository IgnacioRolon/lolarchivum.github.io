Some of them went to an art college, some didn't (The Bravo Ray was a bartender), I worked in animation first but for other's it's their first job. The things we have in common are a huge amount of passion for the game we make and the ability to improve rapidly - I think those are the two things everyone needs to be truly successful. I would also say that no course, no matter what they claim, is going to prepare you for work in the industry - so that makes it difficult to know how to 'break in'. However truly talented concept artist are in short supply, and I found that when I passed that threshold of quality and professionalism a lot of companies began to contact me and things started to move really quickly.\n\nThere can of course be other limitations to entry into the industry. I knew I would need a tertiary degree to get a work visa in the US so a multimedia degree was my first step (it was the only thing available in 2006, now there are a heap of game specific courses). From there I worked to improve my skills, even contacting a slew of professional artists to get critical feedback on where I was at, until I believed I was really meeting the industry standard (which even for associate positions is incredibly high). Finally I really focused on my goal - to work at **Riot** on **Skins**. To this end I started doing fan art of my own LoL skin ideas until I had a folio full of work they could actually use for their game - this proved to them that I really could do the job if I walked in tomorrow. Eventually I was given the opportunity to work as an outsourcer on a few projects. They went well and I showed a huge amount of improvement with each one, giving them the confidence to offer me an interview for a full time position.\n\nTo give you some additional advice I'd like to share with you something I've found myself often pondering as of late:\n\nThe number one thing I look for in candidates is creative problem solving. At Riot we look at craft, communication and culture - how good your artistic skill is, how effectively you can work with a team, and whether your work ethic aligns with Riot values. But for concept specifically I think these things are easier to screen for than the core strength of a great concept artist, which I believe to be that creative problem solving.\n\nFor me the best part of a folio (and something which is often entirely absent) is the spreads of ideas and iterations on a single problem space that show that the artist can tackle a problem from every angle and think outside the box to provide a fresh solution that goes above expectations. For example; if the goal is to design the interior of a gritty futuristic spaceship, will you generate a handful of generic interiors that get the job done, or can you, within the constraints provided, design a plethora of options that have the potential to be unique and memorable.\n\nFor example I couldn't tell you [which](http://www.dsogaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/killzone-concept-art.jpg) [game](http://i.imgur.com/hpTRYGj.jpg) [these](https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/2014/07/07__15_05_07/room2-1a.jpg54c0f839-d606-4cb2-82dd-13ed5040ba57Original.jpg) [designs](http://www.igorstshirts.com/blog/conceptships/2012/marksist/marksist_03.jpg) are from.\n\nBut excellent concept art not only [solves](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr06/16/7/original-21488-1400241470-5.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto) [problems](http://i.neoseeker.com/ca/halo_3_conceptart_yKJn3.jpg) but [inspires](http://squarefaction.ru/files/game/726/gallery/ef4a6bca5df1b802ca408d8df62c1f9b.jpg) [iconic](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/f3/33/cbf3331e55a05ba715f5cf8293ebae61.jpg) [design](http://68.media.tumblr.com/dde8236598048e80dea5a37d0f09af05/tumblr_nj955w3mq21s2wio8o2_1280.jpg).\n\nThe goal of concept art is to show the **potential** of an idea, not just meet the expectations of it. It is a job for people who enjoy solving challenging problems with creative design.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-06-13T00:49:38.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sharing this with us, Kindle. As an aspiring concept artist who would love to work at Riot someday (the idea of [Hextech Quinn](http://imgur.com/a/nqsWi) keeps me going) this is super enlightening, though also slightly terrifying just because of how high industry standards are -- for good reason though of course. Hope to get there some day and work with you guys to make some awesome skins :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-06-13T06:58:03.681+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remember every successful artist was once where you are now. It's one path we are all travelling along. I can honestly say that if you work on improving every day and have an honest passion for what you want to do, it's just a matter of time and the determination to not give up. I started late and only got to Riot when I was 31. I had years of lying awake wondering if I should just give up, and when it finally paid off nothing made me happier than the thought that I could tell people, with an honest grin, that you have just got to stick with it.","replies":[{"poster":"torbon2000","date":"2017-06-13T08:29:28.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for sharing your own experience it was really helpfull for me and for the others that might have the same question.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grimm Howl","date":"2017-06-12T19:37:27.993+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What any studio looks for in a concept artist is a solid portfolio that clearly demonstrates you have a solid understanding of gesture, form, shape, and anatomy. In order to build your portfolio and skills as an artist, you simply need to draw every day. Push yourself to get better and better. \n> \"What software do your artist and animators use? Any recommendations on what someone should focus on learning if they want to work in the industry/at Riot?\nDifferent studios use different stuff, but common software in the industry is Maya, Zbrush, Unreal, Unity, Photoshop, etc. Many studios also have proprietary software that an artist may need to learn after being hired. What’s more important is that you understand basic artistic principles, can execute on your area of expertise at a high, industry-standard level, and can communicate effectively about your artistic decisions.\ntldr: Learning industry-standard software is a good start, but it’s the quality of your craft and your understanding of how it does or doesn’t fit into the bigger picture that matters. You can always learn new software if you have strong fundamentals, and companies looking for artists are looking more at your work than your software credentials.\"\nOBIWUNKENOBI - Art Operations Director","replies":[{"poster":"torbon2000","date":"2017-06-12T20:45:58.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the help !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-06-13T01:03:42.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You draw a chick with some boobies and a 4-inch waist and voila~","replies":[]}]}
