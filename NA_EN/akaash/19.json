Like I never realized there was a difference between silver and bronze. I figured you all were absolutely trash with no mechanics/decision making skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut today. I played with an actual bronze 5 person. And let me tell you . You guys are all ages, ahead of bronze 5.  I don&#039;t even understand what could possibly be going through their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the bronze 5&#039;s actual build path on Sivir. http://puu.sh/tmELC/3245a4a559.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso heal TP sivir.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what else to say but to apologize to the silver players I have offended by grouping them with bronze players.","replies":[]}
