The amount of people with mix ideological views has been shrinking over time.\r\n\r\nI AM EXPLICITLY STATING THAT CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT DUMBER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON. I AM EXPLICITLY STATING THIS BECAUSE I THINK THE WARDENS ARE DUMBER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND INTELLIGENCE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS A DIFFERENT  ISSUE.\r\n\r\nSo any ideas as to why this is the case? I think it&#039;s probably because higher education draws diverse people and exposure to diversity leans people into more liberal mindsets.","replies":[]}
