Usually play support with her but play mid from time to time. I rly want the elementalist skin but cant seem to get it in chests. It makes pissed that at least 7 of my friends say they have the skin just from opening a chest and I havent. I even bought 20 chests at one point and I got 2 dj sonas I'm not joking. At this point I'm just considering just buying the skin, but is it actually worth the money? The only ultimate skins I have is dj sona and even though it's a good skin, I dont think it's worth 25 dollars. What are your guys' opinions?","replies":[]}
