It stays there under my Loot as a permanent skin, but it doesnt give option \"unlock skin\".\r\nI have read a lot of similar posts, but apparently no solution to it.\r\nSometimes, somebody would write that for them, helped to go to Legacy client, and it would be all ok, but now that there is no more Legacy client, i haven't seen any other solution.\r\n\r\nAny oppinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-12T22:58:20.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Curious Case of the Disappearing Yordle Witch...\n\n....SOLVED! I went and checked your account; it wound up getting redeemed, but the reason you couldn't before was because you don't own Lulu yet. That's no big though; once you do unlock her, the skin should be in your collection ready and waiting for you to try out. :)\n\nIf it isn't though, you can always ticket Game Support and they'll look into it for you!","replies":[{"poster":"slaven985","date":"2017-05-13T10:43:51.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you kind Sir, much obliged! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-14T03:44:46.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a problem!
