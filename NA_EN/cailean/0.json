Its fine for the first 10-15 minutes of the game but when things start to pick up and teamfights start happening I get a load of packet loss for about 10 - 60 seconds until it catches up. Ive been in contact with riot support but they are very slow. My ping is perfectly fine ingame when I lose the packets, its only on LoL, no other game. \r\n\r\nIve tried changing my DNS, turning off the firewall both on windows and my modem. Im on a wired connection so I was able to turn off the Interruption setting in the configure tab. Ive tried using a VPN(WTFast) and that still doesnt work. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any help, this is really frustrating as I cant play league properly and havent had a lag free game in ages. Thanks so much!","replies":[{"poster":"oldkingcoal","date":"2016-10-22T05:29:05.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"used the tool still have massive packetloss","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T23:14:55.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good that you hit us up in a ticket, and our tech team can help out as soon as they can!

Ive disabled p2p, run windows 7 so its NOT the windows 10 bug, changed dns, turned off all firewalls and the game still does it even after I clean reinstalled. Above all it seems to get worse patch to patch, in 6.19 it was sporadic, 6.20 fairly frequent, and with 6.21 the game is unplayable because this happens literally every 2 minutes in game. If anyone could help at all it would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Cailean","date":"2016-10-21T12:54:08.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its very frustrating, only happened to me after 6.19.
