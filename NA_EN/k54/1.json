Add the damage from the unique passive (almost like an ignite with a {{item:3165}} and actually ignite your target, I can jump Q > W > AA then use my E to hop away and let them fall to the ignite and passive.\n\nMy masteries also give me the 6% ignore Armor/MR so that totally negates the need for {{item:3135}} in my elo. Though I'm sure it comes in very handy in higher elos, I haven't had a use for it in my matchups.\n\nOriginally all favorite champions were AD champs and {{champion:103}} , but because teams are mainly AD, the tanks mostly build armor and health with a {{item:3065}} which honestly puts them right back at level 18 base MR with my build. They have about 100 - 110 MR, my build negates 50, puts them back at 50 - 60 mr.\n\nIf I take {{item:3135}} over {{item:3151}} , that would leave them with 36 MR but I wouldn't have that extra damage at the end. I could have both in my item set making the MR 24.5 but then I have to decide what's the better last item out of {{item:3116}} {{item:3157}}{{item:3165}} when I can have all 3. I know what I'm about to say is very noob, but I tend to drop the shoes late game when I can do enough damage that I don't really have to worry about escaping and more so just relying on my flash and E to close the gap.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-22T06:33:48.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to sound flamey or anything but building an item because a lack of MR at your elo doesn't make it gold efficient. Void staff is a better item on most champions, it is more gold efficient for the champions you are playing. The easiest way to climb is to build PORPERLY, which is not build this because at this elo it seems okay. There are real factual reasons why items are built on champions, determined primarily by Koreans because they have learned that numbers don't lie. Again not trying to sound like im flaming or an ass just that there are factual numbers behind the builds. \n\n\n\nSide Note: VOid staff is the same as LW it applies BEFORE MAGIC PENETRATION, basically eliminating 35% of their MR stat completely. THat is why it is a far better item","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-22T06:34:50.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So for example how you said you get runes and masteries giving you bonus magic pen, void staff removes 35% of the magic resist BEFORE applying those","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GummyBearWookiee","date":"2015-02-20T19:26:39.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing wrong with it..what people are saying about the hexblade on Akali is on point.  As both these champions though...you generally want to stay back out of the fight and pick your input point...doing so tends to lessen the damage you generally receive and will help to eleviate the need to either constantly back or a desire for the vamp scepter.\n\nOne thing though...sadly AP Fizz is dead...he got nerfed so hard he's not really worth it.  Instead try running him with a Tri-Force and a BoTRK.  AD Fizz is much MUCH stronger at the moment.  Look up some builds on him at probuilds.net and you'll see that that's currently the way to go for Captain Troll Pole.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDoubleFlashx","date":"2015-02-20T19:22:04.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everyone about building the Hextech on Akali, but I wouldn't recommend it on Fizz.
