I got a response: it was for (quote from Riot ticket response): \"directly modifying the League of Legends game files, which is a ToU violation and punishable with a permanent suspension\".\n\nThe only changes to \"game files\" were to a configuration file called game.cfg located somewhere in the LoL folders. I literally got permabanned just for changing one number.\n\nBefore touching anything I even researched if modifying \"game.cfg\" was allowed. I found numerous Riot employee and \"Wrenchman\" posts that said it's allowed or even instructed people to change the exact settings I was changing. Links are in the bottom of this post.\n\nSo the reason for the suspension was changing the resolution to get different aspect ratios (see 4:3, 16:9, 21:9 etc.). What this does is change the field of view. However, League of Legends natively supports ultrawide resolutions so buying a 21:9 monitor has the same effect. What changing game.cfg did was emulate this on a 16:9 screen. Here's what it looks like and how Riot themselves provide settings for ultrawide screens: http://imgur.com/a/FwIkY. \n\nWhy should players have to buy a 21:9 monitor if they can have the same effect for free?\n\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?\n\n>Here are some links with Riot or Wrenchman approval of game.cfg modification: \n\n>- Riot: \n\n>http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/bWudBIZ0-bug-blue-and-red-squares-appearing-when-mousing-over-turrets \n\n>http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=28614 \n>http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=333742 \n>http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1601482&page=1#post18507108\n\n>- Wrenchman:\n \n>http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1848181 \n>http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=998435 \n>http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=98893 \n>http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=59964 \n>http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=183343 \n>http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=10880&page=2\n\n\nTL;DR: Changed screen resolution from LoL configuration file, permaban received even though Riot has said multiple times that it's allowed.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2016-01-05T23:48:44.737+0000","up_votes":147,"down_votes":11,"body":"Hey GGS Sokeri,\n\nI have went forward with removing the suspension from your account.

Sorry about this and good luck on the rift!\n\nI understand there is an automated system that likely bans players for modifying their game.cfg file, however could you please forward this to the developers so they may fix the following.\n\n1.) Allow full modifications to the Game.CFG File, removing the checks from the anti-cheat system in place, Every Game I have ever played allows changing this file because it no way allows cheating to the game other than what people might complain about on resolution (Personally I have had no reason to change this yet because I still use dual monitors which it supports) however I have a 60 or so inch television I might play on in the future) and if I need to change this because the game won't fit full screen then I would get banned for it.\n\n2.) Support all native resolutions to fit full screen / wide screen monitors.\n\n3.) Might also need to make a public sticky telling people modifying this file is illegal now so they don't get banned.\n\nI am also sure that \"Curse Voice\" Overlay, and Custom Skin Interfaces make more changes than what modifying a few lines of text for game options do.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RuGu","date":"2016-01-05T23:59:26.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about modifying your key-bindings to allow for Attack-Move-Click on your left click?

It's unacceptable to allow something and then permaban for it.\n\nI agree that it would be unacceptable for Riot to say one thing and do another, but when considering the fact that you are using information from when Riot was first becoming a company the line becomes far more blurry.  It's not entirely reasonable to expect that comments Riot made half a decade ago should still be valid today, and most of those comments are meant to fix problems rather than allow players to give themselves an advantage.\n\n---\n\nI can't speak to Riot's perspective here, but as an impartial observer I feel like this is a situation where improper information was used to achieve a result that falls under giving an advantage.  That being said, I also see your point, where you are essentially utilizing a different monitor spec emulated within your own.\n\nThis is an interesting case.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2016-01-06T01:40:08.266+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that the \"advantage\" here is of negligible quality since it basically boils down to personal preference.

It's a slightly blurred thing when we're viewing it as editing game files to give yourself extra (ultrawide) screen real estate, but it's more cut and dry when viewed that way.
