I am not sure so i am asking, are there jarls or something like that in Freljord?\r\n2. Is war in Freljord similar to civil war in Skyrim where like half of Nords are Stormcloacks and the rest is pro-Imperial, and in Freljord there are Freljordians(?) who fight for Avarosa, some for Sejuani, I am not sure about people supporting Lissandra besides Frostguard tribe and those Clans try to convice  jarls (if they exist), who are neutral at the moment to fight with them?\r\n3. What are Noxus and Demacia thinking about war in Freljord, maybe they are thinking about possibility to invade and easilly take lands while Freljordans are busy with fighting eachother, maybe they have their favourites leaders and are supporting them or they are simply neutral? \r\n4. What is the current situation of war, who is winning and who is loosing and how the political map of Freljord may look?\r\nI think its all for now.

Basically the opposite of a patriarchy. An animal example is the Spotted Hyena.\n\nFor Spotted Hyenas, females are larger and more dominant than males in just about everything, and even the alpha male is surpassed in position by females of the lowest rank.
