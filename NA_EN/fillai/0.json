It's her way of testing if someone is capable of \"motion\".  If their soul is strong enough to survive it, they're likely to cause it, regardless of if they're worshippers or not.  If they aren't, well, they weren't going to do anything anyway, it's not a huge loss.  She's a hedonist, valuing pleasure and ambition.  Morality is pretty secondary.\n\nAt least, that's what she SHOULD be according to Nagakabouros.  You can see a little of her sympathetic side when she worries if Gangplank will survive the test.

If you can withstand your caliber, you are worth it.*\n\nThis would fit in Illaoi's (and for that matter, Nagakabouros') way of thinking, that everyone is in motion. **Everyone is in their own motion if you look at it, and their motion should not be interrupted.** If your purpose in life is to be a fanatical murderer who quote on quote makes art, but you god damn do it (Looking at you, Jhin), aren't you in motion?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-03-30T19:06:00.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, if I have what you're saying right (and please correct me if I'm wrong) Illaoi's test would be fatal when performed upon someone with potential for greatness, such as Gangplank, or any other champion, really.  While if some random peasant named Wat the Dungfarmer should fail the test they would instead, have something less disastrous happen to them.  Maybe they feel as though a fatherly hand is smacking them on the back of the head, telling them to make something of their life?\n\nAnd while that's less evil, I suppose, it doesn't actually solve the problems with Illaoi's test that I think make it an evil act.  Primarily, she performs it upon the unwilling.  She is taking an active role in putting persons into mortal danger against their will, even if with this new caveat there would likely be less people who would die because of it.  And ultimately, it's largely impossible to know what potential a person actually has.  Take Gangplank, he could have been born some poor scully rat in Bilgewater, or he could have been born the son of the wealthiest man in town.  I don't actually know, probably somewhere in between.  If Illaoi's test was given to him before he was Captain Gangplank, most feared pirate in Runeterra, is his potential and danger of the test the same, or is it scaled down because he isn't at his potential yet?  It just gets very strange.\n\nIt also isn't really represented in the Illaoi story in any way though.  The punishment for failure being death seemed pretty firm according to Illaoi's inner monologue.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-03-30T21:17:14.694+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Illaoi (because of her faith) is aware she only has so much time in this life.

Or let a lesser priest/priestess deal with it?    \n\nYou are correct, she is testing Gangplank because he has the potential for greatness-- i.e. His choices have the potential to change a lot of people's lives and the state of the world.   \n\nBraum (as our prime example of someone she doesn't even need to test) is an autopass because he is actively seeking to cause change and is aligned with his destiny.   Braum is probably not as important for the future of the Freljord as Ashe or Lissy-- but he is following what his heart tells him to do. \n\nLet's look at her job from Illaoi's perspective.   Death is inevitable and part of the design of the universe. But life is not the end.  Afterlife and reincarnation exist.  Also what you think is \"you\" is actually an illusion and tiny fragment of something larger.  (These are her truths-- it's not subjective for her)  \n\nNow this \"life\" was given to you by Nagakabouros to serve (in a small way) its plan.  Failure to live your life to its potential is a type of spiritual pain for you, slows the universe's progress, and fails her god.    Though killing you hurts your family and loved ones...   How important is your life vs your failed potential?  (As killing you returns that potential someplace else)   \n\nIt is a harsh reality she serves.

With power that big, intervening would have... Catastrophic results. This is why Nagakabouros probably has priests and priestesses: To enact her (their? his?) will.\n\nIf the way of life according to Nagakabouros is to follow and live up to your potential, wouldn't it make sense for that to be monitored, namely by said priests and priestesses? If, for example, you had the potential to be a professional writer, but you're dozing off and kind of becoming a supermarkt employee, yet others know this potential is in you, they would do anything to show you. In Illaoi's and Nagakabouros' way, that is to show them through the Test of Spirit. \nI don't think that, for example, Illaoi would need to test Jhin, because he'd be right on his merry way to follow his purpose: Killing. However, what if Dr. Mundo were to be able to be a great scientist, but  ended up the way he is now? That would not be according to the scheme of the Universe. Thus, Illaoi needs to smack some sense in him that he might as well die by her hand if he does not live up to his potential.\n\nAt least, that's what I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-03-31T07:52:26.119+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the thing is, assuming your point is correct, she would test Jhin, and he would pass.  Not because of his inner good or evil, but because he is following his purpose: killing people.\n\nAnd that's what we see happen in her own story.  She is given a freaking terrifying psychopath.  A mass murdering torturer, who has held onto power in his city with an iron fist.  Everywhere he goes he brings death and destruction.  He is damn evil, he makes a great villain.\n\nHe passes the test.  He is free to go on to be just as evil and vile as he was before.  So, from a moral standpoint, the results of the test are neither good nor evil.  It's just change.\n\nSo with the results being a wash we instead look at the implementations of the test.  This is where it fails.  Because that supermarket employee who could be a great writer?  It's ultimately his choice to be a supermarket employee or not.  That's on him.  That's his life.  Now if he chose to undergo the trial to unlock the conviction to go on to be a great writer.  That's something, else.  That's him taking the initiative of his life.  Good on him.\n\nBut that's not how Illaoi works.  She forces people to undergo this test.  And if that supermarket employee, who has done nothing morally wrong, should fail this test.  He dies.  The world doesn't gain this great writer, in fact the world is strictly at a loss because after all we do actually need supermarket employees.  That's where it's evil.  \n\nNow, what Nagakaborous is doing, is saying, according to him, good and evil the concepts do not matter.  All that matters is motion.  Motion can be positive or negative in outcomes, but that's not in itself good or evil.  In the same way a hurricane is the motion of current and wind, and while it can be destructive, it can also bring much needed rain.  The hurricane is not good or evil, because it's mindless.\n\nBut, if Nagakaborous is not mindless.  If Illaoi's actions are all based on the actual will of Nagakaborous, then we, as thinking, feeling, individuals can judge him/her/it/they.  We judge him by the standards of our own life, on the precepts of what is good or evil.  Now, of course, there are arguments over what constitutes good and evil.  Because we are, all of us, individuals with our own opinions.  \n\nBut, I would look at the methods by which the test is administered, and you can tell me if you think this is in any way moral.\n\n-The test is given without the participants permission or desire.\n-The test is potentially fatal.\n-Those that die do not do so because of any grand moral failing, on the contrary mass murderers can pass to go on their merry way mass murdering.  It only judges whether you are \"in motion\" or not.\n-What is or is not \"in motion\" is vague and poorly defined.\n\nThose conditions are inexcusable, from a good/evil moral standpoint.  Which makes sense.  The test is not about good and evil, it is about motion.  But just because something is not about good and evil, does not mean it cannot be judged as good or evil.\n\nSince he's already brought up.  Jhin.  Jhin, much like Illaoi, is dedicated to what he views as his purpose.  His purpose is not to promote motion, it is to create art out of dead people.  According to Jhin, this is an acceptable thing to do, maybe because he sees his art as beneficial to society.  Maybe because he sees his art as a rejection of conventional morality.  Maybe he hasn't actually thought of it in any way.  Regardless, in his mind people dying for art is his purpose.\n\nSo, because this view of life and death and what a person is worth is not tied to the good/evil dichotomy, does this mean we cannot judge him by his methods?\n\nI would say no.  We most certainly can.  He is a mass-murdering sociopath, whether he thinks his art is more important than the lives of those he kills is irrelevant.  He's still killing them.\n\nAnd whether Illaoi thinks the lives of those who die by the Trial were worthless or not, it doesn't matter.  She's still killing them.

The complete point of her trial is to show people their potential, if I am correct. The goal of Nagakabouros is for everyone to live his or her life like Nagakabouros intended it to. If they don't...

Thanks for doing that, that'll make everything a whole lot easier.\nAnd for this statement, it is very much arguable that said employee's death doesn't mean the world lost a writer; We lost a supermarket employee with the **potential** of becoming one.

However, it is most certainly an interesting topic to talk about, so I'll definitely respond to it.\n\n- The first point is all about will. If someone is not willing to go extra miles to reach his or her potential, it's a waste of life in the eyes of Nagakabouros (At least, that's how I interpret it). The Test of Spirit tests their will to live and reach higher stakes, does it not?\n- The second point... If you don't have the will to reach higher, what's the point in life for you? People's main goal is to evolve over time, as does any creature. If you're not willing to advance, you can hold others back, which creates a loop that is against the will of evolution, adaptation and advancement. Might as well clear those rotten oranges out, no?\n- Let us presume motion **is** potential. If you're in motion, you're living up to your potential, A.k.a. What Nagakabouros wants. If you are not in motion, you're not doing what you can do with your life.\n- Your last point is interesting, because there is tiny evidence scattered around her quotes. For example, look at who she calls \"in motion\" or who she likes (probably because they do what they are supposed to do): Ashe, Braum, Gragas, Sejuani, Darius, Gangplank, Graves, Jinx and Vi. All these people do something which they're good at, can enjoy and can still improve at. Darius, for example, is a military soldier who strives for improvement, does he not? Isn't that what potential could also be described as?\n\n\n>  Since he's already brought up. Jhin. Jhin, much like Illaoi, is dedicated to what he views as his purpose. His purpose is not to promote motion, it is to create art out of dead people. According to Jhin, this is an acceptable thing to do, maybe because he sees his art as beneficial to society. Maybe because he sees his art as a rejection of conventional morality. Maybe he hasn't actually thought of it in any way. Regardless, in his mind people dying for art is his purpose.\n\nJhin'd be in motion, because he does what he's supposed to do. He sees this right in his mind. Maybe Nagakabouros was like: \"*Some humans need to inspire fear in others, to, again, strive for defeating their fears and improving.*\", and then serial killers, soldiers, tyrants etc came to existence. Fear is a mighty driving, but it's also one of the best things to overcome.\n\n> So, because this view of life and death and what a person is worth is not tied to the good/evil dichotomy, does this mean we cannot judge him by his methods?\nI would say no. We most certainly can. He is a mass-murdering sociopath, whether he thinks his art is more important than the lives of those he kills is irrelevant. He's still killing them.\nAnd whether Illaoi thinks the lives of those who die by the Trial were worthless or not, it doesn't matter. She's still killing them. (Or more precisely, setting them up to die)\n\nI'm gonna make a **bold statement** here (Heheheheheheheh...): Illaoi is not killing them, they are killing themselves in the trial. Why do I say this?\nIt's kinda simple. They are not reaching their potential, striving for huge improvement etc. They are only doing what they could easily do. They are neglecting their potential.\nTo be honest, every human neglects their potential, because if they didn't, we would have had such a greater world, but that's none of my business.\n\nAnyway, the test with Gangplank was still very much doable for him, because when people are at Death's Door, they are capable of doing things greater than ever. Maybe Illaoi wants to show people their potential in the face of death? Wouldn't that be a plausible possibility?","replies":[{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2017-03-31T15:57:48.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The second point...

That guy is the definition of a villain - his first color story we saw in the Bilgewater update had him carving scrimshaw in the open leg of a _living goddamn person_, _**while he was conscious.**_ And he is the example of a person destined for greatness, that would justify Illaoi calling down the test of Nagakabouros on him.\n\nIs it _objectively_ evil that she forces great but stagnating people to undergo her God's test, especially when not all _great_ people are _good_ people? If you're going to see things exclusively through black and white, would she not actually be doing a _good_ thing by potentially killing such dangerous villains as Gangplank?\n\nOr, are you only restricted to your view of the world, and can't fathom positive aspects of a (in your opinion) overtly negative act?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-03-31T07:29:29.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fortunately my zealotry doesn't get anyone killed.  Since we're comparing the two.\n\nThough, personally, I don't see how your argument is actually helping the position that Illaoi isn't evil.  Since her test actively persuaded an already evil person, Gangplank, to go become an even more ruthless pirate and try to win back his crown.  Notice, there was no moral here.  He was not told that, killing people was bad.  That carving a scrimshaw out of a living person's leg was generally frowned upon.  No, he was told that he grew relaxed in victory and should go back out there and become king of the pirates.  \n\nBecause, ultimately, the religion presented by Nagakabourus wasn't interested in whether the people were good or evil, they just pushed them to keep going. \n\nNow, do I think good things can come from a bad or evil situation?  Of course, it'd be stupid to deny otherwise.  If you pardon the internet cliche, would Oskar Schindler have reached his potential in saving people if there was not a Holocaust to save them from?  No.  Of course he wouldn't.  But that doesn't suddenly make the Holocaust not a despicably evil event.\n\nNow as to this:\n\n>Is it objectively evil that she forces great but stagnating people to undergo her God's test, especially when not all great people are good people?\n\nYes.  And this is the part where this argument gets so confusing for me.  There are a myriad of reasons why forcing people, great or small, good or evil, to undergo a potentially life threatening event because your religion told you it was good to do it.\n\nJust read that line.  From a moral standpoint that is blatantly horrifying.  Can something good come from it?  Sure. People react to psychological trauma in various ways, some use that motivation to do great things.  To use a personal example (I know, I know, you really shouldn't), I happen to know a woman who was raped.  She now dedicates a large portion of her time and energy to helping rape victims.  I can pretty firmly say, she has done more good for the world after her suffering.  That does not somehow make the actions of the rapist any less than the vile actions they are.\n\nAnd that's what Illaoi's doing.  It's not as blatantly obvious as a rapist, of course.  But she is taking people, against their will, and forcing them to undergo a potentially fatal trial.  During this trial they are not judged by if they are a good person, or a bad person.  It is not somehow designed to make the world a better, more noble place.  The only criteria is if you will be \"in motion.\" Whatever that may be.  It can push that one scientist to discover the cure for cancer.  Or, as we see, it can push that one former tyrant to go back and become an even bigger and more dangerous tyrant.  It makes no difference to the test.\n\nSo, not only is the process itself vile, but it does not even push toward a better world.  I don't see how there is ambiguity in this, that's pretty evil.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-03-31T07:59:15.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ambiguity is that there's no way to make the world better, and no way to make the world worse. There'll be heroes, there'll be villains, there'll be people who want to watch everything fall to cinders, or people who want to uplift the downtrodden - but they don't make the world a better or worse place. They are facts of life, and that brutal nature of it is exactly the core of Illaoi's test.\n\nIt's like a crude distillation of \"everything happens for a reason, it is all in God's plan\". The most cutthroat people like Gangplank are meant to be cutthroat - hell, look at Bilgewater during the Harrowing soon after Miss Fortune took over. Gangplank held the entire city in check through fear, and now that the Pirate King is dead, the whole bottle of bullshit that was Bilgewater is uncorked. (which, also makes me technically wrong in saying Gangplank is a villain - he's more of a very, very evil antihero, in this respect.)\n\nThere's a good and a bad side to everything, and even if Illaoi's Tests do go against a person's free will - it's not objectively bad. Heroes and villains alike could die, but their feats become ever-more amazing should they survive. And, true enough to relate it to a rape victim helping other victims - but, that just reinforces the distillation of Nagakabouros' \"plan\" mentioned above - from the terrible person who gave into his baser urges to the woman who helps those who suffer the same pain, in the most brutal, painful core of it: They both exist for a reason beyond our knowledge.\n\nTo try and make the world a better, more noble place would be a fool's errand, and Illaoi knows it. There cannot be the order of Ionia or Demacia without the chaos of the Freljord or Bilgewater. Her job is simply to ensure that paragons of either side are always sowing their brand of either.\n\nI suppose I'm either more accepting of the worst of human nature, or - and this is probably the biggest thing for me on this subject - this is religious lore for a character in a game about powerful people in a fictional world brawling each other.

The actions of one should create a reaction in all--be it a good action or an evil one. Judging a person by the karma of their actions doesn't matter if those actions are negligible. Things and people are to simply means to an end to realize your goal. Just like her Eye of God. Stepping on it and hitting people with it might appear disrespectful, but it is nothing more than a tool to be used. If she has to step on it, or hit people with it to make a statement, it is serving it's purpose. The same is for good and evil actions. They are tools to use for what you want and what you dont. Motion is not good or evil, it is change, action and and desire. I really like how Hippoman put it saying if you are strong enough to survive motion, you are strong enough to cause it. {{champion:420}} \"Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens\"\n\nIf a good man survives an evil mans actions, that will (or should) strengthen him to change them, like a good man's actions will require an evil man to be strong enough to disrupt them. It is a cycle that keeps the world moving, changing, growing and thats what's truly important to her religion and the betterment of the world as a whole.\n\nEven if people view her to be an evil entity, what matters is what they do about it. If they don't like her or her views it would be their motion to destroy her. As it would be her motion to defend her convictions and destroy them. Both actions keep her strong, and require those who wish to oppose her to grow strong enough to be able to. It reminds me alot of the Closed Fist philosophy from the xbox game Jade Empire. That philosophy was if you want something, earn it, or take it using your strength and disregard for those who are not strong enough to help you or themselves. She talks about using your strength to take what you want and destroy would you detest, not out of good or evil, but simply because doing so will create motion and move people to comply or resist, but they can only truly make a stand in compliance or resistance if they are both physically and mentally strong enough to do so.\n\nAs for Nagakaborous specifically she also talks about what her god truly stands for. {{champion:420}} \"My god is not love, it is a kick in the pants.\"  \"Many gods ask for worship. They are weak gods.\" \"There are kind and gentle gods..... Mine isn't one of those.\" To highlight a few instances where she mentions how Nagakaborous operates. They are not a good entity but they aren't one of evil, but that still leaves their actions and influence up to perception and interpretation to those they affect. If nagakaborous affected someone in a negative way, theyll perceive it to be an evil god. If nagakaborous affected them positively then theyll be thought of as good. Nagakaborous is neither and it's purpose is not to BE either. It's purpose is to make you move. If it needs to be perceived as good or evil in order to move people thats just a benefit.\n\n{{champion:420}} \"Names don't matter. Action does.\"","replies":[]}]}
