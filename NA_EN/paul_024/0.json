If not, isn't that stealing on Riot's part?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":10,"down_votes":82,"body":"If you pay hundreds of dollars for skins, then have your account permanently banned, isn&#039;t that theft on Riot&#039;s part? You pay for a product, then they take it back from you. Bait and switch? I think so. This crap has got to stop.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve literally paid over 500 dollars for skins, then I get permabanned because trolls can&#039;t handle criticism and they gang up for reports. I&#039;ve even got a chat restriction before simply for choosing teemo top lane. They hate teemo, they report me. I get banned. Then more bans leads to permanent ban and...I&#039;m defrauded from WHAT I PURCHASED. \r\n\r\nRiot needs to fix this or get sued.","replies":[]}
