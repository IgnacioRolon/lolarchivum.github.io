Just recently, i entered into champ select while there my client crashes. So i restart and try to log back in soon so i can rejoin the lobby. Nope. I got a loss on my series, loss of LP, 30min Leaver buster, and a demerit on my account. I dont know if riot is working on these crash issues, but i just want my loss gone. and its frustrating to say the least.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T23:43:03.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing in champion select and losing LP sucks, and I'd like to help resolve whatever is causing it to happen.  I do need some more information, though, to figure out what's going on.  Can you be more specific when you say crash?  For example, are you receiving any error messages and what does it say?  What are you observing, or what are you doing exactly when this issue occurs?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Adinymis","date":"2016-08-05T23:47:45.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im just in champ select waiting for my turn to pick. I open the champion menu, and then the client crashes. I get a message. ( lol.pvp.net (or similar to that) has stopped responding) so i press cancel and restart the client.","replies":[]}]}]}
