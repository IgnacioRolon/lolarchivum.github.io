Mama Meep was the staff member who responded and said it was done but asked me to fill out a account recovery form with directions. I followed his directions but now have no received a response from him for 5 hours now. My account is now permanently suspended. I can assure you there is nothing wrong with my account and the information I provided should be accurate. If someone could please assist me I would deeply appreciate it as this has ruined my whole day off from work and school.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T16:23:19.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and confirmed that your account recovery form has been received.  It's in queue to be reviewed by our account team, but in the meantime it's important not to reply to the ticket until you receive a response.  Otherwise, you'll get dropped back to the bottom of the queue.  We'll reply back as soon as we can!","replies":[{"poster":"Gaila","date":"2017-08-23T13:31:38.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32}}","replies":[]}]}]}
