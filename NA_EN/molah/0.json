I was wondering if other people were having same problems as me and wanted to discuss upon the matter.\r\n\r\nMy laptop is fine. My internet is fine (its not even wifi. Its ethernet). And I never had these problems before EVER.\r\n\r\nIt feels like Im playing from another region. It feels like I have 150-200 ping. This isnt permanent but happens very often and its also random.\r\n\r\nI have tried many \"fix\" options such as disabling the Xbox DVR thingy, redownloading the client, and updating my graphic programs, etc\r\n\r\nIt just feels like I am being punished at this point. Having fine internet and computer and I have to still play with this insanely annoying delay.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how to fix this problem or even would like to just discuss this issue, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAnd I would love to downgrade to Windows 7 but the time for reset is over.. so only options are buy windows 7 or factory reset (which I rather not \r\n\r\ndo just because of 1 game having issues.)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T22:54:18.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you describe the delay a bit more? There are a lot of things that can be causing this, but it depends on the specific symptoms.","replies":[{"poster":"Molah","date":"2016-11-17T00:52:09.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure. thanks for replying\n\nWhen I right click the character to move from 1 point to another, Its not instant or matched with the normal speed limit of my ping (55ms).\n\nThe character (champion) just stands still for (if short) 1 - 2 or most of the time (long) 3-5 seconds and THEN moves to the place I right clicked.\n\nAgain as I stated above, the ping or FPS does not go down at all. Computer and Internet is fine. \n\nI have seen some people make a thread about it in the 6.22 bug thread on Reddit. They have the exact same problem I have and apparently\n\nonly way to \"fix\" the issue as of moment is to go back to windows 7 (which is a lot of hassle)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T19:28:50.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not convinced this is directly related to your OS.
