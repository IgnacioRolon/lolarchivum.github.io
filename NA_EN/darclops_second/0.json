If you move, is it far outside the base?\n* Do you deal damage and or assists, do you die?\n* Do you use skills? Warding the totem is fine, too.\n\nThe amount of \"AFKness\" matters. Try it:\n\nBuy an item AT THE BEGINNING, then move out of the base and stand around AFK for 2:30 minutes: Leaverbuster would flag you (not necessarily for a punishment, but apparently a hidden score counts up now until you move) and voila: Remake pops.\n\nBuy an item SHORTLY BEFORE minute 3, then move out of the base, heck even skill, use summoner skills: Leaverbuster sees you are AFK for 2:30 minutes, basically 84% of the whole game: You are a leaver, Remake pops.\n\nBuying an item does not count at all.\nI was once Bard but the loading was so fast, when I came back, the game was like 2:45,I purchased my stuff and walked down: Remake popped.\n\nHad a missing Yorick one, as soon as he entered the lane as Level 1 with Doran's ring, \"Enemy team agreed to surrender 2 vs 0\".
