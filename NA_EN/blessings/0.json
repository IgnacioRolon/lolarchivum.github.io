And dealing bonus magic damage on her next basic attack includes turrets, epic monsters, champions and minions. ANYTHING she can basic attack. But now her empowered basic attack no longer deals extra damage to turrets?! \r\n\r\nThis is huge. Especially for Neeko's who want to hard shove, harass under turret and get easy plates. This takes away all her sieging. \r\nNot to mention, she doesn't even get the movement speed buff. \r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a bug or a nerf but this needs to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2019-01-10T23:01:04.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a neeko main, I didn't like it, but I don't think it was an unfair nerf.

She capped at a 49.1% Win rate. She's obvious as hell.\n\n2) There are about 40 champions who have turret enhanced damage, most of whom really weren't meant to be siegers.\n\nFor example:\n\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:86}} Shred turrets. Garen's Q hits turrets, giving him a legitimate Demolish every time it's up. Ashe's Q rapid fire destroys turrets. Diana's on hit passive + Lich Bane almost 1 shots turrets.\n\n{{champion:37}} Gets to on proc turrets with Q and her passive.\n\n{{champion:142}} Gets to on proc use her passive on turrets.\n\nI can go on and on....\n\nThere are far more turret destroyers than there are turret immune skills. And almost all of them have competent, carrying damage kits with high success rates too.\n\nPushing turrets was literally the one area she's good at. It works hand in hand with her highest win rate build: {{item:3115}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3089}} . Other builds don't do NEAR enough agency.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2019-01-12T00:46:01.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was not meant to be a jungle there is 0 reason for this.......","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Morieeko","date":"2019-01-12T00:24:11.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is most lilely a bug.
