I don't believe this'll be incremental, though. It can only drop by one. If there are 2 no votes it isn't suddenly only 3 votes that count; It's still 4 votes. In that case, 3 yes and 2 abstain is still 3 out of 4; a surrender. But if it's 2 yes and 3 abstain, that's only 2 out of still 4. This is all alongside the typical AFK voting rules, of course.","replies":[]}
