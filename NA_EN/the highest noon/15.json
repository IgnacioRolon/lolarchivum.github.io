It's your perception that changed. Also, I found that many people interpret someone making a call without wasting time typing \"would you please\" etc. as \"barking orders.\" This isn't a dinner party. It's a competitive game and you're making way too many assumptions about people's intention.","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2017-07-13T22:40:33.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YourQQ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bbuIYnYq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-11T06:40:20.669+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re reading way too much into it and think it&#x27;s the system.

Since Riot claims overall positive gameplay increases win-rates, we can say that loading screen banners are a positive incentive. As well, just being honored got you loading screen badges. Now they're adding actual paid-for content?","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-07-14T00:43:53.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the extra stuff was unnecessary. Are you referring to the capsules a Level 3 or just the key fragments?\n\nTwo things I really enjoy about the change:\n\n1. The after game screen. Yes you can skip honoring someone, but it is already their and encourages honoring.\n\n2. The key fragments being connected to it. I know mathematically you get the same amount of keys as before, but it feels like I'm earning the limit the drop at now. Instead of maybe 1 key frag for a week of games, I might be getting 2 or 3.\n\nSomething I didn't notice before at the end of OP. Yes, not being toxic is a rule. Communicating is not. It is encouraged but the only way not communicating is punishable is when you force your team into a situation. (As in the Support Smite cases)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-11T04:36:10.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your stance on participation trophies?","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2017-07-13T22:00:39.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=That Juicy Booty,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bbuIYnYq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-11T04:36:10.497+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s your stance on participation trophies?\n\nParticipation trophies are great so long as you give better trophies to the winners lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-07-11T04:43:19.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A waste of money to provide. But then you may as well only have something for 1st place and nothing else.\n\nI would ask for a different comparison since participation trophies/ribbons do cost money (however cheap/expensive).\n\nI will also admit to potentially being biased on the whole thing though. In my school system (teacher, not that it matters) they do award ceremonies and award students for Academics (Principal's list, A honor roll, B honor roll.) but also for behavior. Students getting an award are more likely to continue and those who may have made a few mistakes may try to better themselves.\n\nI realize I just argued for both sides, I just hate the phrase \"participation trophy\" Maybe. xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}
