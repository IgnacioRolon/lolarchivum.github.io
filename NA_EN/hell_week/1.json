HERE IT IS!","subforum":"Tips & Tricks","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Well we all know how annoying thornmail can be, specially as an ADC or squishy AD champs, such as Riven. Some of you might not be aware of what thornmail does. What it does is it reflects 30% of the physical damage dealt by the attacker ( including most on-hit effects ). So the more AD you have the worst it will get. So it's pretty simple really, if you're being damaged by the damage you deal, you just simply want to get HEALTH BACK from the same damage you deal. Also keep in mind all the damage being returned by the evil thormail is magic based, so 1 or 2 simple magic resist items will do the trick.\n\nItems that counter thornmail - {{item:3153}}   {{item:3074}}   {{item:3072}}   {{item:3508}}   for damage.\n\n                        {{item:3065}}   {{item:3102}}   for MR.\n\nIf you build those first 3 AD items and a banshee, you're basicly set, and that thornmail will be close to useless. \nHope this was useful for anybody out there having trouble with those nasty thornmails, specially for Riven players... man those thornmails can really pack a punch.

In other words, it deals 30% of the damage you deal to minions back to you, regardless of how much armor the wearer has.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hell Week","date":"2015-02-25T19:01:32.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point, i just assumed people would build at least 1 armour pene item with their regular build.
