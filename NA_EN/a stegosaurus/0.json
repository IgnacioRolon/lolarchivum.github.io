Specifically Janna. As one of my favorite champions to play, and one of the first champions I bought, why did riot reworked her and decreased the quality of her splash art? It was amazing and very lifelike. She is looks like an in game character graphic from WOW. I liked league of leagued, because the characters and art had a different dimension away from middle earth/fantasy typical artwork and feel. I know League of Legends hired someone from WOW, and I am not blaming him. League of Legends should be separated from other games like this. Now Janna doesn't even look like herself or fit the lore at all! Please Riot, I need an explanation. \n\n[Edit: Made three deletions of harsh comments within this post]","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-08T16:38:54.702+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Janna's new splash art is a lot better than Janna's old splash art for quite a few reasons, the most prominent being her lore. The new lore much better represents the her \"otherworldly\" appearance much better than the old one, as her old splash makes her look a lot more like some of the other female champs than she should. In addition, the expression on her face captures the \"untouchable\" nature of Janna significantly better than the old one, as Janna's smirk in her old splash doesn't reflect that nature.\n\nIn addition, the quality of the splash art is unquestionably better in quality, as her old splash art looks very dated in quality. I mean seriously, the new one looks like it is done by professionals and the old one looks like it was done by amateurs.","replies":[{"poster":"iLove ma Support","date":"2016-07-10T20:31:48.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i liked the more touchable version of janna","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gapybo","date":"2014-11-08T11:08:44.515+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"She doesn't look like a slutty fanservice anymore.

Her lore states her affections can change as swiftly as the wind and that she's often the center of attention at League of Legends events, but none of those things have to do with being flirty or romance. Her affections could just as easily be considered her friendships, who is on her good side. Janna is not a slut, she's a young woman with a harsh past who has dedicated herself to the teachings of proper magic use/regulations.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2014-11-09T05:27:53.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the new image: 1) She has even less clothes now (around the hips and chest).  2) Janna is closer.  3) Her crotch is in full view (as opposed to blocked by her leg in the old one)\n\nThat is your definition of job well done.

Good to know.\n\nI know this is an outdated post, but Just because you \"put less clothes\" on a person. It doesn't necessarily make it more intended for fanservice. If you look, it appears that she has less clothes because her little wavy piece of cloth that attach to her waist are now transparent, which is what they should've been in the original.\n\nWhy is it bad if Janna is closer in the new picture? The picture was always supposed to represent an image we can connect in our minds to Janna. The picture shouldn't really have anything other than janna.\n\nThere is a point to fanservice where it doesn't become fanservice anymore. There is a point at which a scantily clad person becomes more mature, rather than less mature. If they wanted her to appear as a slut, they would've changed her facial expression. For example, Miss Fortune, being the biggest slut in the game right now, doesn't actually show that much skin. In fact, she doesn't wear shorts, she wears a \"bra\" that covers the whole of her boobs, and she has a hat. All of these put together really only show her waist, and her shoulders. But unlike Janna, her facial expression reveals the fact that she is a sex figure. Her \"bra\" - while covering 100% of her boobs - Is still revealing. Her boobs are way too big for how boobs should be, and her figure represents an unrealistic quota for women to try and adapt to. You've heard all this before, from feminists, to people that dislike fanservice, to people in the news talking about \"whether sex in games is alright.\" There is a difference between \"naked\" and \"nude.\" \"Sexy\" is generally represented more by scantily - clad women, or women in their underwear; rather than people with no clothes on. The difference between Janna losing clothes and Miss fortune's facial expression, posture, and figure, is that Janna is more refined, she obviously isn't looking for sex, and she doesn't show any lust in her figure, posture, or facial expression.\n\nTl;Dr\n\nJanna shows her maturity by choosing to wear clothes that fit her more than the original splashart, though there is less of it, that shows in my mind that she doesn't mind what other people thinks of her. She isn't a slut, and she wasn't meant for fanservice; because if she was, she'd have a different facial expression, posture, and figure. She doesn't have oversized boobs, nothing about her says \"sex\"\n\nGood job riot, and please change Miss Fortune. Put the classic into a skin, and make money off of that skin, like you do with Arcade Miss Fortune. But don't shun newcomers away from buying her just because she's a slut.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rune Ocarina","date":"2014-11-08T12:01:45.537+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They immediately explained why Graves lost his cigar, but they've been quiet about this.

It looks like someone shaded a lot of her original picture with blacks and whites for the darks/lights which is always a big no in the art world. there's some really weird blur mechanics going on by her hair, her cloth around her legs is very jagged and doesn't flow well, the pose isn't very dynamic, the texture of her staff at points makes it look like it's covered in cobwebs. It was a good piece of art, it was better than say Toxic Mundo or old Sion or old Singed art, but it wasn't up to par with a lot of the splashart today. The new splashart shows her otherworldly side, paints her as a very different entity from the previous 'blonde chick' headshot she had before. This new piece has better dynamics both in the posing and the shading of her character. The new splash looks like she's actually commanding wind as opposed to 'hey look I'm posing with a staff'.\n\nAs Janna is one of my favorite champions to play I was both very excited and disappointed in this new splashart. Very excited because the art is absolutely gorgeous and fits Janna to a tee. Very disappointed because I own every Janna skin (besides Victorious) and therefore I'll only really get to see the splashart as a headshot in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2014-11-09T12:30:02.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think \"Now Janna doesn't even look like herself or fit the lore at all (claiming she is down right ugly)\" is incorrect. As far as the quality of the textures and lighting etc. it's a very well done piece of art. But the old art was too, and the current one does not depict Janna in so far as we've known her. Yes Janna is perceived as otherworldly, but if you actually read her lore this wasn't always the case. She's an orphan and grew up on the streets and stole to get by, and if you read JoJ she even has paparazzi problems like any other celebrity. While her tattoo has had mixed reviews, I felt as another person felt that it made her relatable, and served as a reminder of her childhood and that she's not above us all. However, with the lore retcon we can no longer hold splash arts to the character depictions as we've known them since they are currently subject to change. Imo she was prettier in her old splash and depicted beauty, warmth, and grace in addition to power. Now she's still pretty and powerful, but completely otherworldly and cold.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2015-01-30T00:21:02.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShadowGlaive213,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=TpAqg1s0,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2014-11-09T12:30:02.629+0000)\n>\n> I think \"Now Janna doesn't even look like herself or fit the lore at all (claiming she is down right ugly)\" is incorrect.
