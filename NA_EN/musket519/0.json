But after the game i get leaver buster for 20 minutes on 5 games FOR SOMETHING I CANT CONTROL. Its not my fault that my computer crashed at that moment and Riot should know things like this happen and have some sort of appeal process for it cause now i have to wait for over an hour with nothing to do for something that i didnt do and cant control. Please Riot just do something for this, it makes me and im sure many others just not want to play the game anymore just because of this kind of stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSeltzerBaron","date":"2016-10-13T03:28:13.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand why you think there should be an appeal process but I disagree. Seems like an awful lot of people play this game on garbage computers (myself included) or craptops that overheat/crash frequently. If you're having regular issues because of your hardware (I'm not saying YOU specifically are) then I think leaverbuster is appropriate because you knew beforehand that there was a risk of error or crash and you should be forced to assume responsibility for it if your junk crashes you and ends up ruining the game for the other 4 players. I have fps problems often but I can usually correct them. If a player has consistent hardware issues resulting in disconnects they should not play and if they choose to then they should suck it up when leaverbuster nails them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"You SmeII Bad","date":"2016-10-13T02:46:11.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, The website says you get a 5,10, or 20 minute restriction but I was instantly given a 5 game, 20 minute restriction. 20 minutes for a offense is a bit excessive. I understand the wrong doing of leaving but the times should escalate and decrease with the amount of games to leave / complete.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T22:37:40.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We certainly understand that sometimes that an emergency comes up or a technical issue pops up. This is why you never receive a 5-game penalty for a single disconnection. It takes a trend of disconnections before you get a 5-game low-priority queue from Leaverbuster.\n\nSince all disconnections negatively impact everyone in the match, regardless of intent, they're all treated equally by the system. This is also a big reason why penalties cannot be removed or modified for any reason.\n\nBlue Screens are often caused by drivers that are problematic or hardware issues. Our [Bugpslat & Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) is a good place to start troubleshooting this.
