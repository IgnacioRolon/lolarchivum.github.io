I've played three games today against AI and two of my teams had bots.  The first game had two.  It was surreal to see them take the exact same actions (same lanes, stopping in same place behind first tower, charging one enemy and both dying).\n\nThis isn't something I've seen normally in the past.  Today almost doubled the number of bots I've seen farming for IP.","replies":[{"poster":"SILVER ELO GOD","date":"2017-07-02T21:22:39.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. But I was playing a renked game with a human and later on I noticed it's an unranked account that has been botted to 30 and sold. They don't even try to hide it anymore. Before you would see it's unranked but it would have no normals played because they would wait for op.gg to drop the data and then sell it. At least I think that's how they did it before, because I've seen weird names like this (dkaokdao or something) and they play godlike and have 0 normals and are just doing their placements.\n\nBut now it's just plain obvious.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T22:46:06.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can always report people that you suspect might be bots by using the report button in the post game.

There was an option in the support webpage but I'm not sure which option to chose. I've done this before I just can't remember which fields to select and what to write. The person got banned the same day last time I did it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T20:18:51.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick the one at the bottom that says \"I want to report abusive behavior\" and that'll get you to the right people!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
