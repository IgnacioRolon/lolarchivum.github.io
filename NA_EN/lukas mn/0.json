I needed like a week to find out what was the problem at my place, but never thought it would be it. In my case the problem was Razer Synapse. I got the BlackWidow Chroma keyboard and Darthadder Chroma mouse, so u need this Razers app to conf. all the lights and settings but i dont understand why and how that inflicts to loading the game?\n\nI log in normaly, go to a lobby, going into champ selection... everything ok, and then when the game should start loading that error pops up. I closed and restarted the client multiple times, reconected 1 milion times and no go. Then i updated GPU drivers and nothing so then i started closing running apps in Start bar. I closed Razers Synapse too and look at that... the game worked. I repeated the bug few times just to be sure and thats it.\n\nI got Avast Free and it doest bother the game and Hamachi and Steam too... \n\nSo what is the problem between the game and Razer Synapse? Anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"CircIe","date":"2017-08-01T18:22:14.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue right now as well and was wondering if you ended up fixing it.
