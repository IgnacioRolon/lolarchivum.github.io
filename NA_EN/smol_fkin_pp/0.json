Sometimes it happens when it's my turn to pick or ban, sometimes it occurs when another player is picking/banning. I can't figure out how to reproduce it, as it occurs seemingly randomly for me. Sometimes it'll happen multiple times a day, other times it won't occur for a week. I've been scouring the boards for a fix, and the only thing I'm seeing is that it's \"fixed,\" even though there's still a multitude of recent posts regarding the issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smol Fkin PP","date":"2016-06-14T01:17:38.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dynamic queue died <3 riots listening to us Yay!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smol Fkin PP","date":"2016-06-14T01:15:33.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwTv Secillia","date":"2016-06-14T09:24:10.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I won an aram and now I can queue T-T okay I'll take it","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwTv Secillia","date":"2016-06-14T08:55:04.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did anyone come up with a fix for this?
