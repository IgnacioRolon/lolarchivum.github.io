MS (ping) is the time in milliseconds it takes for data to travel between Riot's servers and your computer, so there is no way to truly get around distances and the way data travels across the internet. There are slight things you can do to mitigate issues of ping spikes and random jitter, but you're already on a wired connection so they're likely to prove unhelpful. You can try taking a look at the [KB article to troubleshoot connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but I'm afraid I can't promise you'll find what you're looking for.\nSorry for being unable to help you further, but if you have any more questions don't hesitate to ask! \nRegards, Kayle","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T15:56:06.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Only Kayle has provided some great insight here. The biggest factor in latency to a server is the route the ISP takes to get to that server. Our [NA Server Roadmap](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap) goes over a lot of the other factors in your latency and has some great visuals as well.\n\nIf you'd like to have one of our tech specialists take a look at your routing, I recommend running a set of traceroutes [using our guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) or with [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) for 5 minutes with the IP address 192.64.170.1, then exporting your results as text.

I've seen streamers like C9 Sneaky who live in Santa Monica have 67 ms but I live further east of that which makes me closer to the chicago server.
