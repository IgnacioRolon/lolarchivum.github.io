I've been trying to download league for about 3 and a half hours now, and it freezes here every time.\r\n\r\nI've also tried to download from different servers aka euwest, russia... they don't work.  Obviously.  Just thought I'd try that though.\r\nI've enabled and disabled peer-to-peer transfer, which didnt work.\r\nI reset my computer 2 or 3 times throughout this time, and it didnt work.\r\nI reset my internet a few times which didnt work.\r\n\r\nI'm on a MacBook Pro, reluctantly, but still I want/need league to survive in this world so please, any help with this download would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nI included a picture of my download just for reference.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJake","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-01-29T01:34:26.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey WSU Panzey,\n\nI'm sorry that you're having problems downloading the new patch! There are a few things that you can do that may help the patch download properly. \n\nFirst,  make sure your cookies are enabled on Safari. This can affect your patch because the League client uses Safari as a backbone on the Mac client! \n- Click on the Spotlight magnifying glass in the top right corner of the menu bar and search for \"Safari\"\n- In the Safari menu bar, select Preferences and click on the Privacy icon\n- Make sure the [Block cookies and other website data:] section is marked as \"Never\"\n\nIf the Cookies change does not work, verify that your computer's clock is synced! \n- Open your [Applications] folder and go to the [Utilities] folder\n- Open the [Terminal] application\n- Type the following command in the Terminal: sudo ntpdate -vu time.apple.com\n\n*Note: You will need to enter your Account password and hit [ENTER] but the letters will not be visible as you type them\n\nThe last thing you can try is ensuring the League of Legends.app has Administrator Privileges. If League doesn't have admin rights, it may not allow you to connect to the server to download the new files! You can find a guide to do that [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#jmq8)!\n\nUltimately, if none of that helps resolve your patching issue, I recommend you [submit a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), as we'll be able to better help you out with resolving this patch problem there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeken","date":"2015-01-30T00:48:56.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi :( repairing my client won't work, and there is an invisible LAUNCH button that does nothing but make noise when clicked.
