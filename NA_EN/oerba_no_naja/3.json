It was basically moved there just so 21/9 and 9/21 couldn't take advantage of it on top of their given build. It's on the top shelf so now no one enjoys it.

If you go 9/9/12, you get most of the early offensive and defensive stats you might be used to, and you'll also get Runic Affinity and Alchemist as a bonus. It's mostly useful on heavy farm junglers who want to chill in the jungle for a long time in between recalls. Even then it's not amazing, just viable.\n\nI don't feel like allowing people to get the spellvamp/lifesteal AND offensive masteries at the same time is a good idea, though. Most likely the sustain would either be strong enough to be relevant, in which case you'd HAVE to take it, or it wouldn't be that powerful and would remain uncommon. There are a lot of sustain masteries out there already, though, so I'm not sure that just making it into another sustain mastery would be ideal, either. \n\nAt the moment, supports tend to take 17 points into utility without very much variation in what they take high in the tree. The first 8 points in the tree are pretty variable, but in tiers 3, 4, and 5, they'll grab Greed, Culinary Master, Scavenger, Wealth, and Bandit every time. That will leave you with 2 points to allocate somewhere. Ideally, I think it would be nice if supports had a choice Inspiration, Meditation, and Vampirism. If those three were changed to be balanced with each other- and I'm not sure how you'd do that- and each had a cap of 2 points, you'd essentially have to choose between them. Meditation would help you poke more if mana gated you, Vampirism would help you trade more, and Inspiration would help you keep up in levels if you roam more.\n\nBoth Vampirism and Inspiration feel pretty weak- but more so Inspiration. As it stands, it would take 5 minutes of standing next to a higher level champion to get from level 1 to level 2. That doesn't sound that bad, but it would take over 30 minutes to level from level 17 to 18 from this mastery. It just doesn't do very much. Even for 2 points, that's not worth it.

On which champions? And does your final mastery split usually send you to at least 21 points in Utility? Or just far enough to get these?\n\nThe only setup I regularly use (that doesn't go 21 deep in anything) is my 15/0/15 page just for Syndra. 15 in offense is just enough to get the +%ap mastery, and the 15 in utility for %missing mana regen. Although, I only take 2 points in vampirism since I like the health biscuit mastery. :3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-08-12T15:35:13.681+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it were a one-point wonder it would make an interesting choice for players.\n\nExtra bulk from Defense or better sustain from Utility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-08-12T18:04:20.376+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It really should be added to the defense tree as two separate talents in tier 2 and 3 as an alternative choice to HP and %hp.  3 points in tier 2 for 3% vamp and 1 point in tier 3 for an additional 2% vamp.\n\nThe problem is that % vamp is just not as good at sustain as the potion/biscuit utility talents in early game.\n\n**EDIT:** I just did the math on the potion/biscuit sustain versus 3% steal/vamp. Each potion returns +35hp. Most midlaners start 2 potions for a total +70 hp in lane. You would have to deal **2333** damage (after resistances) to match the sustain. \n\nHowever, the steal/vamp is actually more effective in short windows when you're in duels or skirmishes. You only have to do 100 dps to match the healing per second from a ticking biscuit, and a duel to the death will require far more dps than that even at early levels.\n\nIn other words, 3% is better when it counts and scales far better into mid and late game. It's more for in-fight sustain than early laning.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimaropa","date":"2015-08-12T21:37:37.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support, utility should have at least some good stuff that worth putting points into.
