Each account is given a period of time where their summoner name is protected from cleanup, but this time period depends on the summoner level of the account. An account under level 5 is granted **6 months** of protection, after which the summoner name is up for grabs for any player that spend the RP to purchase the name.\n\nI hope this cleared up the confusion, please let me know if you have any questions that aren't answered after browsing through our [**Summoner Name Cleanup FAQ.**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-)","replies":[]}]}
