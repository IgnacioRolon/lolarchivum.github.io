The icon shows up that it is trying to open it. Nothing happens for a while.  I will check on it in task manager and it says league is not responding.  So I force quit it, then try to open it again from a different spot (finder folders).  Sometimes it will open from going to a different location but others it doesn't.  If it doesn't open then, then I have to restart my computer.  Generally if I restart my computer it works.  I shouldn't have to restart my computer every time I want to play league? Help?\r\n\r\nThis is for a mac by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-03T22:29:38.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may need to adjust some of those Mac admin permissions to make sure League to able to access it's game files properly.
