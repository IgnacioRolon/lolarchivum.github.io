So I had the motivation to go for silver (I had no runes rofl). Anyways, a few days later I dropped down to bronze 5....I was stuck in bronze 4 and 5 for months because I was that stupid and bad. End of season 3 was almost here, played ranked as usual, this time i was actually climbing. Get to bronze 1 (less than a month left before season ended). LP gains were like 7 per game....it was frustrating. Clamping too OP. Evantually jumped to s5 promos, I won my s5 promos in the last game due to a Poppy carrying me. I ended at silver 4 that season\r\n\r\nSeason 4, I started off at silver 4 after going 8-2 in placements. Didn't drop to s5 once (not that I recall). Climb from s4 to s1 and drop from s1 to s3 or s4 like 12 times. After the 13th time or so, I make it to gold promos. Won the promos in one try and it took me exactly 1000 games. Now I am sitting at G4 promos","replies":[]}
