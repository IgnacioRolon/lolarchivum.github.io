I am here to ask about information with regards to creating a support ticket to dispute a wrongful 2 week banning of my account. Ive been around since season 1 and have never once been suspended or banned. \r\n\r\nCan a moderator or admin from the tribunal take a look at the replay of my last game and see that the rest of my team was intentionally trolling me? The 2 week ban really isnt that big of a deal but come on.. seems kinda heavy handed to me, especially considering this is based off of one bad game out of thousands played with a completely clean record of conduct.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m 99% sure this post will amount to nothing but I know I&#039;m innocent so I thought I may as well give it a shot, any help guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-06T04:57:34.777+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were given a 2 week ban right off the bat, it's likely because you used some form of hate speech or told someone to harm themselves/others. If you'd post your chat logs given in your reform card, we can help you identify what portion of your chat got you punished.\n\n----\nEdit: as others pointed out, if your van was for intentional feeding and you intentionally fed, it is unlikely to be removed.\n\n----\nEdit again, cause I was curious after seeing you complain about your teammates.\n\nGiven that your teammates do *all* appear to have been at best not trying, and at worst trolling the **entire** game, it's *possible* you get a pass on this time. I'd recommend submitting a support ticket and politely explaining that your entire team was doing similarly and while they didn't feed kills they intentionally threw the game and trolled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreampEye","date":"2017-11-06T05:00:26.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2017-11-06T13:52:47.903+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"looking for validation again i see...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-11-06T07:08:30.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chat logs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-11-06T05:04:18.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just send in the ticket. \nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nYou did something to get 14 day suspension.
