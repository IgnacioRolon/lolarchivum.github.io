It stopped opening so I decided to uninstall it and reinstall it but It popped up as the legacy client. How do I install the alpha beta client? I press on the upgrade now tab on the legacy client but all it shows is a youtube video? Can someone guide me to on how to redownload the Alpha Beta Client?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T23:27:47.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you install the Beta Client is to hit that upgrade button. You may need to delete the **LeagueClient.exe** file inside your installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) then launch your League Client again from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file to try the upgrade again. You may need to try this a few times before it works.\n\nLet me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Zlax","date":"2017-05-22T18:13:03.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot it helped me really i wasnt able to start client for weeks thank you a lot :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scruff10","date":"2017-04-23T06:30:46.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"league will not launch after last upgrade, so how do I upgrade?","replies":[]}]}
