Then I got a little pop up saying that I cannot connect to servers, please check internet connection and try again (something very close to that). I have restarted my internet and even my computer and nothing is letting me get back into my match. I really don't want to lose LP or get a leaver buster because of this. RIOT please help me out on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T18:20:02.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may have been some hiccups with the current maintenance per the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.
