I love his W and the brittle ability. It feels so good to melt people down and then pop them.\nOrnn is a slow tank. I feel like it's hard for him to finish off fights mainly due to his low movement speed and long cool down. Champion with high mobility will run away fast. \n\nOrnn is a very team dependent champion. If your teammate sucks at communicating it's harder for Ornn to do anything about it. Maybe this is due to my rank as a silver. Not many people are good at communication at this rank I think. I think I should switch to a more meta champion grind to a high level then use Ornn.\n\nIf I'm not playing top because I can't help my team, I play the support role because supporting ADC is a crucial for winning a game. I'm a bit iffy when I'm playing top when the bot lane is doing bad. I fear all my effort in winning top is wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-10-20T20:16:31.257+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is not about meta if ur in silver, but it is true that ornn is not really a good champion for climbing.\nImo just play aggresive split push fiora, that champion is completely busted and u win almost all lanes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Slaiyer","date":"2019-10-20T22:52:27.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"he was so fun when he had that little shield on the fire breath attack","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2019-10-20T21:53:25.413+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the issue with Ornn is that he is a bit clunky.  If your opponent is mobile in particular he can flounder to try to hit his Q and E.\n\nTrying to chase an Ekko or someone with multiple dashes with Ornn is just asking for a headache.  They dash over your Q and then run away while you're still trying to connect with E.\n\nHe can jungle okay, but he overlaps so much with other champions who do the same job there's no reason to pick him.  However, he has a fun kit and is visually really cool.  The storm skin IMO looks pretty awesome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BÃ¢rd","date":"2019-10-21T02:57:51.254+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just revert his W to its release version, with it giving both a shield *and* unstoppable, but having lower damage and a smaller AOE.\n\nOrnn was a decent champion ruined by Riots propensity to overbuff new champions and reluctance to go back on changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hiyares","date":"2019-10-20T21:59:01.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem that i have found as a tank main in lower elo is that you are stuck relying on your team to do damage and make plays happen. yeah as a tank you can initiate but it wont do anything if your team is never with you or afraid to go in. You need to keep in mind every game s with random people so everyone has their own style and mind set as to how they want to play the game. ornn is honestly fucking annoying to deal with as anyone with how he works he just punishes melee champs in the top lane but in terms of team fighting on low elo its again you just are way too reliant as a tank on everyone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seraphim117","date":"2019-10-20T21:38:35.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly he is extremely underated because his kit is wierd, but he can solo carry games. if the enemy steps to a wall you can r-> e->q-> w ->auto the carry and you will just about annihlate the entire enemy team single handedly. I do it near baron pit a lot and it is so fun to just be chilling and then boom quadra kill. hes a really great champ, wins matchups entirely because people do not know how to fight him, and scales extremely well. as for team, it is ideal to have a competent team, but if one person on your team has a brain its usally enough for the win. Also you can get some ad on him and blow peoples minds with your dmg, so do not discount that lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nithke","date":"2019-10-20T20:45:38.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem with Camille, I love the champ but her tools needs a good jungler and a good team, having one of those is already rare","replies":[{"poster":"Smilemoreee","date":"2019-10-23T10:15:59.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels bad after spending so much energy to win lane but loses in a team fight because of other players.

In solo queue, it's easier to affect the outcome of the game as a midlaner since you're closer to bot lane, drag, etc. and can be a part of more plays. With Ornn mid you'll likely face some less favorable matchups, but I think in many situations it would work! :)","replies":[]}]}
