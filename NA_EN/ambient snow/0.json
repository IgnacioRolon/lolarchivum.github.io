My Reason for this is, i want to know what is reportable and seen in riots eyes as being Toxic to others and players around you Cause recently it seems the people who are reporting the  so called &quot; Negative attitude players&quot; in many cases are usually more toxic then those players they report. \r\n\r\nmy example for this was a previous game, ganted i was negative. ( my team was making a bunch of fundamental mistakes, IE Chasing the enemy constantly through their jungle and getting killed over and again. \r\n\r\nNever did i curse or scream or be little my team members. \r\n How ever the person Demand i get reported the morg, was the opposite, Constantly belittling , and raging. \r\n\r\nmy example here is, what is the definition of a Toxic player? is it Simple frustration now that we label as toxic?  Or is it a defined instance that is beyond frustration?\r\n\r\nAnd why do most people seem to not see that Players, especially in ranked Can get Frustrated with the strangers they play with?\r\n\r\nI can understand Cursing screaming, Belittling, and what not as toxic Behavior. \r\n\r\nbut saying &quot;GG enjoy your win&quot; , &quot;Yup i&#039;m done&quot;. or even &quot; at some point you guys will learn to stop chasing&quot;\r\ni can see that as negative, but i don&#039;t see how that warrants a Report.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkPh0enix","date":"2017-02-19T09:58:10.922+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think of it like this:\n\nIf you played soccer but instead of friends your team was made up of strangers, would you go and ask them \"why?\" (the equivalent of a ? ping) every time they fucked ? Would you call them \"useless trash\" if they werent up to par? Would you tell them to kill themselves if they fucked up real bad? If they were harrassing you and you knew there were penalties for talking back, would you respond or talk to the referee who is there to help players for assistance?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-02-19T06:06:17.261+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my understanding its basically anything negative especially a negative impact on the game. So to a point claiming the game is over and that you are done implies that you wish to no longer play, no longer want to try and win and is usually an indicator that you will afk. Hence it making a negative impact on the game because you are no longer wishing to play. \n\nAsking for reports has always be a punishable offense. Mainly because it doesnt help. you are only saying it to basically bring more fuel to the fire. It would be the same thing as if you saw a crime. common sense tells you to call the cops. But in this case you are calling the cops numerous times as well as telling other people to call the cops. You only need to do it once, calling them over and over or having other people isnt going to make the cops come quicker. Its the same thing here. If you are going to report people just do it, you dont need to tell them you are, nor do you need other people to report them. One report is needed to get a review, more isnt going to make them get punished faster. You should be reporting people who you see as breaking the rules, not because someone told you to report them!\n\nAll in all just use common sense to what you think is acceptable. If you wouldnt say it in real life, you shouldnt say it online.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reign L9","date":"2017-02-19T06:15:33.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe what you're looking for is the [Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/).","replies":[{"poster":"Ambient Snow","date":"2017-02-19T06:30:58.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know what the summoners code is.  Been playing this game for 7 years and that's why i don't curse in this game.   But how people define the meaning of the summers code is what i was asking.  \n\nlike at what point or to what point are people allowed to just get frustrated and vent a little and at what point does venting, Become Toxicity? \n\nThat's my question\n\nI'm not saying Every ones perfect i know i'm not and i know i can get frustrated at times and say ugh \"GG grats on your win, or Yup i'm done\",  or even make a informative comment on bad choices like.  \" Can we please stop Chasing!\"\n\nBut at what point does it become a punishable offense for just being frustrated.  For me i define it as. \n\nThe moment you start cursing, belittling or even being in reasonable to other players, then i see that as the part of being Toxic or deserving a report. \n\nbut is my definition wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-19T16:01:29.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any form of being negative is considered toxic according to Riot.

What rito is too stupid to understand is raging is part of hardcore gaming, always has been, always will be. It's a fundamental component to playing that hard. Their stupidity was in making a ban system for chat at all, they have a mute button and that's enough. The only thing they've done with banning players who rage when their teammates act like assholes is encourage people to never want to spend a dime on this game again.","replies":[]}]}
