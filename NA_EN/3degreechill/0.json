Riot hasn't made alot of insectoid/arachnid archtypes yet. Only 3 I believe: Elise,Kha,Skarner, the latter one lost his insectoid feel to him so he doesn't really count. \r\n\r\nOpheilia is a humanoid/insectoid mage with a staff that looks intimidating. Opheilia is cross between a Dot mage and an assassin, like Malz and Leblanc. She relies on getting in to teamfights, \"stinging\" someone, getting out, and letting her Dot skills do their work. \r\n\r\nNote: Her dots are different and can stack.\r\n\r\nPassive: Swarm: The more allied champions around Opheilia cause Opheilia to gain bonus AP and Movement Speed. \r\n\r\nQ: Injection: Opheilia's main source of damage. Opheilia summons a wasp of her own to  dash to her target and inject the target with a toxic venom. Initial damage and Dot. Skillshot. If this is the first spell on to the target, it deals more damage. Medium range.\r\n\r\nW: Nerotoxin: Opheilia fires her stinger at target applying a dot that slows that increases with time(Like Nasus' wither). If this is the first spell on the target, it slows more. \r\n\r\nE: Hive: Opheilia summons an hive at a location. The Hive has Base HP+ AP Scaling. The hive sends out 2 swarms of bees, one attacking the closest target(Dot)and the other going to Opheilia and increasing her armor, magic resist, and movement speed for a period of time. Destroying the Hive casues the Dot and the increased resistances to disappear. If there no enemies nearby, both swarms go to Opheilia and doubles the effects.  \r\n\r\nR: Final Sting: Opheilia creates a stinger from her staff and shoots it at an enemy. Does more damage depending on how many Dots is on the enemy. Adds a Dot. \r\n\r\nHer Q and W have additional effects depending on which spell she uses first so that Opheilia players can have more versatility when comboing their spells. This way, shes not a binary QWER champion. She has paths depending on the circumstances. Opheilia is supposed to be a long range mage, but to do the most damage, you'll have to be in close.","replies":[{"poster":"Leroyswish","date":"2014-06-19T23:19:50.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the concept is neat. I really like Elise and Kha'Zix is badass. However, I'm a bit confused about the actual abilities. Like...\n\n*Which Damage-over-Time do the abilities inflict? Deadly venom? Bleeding?*\n\nI think that's it's important to specify. Also, I had a further question. All of the abilities have a unique feature if \"this is the first spell on the target.\" What exactly does that mean? The first spell to damage them in the game? The first of Opheilia's spells to strike that specific target?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Girl","date":"2014-06-20T18:33:51.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 - I really like this too and am interested in better {{summoner:13}} on the \"first spell\" business as well. This is such a cool concept!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-16T10:05:10.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ophelia its a better name IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2014-06-21T19:47:43.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, but there are two main problems I have with it.\n\nA) Though her design is unique, her kit isn't. Spamming DoTs is very similar to Cassieopeia, and while you certainly have not copied Cassie's kit, this playstyle, combined with the various free stats and utility you have, would completely edge Cassieopeia herself out of her high sustained damage niche that is already almost gone because of burst/assassin metas.\n\nB) She's a queen bee style champion, right? I like the idea, but why does she have to be humanoid? We already have plenty of \"almost monstrous but we have to make sure there's room for fanservice\" female champs, why not just let Ophelia be an actual giant killer bee?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arctic Wolf","date":"2014-06-20T21:00:41.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea, but I think you'd need to rename your W; Elise's Q (human form) is already \"Neurotoxin\" and I don't think Riot likes multiple abilities with the same name for clarity's sake. Otherwise, they really missed an opportunity to rename Trundle's Q from Chomp to \"Frostbite\" when they moved him to the Freljord, but I think they didn't because \"Frostbite\" is already Anivia's E. That aside, this sounds like it'd be a really fun champ!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2014-06-20T20:45:10.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The concept is good but the passive has a BIG problem.\n\nIt's completely useless in laning phase because:\n\n* She's alone in lane/jungle (neither ADC nor Support)\n* The passive won't apply if the jungle comes from too far (trying to catch in a pincer)\n* A careful opponent can tell when you're going to gank by looking at your AP or movement speed. (except if you are the jungler himself)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BodyByDave","date":"2014-06-20T18:55:17.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting concept, some ranges may help clarify your intent though.\n\nI worry she might get stuck on her turret too much as an AP mid, maybe her Q could change slightly?\n\nQ: Opheilia tosses a wasp at her enemy (skill shot line). This ability deals damage around the target and affects the target hit with venom.\n\nYour E seems cool, kind of confusing though, I considered toying with it into a proliferate ability that would buff the player's move speed a bit and spread the swarm in an area around the target you cast it on (spreading the snare and dots), but it might be a little too strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Girl","date":"2014-06-20T18:27:34.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would totally play cause 1) i love the name, 2) i love the sting and 3) i love the passive!!! \n\nWhy did you decide to call her Ophelia?\n\nVery fun!<3","replies":[]}]}
