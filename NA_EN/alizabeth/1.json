For starters can you tell me when the black screen popped up; had the game been going on for a couple minutes or did it come up when you went into Loading screen? Were there any error message pop ups as well like 'LoL is not responding' or a bugsplat notification?\n\nThe more details you give me the better I can try to zero in on a cause. I'd also suggest staying clear of queuing up for matchmaking until we find the cause. Don't want more games where a black screen interrupts you! ;_;","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alizabeth","date":"2017-09-15T00:56:00.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and the game is done. whelp.","replies":[]}]}
