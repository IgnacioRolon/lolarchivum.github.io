To follow up, we've got a fix in for this that should be hitting PBE today. The overlay wasn't appearing when you loaded in on Chaos, but was working a-okay when you loaded in on the Order side of the map. If all goes well, we'll have a fix ready for 8.7. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2018-03-20T17:52:51.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the follow up :) Will have a designer look at this and try to get the fix in quickly!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2018-03-19T23:06:39.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Homie!\n\nWhat VFX are taking a look at it and I do not see what's missing.

When Rengar uses R the blue-ish \"dimming\" effect, like in Skin Spotlights, is absent. The screen does not change shading at all. The bug didn't happen when I tried to recreate it in practice tool but in my last game it was apparent.","replies":[]}]}
