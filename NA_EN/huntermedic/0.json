You must not have been put in any of the Tiers of toxicity for 6 months, 2.) You must have played the game for at least 1 year, 3.) Riot must approve your request after 3 \"test\" games. (They show you 3 examples and you answer). Of course it's still easy for a troll to abuse the system, but it would be a lot more effort for them.","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2017-04-18T07:18:00.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pouting,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Eaxh2Aw4,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-04-18T03:34:43.419+0000)\n>\n> There should be very specific requirements to lower the amount of trolls. 1.)
