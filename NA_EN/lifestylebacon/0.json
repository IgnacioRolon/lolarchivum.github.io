I got fking grouped on just cause they were 4 people queue and they fking trolled the game and inting like fk to the pOINT WHERE WE LOST THE GAME IN FKING 14 MINUTES with the enemy team having more than 42 kills...WTF...who wouldnt get angry over this, no fking normal person, dont even tell me to stay quiet and do nothing in these situations cuase u dont stay fking calm cause i felt like i deserve justice and i realized that so i stopped toxic and just said i would report my team...and i get banned wow....if i got banned for this i except the other 4 to get banned....wtf and they enemy team also reported me cause my fking team asked for reports all cause I GOT ADC FIRST AND THEY DIDNT...BOOO WHOO SUCKS TO SUCK. I deserve justice maybye a 5 min game restriction for the toxicity...not a fkign permenant ban for my team bing DICKS and tilting me...NO FKING IDIOT WOULD REMAIN CALM AND ignore when all 9 players decide to pick on you..I WANT JUSTICE, if i got permentant banned i want all those other players to get permenant banned or my ban lifted, cause this aint fair at all. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT ASKING FOR REPORTS IS not allowed so permentant ban my whole team for that IMMEDIETLY.
