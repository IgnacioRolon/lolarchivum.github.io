We had a fair battle of 1v1 till Camille came top soaked 3 waves of exp and then dived me solo under tower when I was full hp. I tried to persuade Wukong to int because of what she did and it worked, the enemy adc got mad at what I wrote and reported me. Surprisingly it got me banned. I&#039;ve never once in my life int&#039;d (have more than 15 deaths) on my account neither did I directly addressed the enemy adc. I&#039;ve talked with Riot Support and all they&#039;ve been doing is saying you&#039;ve caused a negative experience to the players. I&#039;ve never once flamed anyone nor did I directly shit talk anyone. Last time I accepted ToS it wasn&#039;t written that telling your enemy to afk is bannable\r\n\r\nthis is the chat logs, I didn&#039;t change anything\r\n\r\n\r\nSunKenDraven: cme this way \r\nSunKenDraven: k il b \r\nSunKenDraven: bk return to lane \r\nSunKenDraven: vel koz \r\nSunKenDraven: cmille top \r\nSunKenDraven: wtf is camille doing soaking xp \r\nSunKenDraven: lol thats a douche bag move by camille to come and soak 3 wave of exp \r\nSunKenDraven: get mejai \r\nSunKenDraven: dont afk ur gonna get leaverbuster but u can int since riot doesnt do much to inters \r\nSunKenDraven: cuz its from experience \r\nSunKenDraven: dont say in chat u will int \r\nSunKenDraven: just mute every one and int \r\nSunKenDraven: cuz riot will ban u if u int and say it in chat u will int \r\nSunKenDraven: last acc got perma banned like that \r\nSunKenDraven: fk off i int when those jgler come to my lane and stealing xp \r\nSunKenDraven: those %%%%s need to learn their lessons \r\nSunKenDraven: nah dude only ppl ur ruining the game is for 3 ppl \r\nSunKenDraven: lol no if u dont play u will get leaver buster \r\nSunKenDraven: its better to just end the game fast and int \r\nSunKenDraven: and mute all \r\nSunKenDraven: yo wu if u ever said ur inting in chat just say im having a bad game sry guys \r\nSunKenDraven: and riot will think ur having a bad game \r\nSunKenDraven: nah dude","replies":[]}
