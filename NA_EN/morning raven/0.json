Right now for Teemoween, we have access to our personal shop thing (which I always love the look of). I can&#039;t find it on the new client to even know where it might go - let alone work. So if i want to check my personalized sales, I need to use the legacy one. Am i just missing it? and if not, why would it not be there during the store event?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-22T22:49:25.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to use the legacy client, it is not available in the alpha, sorry for the let down :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Datazzthough","date":"2016-10-22T13:08:53.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i looked everywhere for it.

I just went into legacy to check it out. Other things to go into legacy for: DoomBots.
