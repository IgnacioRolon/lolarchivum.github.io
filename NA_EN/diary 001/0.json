Didn't AFK in either of these games.\n\ncontext of game 1: I create a level 30 alternate account to learn new champions in a ranked setting. This particular game, I choose Renekton. As the lane starts, I realize I made critical mistakes in my rune choices and summoner spells, and I tell my teammates I'm done trying. \n\nI'm still farming, I'm not inting, and I still participate in ganks, but I don't bother looking at the map or bother doing objectives. I just sit top all game and wait for the game to end. The game ends and my stats are 7.1 cs, 1/4/1, and 'average' damage. I'm not using derogatory language, and I'm not even being hostile towards my teammates. No spam pings. However the same teammates that triggered my banned were literally telling me to 'shut the fuck up' and calling me 'fucking r%%%%%ed'.

She sits in brush for literally 2-3 minutes waiting for Teemo to overextend. She ends up dying and as a result I'm two levels down. As Renekton.

If someone dies every couple minutes but it's because they got camped while trying their best to be useful to the team and try to win, they don't get banned. If you sit top, right-click the lane, and announce that you're just waiting for your team to lose, you get banned.\n\nYou weren't giving any percent. You flat-out said that you picked the wrong runes, a loss was therefore inevitable, and you weren't going to even try. It is possible, of course, that some people do this and don't admit it in chat, but that's just because they have an ounce of sense if not courtesy.\n\nYou spend the entire time arguing. If you think everyone argues all the time, it's probably because you only see games in which you are a participant, and you're a catalyst for negativity. That's the definition of a toxic player.\n\nGetting more than one report makes no difference.

Any time anyone provides you with information or an explanation of why you are banned, you just deny and counter and demand better explanations. You say that you can give up and not get banned when you literally tried that and are now banned. \"Giving up\" is a verbatim reason for reporting when filling out a report after a match.\n\nThe point of a PB thread isn't to convince you that the rules are perfect and enforced perfectly. The point is to provide you with an explanation of how you broke the rules so that you can avoid doing so in the future. If you're not interested in that, there's no purpose in giving you any attention.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-09-07T11:57:41.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=diary 001,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fmW2xRA6,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-07T04:46:41.625+0000)\n>\n> Looks like you think just because the masses agree with you, you must be right.
