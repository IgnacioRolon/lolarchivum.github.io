I started playing again because i was able to build a better computer, and all ive been trying to do is get better at the game. Everyone has encountered players who simply are unkind people, or who are just having a bad day, simply understandable. but its more than that. so much more. it seems like every game i get into, someone has to flame or trash talk, you say one word in all chat, for example &quot;blitz op&quot; (which in this case did happen) and nothing but targeted remarks about how &quot;ur just trash:&quot; or &quot;ur just bronze&quot; are returned. its not just one time, its back to back to back to back games, where anything is said. and all you get in return is hate, nothing but hate, its actually depressing, it sounds so wimpy, but if im being totally honest, it sometimes makes my eyes water. its pulling my faith in people away from me.\nI recently got a chat ban, the reason was fair enough, somewhat unnecessary but its whatever, i played the matches. the reason i was chat banned was for getting into a heated arguement with the fiora support with smite, and the adc jhin. in the beggining of the game jhin didnt leash, and fiora only used her parrry to dmg red buff, guess she was messing with me, later in the game my score took a deep hit, and the arguement sprung up, starting from the fiora posting my score in all chat and joking about how bad i was. after that game i was chat banned. my honor level i was working hard on, droppepd and locked to lvl one. the most form of toxicity in chat. is when people spam your score without thinking about or knowing about how your actually contributing. and everyone mocks you. The bottom reason im making this post and the thing your waiting to hear is, i know im getting either chat banned again. or suspended. i just finished a game, in which i had an ahri support. its normals, so i pay no mind to it. but every single time i would do something. whether it be miss an ult, or flash and heal when only one was necessary. i would get spammed with enemy missing pings, every time i did something that ahri didnt approve of. later malphite joined in too. at this point id had enough of it. i very aggressively asked them both to stop, in which they responded by asking the enemy team to report me. really? this is what people can be like? i get yelled at and spammed with pings every single time i did something they didnt approve of, and now they are trying to incentivize the enemy team to report me? as i started to play the game again, now more aged and mature i noticed how people can act when they dont have any immediate consequences, people will find some fault in you and blame all of their problems on you for it.\nproblem is, i know im getting penalized some way. why? probably those two swear words i added in when i asked them to stop. go figure. i know how the system works, i know its coming soon. the worst kind of flaming is when someones posting your score and joking about it. do you think i wanted to do bad? oh you do? that makes me feel even worse thanks. every game this happens. this post is way too long, and terrible worded and written. and will never get any traction. but this is me speaking my mind one hundred percent. im not as thick skinned as others, i take criticism very harshly and try to improve with it. but toxicity and hurtful words dont help. but im posting because i know im not the only one. ive reported many people and gotten loads of instant feedback reports. but the hurtful words just keep coming. and yes i know mean comments are inevitable\nUpdate, ive read your comments and im sorry for the terribly spaced out and written text, but i have in fact have been chat suspended, here is the chat logs\nGame 1\nAltDonovan: that b u t t\nAltDonovan: mehhhhh\nAltDonovan: kills worth nothing\nAltDonovan: lol\nAltDonovan: dont even\nAltDonovan: d o n t e v e n\nAltDonovan: wtf\nAltDonovan: ???????????\nAltDonovan: just fkn letting him know\nAltDonovan: can you\nAltDonovan: C A L M T H E F U C K\nAltDonovan: down\nAltDonovan: 200\nAltDonovan: free drake\nAltDonovan: they all left\nAltDonovan: it was me vs irelia\nAltDonovan: both low health\nAltDonovan: ffs\nAltDonovan: wtf\nAltDonovan: seanbk\nAltDonovan: PK[ Vrgenkl\nAltDonovan: nhp{klD HRFS\nAltDonovan: l RNWEGH[\nAltDonovan: kl:RE Hn\nAltDonovan: pk< REWS\nAltDonovan: R;Lk\\\nAltDonovan: ahri stfu\nAltDonovan: honestly\nAltDonovan: all you do is talk shit\nAltDonovan: can you just shut up\nAltDonovan: it WAS a free drake\nAltDonovan: but everyone chased down rakan and died\nAltDonovan: stop fkn questioning me\nAltDonovan: there goes ahri again\nAltDonovan: questioning everything i do\nAltDonovan: and blowing up chat like a hypocrite\nAltDonovan: wtf is wrong with\nAltDonovan: you\nAltDonovan: seriously\nAltDonovan: you dont even know what happened ahri\nAltDonovan: u stfu\nAltDonovan: i ping once because enemies are moving out of sight while your doing rift\nAltDonovan: and you all fkning blow me up\nAltDonovan: im not gonna keep explaining to you why your stupid ahri\nAltDonovan: your so fkn tilting honestly\nAltDonovan: ur dumb\nAltDonovan: i ulted before he died\nAltDonovan: hoping to save ur sorry ass\nAltDonovan: but veigar kiulled him\nAltDonovan: so\nAltDonovan: can\nAltDonovan: you\nAltDonovan: please\nAltDonovan: hut\nAltDonovan: the\nAltDonovan: fuck\nAltDonovan: up\nAltDonovan: and\nAltDonovan: \\knock\nAltDonovan: it\nAltDonovan: the\nAltDonovan: fuck\nAltDonovan: out\nAltDonovan: piok nAwesd\nAltDonovan: AFETKPGN\nAltDonovan: BKP;ASEDr NSEDKLGP\nAltDonovan: k:pl ASGD\nAltDonovan: pl sgdn\nAltDonovan: klpS gre\nAltDonovan: your the ones pinging me every five fkn second\nAltDonovan: s\nAltDonovan: you have the issue\nAltDonovan: wtf are you serious\nAltDonovan: my team has been pinging me every single god damn time i do anything\nAltDonovan: srsly\nAltDonovan: im reporting all of thenm\nAltDonovan: expect renekton maybe\nAltDonovan: they ping and question me every fkn step that i take\nAltDonovan: i cant do anything\nAltDonovan: and now their askiung you to report me?\nAltDonovan: this fkn game is so tilting\nAltDonovan: LOl\nAltDonovan: u are too\nAltDonovan: had to type in all\nAltDonovan: teamates trying to report me for something theyre doing\nAltDonovan: ??????????????????????????????????????????\nAltDonovan: ?\nAltDonovan: reported\nAltDonovan: nobody could possibly play this game with all of you breathing down someones neck\nAltDonovan: STFU\nAltDonovan: WHY ARE YOU PPINGING ME\nAltDonovan: FUCK OFF\nAltDonovan: ITS WON\nAltDonovan: ITS\nAltDonovan: WON\nAltDonovan: team doesnt know what pushing lanes is\nAltDonovan: yells at me\nAltDonovan: fkn logic\nAltDonovan: gg\nAltDonovan: ffs\nAltDonovan: gg\n is this worth a penalty?

I totally saw it coming when the internet started getting big. It was no surprise that people acted like assholes to eachother. At the time, it didn't depress me, because I knew that people would act that way when not face to face. But now I'm seeing it bleed into society's day to day life with social media obsessions. \n\nNowadays, it's ALL ABOUT other people's opinions on shit and what everyone thinks of everything. It's sickening. Let's go to Twitter and see what my fav celeb thinks of this topic, because I've lost my ability to think for myself!!! (Probably never had it, if you grew up on the internet). \n\nSo yeah, I feel ya, it is depressing how people act towards eachother. But for me, it has nothing to do with how people act towards eachother in league, because that's sort of to be expected from children with anonymity. Some adults too. They just get a kick out of it. It's the social media that makes me worry and is depressing.\n\nAs to your chat, yeah you just seem to take things too personally. They're gonna do that to anyone, it has nothing to do with you personally. Gotta learn to mute people like that. Subjecting yourself to that abuse isn't healthy when you are sensitive. Start utilizing the mute button, and stop arguing with idiots.
