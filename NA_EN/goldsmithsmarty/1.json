More and faster games. \r\n\r\nMost important, it's a 4 man decision. Bad. Lets make it 3 man instead. Or pick a captain in the beginning and let it be his call.\r\n\r\nRiot gives and advice in their Tip Of the Day section. Something of sort \"Every game is winnable, try your best, don't give up\"\r\n\r\nBut why listen to Riot, why listen to professional players?\r\n\r\nAll inhibitors are up? Turrets are up too? Good. Perfect time to surrender without a single teamfight, right after laning phase.   \r\n\r\nHow dare you waste other people's time? You toxic waste. Don't you know that you either completely dominate your opponents or surrender so you don't get dominated. \r\n \r\nI, for one, love to win against less experienced players who can't really oppose me and I will brag about my 25/0 score. Hard game? Screw it, I'm not going to waste may time trying my best. My dick is too small for that.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nRight when I started to play league some good eight years ago, I always been frustrated with this 4 man surrender bullshit. Why does the game have to be so toxic inherently. Why can't we just stick to the good old system of \"-ff\" from every teammate. What is this argument \"I don't want to waste time\"\r\nLike playing lol isn't a waste of time.\r\nI like easy wins when I try to climb in ranked, but  I hate easy wins when I play normal games.\r\nWhy would you surrender in ranked when you have a tangible resource to lose?\r\nWhy would you surrender in Normal when the whole point of normal game is to have fun playing? Come backs are always fun.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-03-29T23:16:18.031+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quality shitpost, whoosh all the fools.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-03-30T11:27:46.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is something better called a remake. only 2 people need to say yes to ff and it triggers at 3 minute mark.\n\njoke aside this is a very shitty idea. i've seen people say ff at 10 minute but you sir earned earliest ff badge at 3 minutes.
