Because every game I use words like -removed by moderation- or f.u.c.k as the part of my speech. System picks it up automatically and when they report me I will always get a ban, since I just use these words all the time.\n\nOh, and they gave the chat for second game where I said only 2 swear words over the entire 40 min game. Ass-hole and a bitch. Both used neutrally. Not to insult. As if any of these may insult anyone anyway. Why team reported me? I honestly don't know. They were mental. I played top Urgot doing Ok, nothing special. In the middle of the game they started flaming me. Saying I'm down minions, I build wrong items (items were ok, tanky) and so on. I didn't feed nor did I say anything bad to anyone, as usual. It is so unfair that I get reported for a game where I did nothing wrong and I get suspended cause I called enemy Illaoi a \"broken bitch\", as a character of course, in my own chat.\n\nOther game chat is from when A guy was rude to me after I reminded him to release a Herald in the mid lane. He said \"STFU I know how to play\"\nI got angry and asked him what is the deal, and he insulted me further. I only once called him -removed by moderation- We won the game and didn't really argue anymore that much. I didn't even think he would report me but people abuse this system.\n\nI was in the middle of champion selection and the game kicked me out now saying that I'm banned now.\n\n14 days. Nice treatment of players. I climbed to silver 4 and almost had my promos for silver 3. Just because some trolls and assholes intentionally insult you and report you after you call them something classic. \n\nNot only most of the community is toxic, you punish players who try to keep team together, try to make it enjoyable even if we lose. Good job Riot, \nAfter 14 days, I don't think I will come back. I will probably find some other time sink.\n\nI've been here since late 2010 if I remember correctly. Back then, riot cared about community. Now they don't give a shit.\n\nIf someone knows a way to appeal this ban, please tell me. I can't submit a ticket, site just doesn't work for me.

Seems lot easier. Calling teammates c**t doesn't seem like you are \"trying to keep the team together\" or \"trying to make the game enjoyable even if we lose\". \n\nRiot does care about the community still and is trying to improve it. In your case it simply seems to be improvement through punishment and eventual removal. \n\nThere is no need to type out negative words to your teammates/game. It does nothing positive for them and in fact causes a more negative atmosphere in the game. If you need to say something, say it in your head or out loud. If this is your 14-day ban I'm guessing you have heard this all before and been warned before but there you go. \n\nJust behave with two of the rules in mind  you should have learned as a child:\n\n1. If you have nothing nice to say, don't say it.\n2. Treat others how you want to be treated.\n\n\nEven if you view the language you are using as acceptable because it is part of your normal vocabulary, it doesn't mean others view it that way. The words and tone you seem to use are certainly not positive and should not be in the game. This is a video game, people come here for enjoyment and the words you are using are not conducive to that part of environment. If you are only getting banned for chat and not behavior, it seems like a fairly easy fix.

I don't remember reporting anyone starting league. \n\nInteresting fact, I often times report people in league now for bad attitude or offensive language (I don't mean just swear words) but I've been playing Dota 2 since it's closed beta days and I never report people there, only for rage quitting the game maybe, if that.\n\nRiot incentivizes toxicity in people. I have 2 posts about this issue, but I don't know how to find them on this forum.\n\nAlso, I don't think I have ever used the word \"feeder\" in my entire life playing lol or dota. Bad skill or bad game is nothing for me.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-04-23T01:09:06.575+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldsmithSmarty,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WhTaMnFt,comment-id=00020000000100000001,timestamp=2019-04-23T00:46:59.531+0000)\n>\n> I only got 2 chat restrictions in a span of 2 moths' maybe.
