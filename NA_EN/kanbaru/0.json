However this is the second time it has happened and when I tried to reinstall it again it gives me the same error after installing the new client.\n\nDoesn't get fixed by uninstalling the game again. As well I have downloaded the Hextech repair tool and it hasn't helped either.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix it?\n\nEdit: If anyone has the same issue please try what I posted in the comments below.","replies":[{"poster":"Professor Hasid","date":"2017-09-16T08:26:53.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem. when i reinstalled the client through HRT i thought it would work becuz i managed to log in and even played a few games. once i closed the client down and tried relogging after an hour the same problem occured. I've never had this problem before untill today. pls fix it because i have done everything i can on my own. \nTried everything in the permissions aswell.","replies":[{"poster":"Professor Hasid","date":"2017-09-16T09:15:23.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nvm, i fixed it myself by opening the \"Riotgames\" folder and deleting \"League Client\" and then clicking on the \"lol.launcher.admin\". The client will launch after that.  Rito can never help  you resolve an issue. You always  have to find ur own way of fixing this bug  of a game.  Goodluck.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T17:49:29.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your settings on your OS or antivirus might have changed, and causing the installation to get blocked.  The steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide should help resolve that.

I went into my \"Local Disk\" then found the \"Riot Games\" folder and moved and deleted it in my recycle bin. I then redownloaded the game again through the league download and it finished installing the client patch then the regular league patch like nothing ever happened.\n\nMy guess is that the previous League files were not being deleted by either the league downloader or the HRT.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T21:41:02.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, that's great news!
