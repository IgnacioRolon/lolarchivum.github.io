I was playing as Yorick into an Aatrox, there were two instances where this bug happened. I don&#039;t believe that the items we had mattered because it happened pretty early on and then again 5-10 min later. The aatrox tried to preemptively Q out of Yorick&#039;s W before it formed, and instead of traveling, Aatrox just floated up and then came back down. If needed I have a replay of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2017-10-06T23:58:16.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick's W has a knockback component on it, which is knocking Aatrox out of his Q. This is intended behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Asph0del","date":"2017-10-08T02:09:22.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm, it seems kind of off both mechanically and visually, Aatrox floats up real slow and high which looks unusual and like a bug, and if it knocks back I don't think it should last like 1.5-2.5 seconds right? That's really long for canceling his initial Q cast.","replies":[]}]}]}
