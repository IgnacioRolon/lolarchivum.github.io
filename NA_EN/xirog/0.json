And even those who did not participate in his creation, tell me how you pictured him next to MF during the event!\r\n\r\nThe reason i&#039;m asking this is because i really want to do some sketches around him, if you&#039;re curious.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, that&#039;s it, please leave your humble opinion! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Angelofchaos16x","date":"2015-08-04T02:48:22.819+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The way he was described in the story, I imagined that he is someone who is very slippery, quiet and almost more like a spy. I picture him as a young man, around his thirties. He is good looking, but nothing too much, so he remains hidden in Miss's shadow, but he does have his charm, if you get too close. His hair, a dark shade of brown, flows down in a clean manner, but does not pass the shoulders. His eyes are a dark shade of green, that seem to to tell a tale on their on, a story of tranquility to a fool, but one of  danger to the wise. His skin suffers from the lack of tattoos, further adding to the discreteness of this figure. His face is one of a troubled man, for his past is as mysterious as him, and even Miss Fortune, known far and wide to have her ways to make a man talk, does not know of his past, nor does she try, for she knows that those are not her affairs.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-05T03:58:52.591+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is very cool.

The thing that Rafen has about him is that he's actually a bit non-descript. He's not ugly, and he's not overly handsome at all as he can blend into a crowd quite easily. He's athletic, as he's a pretty good second-story burglar, but he's not wiry, as he can hold his own in a fight quite easily.\n\nI don't see him as very old as his relationship with Sarah, who is quite young herself, isn't in any way paternal. He'd be older than her, but not so much to be outside the realm of a peer.\n\nBeyond that, I really like Angelofchaos16x's description.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2015-08-04T02:55:53.551+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a Yordle suffering from a severe case of gigantism, and also has the telekinetic ability to move sea sponges.
