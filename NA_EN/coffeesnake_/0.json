But i honestly enjoy kayle&#039;s\r\n kit like i just understand it so well and u can really get a few easy kills because of it. ult is immortal for 3 seconds. i understand that being to op/broken but i think its find bc other champs have an immortal like ult such as aatrox or tryndamere. but if Riot is really gonna rework kayle ill be sad because i just understand her kit and how to build her so well. i think she a great champ with how she is nowI dont really think she needs a reawork because she has a high utility 2, you can heal and give movement speed to urself or a low ally tring to escape or even ult a friend if rooted and might die and thats sucha big part of kayle and her utility she brings to the team.She can dish out tones of dmg and still support other teammates but if they do change her I do hope they leave her E exactly how it is and possibly increase her overall dmg. I really dont think Riot should do a rework on her but if they do it would be kool to see what they came up  with. ps If any people at riot see this i just hope u dont turn her into a support.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2018-12-28T05:58:57.238+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gave you a thumbs up.  I have started to fear these reworks.  \n\nI have lost a few of my former champions when they redesigned them.  I play at a higher ping and like simpler champs for that reason.  If they do an \"Aatrox\", \"Irelia\" or \"Swain\" on my dear Kayle (or Morgana), then this will be yet one (or two) more lost champions for me.  Every rework has been for me so far (with perhaps Ww as an exception) has been like the loss of a dear friend.  Please leave Kayle (and Morgana) alone.  There are other champions out there which could use more attention to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2018-12-28T19:42:10.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can save a breath for Morgana.

Basically trynd 2.0. She actually needs one. Trynd as well imo but that's another comment for another thread. Actually, technically Trynd is Kayle 2.0 because she's older than he is lol\n\nRiot's keeping her melee to ranged playstyle I do believe. That's what makes Kayle... Kayle. The only difference is I'm guessing it'll be gated somehow so she just doesn't right click people to death. It'll be interesting to see what they do with it.\n\nIIRC she's still going to have supportive abilities, only they'll probably be radically different to what they are now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late Game Kayle","date":"2018-12-28T07:44:42.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.
