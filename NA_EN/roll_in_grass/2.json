Having 1000 games and being Silver still is just the same as having 1000 games and being plat or diamond.  You're both stuck in an elo, and you're both not getting out, or getting better. Just because you're a specific skill level does not mean you're meant to be there, no matter what people say. So no, you aren't bad.

I'm glad it didn't push you to stop playing altogether.  One day you'll be able to keep up with gold/plat/dia.  Just keep practicing.  Some tips, after a few straight months of playing, just take a couple weeks off.  You'll go back into the game having digested all the new things you learned, and your reaction time will be back up to par with the new skill set.
