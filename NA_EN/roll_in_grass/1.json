His lore expands upon that with mentioning that he has mastered the use of every weapon available and this could include the style of weapon that the Hyperlight Blade is.\n\n**What doesn't work:**\n• \"Alpha\" isn't something I'd personally use to reference the identity of Jax. Alpha of all weapon masters? Maybe.\n• \"Multi-target\" would only reference Jax's counter-strike ability, all of his other abilities are either a feature for himself or for a single target.
