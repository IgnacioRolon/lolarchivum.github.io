I will be in champ select ( league being the only app open) and then it suddenly crashes then i get a bugsplat sometimes but not often, but everytime a notification saying \"youre running low on memory space\". forcing me to lose lp by dodging and have a long penalty time... this also happens LOTS when im on chrome ( only app open ) and it will immediately send me to desktop closing chrome with the same message. The increasing your memory space thingy in your settings doesnt work for me... as ive tried so im at a loss. I cant do anything on my computer anymore. If i get this message again while trying to play league or go on the internet, i might kms.. would anyone SOMEHOW know a fix to this stupid low memory problem?... im dying...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T01:15:25.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sounds like your pc is running out of ram in order to keep everything running at the same time. Since this is always happening when Chrome is open, I'd venture to guess that between Chrome and League all of your resources are being used, so then your pc needs to shut something down in order to keep operating. \n\nLet's try running League without Chrome open to see if this keeps happening or not. Test it in a custom game and let me know how it goes. If this works pretty well, the main issue might be that you simply need more ram.","replies":[]}]}
