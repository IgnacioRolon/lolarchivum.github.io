Those 8 minutes could have had a lasting effect on the outcome of the match, so it will count that match as a loss for you since you weren't there the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jökër","date":"2017-10-30T03:18:23.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand this but it was right at the start of the game and you are free to watch the replay of the match and read the chat logs for yourself I came back as soon as I could and helped them win. :/ like if my computer crashes again I just feel like I wont join back since i'll just get a loss of lp and a punishment regardless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jökër","date":"2017-10-30T03:16:57.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand this but it was right at the start of the game and you are free to watch the replay of the match and read the chat logs for yourself I came back as soon as I could and helped them win. :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jökër","date":"2017-10-29T10:39:54.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ideally I would like my 16 lp back plus the 21 I would have gotten for winning the game.","replies":[]}]}
