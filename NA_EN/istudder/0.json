I recommend simply letting the patching process run for a while and not touching it until it finishes. If you run into errors while patching, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Blasterblade97","date":"2017-02-24T13:15:49.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes very long my internet speed is 45mb/s but stil the download speed after the 32% is only 86KB/s and goes below that","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-26T21:30:19.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running into a specific error message, or is it just taking a while to patch? Keep in mind that your (home) network bandwidth of 45 Mbps is not the same bandwidth that other sites and services can allocate to you while patching or downloading files. The actual number you'll see will be determined by your own download bandwidth, the bandwidth allowed from the host, and other network factors in between.\n\nIf you aren't running into an error, let the patch run while you aren't using the computer so it can run uninterrupted. Please let me know if you run into any patching errors.","replies":[{"poster":"League Ã–f JinX","date":"2017-11-26T06:44:30.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same problem, Pbe is 14-000 mb\ntakes forever to download, didnt finish when i waited for almost 10 hours","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
