He can't hop on enemies, and if you gave yasuo this ability then it would obviously be over powered, but giving braum it will give him enough utility to see top braum gameplay in the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-25T21:23:09.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while I dont disagree, mobility supports up until Bard wasnt really a concept.

One of Lee's major issues is that he has too much mobility, and it comes from an ability that's designed to protect living allied units (which a ward doesn't count as), or to help himself sustain in the jungle. \n\nIf the devs are actually able to justify denying Braum of the ability, the same reasoning can probably be applied to Lee as well >_>","replies":[]},{"poster":"The ADC Wizard","date":"2015-02-25T22:26:49.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should a champion be played only one way?
