I had a game recently where I got a tier 3 eve who was doing like 17k damage a round while the next highest on my team most of the time was like 1k damage haha","replies":[{"poster":"Gamma Sector","date":"2019-09-06T08:47:50.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if they don't start building magic resist items when they see an item stacked 3 star eve, then that's just Darwinism at that point","replies":[{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2019-09-09T21:54:08.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BongMage420,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=wffkeGTf,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-06T08:47:50.866+0000)\n>\n> if they don't start building magic resist items when they see an item stacked 3 star eve, then that's just Darwinism at that point\n\nHow do you build magic resist, when items and champions are up to RNG? In that case your only hope is that you can get items from the carousel and that might be too late or you need to get dragons, which again are up to RNG. Also executing 65% champs is just broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThisName1sDumb","date":"2019-09-07T05:03:39.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BongMage420,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=wffkeGTf,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-06T08:47:50.866+0000)\n>\n> if they don't start building magic resist items when they see an item stacked 3 star eve, then that's just Darwinism at that point\n\nBy the time I had her 3 starred, there's not much you can do to get mr besides the carosel, and if you don't get lucky there, you're out of luck. Or I guess if you get a dragons claw from the infernal drake.\n\nBut yeah, the one last guy other than me had a stacked chogath with a dragon's claw and he ended up winning, but it was pretty back and forth.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-06T01:31:31.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
