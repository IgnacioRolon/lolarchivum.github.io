Both champions have been clearly defined as ADC and support, but we have seen off meta roles with similar champions. These are the first with unique interaction that you will probably never take advantage of if you don't pick them for their specific purpose and role.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-04-05T03:39:52.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"only \"meta\" that riot has truly enforced is a role's purpose\n\nyou can be whatever champion you want in whatever role you want (say, support), but if you try to act as a second jungler instead of legitimately supporting (or at least trying to), that's the only time the meta will be enforced.\n\nRole Goal Metas are unchanging","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-05T03:07:58.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot still does not enforce meta in any way.

Imagine trying to balance not only their solo ability, but games where both are in the game, and alternative roles each could play.

Rakan's heal procs -when- he touches an ally, not if. An increased dash distance will get him out of trouble, but that'll just make him slippery, not strong. What good will an attack speed buff to do benefit Rakan? Like I said, unless he gets significant AP scaling on his basic attacks, that'll do nothing to make him \"unbalanceable\".
