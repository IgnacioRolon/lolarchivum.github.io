Remember, league used to last 30-45 minutes on average, sometimes much longer, and in *those* games Lee's damage falls off quite heavily because he can't invest in armor pen as easily as other ad assassins can.\n\nThe reason Lee is picked in high elo has nothing to do with him \"not falling off\" as you claim.

Either he lacks impact for landing his combo because he's sturdier (and he's still vulnerable to dying) or he dies on his way in or out because he's flimsy.

Pantheon falls off late game, not because he doesn't do damage, but if he goes full damage, he get's insta-deleted. Renekton falls off in the way you think he does, because he doesn't scale very well, but he can get really really tanky to ignore that fact. \n\nLee Sin falls off due to Teams no longer giving him easy access due to a Front line. Fall off is not a singular definition","replies":[{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2017-04-29T02:19:10.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"however it could be argued that with Lee Sins mobility he could simply go around the back, if Lees frontline is crashing into theirs they won't be able to get to him.\n\nLee is one of if not the only champion that can quickly go around the back of the enemies (Outside of maybe Kass,Kha and Rengo) instagib a carry (Again, those 3) But also provide utility for their team and having enough tank to easily shrug off the retort from say, the mid laner.\n\nand even then it's not a CONSISTENT falloff, Late game Renektons damage falls off vs other brusiers, that is a consistent weakness that's why you don't see people howling for Renekton nerfs, because he has a consistant weakness late game for his powerful early game, Lee however has an inconsistent weakness because if Lee jumps in from the side with a Banshees over the wall by mashing W ult Flash Q Q a squishy is basically dead and Lee gets chunked but the tankier builds Lees use is good enough to get him out, and I know your gonna say \"CC him\" well with a good lee it will be absurdly difficult to do and even if you do land the CC odds are your squishy is still gonna be kicked to the enemy team regardless because of how little delay his \"Combo\" has, you see it in higher play too Lee normally gets a kick off before the CC hits.\n\nIf anything Lee having such a powerful early game he SHOULD have the Renekton style weakness of doing crap for damage late game because a champion which is good on all stages of the game is an unbalanced champion","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-04-29T02:22:37.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a Lee runs all the way behind your team, I believe that should count as an Outplay. I'd also like to point out that Renekton too, can still kill carries late game if he's allowed into the back line. He's just not as good against the Front-liner tanks and such than others.

He honestly needs to get his spellvamp in the jungle looked at because he hardly takes damage. If he's going to be so dominating via kit then he needs real risk when he goes into the lane to gank.
