Now, if they can do that AT WILL, it has to be more than just they had the better jungler almost EVERY SINGLE GAME. Perhaps, and I'm just spit-balling here, it's because they DESERVE to climb. Maybe the better player, over the course of a large number of games, will get an average rank that is higher than other players. If over hundreds of games, you end up Plat 5, or Diamond 2, or Silver 3, or whatever, it's because you belong there. Not everyone gets to climb. Not everyone is good enough to. That's what it boils down to. Better players climb higher than worse players. Until of course you reach your upper limit.\n\nAnd I've seen pros on stream that don't make bullshit excuses like, \"Ermahgerd couldn't win this one cuz top is retarded!\" No, you'll hear them say something like, \"Oh well, sometimes these games happen. I'll get the next one.\" I used to be a really big believer in \"I won my lane, did my job, still lost - derp\" but at some point I recognized that I could do more to win than just win my lane. Maybe I could be more attentive to teleporting bot lane to turn a gank around, or roaming mid, or invading their jungle, etc. When I adopted that attitude of looking outside my lane, my rank went up. Now I'm looking for ways to improve even further to get even higher. I'm not looking at each game and complaining that I had an afk, or that someone (including myself) had a bad game. I'm looking at each opportunity to help my team in any capacity to win the game. Part of the skill involved is using your advantage to do more than win your lane. Part of the skill is knowing how to win the game regardless of the result of your lane.\n\nThere are plenty of elements that vary from one game to the next. That's when we rely on statistics to even it out. You get a bad jungler sometimes? So do the 5 people on their team. You have a bad game sometimes? So does the enemy team, or the other 4 people on your team. The only constant from game to game is you. You and your skill decide your rank when you play enough games to average out all the other factors. \n\nFinally, if you attribute bad luck to why you lost your games, or bad teammates, then you MUST also attribute your wins to good luck or good teammates, right? Of course not! Most people would say they won because they were better most of the time (I think everyone can agree that they get lucky sometimes or that they get carried sometimes). The reverse holds true for losses. Sometimes it's bad luck or a bad teammate, and there's not a lot you can do to change that, but most of the time there was SOMETHING you cold do to have won the game (until it slips away and snowballs out of control). Don't look at your losses as other people's fault, while simultaneously looking at your wins as your own accomplishment. The fact is that there are a lot of factors that go into both success and failure, but that's why we play many games; to average out all the extraneous factors.","replies":[{"poster":"Tulare","date":"2017-05-16T18:51:07.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disclaimer: This is why I'm only Silver IV.\nI _do_ attribute it to good luck or good teammates when I win a game.

In general, though, I don't know why a game was won or lost.\n\nSometimes I can point to a primary factor. What could I have done about that, though? Usually, I'm not sure.

Well maybe except Azir but I just love his playstyle and just the fact that he can dominate early laning and can be a hypercarry late game. Shen is also just in case I get forced into top lane. Also I tend to take TP when I find it to be effective. Honestly most people I see just go to the champion that does a shit ton of damage, that makes it frustrating for me to try and 1v1 but in the end when I play champions with alot of utility and help my team we usually win in the end. 50 minute games where I have to peel for my entire backline as Ash ADC O_o but its those kinds of do or die games that I live for. {{champion:22}} says hi","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2017-05-16T10:26:54.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that people tend to imitate the pros, come up with bs reasons why, and then complain when that strategy has weaknesses and demand Riot to change stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2017-05-15T23:44:17.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure, but one of the reasons I main Azir is because he's among the least team reliant champions in the game.\n\nBarring a few champions (Malphite, Miss Fourtune namely), I can 1v5 - I just need my team to not be totally braindead, which rarely happens.\n\nTeam game as it is, it's obnoxious how much control junglers have had ever since vision was kneecapped.\n\nConstant ganking, camping, and goon-squadding used to be gimmicky strategies that only worked in low elo, because anyone mid-silver+ would be able to ward at least 1 side of their lane with proper investment BY THEMSELVES.\n\nNow however that's happening in pro play because even with co-ordinated vision, most of the times people escape it's because it was guessed in advance, not because of the wards, which usually are too late to stop anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2017-05-16T10:25:18.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 ward in the jungle will give you a really good idea where the jungler is at all times.
