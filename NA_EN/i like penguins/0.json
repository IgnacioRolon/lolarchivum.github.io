Is there a way to fix this so I don't need to redl it again, or a way to prevent it for future?  I have really slow internet so this is extremely annoying having to dl it over and over.\n\n  proof of me already having it downloaded https://gyazo.com/6a27f303712bad90a3abe54ecff7b179 \n\nand it making me dl again https://gyazo.com/71edbe2d3ab5bf37eb2ddb672b74156b\n\nEdit: Update, it downloaded but keeps going past the full download length now.. wtf? https://gyazo.com/65c638523e97c82bc67664a6d7e83963","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T01:37:31.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm if you had already downloaded that patch once (or more) times, then it sounds like your client must have noticed that some of the files didn't get installed perfectly. This is the clients attempt to redownload that patch in order to prevent you from having any kind of random crashes. \n\nIt's best to let that download finish up, but if it pops up like every time then go ahead and grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and try running a quick **force repatch**. Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Penguins","date":"2017-08-05T11:58:43.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty, for now it's doing good.
