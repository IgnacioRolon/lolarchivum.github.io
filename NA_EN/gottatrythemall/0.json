It is not a hardware issue, I experienced the same problem with a variety of mice. \r\nHas anyone else ever had this kind of problem?\r\nI shall be more specific.\r\nIt happens, let's say, once every 5-10 seconds. When it happens, for about 2 seconds, it doesn't matter how many times I right click, the game refuses to register it, while at the same time I can do anything else. Left click always works. Mouse movement is still fine, I just can't right click. My ping is stable, my fps are fine meanwhile. What could cause this madness? It is impossible to play properly like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-24T17:42:45.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ruling out hardware possibilities by swapping your mouse was a solid step.  There might be an issue with your config settings that's not responding to your input.  Resetting your config might fix this up.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if that does the trick for you.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyRiceFarmer","date":"2018-01-31T21:36:30.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just had the exact problem, it randomly started happening ingame, your tip fixed it.
