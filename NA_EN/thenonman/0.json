I think he can also get the stacks from an assist too. \n\nNasus on the other hand needs to last hit the minion for +3 stacks but can stack cannon minions, large monsters, epic monsters (drakes, baron, rift herald, vilemaw) and champion kills to gain 12 stacks. Nasus can only stack by last hitting something with Q, finishing off an enemy with his E, or his AOE R does not give him stacks. So when you have a nasus on your team you want to try and let him get kills with Q and at least give him the cannon so he still gets stacks while he is with the team when y’all are pushing.\n\nVeigar tho is easier because he gains AP by either last hitting minions/monsters with q or by simply hitting an enemy champion with an ability\n\nI think these are the only times that you should not try to “kill secure” but of course that is only if the enemy champ can’t escape. If you think the caught champion can easily escape your team and survive then it is anybody’s game to get it. But let’s say Nasus 1v1ing the enemy lux, got her low she used the zhonyas active, if you helped nasus out slightly then it would be respectable to give him the kill. The dick move would be securing the kill when nasus clearly has it just because you want it.\n\nBut kill securing in terms of player behavior is not reportable, so you can secure as many kills as you want.
