A friend managed to give me a beta key to the JP server, and I took Yasuo into a custom game with the High Noon skin for the hell of it. I noticed right away my Q used the default skin sound, without the noticable &quot;bang&quot; it&#039;s supposed to. Interestingly, the sound plays properly for the PROJECT skin. Afterwards, I tested it with Jhin&#039;s High Noon skin as well, because why not? His sounds worked just fine. I have an exam in an hour or so and I just wanted to do a quick test, but there&#039;s a clear bug going on here, replicable 10/10 times on Yasuo. I suspect it may have something to do with his Q sound being tied to his voice going off on cast? No way to be sure. \r\n\r\nFor reference, my IGN on the beta JP server is &quot;Giga&quot; if you need it for anything.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-04T21:35:20.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GigaBreaker88 - \n\nWe're aware of an issue where High Noon Yasuo's Q isn't properly playing - it's not related to VO, just the skill in general.  Thanks for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2016-02-05T01:14:03.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hijack, but I wasn't able to get any help from the Japan server side when I submitted a ticket. Do you know why the Japanese server is being blocked off regionally? Only certain countries can currently login. I work in Korea, and I was pretty excited about being able to play, but due to the IP block, I can't get in without a VPN. Another person from the Philippines told me they had the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T17:05:01.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's intended that for now, it's only for players located in Japan.
