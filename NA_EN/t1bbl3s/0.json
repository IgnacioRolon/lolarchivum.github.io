Hey guys, I recently tried to install league on a new computer. I then open the launcher to download it, and it is stuck at 0% with calculating differences and 1 files scanned. I wait a bit 30min to an hour it will say the download failed. And then a bug splat will appear. Any help on this? I've tried everything riot suggest and still nothing. Help would be much appreciated.{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T21:56:52.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being this early in the process, the patcher is attempting to scan your game files.  Settings in your OS may be blocking it from happening so you end up getting stuck there and end up in an error message.  As a first step, I suggest using our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to allow the patcher access.  That should get you updated and ready to play!","replies":[{"poster":"T1bbl3s","date":"2016-08-21T13:27:38.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried it Porocles, but with no success.
