They aren&#039;t really banning the right people sometimes.\nI&#039;m not here to say I&#039;m a perfect person or anything, but I&#039;m not the type of guy that&#039;s going to give someone shit unless they deserve it. I&#039;ll be toxic towards others who are being toxic. The only times I ever get mad at people are when they&#039;re trolling, being toxic, or when I asked them not to do x thing and they continually do it and end up not helping the team in any way. I do not yell at every player. In my last match, I was mad at 2 of my teammates. I had 2 other teammates that were doing just as bad, but I did not say things to them. Why? Because they weren&#039;t toxic and talking shit. I got mad at the people who were, and yet I&#039;m the one who gets a ban? For what? I&#039;m not the one even starting these flame wars. I don&#039;t care to report the people who are starting shit since I&#039;m just not going to let affect me after the match, but I get reported by tons of butthurt trolls and now I&#039;ve been perma banned because of it.\n\nI believe in my 14 day ban email (I am now perma banned) there was a quote saying that people from both parties would be punished equally. Now, in the match that I was reported for, I actually did report the other party in the argument. One of the few times in which I do so. Turns out he never even got a 1 day ban since I checked him up on some league stat site (Can&#039;t recall which one) and saw  him playing the next day. So the fact that Riot lies about how they handle cases, and how they don&#039;t look at both sides of the case just shows me that they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing.\n\nThis isn&#039;t really a post to get me unbanned. I should not have been banned in the first place, but whatever.\n\nThoughts would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-02-15T03:06:59.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it was their first offense, and they just got chat restrictions?\n\nAnd people don't get punished for one game.

Show us the entire chat logs where he was just as toxic as you? Maybe he had one bad game and usually he's very well behaved. \n\nAbout assholes needing someone to be an asshole to them, no. That's not how behavior modification works. Yes, they need to realize that the words they're saying affect others, but using the exact same language to them will only reinforce the way they act, not make them rethink how they speak.","replies":[{"poster":"Valendrome","date":"2016-02-15T02:58:06.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If no one is an asshole, then I have absolutely no issues with playing together as a team and talking. I'm not saying it's necessarily right, but it is different because I'm not the one that ends up picking these fights with other people. I'm hoping you can understand that.\n\nI asked my Rengar to come gank and he sat there, so I said this in all chat \"What the fuck was my Rengar doing?\".  The Yasuo was up against a Fiona on mid, and he went 1-3 and complained each time he died. On his 4th death, Rengar and I were on our way to gank, and he starts giving us shit and told us not to gank so I respond with \"The gank was fine, you were going to die. We came after your death.\" He said one other thing and I responded with \"Stfu. That has nothing to do with us\". From this I can tell that he's like this normally. He loves to complain.\n\nIn regards to behavior, yes, you are right, maybe it's not the best course of action for me to be an asshole back, but you can surely at least understand why, yes? I don't think you're right in saying that it will reinforce them. I guess it is dependent on the person.\n\nI can admit that I'm angry, so that's why I end up cussing a lot as it's the easiest way to let it out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2016-02-15T02:46:48.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \n Valendrome (NA)  - 2 minutes ago\nPeople are different.

You are just as much the Ass as the others !\n\nIf you brush it off then you don't start a flame war !

There have been plenty of matches where I have people who play and don't talk shit, and guess what, I don't say anything rude to anyone in those matches. If I brush it off, the person will never change. If I talk back to them, there's at least the chance that they'll get the memo. This is why I'm saying they're banning the wrong people. Ban the people who are wanting to be toxic towards others.\n\nI don't want to be that way, but if that's how people are going to act then tell me why I should show them any respect.
