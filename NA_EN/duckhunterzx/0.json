I was disappointed to find out that the client wouldn't download the replays. After some research I figured out that I need to launch LoL as administrator.\r\n\r\nSo after I downloaded a  replay of a game in THIS patch, I tried to play it, but all i got was a black screen and an error saying \"Failed to open replay. The game will now exit\". Then I clicked the okay button and the whole thing went away and i returned to my client.\r\n\r\nThe way this is supposed to work is that replay files (.rofl) are saved to a directory within My Documents. When I navigated there nothing showed up even when I had downloaded the replay. Now onto my Users folder there are 4 sub folders: Default, Public, (my username) and a weird folder with random characters i'd say. I found that there was a similar directory with the My Documents folder inside the last folder, and that the replays were saved there instead of my (username) folder. So without knowing what to do to fix this I reinstalled LoL as cleanly as I could and prayed it would be solved.\r\n\r\nNow since I'm here you can guess the issue persists. I really have no idea what to do. I've already submitted a request to the support but I am worried I won't get much out of it. Can someone give me precise instructions on what to do? If you think the information I've given are insufficient, I'll be happy to provide more (screenshots and other data). Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"WerwolfO1","date":"2016-12-23T19:06:03.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the problem you are currently facing is most likely that Riot doesn't support special characters like üßâ... correctly.\nI suppose your user does have one of these special characters which aren't the normal ASCII characters, which is even more likely since LoL is saving the file in a user with random characters.

I am not sure how the encoding works (being a programmer, that's embarassing) but i've set my OS to be in English because the Greek translations were horrible. I am not sure if they're conflicting but I will try switching my OS language back to greek and if that doesn't work, then I'll just create a new account with latin characters. Hope that works.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T23:23:53.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replays are still in testing so you may run into some issues.
