However in some games i'll go like 18/5 and still manage to lose the game because my team makes horrible calls such as fighting 4v5 at dragon instead of giving it up, or over extending and dying in team fights. \r\n\r\nShould i roam more, should i gank more? or should i just crap on lane. How do u win games with bad teams.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazinHot6","date":"2014-10-27T12:37:51.506+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes to carry a game you need to help your team do well.  A couple of examples:\n1. Let your under farmed *insert lane* take the kill (you still get assist gold)\n2. Dont take all the CS when group  pushing a lane, a lot of AD champs need them for life steal after team fights\n3. Roam after you kill your laner/turret and do step 1\n\nIt doesnt matter how far ahead you are when the rest of your team is in shambles.  I usually try to get my tank or adc fed so they can do well.  I always will prioritize helping the player who is helping me the most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zliplus","date":"2014-10-27T18:29:04.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you have to do the 'wrong' thing to work with your team. If you team keeps fighting 4v5, maybe you need to stay with/near your team all the time so it's a 5v5, even if you know that it would be better for you to split and take a turret. If one person always split pushes and gets caught, maybe the rest of your team should push the other side of the map, or wait in ambush near the split-pusher and gank the enemies that come to kill him.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackMambo00","date":"2014-10-28T00:13:30.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is some of the best advice you could get.

Typically when I lose a game where I am dominating like this it is because I make mistakes that cost me the game. Your ahead and you need to use this to help your team. Yeah not every loss is your fault when your ahead.  Sometimes there are teams you just can't do anything about. \n\nI played a game a while ago where my top, bottom, and jungle were not doing well at all. I was super far ahead on Akali and dominating my lane. The only reason we didn't surrender at 20 minutes is because I was able to win us teamfights, but when most of us were dead or on super low health after we weren't really able to siege anything. At one point in the game a teamfight broke out in which I would have been able to get a penta kill (I still haven't gotten one), but instead of getting the penta kill I allowed the Vayne on my team to get most of the kills. This got the Vayne a lot of gold and xp, and because she got so much from this she was able to help me help us win teamfights and very soon after the game.\n\nYou don't need or want a ton of kills if the rest of your team is behind. Just because your 18/5 doesn't mean you can 1v5. Give some of those kills to the other carries on your team. Get them gold, so they can start doing things in teamfights other than dying and running away, and you will find yourself winning more games even though you have a lower kda.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-10-27T16:53:57.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"the best thing you can do most times is to just not dying along with them for a bad call.

It really breaks down to something like 25% of games are un-winnable for various reasons.  25% of games are automatic wins for the same various reasons.\n\nNow, those remaining 50%?  It depends on the game.  Do you have another player on the team that looks good?  Get them fed as well.  Two fed champions is the golden point where your team will win.  One fed person is too easy to shut down (Or just exhaust), so playing 100% for yourself doesn't work very well.  Get two people fed, hope to win.  If you lose, oh well, move on to next game.  \n\nIt is important to remember that you aren't looking for a 100% win rate.  Or even a 70% win rate.  A 55% win rate will climb you the ladder pretty quickly, assuming you keep playing games.  A 60% win rate is huuuggeee.  The only time you will get above a 60% win rate is on a smurf account that is way below your actual skill level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"This is Snake","date":"2014-10-27T14:13:07.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you keep giving up dragons like that, eventually the enemy will have a big gold lead and have their core items before you.

Call out the lane that fed the enemy. If you want to do this extra good, try calling out the lane in an indirect question like, \"Who fed X Character??\" when you and everyone else knows who fed. This is extra frustrating to your struggling teammate. \n\n2. When the person rightfully talks back to you for calling them out as a feeder, make sure you put them in their place so they get really angry and stand 0 chance of improving their game and helping the team achieve a win. \n\n3. Feel good that you weren't the one who fed. It sucks to lose, but it's relaxing to know you're totally out of the loop this time. \n\n4. Always be the last to join a team fight. Because the person who joins first will most likely die. Clean up the easy kill and gtfo so you can continue to harass your teammates for dying while inflating your own KDA. \n\n5. Never ever feel bad for letting someone know they are doing bad. Better to be a jerk in life than a feeder in a video game.","replies":[]}]}
