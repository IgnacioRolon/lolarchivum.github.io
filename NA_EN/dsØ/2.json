As for jhin I never really played him after reading his lore, but what from I can see he is a champ that seems solid.  You should buy more champs for various situation. its a lot of learning involved. It also helps the game grow. just remember it doesn't matter when anyone thinks except yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2017-09-13T04:36:47.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for him he's mostly about positioning kinda like a sniper since that's what his ult is can't take down tanks with it but is good against high priority targets such as mid and adc","replies":[]}]}
