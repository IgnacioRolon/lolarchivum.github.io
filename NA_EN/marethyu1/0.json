I don't have a screenshot of your error (but if you do, I'd greatly appreciate seeing it), but from what you're saying it sounds like you're encountering a connection block just as you start to load into the map. There's a lot of transitions from the lobby to the actual game after all!\n\nFor starters, I suggest using a hardline connection over wifi if possible. I also suggest taking a look at your router and manually forwarding any ports that LoL needs. We have steps that can help walk you through that [**right over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq8). Go ahead and follow those, and then test the game out by opening multiple custom games and connecting to them successfully. If you'd like, you can even test in a matchmade game afterwards, but I'd rather avoid risking you getting a Leaverbuster if possible. Let me know how things work!","replies":[]}]}
