I've tried the hextech tool that the bot in support recommended to me but it changed nothing whatsoever. I tried restarting the client, reinstalling league and I haven't seen any difference. Also, sometimes my client sometimes stops working and is frozen for a few seconds. I THINK (major emphasis on think) that since my client hasn't been updated yet, I THINK that my client is freezing because it hasn't been updated yet. Any help would be appreciated in how I can manually upgrade my client or if there is some other issue! \r\n_","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T04:41:12.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're still able to play League, then you've proooooobably already updated to the new client sometime in the past.

We can try doing a reinstall but that may not help either. With the new client came a few new features as well, so let's try one of those first before having to wait on a reinstall. Open the client settings in the upper right hand corner and turn on \"Low Spec Mode\", then test it in a custom/practice game.\n\nLet me know if low spec mode helps!!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
