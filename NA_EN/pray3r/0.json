I was just wondering how you may have found the role that you main or why you chose the role you main. I&#039;ve taken just about every quiz out there and played them all but I just can&#039;t quite manage to get one role that I can&#039;t get enough of. Any feedback would be awesome. \r\n\r\nThanks a ton!","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-11-01T19:02:10.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}}  goes mid therefore I am a mid main\n\nIf she goes support I will be a support main\nIf she goes jungle I will be a jungle main\n\n#AhriFancultBanner\n\nBut really I am a mid main. I am the real thing.

Jungle is a more opportunistic position. Mid is the hardest lane where you need high skill and outplay potential. Adc is a back line player and mostly has kiting skills. Supp is to help the team carry and keep everyone from wining lane. It's all up to you who you like to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-01T18:54:28.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll just say this, if my support is trying to keep me from winning my lane, I'll be pretty mad at them!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hryna","date":"2016-11-01T04:16:18.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Figure out what mechanics/macro elements you're good that and what role is best to bring that out/require that and vice versa for bad elements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-11-01T03:51:23.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like playing Marksman either as ADC or Top/Jungle.
