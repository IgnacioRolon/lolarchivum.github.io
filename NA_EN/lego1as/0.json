I&#039;ve reported my fair share of players and even took screen shots of offenses from about 15 different players.  When I say my own research, what I did was track these players through OP.GG and saw from the date that  I reported until now, they have continuesly played games (match history). There was no large gaps (at least 14 days)between games.  This meant that they did not receive at  least a 14 day ban. These SS were  taken mostly during August.  Of course there is no way to track  chat suspensions but the offenses these 15 players were at least for intentionally feeding / racism / hate speech on the level of: &#039;get cancer&#039;.  &#039;kys&#039;, &#039;i will murder you and your family&#039;.  So it definitely possible that some of the 15 players got chat restrictions as punishment. But  having to research 15 players, I found none got a 14 day suspension.  So my conclusion is you must be a serial toxic/troll in order to receive a punishment as severe as 14 day  or permaban.  I guess infrequent raging/inting/trolling is okay.\n\nI&#039;m done with the IFS.  Its wasting my time.  I understand that this game is filled with toxic players and its okay.  I&#039;m just going to play along and do the best I can.  You want to call me trash and tell me to uninstall.  its okay! you want to tell  me to kill myself and you&#039;ll kill my family.  thats okay too.  you want to steal my buffs and ban my picked champion (not even meta champ) thats perfectly fine.   \n\nI won&#039;t  waste my time reporting.  I don&#039;t blame Riot at all.  I&#039;m thankful they make a great game.  I guess over the past 4 seasons, I&#039;ve developed a numbness to all the toxicity.  I don&#039;t  even have to mute anyone because chat rage doesn&#039;t really bother me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ren Amari","date":"2017-09-10T04:21:21.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Accept my friend request so i can debate your clearly wrong ideas about this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lego1as","date":"2017-09-10T04:58:32.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Asutoro,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HRjA3WFZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-10T04:21:21.719+0000)\n>\n> Accept my friend request so i can debate your clearly wrong ideas about this game.\n\naccepted....\n\nI accepted at first but after reading some  of your quotes on other posts, clearly you have rage issues.  \n\nseeing that you want to  'debate' indicates to me your hostile intention.  \n\ngoodbye","replies":[{"poster":"Ren Amari","date":"2017-09-10T11:01:09.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually you don't want to hear ideas that are different from your own. The reason you Think i have \"Rage issues\" is because i post a lot on the boards.

I too am  human and open to the  possibility of being wrong (lots of times).  I just  don't deal with belligerent people like you.  You are trash in your own way.  toxic/ragers/trolls I can  handle.

Its just that easy really.\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5Tozc4Pj-rules-of-trolling-getting-popular\n\nTheres a thread outline'n it, I've been trying to get riot to address this for prob 6 years and today they actually banned me from help desk not cuz of any punishment I have (cuz I have no punishments atm) but cuz I was asking questions and requesting clarity and context on riot's stance on this subject of the troll rules and what us players should do about it if team communication is the only option but we're punished if we use it... I mean I wouldn't care so much if we had another option to deal with in game griefing or trolling actions, but we don't, so I think its kinda crazy to punish 5 people in a game cuz 4 spoke out verse 1 guy.... BUT thats just my unpopular opinion, riot staff completely disagrees with me, they think punishing 5 players for the actions of one is completely legitimate and that team communication is not required on a team game (LOL) by giving players both mute and mute ping to completely cut off team communication.","replies":[{"poster":"Ren Amari","date":"2017-09-10T11:01:37.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for linking me that board.
