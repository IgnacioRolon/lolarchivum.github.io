No racism, homophobia, etc that would warrant a ban. Just standard trash talk. If i have a teammate who is playing extremely poorly why am I being punished for telling somebody that something they did was dumb or telling them they need to focus more. I have received chat restrictions before for asking teammates to stop doing what they are doing and adapting to our teams game plan, albeit slightly less polite but why should a single F-bomb mid sentence cause me to receive punishment?\r\n\r\nIn any other game through out my life be it video games or sports, stuff like this is extremely standard and not punishable. Why is LoL so different? \r\n\r\nI understand that the punishments may be based strictly on reports and if that is the case that should 100% be changed especially considering 95% of players report if somebody says anything that isn't outright positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-03-07T00:42:37.505+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because during the Tribunal, this is how the majority of players voted.

They were decided by machine learning being fed every chat log with a decent majority punish (not sure the exact cutoff, but I’d imagine it’d have to be at least 70% in favor) and it learned on its own what the behaviors were that the community was voting to punish versus logs it was fed that were “clean” (i.e. voted not punish).\n\nIt wasn’t “not quite half”, it was well over half, regardless of the exact number. And Tribunal has been stated to have had decent participation in the earlier phases of it, only dwindling once League got “too big for its own good” so to speak.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2019-03-07T05:54:56.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"The Tribunal didn't differentiate from trolling/inting bans and chat related ones. Because you were given chatlogs from all players, as well as stats, it was much easier to vote in favor of punishment.

Regardless, the amount of times this would've happened is so small as to not affect the sample greatly. Machine learning is very good at operating even when 10-15% of the data is \"bad\" or doesn't fit patterns.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-07T05:22:35.574+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rules in one place aren't necessarily the same as the rules in another place. The rules here are intended to reform or drive away players whose behavior would drive away many other players. When you say \"No racism, homophobia, etc that would warrant a ban. Just standard trash talk,\" that shows that you haven't yet grasped that LoL has rules you aren't used to, or that you disagree with, but which still apply nonetheless. You're confused that your behavior, which you believe doesn't warrant a ban, is getting you banned. This is the key. That behavior _does_ warrant a ban here. It's a bit like going to someone's house and being told to take off your shoes. If you keep your shoes on because you wear shoes around your own house, it should be no surprise that you'll be repeatedly asked to take off your shoes, and eventually told to leave - which you have been, but you keep coming back and engaging in the same unwanted behavior.\n\nAlso, actual sports have rules for sportsmanship. Breaking those rules results in disqualifications, fines, or other penalties.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2019-03-07T02:17:16.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then just don't trash talk.

It astounds me how accepting and aware my high school students are compared to those of 5 years ago or even my own university time. They get that it's not a white male world anymore.
