Saying that alone will always result in a 14 day ban assuming you haven't received punishment prior to that. Telling someone they're \"fucking retarded\" isn't much better, but if it were just that alone you probably would have only received a chat restriction. May I suggest just muting people / not typing to them? It's better to say nothing and keep yourself safe over saying something in the heat of the moment and getting yourself banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mythicalmango69","date":"2018-04-17T23:30:53.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i'm just going to quit this game.
