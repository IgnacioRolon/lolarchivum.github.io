What frustrates you, how does a certain spell make you feel, etc. When it comes to suggestions for what should be done, in 99% of cases we don&#039;t really look at them. Sorry if this comes across as mean, but we have designers with years and years of experience who&#039;ll still come up with the wrong solutions half the time. Our design process is highly iterative. Identify a problem, form a hypothesis, attempt to prove or disprove the hypothesis through playtesting, adjust your solution, rinse and repeat. A single &quot;solution&quot; presented in a vacuum does us no good at all.\r\n\r\nWhat he&#039;s essentially avoiding saying but implying is that nobody from Riot is interested in your designs. Nobody at Riot will ever read these ideas. And I&#039;m not saying that because I, for some reason, hate people coming up with cool new champion concepts. No. Some of you are fucking amazing. I, at one point, also liked designing new champs and items, but there&#039;s no point to doing it. If you will notice, the only threads where Riot ever responds are the ones where it&#039;s either a pretty skin and the image is instantly visible, it&#039;s something basic that&#039;s in one line like &quot;Make Malzahars voidlings scratch themselves when idle like puppies&quot; or just something that&#039;s a borderline meme about Graves&#039; cigar or something. \r\n\r\nAnd that makes me sad. No Zenon, some ideas are in a vacuum, yes, but sometimes, there are genuinely genius ideas out there that are so obvious that they are worth at least _TESTING_. Wana improve your image within the community? imagine this situation and follow it up:\r\n\r\nGo to an interesting suggestion thread that actually has something interesting(These threads exist ever so often), take an idea. Suppose someone is proposing a TARIC rework where he has a new ability. Suppose someone is proposing a new mechanic or something even. Then TAKE that mechanic and TRY IT OUT. If that seems to time intensive then do it only for like the most interesting ideas out there. THESE EXIST. Post a response, do something! Make a blog maybe that details what you are testing out. SHOW US the half made kits of champions you are making so that people can see them, make a blog. \r\n\r\nJust do something to make it at least _SEEM_ like the dev and rework teams are not completely closed off and don&#039;t really give a shit about anything someone else might have to say. \r\n\r\nI used to want to work at Riot when I furst learned about it. It seemed like a great company with open-minded people who are not bound by the shitty hierarchical corporate bullshit of other companies, but in the end as time goes on you seem to retain the same attitude of those companies. We know better, we do anything and everything not any longer because we like it, but because we must maintain the image that we give a shit about our community, we must maintain the game to completely facilitate the Esports scene while disregarding the average player-base because thats what 99.99% of the players are, right?

A single &quot;solution&quot; presented in a vacuum does us no good at all.*\n\nThis is pretty accurate though. About the only thing that might be useful is a superbly well-crafted suggestion *related* to a current problem champion that does a point-by-point addressing of the problem, proposes several possible directions, and then deeply discusses the pros and cons of different solutions targeted in those individual directions.\n\nAnd, on this board, such a post would likely end up down-voted with no explanation, meaning Riot is unlikely to ever see it -- people often seem like they're here to just get told their idea is great. That's fine, but it's not really a forum worth Riot's time to sift through.\n\nIf we **want** Riot comments, we have to ***earn*** them -- we have to have DISCUSSIONS about the problem, not merely suggest solutions. We have to figure out the \"WHY\" and the \"WHAT,\" and be aware that Riot may not worry about our \"HOW.\"\n\nAs they said -- even the most experienced designers fail to hit the mark much of the time.\n\n**AND REMEMBER:** He said they don't look at 99% of ideas. I'd hazard even that number is a little lenient. But the take-away here is that there are ***SOME*** ideas they **do** look at. Making those stand out (and getting the proper forum attention to them) is important.\n\nPeople need to stop down-voting things they disagree with, and upvote good, reasoned discussion and well-created suggestions instead, provided they can be defended. I may not LIKE your Urgot rework, but if it's mechanically solid and has a good conversation behind it I should upvote it.\n\nSave the downvotes for badly conceived or hacked together ideas, or posts where the creator isn't taking any feedback or listening to any thoughts. **MAKE THIS A FORUM** ***WORTH*** **VISITING**.\n\n> I used to want to work at Riot when I furst learned about it.

I've been there twice for interviews, and their company environment is like nothing I've seen anywhere else. Everyone is incredibly intelligent, clearly passionate, and they love this game as much or more than we do. It shows in everything I saw.\n\n> FUCK.

You can&#039;t say that replying to a thread is HARD. You have people who can do that. If not, then hire them! \n\nIf the people who reply to a thread aren't the design / development team, about all they can really say is \"cool idea.\" The guys and girls who work on the design / dev side of things are super busy -- they don't really have the time to work on anything but their current projects. Hiring people solely to respond to the community concepts boards isn't really a good use of time or money, I think.\n\n>Previously I would make concepts for champion reworks, but what&#039;s the fucking point...\n\nFun. Entertainment. Challenge. Design practice. Things to put in a portfolio (I know I did). Things to discuss at interviews. There are a number of incredible reasons...it's just that \"So Riot will use it\" isn't really a practical one.","replies":[{"poster":"antymattar","date":"2015-12-06T17:54:18.102+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.

I basically just applied with a decent cover letter (I do have a friend there, which helped get it noticed), and had enough relevant Computer Science experience (and enough samples and experience with analysis in general) to get me the QA interview. From there the Riot guys and gals figured out extremely quickly that I was more interested in design.\n\nBasically: find a way to stand out, know your stuff, know you're good at what you do (and *be* good at it), but ***also*** understand that you have a *lot* to learn.

Do projects: you need something to show. Write clean, well-documented code. Know and apply industry standards.

Tear apart and scrap your own ideas: if you can't realize when it is time to scrap an idea you loved but isn't workinf you might end up wasting resources.

Let me narrow that down\n\nHave a portfolio showing multiples types of content, perhaps with analysis of your decisions or alternatives available if someone asks. You want to show that you're not only good at creating content (a lot of people are) but that you can create quality content and specifically target your designs to solve specific issues or create intended gameplay. Anyone can have a good idea: you want to show that you consistently have GREAT ideas. \n\nYou NEED to be good at analytical reasoning. A large part of game design is figuring out which of a thousand different options is the RIGHT one, especially if you have ten FANTASTIC ideas that would be INCREDIBLE in the game, but only have the development bandwidth to actually release two of them. How would you decide which two? How do you determine how much negative reaction to a change is to much negative reaction? And so on.\n\nHonestly though? I'm not sure what to recommend, because the field has a lot of ambiguity in it. There are a lot of traits that make a good designer, and I don't have enough professional experience in the field to give you a list of my personal recommendations.\n\nSo, to pull some things from Riot's career page for Game Designer...I've bolded what I personally feel are the most important, **but I'm not Riot, so actual mileage may vary.**\n\n>Experienced: you probably have experience in game development, but even if your previous trajectory was in law, analytic philosophy, or strategy consulting, **you're propelled by an engine of critical thought with unlimited theoretical horsepower**\n\n>Mission critical: **you concisely articulate game concepts with balanced persistence, analyze and ideate mechanics with equal and opposite force, and dismantle and assemble systems with both skill and aplomb**\n\n>A design maverick: you're fluent in many prevalent game systems and mechanics but have the critical thinking skills to know when it's time to defenestrate them in favor of something more radical; in other words, **you know the rules and know when to break them**\n\n>Intellectually curious: you've most likely earned a degree or two, but know education doesn't have an end date—you think on your feet and absorb new knowledge every day; you relish challenges for their learning opportunities, and know when to pummel a problem solo and when to recruit expert backup\n\n>To the point: **your verbal and written communications are crisp and clear**, distilled from complex ingredients into smooth, yet potent, shots of insight; your best work comes from a place of collaboration and teamwork and **you know that quality results come from dynamic communication throughout the design process**\n\n>Tech-friendly: you either have a technical or programming background, or **you think like an engineer and attack problems with the same systematic precision; **experience with scripting languages and designer tools is a definite plus\n\n----------------------------\n\n> What did they specifically see in you that lead them to having you for game design?\n\nOn the list above? I'm definitely well above average as far as analytical and critical reasoning go. My ideas are broad and often multi-faceted, although I perhaps get a little bogged down in a single direction instead of widening out to dozens of potential solutions, which can be a bit of a flaw.\n\nMy background is incredibly varied, and mixes philosophy, sociology, graphic design, UX/UI design, programming, marketing, and more. I have over ten years of amateur RPG design material to showcase, and headed up a few minor projects. I tend to be well-written (although I often need to work on being concise), and, as a result, my cover letters are often decent.\n\nPersonally? I think I got quite a push from having a friend in the company, given my level of experience going in. I have no actual proof, but I imagine my resume and cover letter alone weren't impressive at first, and it was only after talking to me the first time that they thought I was really worth interviewing further.\n\nBut I can't really speak for Riot, or what they saw in me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheTarians","date":"2015-12-09T02:41:45.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so what would you recommend to have if you are in the game design section?
