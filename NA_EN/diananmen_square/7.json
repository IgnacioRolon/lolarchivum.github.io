Im in gold and i constantly come across this problem just about every game. I always upgrade my yellow trinket asap, i mean its a mini sightstone for a measly 250g. Yet i have to beg teammates to spend it. I get replies like \"itll keep me from getting to my next item sooner\". All i can do is shake my head at these ppl. The value you get back from it is tenfold. Information is everything in LoL, and with a meager 250g you get loads of info on the whereabouts of the enemy team...which then in turn allows you to make moves for objectives etc. as for the red trinket i usually only upgrade it real early if im playing support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-06-26T22:48:01.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not under-rated, under valued.  Bad players don't ward... good players do.

If it wasn't for supports getting sightstone, I would be often the player with most wards placed.\n\nI mean. I'm Silver IV, and I never see anybody buy a ward. It's me, the jungler, who buys 2 {{item:2044}} and 1 {{item:2043}} to keep vision of the dragon or baron. I go base at level 9/10 and get my trinket upgraded ASAP. I don't see anybody else doing that, and I just hate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
