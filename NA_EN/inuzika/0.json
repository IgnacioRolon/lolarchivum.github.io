I also can't buy any 4800 Ip champion for the same reason. I can purchase the cheaper champions though, but I want to purchase fizz. Perhaps I will be able to after another game and it's not really a huge issue for me. I just thought I would bring it your attention that the store doesn't see the amount of Ip properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-28T00:36:31.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bug that occurs in the Beta Client every once in a while.
