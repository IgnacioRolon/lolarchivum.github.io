Incomm, the company who manufactures RIOT's RP cards, has no support facilities that I can find (I've tried contacting them in every possible way for over a month now). If your card is faulty RIOT refuses to help you redeem your RP and asks YOU (the paying customer) to go on a wild goose chase to contact Incomm to give you a code that works. This is disgusting, how can RIOT tell us that they are trying to create a more serious business image but refuse to take responsibility for a faulty product with their name on it?!\r\n\r\nTL:DR - RIOT doesn't give a fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T15:30:15.215+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"RP cards are handled by third parties, meaning we are unable to activate the cards ourselves, so we ask players to return to the store they purchased it to work things out.  We do not request that they contact the manufacturer of the cards themselves.  \n\nI looked into your specific issue  to see what's going on, and I see that you've had multiple tickets where we provided context.  The card you are attempting to use was already redeemed back in 2013, and isn't from your region.  We asked for screenshots of your card to try and help a few times, without a response back to us.  In this case, there's not much we can do.\n\nIf you have any further questions, our specialists will be happy to clarify in your ticket.
