I won't be discussing if her abilities are too strong or whatever, because we don't know that yet. I'm more concerned with the way her kit actually operates.\n\nKalista's kit requires her to bind herself to an allied champion, who she then synergizes with for the rest of the game. Without this mechanic, her abilities either cannot function, or only function in a gimped way. Her ult replaces a teammate's abilities- The first champion to ever have direct influence over another champion's personal agency- but it can only be done to a single ally for the whole game.\n\nThis also means her and this ally must be on the same page and have solid communication and understanding, as well as a plan.\n\nWhat does all this mean?\n\nIt means Kalista was designed specifically with pro play, and ONLY with pro play, in mind.\n\nKalista cannot operate in a disorganized setting, or in anything less than high levels of organization. What if her support AFK's? What if they are slow on the trigger and waste her ult? What if they misuse it? What if the support is actually upset because they had their own idea what they were going to do, and suddenly, all their abilities were replaced by Kalista's ult? What if the support sees an opportunity that Kalista's ult could exploit, but Kalista fails to ult at all because she didn't see it?\n\nIn pro play these problems do not exist. The ADC and the support are in constant communication and, past laning, mesh with the entire team. When Kalista operates in an organized setting she will be flashy, she will be a major influence, and she will make the #outplays. In disorganized play, aka solo queue, she will be worthless. Her winrate will tank hard, hit rock bottom, and determinedly plow a hole to go down some more. I can already see it coming. And then you'll see her in pro play and go \"what the hell, why cant I/my team play Kalista like that?\"\n\nAnd the answer will be because Riot never intended for you to play her. They didn't make Kalista for you. They don't care. They designed her around pro play, and thats where she will be played. I really hope I'm wrong and Riot makes some sort of contingency for idiot teammates in her kit, but if they don't, you're going to see an abysmal winrate everywhere but coordinated team play.\n\nEDIT: Perhaps accusing Riot of blatant disregard for everyone but pros is a bit melodramatic on my part, but its either that or they are *actually unaware* that her kit is inoperable in its current state. I can't decide which idea is worse, that Riot is malicious and simply doesn't care about non-pro play, or that Riot is woefully ignorant of how their own game operates.","replies":[]}
