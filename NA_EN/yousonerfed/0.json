That, and while helpful, it doesn't really create any gameplay for either side, and is about as passive as Zilean's Innate.\n\nCreating brush is pretty interesting, though, and is thematically rich while providing pretty strong kit foundation (I'd imagine a champion like this would have abilities that interact with brush in some way), especially for a support-oriented champion.

Then there is the issue of passing through the outer boundaries of the game.\n\nTenacity is that CC resistance. Swiftness boots have a slow reducing effect which would only work for slows since you are still completely active during or in one. Tenacity reduces the durations of all cc which is how all other cc is expressed. You would have to grant immunity for anything other than slows which olaf has.\n\nStat sharing, while an interesting idea, is counter productive to the player having to share. They are effectively making themselves weaker, reducing their effectiveness in combat, even if done willingly you would feel like you could no longer contribute fully until your stats return. This is why there are Aura items and abilities instead.\n\nAhh, I did not know you meant invulnerable objects. I kind of like that idea but it would have a drawback of how long it would last before disappearing, or its attacks would be very weak.\n\nDisarming, while neat in ideation, wouldnt make much sense since most champions do not use weapons. the act of disarming them would literally DISARM them. Amumu also has this ability in his ult.\n\nCloning doesnt work in LoL because of what LtRandolph said, the game does not allow more than movement and target control for additional unit manipulation. You would have to relinquish control of your champ in order to control the clone and vice versa. I can think of only one way that might make this possible while still fitting into the game but it would be a programming and resource nightmare. The macro and micro managing for the player would be insane as well. There is the other issue of stats, how much and from whom are the stats coming. An identical copy would immediately tip the favor for the team with the clone for however long it lasted. If it had reduced stats it would die to easily or barely contribute.\n\nI liked your thought of making a twins champ that were two champs in one in a sense. This actually gives me some awesome ideas for a champion concept I might try to flesh out. I have had similar thoughts myself about a duality champ but I didn't know an interesting way to implement it until just now.\n\nAnd I am sorry I did not go into greater detail as well last night.

Let's give them some more!\n\nHere's one that I've been trying to implement for a while: Fatal Bonds.\n\nIn DotA, the Warlock had the ability to link together several enemies with a debuff called Fatal Bonds. What happened was that when one of the bonded targets took damage, the other bonded targets would also take damage equal to a percentage of what the original target took. This was SCARY good for AOE compositions.\n\nImplementing it the same way in League wouldn't work, but I have a way to work around that.\n\nThis iteration of it comes from one of my Champion Concepts. (*Please don't get antsy about the numbers. The concept is what matters.*)\n> Yuurei releases dark spirits after a short wind-up, dealing 150/250/350 (+0.8 AP) magic damage to all enemies in a large area (550 radius) and slowing them by 30% for 2 seconds. This also curses the target area for 8 seconds. Enemy Champions in the AOE are afflicted with Fatal Bonds; when one takes Champion-based damage, all other Champions with Fatal Bonds also take 20% (10% for AOE and multi-target damage) of that damage (post-mitigation) as magic damage. Fatal Bonds has a total damage cap of 600/1000/1400 (+1.0 AP). Damage from Fatal Bonds cannot be lethal, instead reducing your health to 1 if it would otherwise be fatal. Damage from Fatal Bonds does not stack upon itself.\n140/120/100 second cooldown. Costs 125 mana.\n\nThis iteration has clear counterplay: Get off the cursed ground to remove the Fatal Bonds debuff. Additionally, the feedback damage is lower for AOE and multi-target damage so that it doesn't overwhelmingly favor AOE compositions. Lastly, the damage cap prevents Fatal Bonds from getting way out of control.\n\nI'm not sure if I've covered everything, but it's a good start, and I'd love to see a Champion with such a mechanic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yousonerfed","date":"2014-05-09T18:27:04.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here is my first one: Stealth on-ally.\n\nXypherous once told me that Riot is avoiding such a mechanic because it destroys certain counterplay. His example was that if you stealthed a Malphite, seeing his ultimate coming becomes impossible.\n\nMy solution to this? Make it so that if you stealth an ally, they cause an indicator to appear over the heads of nearby enemy Champions (ala Warwick's Blood Scent), telling them \"HEY, SOMEONE'S CLOAKED! BE CAREFUL!\" This makes the ability not nearly as good for stealth-ganks or initiates, but retains its functionality when used to save a teammate's life.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2014-05-09T23:25:28.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a way this could work would be in a way were instead of just stealthing an ally and allowing them to wreak havoc (since certain champions would be overwhelmingly powerful with even a short stealth), [having the stealth be champion-proximity oriented.](http://lolchampdesigns.blogspot.com/2013/01/wip-fogmire-fearsome-phantom.html) \n\nBy which, I mean, having a champion that could, say, create an area around itself wherein allies would be stealthed (only as long as they remain within the area) , allowing enemies to know that there is the possibility of stealthed enemies in that *very specific* area, and allowing for all sorts of bluffs and baits on the stealth-creator's end.\n\nIt would create a lot more room for healthy gameplay for both sides, and would prevent the countless abuse cases that simply stealthing an ally for however long could bring.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YourtrueKami","date":"2014-05-12T00:33:31.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two idea I think would be interesting to see. The first is a champion that has a blink/flash ability. Think of it like when Shen taunt's then flashes at the end. I see it as the first button press would be a dash and if you pressed it again before the dash ended then you would blink. This could be really interesting, imagine if each button press moved you in the direction of your mouse at the time of the button press. Or the simpler option would be the dash would go in the direction of your mouse but the blink would be forced to go the same direction. I personally like the option of being able to blink a different direction though. Of course, it would have to have some drawbacks for that kind of mobility. Such as slowing you character if you chose to use the blink, or maybe locking you out of flash/ghost.\n\nThe other idea, is more for a champion. I'd like to see a champion completely designed around tethering people. So the whole kit would be used to tether; enemies to enemies, enemies to allies, allies to allies, or maybe even just enemies to a spot on the map. Of course, in my mind it would be a support because I just see these tethers mainly used to strengthen/weaken the people that they are on. But I think some pretty cool things could be done with it and it would cause some interesting interactions in the game.\n\nJust some thoughts I've had, I might be the only one to find them interesting though lol.\n\nTL:DR To shorten the wall of text, a combination of a dash and blink (though of this when someone said dask by mistake) and a champion revolving around tethering/linking champions together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-05-10T03:09:57.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A self-sacrifice ult/skill- Unlocks at 7% hp, and deals fatal true damage to you, healing the 2 nearest allies, and moderately  slowing nearby enemies and granting them increased movespeed.\n\nWould need a long cooldown","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-05-09T20:49:05.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I made an expansive list based on some champion concepts I have:\n\n* Map-wide charge with direction changing.
