I have seen kled&#039;s get away with tethers and why should they while fizz and vlad do NOT get away with tethers?  Kled should not be breaking tethers when he hops off his Yoshi.  For real 100%.  I know plenty about balance. Been here since season 3 at least.  This may not be a big of a deal with a behind kled, BUT with a fed kled he will hop back on his Yoshi asap through sheer AA damage while sivir shielding a tether.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT IS BULLSHIT","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2017-08-27T21:02:17.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wanna say Kled, for all intents and purposes, becomes a different champion when he jumps off Skarl.
