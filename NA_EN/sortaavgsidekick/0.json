Thanks in advance.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Riot games....\r\n\r\nHi, I wanted to have a chat in this discussion board with one of your lead community managers or one of your head designers about casual players.\r\nI am one of those casual players, you can probably check my KDA on any of the hundreds of games I play (mostly AI), and I want to improve my skills.\r\nIt is a very big help when people on Youtube post guides on &quot;how to play League of Legends&quot; (this is sarcasm, it helps very little). The best way to improve skills is to challenge one&#039;s skills against tough opponents. But when those opponents or your allies bad mouth you for going 0/5/3 with 59 cs at 10 minutes, it leads to anger and frustration. If you would actually make an honest to god advanced or master level AI to practice against it would mean a LOT to all the casual players (not another F***KING April Fools joke). I want to improve but being called trash for missing last hit on minions is annoying. I cannot practice against intermediate AI as they aren&#039;t a challenge and those games usually last 15 minutes, barely enough time to hit level 11. I understand that your goal is probably to promote the actual PvP content, and that is fine. The &quot;master AI&quot; would allow us casuals to get to a point where we could actually stand a better chance to do PvP of any kind. For all the people who disagree with this proposal and say to &quot;get good&quot;, I cannot get good without a challenge, and PvP is a challenge out of my league (LITERALLY). I don&#039;t want to be challenged while any thoughts of improving are getting crushed by people who are clearly better than me and enjoy rubbing it in my face (metaphorically speaking of course).\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, \r\n\r\n             SortaConcernedSideKick","replies":[]}
