These past few years have been rough, and it&#039;s not been easy staying positive. Today is looking up, and it&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve been looking forward to the future and what it might hold. \r\n\r\nStraight out of high school I had a tumor that completely obliterated my inner ear, ruining my options at the time by keeping me bed ridden in recovery for almost 4 surgeries. In and out of surgeries every 6 months for almost 4 years, it prevented me from going straight to work or college. Finally however, in order to keep my health insurance, I had to leap into it and attend classes and a year later my English professor hired me as a tutor as well, even though to this day I still don&#039;t know why. Two years later, my infrequent cluster headaches that started concurring after my second surgery dramatically increased and I was blacking out from the pain while driving and going up and down stairs. Most days it was effort to just shower and get ready to go to work and class, and eventually the attacks became a weekly, and then daily, occurrence that finally took it&#039;s toll and, even with a spectacular boss and former teacher who was understanding of my dilemma, I could no longer attend classes and work and had to drop out of college...I was 24.\r\n\r\nThese last 5 years, I&#039;ve been unable to work and struggling to try to make some purpose or meaning of my life. Honestly, it&#039;s been my two family members who&#039;ve supported me this last decade, and my close friends whom I&#039;ve all met online via WoW or League who have kept me going. A year ago, I was gifted with a brief moment of hope for the future when a Social Security verdict was passed by a Judge who said I was in fact disabled and that these attacks qualified as epileptic seizures, rewarding me with full disability. However that flame was quickly extinguished when Social Security later said thanks to my family keeping me afloat over the years, I was no longer eligible for the back-pay I was to receive for fighting for disability the last 5 years. I now suffer my attacks 3 - 8 times a day, almost daily, and certainly weekly. Cluster headaches are immensely painful and the effect is something between a stroke and a seizure, and not only are they overwhelming during the attack but afterwards you&#039;re completely drained and incapable of functioning after some of the more powerful attacks. The worst part for me however isn&#039;t the attack itself, but the look of helplessness on the faces of those I care about. All they can do is watch from the sidelines as I lay on the ground pounding my head in, and clawing at my eyes trying to tear them out of their sockets, seizing on the ground all the while. For the longest time I genuinely didn&#039;t know, care, or want to make it this long...the notion of living through this for another few decades was too depressing to think of. That&#039;s changed though these last few years, and while the pain itself hasn&#039;t changed, in fact it&#039;s gotten more severe and more frequent, just knowing I have something out there, and friends to laugh with has made this journey so much more bearable.\r\n\r\nTo anyone out there suffering from depression or having a hard time in their life, know that it can always get better. That feeling of hopelessness and despair won&#039;t last forever, you just need to find something or someone that holds you together in your darkest moments, and hold onto that feeling of singular hope. If after nearly a decade of cluster headaches has taught me anything, it&#039;s that while this life holds many things in it that can tear and beat you down, all you need is one single life-saver to keep you afloat. If I were to have any birthday wish granted, it&#039;d be one...that everyone of you be safe, and find some joy in life, because life is far too fleeting to let all the problems that can happen distract you from the greatest, and most beautiful, moments you have had and are yet to have. That is my wish, and I hope it comes true more than anything. Be safe everyone, and don&#039;t forget to laugh and smile.","replies":[]}
