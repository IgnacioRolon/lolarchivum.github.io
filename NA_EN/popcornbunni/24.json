With Ornn W all the CC was applied to you with its full duration and if it was still present after the W ended you were still CCed. Irelia works the same way as shown in one of the clips. Olaf straight up doesn't get \"debuffed\" at all during Ragnarok. That being said if Irelia starts charging W and you throw a morg binding at her during the W she will STILL be rooted when it ends.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-03-21T07:54:42.654+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think chargetime is far better. With your suggestion she could just reduces Veigar w or ult damage with a small click and instantly after chuncks your health. \nLike how it is now she has realy have to make a big breake between the whole bladedancing and with a longer break she comes with more energy out of it again.

In it's current iteration the skill will always yield the same amount of utility and power regardless of what it's used against. i.e.: It'll be just as powerful against all sorts of dives, stuns, etc, rather than be used against key abilities for powerful reversals. I feel like the current iteration of the skill might be a little too consistent instead of having a \"success condition\" like Fiora's parry when hit with hard cc.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-03-21T22:52:29.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is this would maker her way stronger in low elo than high, and potentially make her more difficult to balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-03-21T17:50:04.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not every Ability needs to have a huge success condition. And at Fiora it makes sense, she actualy parries an attack with her Riposte cause she is a Duelist. Irelia is basicly an Artist with her Bladedance and all she does during w is rest and chill down a bit. Similar to Master Yi w (but his is weaker according to his Mains cause CC has a stronger effect on him). The w should clearly be not a main focus on her kit, q, e and r are the important abilitys that define her. While Fiora gets defined more by w together with q and r and less by her e for exampel.\nGalios Kit is centered around all Abilitys basicly but less around e as it is slow and predictabel. Still HE WAS the one that soaks in Damage duringa  taunt and returned the Damage with old Ult and now IS a champion that can move slowly during w but taunts after and not during it and also just for taunt duration and not damage. Riot proberbly thinkts it is not fair for a non Ultimate to return so strong and regularly heavy damage in short time rather than from long casts absed on the player who decides the outcome after all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onotori","date":"2018-03-21T23:00:00.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Grace bends, where strength breaks.\" -- her interaction with Darius. \n\nThe idea of absorbing an attack is the idea you're getting at, but Irelia doesnt absorb the attack, she dances around it and redirects it into your face.

Damage is increased with the momentum how long she dances with the blades, where is no redirecting as a whole cause Irelia just interacts with her blades and the blades with her and not she or the blades with an enemy.

Going back to Camille she also has % health damage on tactical sweep. Renekton has Fury empowered Dice which shreds armour (and is also just a big old lane bully), nasus has spirit fire as well as infinitely scaling damage, yasuo has his ult (and crit steroid), trundles ult is the ultimate counter to a tank.\n\nAatrox is probably one of the few that doesn't have any tools to rip a tank apart, but he has amazing no-item sustain which is a counter.
