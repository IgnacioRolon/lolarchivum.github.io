And a part of solving his issues needs to be addressing both levels of play -- weakening his impact in organized play while increasing his solo performance.\r\n\r\nIf you weren&#039;t aware, Ryze has some nerfs on the PBE meant to address these to an extent:\r\n\r\n-Ultimate cooldown raised drastically\r\n-E base damage up early, the same late, and damage to secondary targets halved.\r\n\r\nThe change to E increases his early dueling power while weakening his waveclear, one of the components which makes him so strong at higher levels. \r\n\r\nChanges like these are what should be looked at. Now, I don&#039;t think just wholesale weakening his wave clear in exchange for some minor buffs early is an equivalent trade, but it&#039;s the right idea. \r\n\r\nLooking for discussion on what changes could be made for him from the community here. I&#039;ll put my personal thoughts later in the thread but just wanted to open the discussion first and foremost.","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-03-04T18:58:49.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2018-03-04T19:17:30.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quiet Dude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v9L3PF63,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-03-04T18:58:49.286+0000)\n>\n> I think he needs a shirt, to be honest.\n\nYou could always play with his pIrate skin {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2018-03-05T05:13:29.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Donâ€™t forget that Ryze is one of those champs that scales with ping in addition to skill level, giving the average player ping is about 60-70, (mine however is usually 110, 300 afternoon and never went below 80) pro players play with 10-20 ping, making  combo spamming or precise skill shot champs such as rice and ezreal perform better at maximum potential","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-03-05T02:57:06.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't fix Ryze so that he's balanced in SoloQ and balanced in pro-play without either A) changing his kit or B) Changing the fundamental meta of pro-play\n\nAs long as Ryze is a hard scaling DPS mage with a near-global AOE ultimate he will always be an oppressive pick in high ELO/pro play regardless of his numbers.","replies":[]}]}
