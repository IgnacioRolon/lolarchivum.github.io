Even at this low level of play, she doesn&#039;t have a remarkable win rate at it only goes down at higher levels of play, but she simply is not fun to play against, even garnering a 3.6% ban rate over a 0.4% play rate in Platinum. Meanwhile she is a complete no-show at a competitive level; I can not comment with a great deal of knowledge why that is, but I imagine it&#039;s because she falls apart when a coordinated team can get in on her down-time while she has little way to interact of her own.\n\nI propose changes to add more opportunities for counterplay from Illaoi&#039;s opponent while also letting her capitalize on her strengths and have better rewards at higher-level play. These aim to address Illaoi&#039;s early game and first few levels where she should be the weakest while improving her team fighting contribution. Essentially, the goal is to make the &quot;playing as/against Illaoi&quot; tips actually reflective of what you want to do with/against her.\n\nTentacles:\n_Faster Tentacle spawns when roaming, slower regrowth during laning, more consistent interaction with various champion toolkits, more pacing required on Illaoi&#039;s part. Damage chunks % health to better interact with Test of Spirit (E)_\n\n* NEW!: Tentacles can not spawn near  the same spot as a recently killed tentacle for 15 seconds, lowered by 5 seconds for each rank of Leap of Faith (R)\n\n* Tentacle spawn timer 20 (at level 1) - 12 (at level 17) seconds -&gt; 16 (at level 1) - 10 (at level 13) seconds\n\n* NEW!: Tentacles can be targeted by spells, but still take no damage from area-of-effect spells, and one damage from targeted spells\n\n* Reduced damage from several tentacles: 50% if hit by a tentacle in the last 0.5 seconds\n\t-&gt; 50%, and another 50% reduction for each other tentacle that hit in the last 1 second\n\tdown to a minimum of 25%\n\n* Tentacle damage 10-180 (based on level) +120% Total AD (Not accounting for Tentacle Smash&#039;s bonus damage)\n\t-&gt; 5% of target&#039;s current health + 100% Bonus AD\n\n\nTentacle Smash (Q)\n* Cost 40/45/50/55/60 -&gt; 60 at all ranks\n* Cooldown 10/9/8/7/6 seconds -&gt; 20/18/16/14/12 seconds\n* Passive Tentacle damage bonus 10/15/20/25/30% -&gt; +3/6/9/12/15% of enemy&#039;s current health\n* NEW!: Tentacle Smash slows all enemy champions hit for 50%, decaying over 1.5 seconds, during which time they are grounded\n\n\nTest of Spirit (E)\n* Cooldown 20/18/16/14/12 seconds -&gt; 18 seconds\n* NEW!: Upon hitting a minion, deals 50% of the minion&#039;s health +100% AD. If this kills the minion, a tentacle is spawned near it, if possible, causing near-by tentacles to slam over the area of the killed minion\n\n. \n\nI&#039;d like to hear  feedback from Illaoi players, other low-level players, and anyone familiar with what makes for healthy gameplay on these and other possible modification to the priestess&#039;s moveset.","replies":[{"poster":"Shifue Draven","date":"2017-07-16T07:15:12.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering i have been picking up illaoi recently and studying her a bit as my fall back top. I hate to tell you that your wrong and here is why.\n\n1) She is a juggernaut with the likes of ones like darius(which i hate to see what you think of him) she is of course strong and can take a beating but she is slow(here is counterplay one) so you can litterally run circles around her and she can't catch you which means either A) we have to build speed boots (less tanky) or take ghost for short chasing burst or take something like stormraider( which feels like a wasted mastery to me). OR B)keep the tanky boots and pick a better mastery and not keep up to chase you. and she can be easily ganked due to this.\n\n2)All but w and r are skills shots so you can dodge them easy(counterplay two) and the animations take forever and can not be canceled. W is an empowered auto that gives a little more distances but again we have to catch you with it as well as r which requires w to be used to.\n\n3)Her extra tentacles are easy to deal with....don't go near them or kill them(counterplay three) they sit right at the walls and even then they only spawn in certain places on said walls so go to the other side and when she does the same move and kill the other or just stay out of range of her w while near one it's rather simple.\n\n4)Your fixes would completely gut her and make her a slow tanky nothing that can't lane or even team fight. illiaoi is only good for 3 things split pushing, objective control ,and team fights. if you strip anything of hers she will be like the old urgot and just a tanky nothing that really has no place.\n\nSo this being said she has a lot of counterplay you just have to know how to counter her which is the problem for most lol players they scream op before they look at a way to solve the issues cause why i picked this person and i should have won or i can't beat it so it's broke.\n\nThink of it like mortal combat it's like subzero he feels like the most broken thing to fight against cause if you don't watch it bam ice ball and frozen in place for free damage.but when you learn how to dodge it  or stop it well he does not have much more in the tank to fight with does he? then he has to relay on his real fighting skill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-16T03:44:03.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"illaoi is literally nothing but counterplay through attacks that are either avoidable, interruptable, or hard-countered just by walking away from her. even her achieving her win condition gives you room to mitigate her success\n\nall your changes gut her for the sake of dog shit silvers who want to bumrush everything and get mad when a champ specifically designed to counter that is doing their job. \n\nno to 100% of this, you don't understand the champion","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-07-16T06:34:00.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This man speaks the truth.

Increasing Tentacle damage and reward is not anything close to gutting her, nor is adding a soft-case reward for her E. This is a combination of straight buffs, straight nerfs, and complete tweaks. This lets her set up wider and faster arrays of tentacles when roaming mid or teleporting bot after a push, while giving her larger downtimes and more interaction during laning. \n\nIf you disagree that that is a healthy way to address the character that's fine, but to dismiss everything without adding anything to the conversation is petty at its best and downright inflammatory at its worst. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Bubbaman73,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oE8Bqtgr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-16T03:39:17.890+0000)\n>\n> She does need some changes if she wants to be played and viable across all ranks but these changes simply wont do it.\n\nWhat kinds of changes do you think she could use that would both improve her performance against coordinated teams and lower her banrate to something more reflective of her player base's size?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-16T04:06:20.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you NERFED its damage. 5% current health is nothing that she needs and neuters her damage against squishy opponents. 120% total to 100% bonus is a MASSIVE NERF.

Illaoi hunkers down in one lane to splitpush hard and tries to bait people into coming into her zone where she can dominate them. And even then, that isn't guaranteed because there are many champions that effortlessly hard-counter her. \n\n>If you disagree that that is a healthy way to address the character that's fine, but to dismiss everything without adding anything to the conversation is petty at its best and downright inflammatory at its worst.\n\nthis post isn't worth anything but dismissal","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-07-16T05:04:00.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Call me noob and/or trash but personally, I hate facing her.  I can't farm when she does her \"Test of spirit\" so I back off until I get those things off of me, then by the time I come back to lane after dealing with her tentacles it's back up again.  I can't fight her when she pulls my spirit because then she has 2 targets that deals damage to me( me and my spirit), so fighting her is annoying if she does indeed land her skill-shot.  \n  Can't get \"tanky\" because the more HP I have the more dmg she does with her \"harsh Lesson\" building any sort of armor is useless because her first item is Black Cleaver and at that point it's somewhat useless considering Riot is making every armor item have a$$ load of HP in it.  \n  I personally just ban her every/any time I get top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"DU Baymax","date":"2017-07-16T06:51:40.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play {{champion:122}} \n\nwin lane\n\nez","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-07-16T07:06:35.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels risky honestly, I'v done better with Darius against her but it still sucks facing against her.
