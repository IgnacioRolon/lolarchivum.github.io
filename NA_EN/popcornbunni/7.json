Because the way I'm looking at it, as just tanky fighters, it would seem the opposite to the board's view.

Meanwhile Olaf is considered a diver instead of a juggernaut (I can agree with this). Note that Olaf was previously considered a juggernaut in a previous attempt to classify champions about 2 years ago.\n\nand then Dr. Mundo is classified as fighter, instead of tank, when his entire kit is based around HP (has HP regen boost & MR boost), and literally everyone builds tanky on him right away instead of 1 item with AD/AP then into tanky items like traditional juggernauts.\n\nalso, why is cho'gath classified as unique playstyle when he seems to me like a warden tank (this I'm not sure, so I'm not going to disagree that quickly)\n\nalso, why is quinn unique playstyle when she's more of a hybrid marksman/assassin? \n\nif anything, jayce seems more like a unique playstyle. I know his Q is very potent and all but a huge number of circumstances involve throwing himself into the midst of battle unlike velkoz, xerath, and ziggs, who almost never shove their faces into the enemy team. \n\nand then there's Jhin who's listed as hybrid Catcher but not Ashe?\n\nand I don't know if I would even mildly agree with their decision to lump Ashe through Xayah into one class without subclasses because Jhin clearly plays differently than Kog'Maw or Vayne","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-01-29T14:56:41.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key point to remember is that there is no point to this classification in itself. It's just a tool to analyze and compare different champs and to group relevant champs with similar kits together. A champ being officially sub-class X just means that's how Riot see them, but it's only a starting point, not a final word.\n\nThat being said, I was rather disappointed with the last version of the classification, and I disagreed with most of the changes compared to the previous one. So when we disagree on what the starting point even is, that doesn't help discussion... Below, a few case by case comments.\n\n_____________\n\nFor Olaf and Shyvana, the back and forth between the different versions of the classification suggests to me that the current version just needs another sub-class. Other people that would go with Olaf and Shyv in that new sub-class would be Warwick, Volibear, Trundle, Udyr, etc. I've made a suggestion about that (and some other thing) here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fSghVIlb1XdodKU0ze_gY4a57qwFFZWtuVX_d3Daryg/\n\nMundo is very definitely a Juggernaut, this one decision is perfectly sane and sound. He only has soft, single target CC, no way to peel for an ally, and no way to lock-down an enemy team with a big engage. In other words, he lacks all the key strengths of a proper Tank. His contribution to a team is mostly his own damage and not dying. That's what a Juggernaut provides, not a Tank.\n(Note that if the additional sub-class I mentioned above was created, he might go there, but in the current system, there is no hesitation, he's clearly more Fighter than Tank, and he is no Diver, so he must be a Juggernaut.)\n\nFor the various Marksfolks, I'm more hesitant because I don't know those champs as well but what you've got to keep in mind is that: What do they provide to the team? Not what they look like.\nSure, Quinn \"looks like\" an ADC. But what will a good Quinn do in a game to get her Victory? Probably NOT stay in the middle of her team, close to her Support and Tank, contrary to \"real\" ADCs. She won't stay on the flanks either, waiting for an opportunity to jump into the enemy backline, because despite her super high MS, she has no good, free-range mobility like a true Assassin such as Zed, Kata, etc. Instead, she will try to roam, disorganize the enemy team, and hopefully win without ever needing to team-fight. So in the end: it's true that she has elements of both Marksfolk and Assassin, but what she actually does with those elements is neither what an ADC nor what an Assassin do. Her output is clearly different, and she has a truly unique playstyle.\nNeither Ashe nor Jhin suprise me being or not being a Catcher, but I couldn't say which one the two most \"deserve\" it. Maybe Jhin, I agree, but I wouldn't be categorical. But more broadly, Riot tried to differentiate Marksfolks using \"hybrid\" notations, and I don't think that was a good idea, when all Marksfolks are still mostly here for their damage. Basically, Marksfolks are all here to provide damage+a little something, and the little something helps differentiate them **between all Marksfolks**, but it is not the main reason you pick them **over, say a Mage or a Controller**.\nAnd I don't think most ADC play *that* differently from each others. Not to the point that they need different sub-classes. Ashe and Vayne play differently, but compare them to Ziggs versus Vladimir, and they suddenly look pretty similar.\n\nJayce, on the other hand, would be a good use of the hybrid notation, IMHO. What's the ouput he provides? Poke at the start of a fight, then he swap form and act as a Diver with weak CC. But he really plays like an Artillery at some points, and like a Diver at some others, not a uniquely different playstyle like Quinn. Jayce as a pure Artillery, though, I'm not convinced.\n\nCho'gath is an odd beast. I'd qualify him as an unreliable Tank with heavy damage to compensate, except that an unreliable Tank is no good Tank, and a Tank isn't interested in compensatory damage, it's not their job to deal damage. Maybe that's enough to make Cho a unique playstyle, maybe that just means he's outdated, I don't really know. But when you say he's a Warden, compare what he can do to what Poppy or Braum can do, and you'll see that he's not a *good* Warden.","replies":[]},{"poster":"r4ndomkill","date":"2018-01-27T00:30:51.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mundo might build straight tank but that doesn't make him one, he just has all of his damage built into his kit so he only needs things to keep him alive instead of giving him anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-01-26T10:39:26.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ this.

A lot of them look to carry in the midgame due to higher, non-scaling, flat damage that some of those items provide before being outscaled by the range and DPS (via crit/AD/AS) of ranged AD carries.\n\nPrototypical bruisers build items like this: Triforce - Cleaver - Titanic - Sterak's - Death's Dance - BotRK (in the past) - Maw - Frozen Mallet (in the past) - Gunblade (rarely) - Iceborn (rarely) - Warmog's - Wit's End (sadly, extremely rarely).\n\nIMO, the most absolute, archtypical, \"cannot go wrong if you call them a bruiser\" champions look something like Kled, Olaf, Jax, Renekton, Irelia, and Xin. Ideally, when these champions are fighting in the midgame, their opponents aren't exploding or anything, but these champs at this point in the game should be winning DPS races due to their spells, CC, and items spec'd for damage and enough survivability to utilize that damage.\n\nThey're not gonna win teamfights in a 5v5 because they tend to excel at picking on a single target and \"duelling\" them down, if given the opportunity, hence when they tend to be decent splitpushers.\n\nI'm not going to comment on game balance or the state of the class of champion or anything like that. This archetype is supposed to have a clearly designed window of power in which to force the hand of the opponent by being separate from their team (should the situation need it) putting pressure on static objectives like towers and, in turn, eliciting a response from the enemy team, lest they lose a tower or even an inhibitor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hugmeharder","date":"2018-03-24T10:52:17.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly speaking, non. The only good bruiser currently in the top lane is{{champion:164}}  because since a couple of years back there were these discussions on this forum regarding how insane they were for their burst damage especially most adc that were having problems. So for the next few patches riot kinda went overboard at such an extent to resolve this issue that the whole 'concept' of bruisers was at a verge of extinction. Most of the champs that have been listed above once used to be bruisers but currently most people play these champs as tanks now. This is because the last few months more importance has been given to tanks and 'bruisers' were the only class of champions who could leech the hell out of tanky champs with their burst damage. Thus, another reason why currently in the top lane there has been choices of choosing tanky champs over bruisers. Also bruisers are not complete tanks but are kinda hybrids on the basis of buying damage and health items but champions like {{champion:154}} ,{{champion:78}} {{champion:113}} and many more are pure tanks who just don't die easily.

Bruisers historically shine in lower elos and struggle in high elos, they are usually quite straight forward to play, strong at punishing mistakes, but easy to outplay as a team if you know what you're doing.\nEspecially in high dimond and beyond, many champs that can destroy low elos become non viable, while many champs with generally bad performance become busted. Ryze for example totally wrecks the game up there, but sucks pretty hard in lower elos.\nAlso, player experience and playrate are immmportant when talking about winrates. Many of the current high winrate tops have a low playrate(barely above 1%) and are mostly played by diehard mains(morde for example)\nAt the same time, many of the 'FotM' toplaners get played by not that experienced players and thus have lower winrates than you#d expect. \nExeprience is a very important factor in top, many matchups are rather close and can snowball heavily, and more often than not it's about knwledge(experience) rather than raw mechanics so the difference between a OTP and FotM player is pretty massive.\n\n\nAnother thing is precived power and champion fantasy.\nShyvana for example performs pretty well right now, but all her power comes from her absurdly hgih clearspead and good dueling, so she just gets a huge XP and gold lead over the other jungler. On equal gold/XP in mid to lategame, she doesn't look any strong at all, and her teamfigthing later on, which is supposed one of her stregths and once upon the time also was, is pretty pathetic in higher elos.\nAlso, if played toplane, she just struggle alot. So yea, she performs well, but all that power comes from fas clears and if you can't snowball on the back of that, she does feel pretty weak, while the fantasy of the dragon lady(atleast for me) would be becomeing a lategame raidboss for teamfights(which was the case in S2/3).\n\nAnd for most bruisers it's similar, they can do well early and snowballl on the back of that, buff if they hit mid/late on even terms, they feel completely usless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-01-26T03:57:49.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopcornBunni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sATkz9IE,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-26T03:34:43.513+0000)\n>\n> So what exactly do people mean when they say that &amp;quot;bruisers&amp;quot; aren&amp;#039;t doing well?
