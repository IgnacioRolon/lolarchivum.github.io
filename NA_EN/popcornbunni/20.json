That is, they play fighting game in top lane which just happens to be situated in Summoners Rift. Rather than playing the actual game. Second issue, prevalent in lower elos which ties with previously stated, is that people don't understand what laning phase is. Laning phase is for getting gold and denying gold to your opponent. That's the core fundamental. Not kills, not outplays, bug gold. Kills and outplays may help to deny gold, but you won't transit to impactful mid game if you wasted your time chasing KDA around.\n\nSecond part of the big issue, which I think is unsolvable given how it's being handled, is bruisers being more and more useless as the game develops. Game went forward a lot. Mixed arms / team fighting became standard, well, because it simply works. It's more efficient. And such team compositions favor specialists, not jack of all trades which many bruisers tend to lean towards.\n\nSo unless you'll find what kind of unique stuff bruisers can bring to the table of mixed arms team composition on their own, there is nothing which can be done without breaking or gutting other elements of the game. Or making champions broken OP. Make bruisers more tanky? Tanks will be pointless. Make bruisers more damagy, carries will become pointless. Make them balanced? there will be no point of picking bruisers over any of the other specialists. Good example of things getting broken was tri-force ekko / fizz in season 6. By buffing bruisers directly you'll end up with similar result.\n\nSo why people don't take another carry top lane? Because it's a dangerous long lane, which mid laners / carries have difficulty surviving given very long chase distance.\n\nAnd it's not something \"rito did\". Nope, it's the path the player-base moved towards due to them improving and learning the game. Back in season 2 game was very dynamic because many people even in top ranks have no idea what they were doing. I can sypathize with frustration, but in my view, none of the changes being proposed solves the issue and we are still stuck in perpetual cycle and will remain so with added collateral damage  if random changes will be implemented based on whines \"I have bad experience\". Pointing to recent hashinshin drama.\n\nQuite mindblowing how a guy who has no idea what he's talking about gets implicitly elected as voice for the 'community'. I guess that just shows that community is all rage and no sense. I guess it's easier to blame something else, your team, rito, for being bad at the game. Common pitfall.

It's been a while since I agreed with a random person on these boards as much as you. Of course, I just agreed with your first paragraph for the most part.\n\nEveryone wants to complain about dying a few times to enemy jungle, but no one wants to take courage and keep pushing anyway. No one wants to use teleport to help the team get something done while the opposing teleport got used to wreck them, resulting in a single death for their team as opposed to potentially more than one for the enemy team trying to get dragon or going on a big chase.\n\nSadly, I feel like some people play bottom like it's a shooter game, the same issue that top lane has. Don't play a team strategy game without remembering what kind of game it is, or you're going to frustrate your allies.\n\nBut really, bruisers are not in such a bad spot. There's a reason the pros commonly buy Black Cleaver in the top lane. So they can enhance the damage of their ADC at bottom lane. So they can support their team. Just because one slot is labeled 'support' doesn't mean other champs don't support the team. To be more accurate, that slot should be called lane support. There are other item choices that a bruiser can get which will often give more benefit to both them and the team if bought on them compared to say a lane support buying them, such as Righteous Glory and Locket of the Iron Solari. Do those items give them glorious damage? No, but they subtract from the opposing team's damage, and that counts for more than many players are willing to admit.\n\nThey also fail to acknowledge how much impact their champ can have in team fights. Because they don't care about their team's potential. They don't care about the K/D/A of the rest of their team, only their own K/D/A. Wasting time trying to pad your K/D/A may result in significant sacrifices of your teammates that you may not be prepared to handle in future events.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Banbutsu Sozo","date":"2018-02-26T06:49:59.312+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't make sense.\n\nIt's been long known that Soraka can solo lane well and hold her own.
