Ive played one or two games of a champ. Now what would be more usefull vague reminder of what skill I want to use or the actual fuking ability and how much premitigation damage or stats its gonna give? Why would I ever need to the tooltip to tell me that Aatrox e is dash and a small burst of ad that can be used to reposition q. After playing the champ one game I should be able to remember that.

Some people appreciate the extra info (veterans) while many players do not and would be turned off from playing the said champion if Riot threw all the (currently irrelevant) information right at their faces, expecting them to immediately understand the nuances of how a champion should perform at their best/worst.","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2018-06-28T23:56:49.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it a toggle and move on.

I played Aatrox on PBE and i noticed the new tooltip format.\nThe fact that you find it problematic doesn't mean it's bad.\nIt honestly feels like Riot can't do any change anymore unless it lands perfectly into everyone's sweetspot that leaves you singing praises instead of admonishing them.\n\nWe wanted the new tooltips months/year or so ago, this is the starting point.\nRiot has to change the entirety of the way they do the tooltips because they were, until know, being done manually for each champion. Aatrox's tooltips is the new format/tool to help them script it out in few easy steps (without the need to translate everything again on multiple languages) and doing so manually for 700+ abilities in the game.\n\nFor the moment, it's only Aatrox who has them so that Riot can take these tooltip tests/feedback and further iterate when they start implementing it in future patch batches. So it's not really something that you should be screaming about that it's hurting your eyes or dumbing you down, considering that it's only available in less than 1% of the actual tooltips.","replies":[{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2018-06-28T14:32:57.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its as easy as having a \"Simplified tooltips\" option in settings and having it checked on by default. more experienced players would uncheck that box in the options menu and newer players would not even know it exist. but having this hold shift for an actual tooltip with clarity is just bad and it does not take much thought to see that.

Since E is an aimed cast, it only goes off when you release the keybind for it, meaning there's going to be that much delay from when you intend to use it. Easy solution would be to make it an instant cast since it's such a short dash who's distance can't be altered. \n\nThere's another more spaghetti-code issue with it though where it seems right clicking sometime between the Q and E clicks makes the ability not come out no matter what until the current Q has finished.\n\nFix your game riot.","replies":[]}]}
