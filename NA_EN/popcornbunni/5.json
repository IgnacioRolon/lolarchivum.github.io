There's no good at all that can come from gloating and griefing after a win.\r\n\r\nPeople say it when they steamroll the other team. People say it when they've barely won a game. \r\n\r\nAll it does (and is designed to do) is to infuriate the other team, and creates a shitty atmosphere for all involved. Even RQers  and demanding top laners that blame everything on jg are less cancerous than the \"gg ez\" crowd.\r\n\r\nCan this just end please.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2020-01-19T20:44:14.248+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"People who say this usually have such low-self esteem, that it's the only way that it's one of the only things that can make them feel good.

I then copy and then paste a long winded explanation from a txt doc on my desktop into the end game chat that explains why this is unsportsmanlike and I ask them to refrain from doing it in the future. \n\n\"GGEZ\" is not banter, it is just being a dick. Yes this is common in net gaming but it should not be the norm. We should all try our best to make gaming a less toxic environment. \"GGEZ\" the the perfect phrase to use as a stepping stone to this end.\n\nThe response to what I paste is often along the lines of  \"lol, suck a dick\" followed by spamming \"GGEZ\" a couple more times. But I will not let this get me down I shall persist and do my part try and combat this type toxicity, doing my part to make LOL a healthier and more inclusive environment. \n\n-Inuksuk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2020-01-20T12:16:41.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, i also hate players who compliment our Ezreal for playing good.
