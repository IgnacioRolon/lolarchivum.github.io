Players just as low of skill as I am calling myself (And others on their team) out as being trash, should uninstall, r%%%%%ed, etc.. I was wondering if this was a consequence of them just projecting their own inadequacies, or something which gets even worse as players move through ranks and become increasingly intolerant of misplays. \r\n\r\nSo I'm putting a poll here to find out. I would greatly prefer if the responses are from players that have  played or witnessed extensively the kind of banter that goes on in the different levels of play, to get a better perspective on what goes on.","replies":[{"poster":"TIKrunk","date":"2020-01-13T18:40:44.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I've found myself in Iron again, I'm not too pleased with the players I've run into.\nHad multiple people say they were just fucking around on purpose, because fuck everybody.\nHad one person say they were going to AFK at the start of the match, and then did it.\nHad another player leave the match after 1 death, only to come back 20-25 minutes later to tell the team struggling to 4 v 5 \"this is why you'll always be stuck in this ELO\"\n\nHonestly, if that's the kind of players you run into...yeah...I can imagine I'll be stuck there quite a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-13T18:02:04.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze was bad\nsilver was a nightmare\ngold actually was okay.\nplat was bad again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lamakisser","date":"2020-01-14T14:09:03.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"every level of this game is pure toxic","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2020-01-13T19:11:10.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother (who has been from Bronze 5 in Season 3 to high Diamond since Season 6) says that intense chat toxicity is more prevalent below Diamond, but people soft-int and get moderately angry super often in Diamond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2020-01-13T18:35:35.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from my perspective at Diamond 2, I'd say silver or plat.
