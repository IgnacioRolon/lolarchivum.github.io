Her one knock up is her W, which you have to dash/jump inside or against to even trigger the knock up, which isn't even that long.\n\n2. Her other knock up is on her ultimate, which if you instant-cast it without charging, has a knock up that is even weaker in duration than {{champion:12}} Q and the cooldown is 10 times longer. The AOE around it is even smaller.\n\n\nAlso no gap closers on them? Garen's Q makes him run 30% faster for up to 3.5 seconds, and it can remove some slows on him. It also has a low cooldown of 8 seconds (after you swing with it). This is three times a lower cooldown than Poppy's movement speed buff which doesn't even start off at max speed.\nMundo's ult obviously has a munch longer cooldown, but he still moves a lot faster with it. Not to mention he can literally perma slow you with cleavers which slow you by a whopping 40% movement speed even at level 1.\nLet's also not forget that both of these champions have a good chunk of built-in tenacity in their kits, whilst Poppy has none, giving them a much easier time for them to stick on whoever they're targeting.\n\nAnd Garen literally has a point and click *true damage* ultimate which does more damage based on the opponent's *missing health* -- so you can't even build against aside from not having the most kills in the match. If that's not \"stat checking\" then I don't even know what is.\n\nAlso, Garen and Mundo have no mana to manage. Poppy does. And her stun can be counter played by not standing near a wall. That's not exactly difficult, leaving her only real source of reliable hard CC being her ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"LichKing234","date":"2018-04-26T08:45:09.071+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"^all of this not to mention that also have built in higher passive healing by lvl 11 you can never force a garen out of lane again (and sometimes before lvl 11 if he built {{item:3065}} ) he jsut backs off and heals all the dmg you did to him away, Mundo just hits R and just cleaves you to death while also dealling all the dmg with an E not to mention they are also tanky as hell and are champs that punishes mistakes heavily \n\nalso garens Q silences you so you cant make any fancy plays and his E is basically a mini {{item:3071}} passive so he runs at you has 85% dmg reduction uses his sword for you to shut the fuck up then spins on you removing your armor and god hope your not the villain cause if so here comes a True dmg Missing health ult then he jsut leaves and heals away the dmg you did to him.\n\ni mean yeah once apon a time poppy was broken as shit but they are still nerfing her when shes not even meta and saying its stat checking (one of the biggest lies told)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-04-26T07:02:46.847+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean 800 gold just tosses 40% of all of that out a window...","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-04-26T07:11:37.887+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and then he'll be back in the state he is now. \n\nBuying GW's just puts his ult back into the state it is now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryrynounet","date":"2018-04-26T08:00:50.403+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo stack hp and the new liandry kill him pretty hard + you can get bork against him instead of a dominik and finally GW is purchasable by everyone making is ult nearly ineficient","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-04-26T03:32:59.166+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah it's pretty fucking wild.

So in reality the only problematic issue with poppy was her old ult. \n\nEven with her current kit its obvious poppy WANTS to stick to people and fight, but riot is trying so hard to steer away from that nature. But whats worse is that these clowns are even nerfing her tankiness. Ridiculous.

Mundo on the other hand needs a buff. His only reason for being strong was in ultimate and that one gets hardly countered by grevious wounds. And mundo without ult is nothing. For garen I'm surprised. He is as much of a stat check and yet they are buffing his stats. Those are already high enough to out DMG most laners.","replies":[]}]}
