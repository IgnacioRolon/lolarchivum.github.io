I highly doubt it wouldn't be a Tank Ekko or Fizz, but he might build more like a DIver.\nI'm not sure where you got the idea for letting AA refresh Passive stacks, but if you got the idea from Vel'Koz then you need to keep in mind that Artillery Mages need encouragement to interact with the enemy during laning phase so they don't spam spells from a safe distance.\nThe bleed already gives enough time to react.  **It is fine as is.**\n\nTalon already has enough ways to get in and out of fights.  Q can get him in, E can get him in and/or out, and R's stealth and MS can be used to escape and/or close the gap between him and an opponent.  The R can also be used to get him to a wall he can jump over.\nAdding a blink to R will just inflate his power budget.\nSame goes for the untargetability.  The stealth is his defensive tool.  Also making him untargetable could disable his ability to move during that time, use Q, and/or cast W.  \n\nWhat is intangible even supposed to mean?\n\nThe Q damage change just makes the order you use it in your burst combo predictable and makes Talon even weaker againsts Enchanter when they are nearby the target.  It doesn't really add much, and Is overall unneeded.\nAlso if you get both conditions it just seems needlessly powerful.\nThe Q shield change just isn't really needed~~, and may encourage lifesteal and Death's Dance since Talon would be able to add the shield on top of his theoretical sustain.~~\n\nOverall, most of these changes seems unnecessary, encourage more tackiness, unnecessarily inflate his power budget, and/or outright weaken him.\nTalon's kit is fine.  He is a well designed Assassin.  He does not require major changes.\n\nI am fine with the Passive stacking on large monsters.  Take that with a grain of salt, since I don't know much about Jungle Talon.\n\nEDIT: Realized that, due to the nature of the shield, I didn't make a good point with the sustain build.  I left it there, but struck through it.\nAlso I already know Talon sometimes builds DD, I was just trying to say it would make it a better buy for Talon.","replies":[]}]}
