Ahri's mobility is tied to her R, which has your standard cooldown. Her passive relies on actually hitting her enemies x2, adding on skill cap, and making it very unlikely to be used all the time either. She burns her R and she's screwed. Charm's skillshot hitbox is small as well. Whiff it and you're doubly screwed. Meanwhile, other non AP champions who has mobility + defense don't need to aim.  And to be fair, with a lot of mobility in this game, if she is caught without her ult, she's dead meat anyways, even with her E. \n\nMeanwhile, the ones listed above. \n\nMore than 1 mobility skill outside of ult: \nAkali: W, E, and R.\nGraves: E, and R\nKaisa: E and R\nKayn: Q and E\nKha'Zix: E and R\nYi: Q and R\nPike: W, E, and R\nTalon: Q, E, R\nZed: W and R\n\nThe others have 1 mobility + a form of shield or other type of non-skillshot defense:\nCamille: E and Passive\nIrelia: Q and W/E\nYasuo: Passive, W, E, R \nJax: Q and E/R\n\nOnly 3 on there either has 1 type of mobility or none:\nXayah: R\nSion: R\nJhin: Reload passive","replies":[{"poster":"Shigure","date":"2018-10-15T02:01:47.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeh her passive is real hard to proc... requiring only 2 hits from 3 abilities which hit multiple times (2x on Q, 3X on W, 3x on R)  2 of them prioritising champions, and the one which isn't a multi-hit almost guaranteeing another ability will hit to proc it anyway. It's almost impossible for Ahri not to proc it in a trade or when ganked as she simply needs to press W and/or Q to proc it. Charms hit-box is standard hit-box and as i said as a champion with a triple dash she should be vulnerable when her mobility spell is down and she misses her CC.\n\nOk onto the champs you listed.\n\nYou specified more then 1 mobility skill without ult then listed Ult as the 2nd mobility spell for half of them so can ignore Graves,Kai'sa, Kha'Zix, Yi, Zed for the sake of this argument (and Kayn doesn't count to begin with since he uses both in his engage and both are horrid forms of escape). The rest i can agree with, Talon and Akali are too safe and Pyke is getting nerfed next patch specifically because of how easily he escapes once in with the tank build however he also uses all of the above for engage so eh goes either way. You also have to factor in that majority of these are melee and have to go into melee range to do anything so are much more risky then a champ that stays at 550+ range whenever possible.\n\nFor the 1 mobility + shield or non skill-shot defense you can add Ahri to that since she gets a heal from her Q as that's a form of sustain same as a shield. \n\nHonestly it seems like your argument is Ahri is fair because she is vulnerable when her mobility spell is down whilst all these champs are not whilst almost all of them are in a much riskier situation assuming their mobility spell is down and have a much weaker form of mobility/escape then Ahri and her triple dashes in the first place.
