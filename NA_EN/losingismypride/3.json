The only issue is that because the crystal Buffs are more or less invisible power, essentially just stat Buffs, it would be very frustrating to have to try to play around that sort of ability as once he has it there's nothing you can do to get it off of him aside from just not being around until it wears off. Some people think that the natural counter is to destroy them whenever they pop up, but the only person who can reliably do that is the jungler, as the crystals are located deep in the jungle and that would be extremely dangerous and borderline suicidal to consistently try to shut down as a laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wert the Wacky","date":"2017-12-11T23:28:58.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like playing Skarner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-11T19:51:40.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean if his buff lasted for some amount of time after he left the crystal zone?\n\nor do you mean something else?
