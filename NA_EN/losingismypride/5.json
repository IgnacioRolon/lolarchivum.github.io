I mean i feel like the game was in a beta for so long and now they put these thing and were like ohhhh i already see that so wht is new , wht is appealling , why would not i go play dota 2 where you dont have a single chance to get your account suspended cuz of a chargeback of 357 $ USD and also the fact you played 3 years the game had all the skin the champ and all . Hmmmm well if league is dying isnt because they didnt bring solo q but because league is just slow at developing and also you can terminate my account i wont play this game anymore .    srry for english and cya was fun .{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"XiSUlcORnL","date":"2016-07-24T08:10:57.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what","replies":[{"poster":"LOSINGISMYPRIDE","date":"2016-07-24T08:12:01.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well this is the lvl of a pretty bad english writer so yeah i assume that ppl wont understand a single word .{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-24T08:14:12.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't pretend that it isn't bad, but it isn't so bad that it's impossible to understand.
