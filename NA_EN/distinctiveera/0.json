I checked the config file and verified that my resolution is set to the one that my monitor recommends. I also tried lowering the resolution to something lower and that did not work. I am using two monitors, if I load league on the second monitor and then switch it back to my main monitor it will work. Any ideas what could be the issue? I already uninstalled league and reinstalled.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T18:58:19.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was an issue a little bit ago where some players had resolution issues with that error, and we had them press Alt+Enter to resolve it as a temporary workaround.
