Yi's ult also allowed him to chase Kassadin even with his Riftwalk.\n\nKha'Zix could poke and outtrade Kassadin and also had his spikes to mitigate some of the poke damage. The problem is that once mid game came, Kassadin's silence was really crippling to Kha'Zix. With a Banshee's Veil and Hexdrinker late game, however, Kha'Zix could beat Kassadin once again, but Kha'Zix still had inferior teamfighting presence.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MalzaharAnyLane","date":"2015-09-20T00:07:39.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I preferred the game when Kassadin was broken, it meant it kept toolboxes like Lee Sin and Riven in check.","replies":[]},{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2015-09-20T04:22:00.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda miss the threads about perma-ban kass skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-19T17:14:12.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how powerful he used to be, but that was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

With the recent addition of AP scaling to his ulti, however, Kassadin got some of his damage back. \n\nNormally, you wouldn't be able to stack up your ulti before blinking onto your target due to running out of mana, or dying too fast if you tried. With this build, you can have 5k+ mana for 10+ blinks (That's over 5000 range wherever you want to go!), and 4k+ health with Seraph Shield so you can go crazy. Clarity gives you an extra 1-3 blinks if you run out of mana.\n\nFor those of you who think this is a troll \"Tank Kassadin\" build, remember that these are all AP items, albeit all geared towards the late game. Then again, Kassadin has always been an amazing late game champion. \n\nSurvive the early-mid game, and this build will create a late game monster with 1.35s cd blink, burst comparable to Katarina, consistent AoE damage  from ulti, and the ability to catch a target from halfway across the map.\n\nDisclaimer: Only had ~10 games with this build in normals.
