Any match made game counts towards the skin - just no customs. As a note, you'll need to own Gangplank before the event ends to receive the skin. If you played him while he was F2P, it still counts as playing him, but you'll need to purchase Gangplank before the event ends. \n\nYou can try checking your match history to see if you've played him, as long as it was fairly recent. \n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-03T19:51:02.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about playing him while he was free, buying him after he was off the weekly lineup, but not playing him afterwards?
