I had no problem using the taunts, but eventually I couldn&#039;t hear them anymore. I have also asked my friends if they could hear the taunts unfortunately they couldn&#039;t hear them as well. Please fix this :( I know its not my computer cause I can perfectly hear every other champ I use.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T16:59:40.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xUtero -\n\nUnfortunately, Karthus has been playing too many Pentakill gigs and he's lost his voice.
