The next day, I attempted to start up League of Legends but encountered this error.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Cf3IY\n\nThe client doesn't actually start up. I instantly receive the message shown after starting up League of Legends. This occurred after Patch 6.15 went live. I was in a game in which I had to exit because everyone disconnected due to the update. I did not actually install the update either, after the servers went down, the game simply wouldn't start up, therefore I couldn't install Patch 6.15. I thought the issue was affecting a large number if not most people, but it seems my friends are able to start up and play League of Legends just fine. If there are any files or other information that might help with this situation, I'll share it. I would just like some insight on the situation or assistance to fix it.\n\nEdit: I have visited and followed the instructions in Heimy's Workshop.\n\nEdit 2: Uninstalled the game and reinstalled. Installed the necessary files but the game simply won't launch. I am unable to even see the launch screen because of this ever since the issue. I receive the same error message.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-27T08:28:44.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Visit Heimy’s Workshop to patch these issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/c5/Heimerdinger_PiltoverCustomsSkin_old.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120118075912","replies":[{"poster":"KUAM News at 11","date":"2016-07-27T10:05:28.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have followed the instructions and done what it has told me to do.
