When I attempted to relog, it got stuck on the login screen with the login status at Authenticating... I tried restarting my computer, restarting my modem, repairing the game and even uninstalling and re-installing league. None of these did anything because I am still trying to log in, but I keep getting stuck at the Authenticating part. \r\n\r\nP.S.  My friends are also able to see that I'm online, even though I'm stuck on the Authenticating page and can't see the actual client","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T00:32:43.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up your account, and it looks like you might have been kicked around the time that the new patch came out.
