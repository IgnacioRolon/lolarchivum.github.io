Of all the intrinsically healing based/drain tank champs (notably {{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:154}}), the majority rely on healing steroids that directly or indirectly increase when at a particularly low health level. This style of durability sets them apart as being *specifically* more difficult to DPS to death, while being more vulnerable to burst (If they're at 30% health and you can burst them to death in one go, they're dead. If you can only whittle away at their health, they'll sustain through it and kill you like they are supposed to do). Applying grievous wounds only to low health targets hard counters many of their core play patterns in an arbitrary and unfair way. Tell me, would you prefer to take 20% reduced healing at *any* health %, or take 40% but only below half HP? If you were a volibear, you'd know for sure that that 20% flat healing debuff is *FAR* healthier than 40% at below half, since the latter completely cripples his passive. That same train of thought goes for Aatrox's W heal, Mundo's ultimate, Zac's passive, or Olaf's whole dang kit.\n\nThat said, Grievous wounds across the board should be *MUCH* weaker, especially if they move to this healthier model of applying to damage at all health %s. Either some sort of stacking debuff (still capped low, say 25% healing reduction) or a flat debuff of *at most* 20% should be used. 40% is too extreme an amount and causes drain tanks to become excessively binary depending on whether they are grievous wounded or not during a fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bobsenbob","date":"2015-11-10T00:14:15.821+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know what's dumb? morello passive would make more sense for executioners calling, after all, it's EXECUTIONERS calling","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-11-10T00:13:34.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the problem is, Morrelo's GV is being balanced around the abuse case scenario.
