I don&#039;t really care for support Morgana and agree that she might be a bit too strong.**\r\n\r\nMorgana doesn&#039;t use Tormented Soil for damage in the support role -- she uses it to tag people for assists and to spend Spellthief&#039;s Edge stacks.\r\n\r\nBy removing early damage from Tormented Soil, Morgana will be pushed in more easily in the mid lane.  Her wave clear was already abysmal, taking many seconds to work whereas other champions can instantly clear a wave.  If you are against a champion that instantly cleared waves, then chances are the enemy minions would walk off of your soil forcing you to tank the minion wave and spend another 130 mana dropping another patch of soil.\r\n\r\nThe best way to nerf Morgana&#039;s supportive capabilities is to remove the interaction between Spellthief&#039;s Edge and Tormented Soil.  Make it so that it doesn&#039;t spend all three stacks in one cast.  That way, Morgana spends more mana constantly dropping soil OR has to blow her binding, providng a significant moment of weakness for the next 11 seconds.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the above can be buffing Black Shield&#039;s cooldown to 15 seconds, giving it an offensive use (aka, use it on an enemy to spend the cooldown and do some damage/effect.)  Have the cooldown doubled to 30 seconds if you use it to shield an ally.  The shield duration can also be shorted to 3 or 4 seconds, if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2015-05-05T23:13:27.556+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nerfing her tormented soil damage is pretty much the least effective way to hurt her support game.

Landing one binding potentially destroys a nontank support, and Black Shield removes CC threat if you are able to use it right before (or during a CC train) spells are used. She is a mushroom while other supports fit into a rock, paper, scissors (Tank<Sustain<Poke<Tank) set up.\n\nYou'd have to either change her kit interaction with CC or reduce the amount of CC she has in her kit while also increasing AP ratios to encourage her going to mid. Sadly mid has a bunch of AD and Assassins and easier jungle interaction, and while she can fair well there, it isn't exactly in her best interest as an immobile, magic shielding mage unless she knows she's going up against another mage or can reliably land her CC and use her shield properly (which is a player related problem, not entirely a champion).\n\nAnd as a support main, while she's annoying I don't really want her leaving the lane entirely.

Now she might have to last hit or comeback to W again creating more opportunities to gank o just punishing her early game more because of such a safe mid game.  \n\nYet she will still have a OK late game with utility since she has no carry potential unless she is ahead.  \n\nmorgana doesn't need a nerf mid or support.
