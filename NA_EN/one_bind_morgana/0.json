Right now, out of 49 mid laners that champion.gg has compiled data about, Morgana is **38th place** for total damage dealt, **33rd place** for killing spree frequency, **40th place** for total gold earned and **30th place** for total minions killed.\n\nClearly, the data shows Morgana is a champion that struggles with damage output (when played in the mid lane.)\n\nLet&#039;s look at the potential impacts of having Tormented Soil do less damage in the earlier stages of the game:\n\n**Support Morgana**\n- Loses about 10 damage depending on how many soil ticks the enemy takes.\n- No change to her interaction with Spellthief&#039;s Edge.\n\n**Mid lane Morgana**\n- Her average farm per game will go down as she&#039;s going to miss lots of minions to her own minions in between soil ticks, since each tick is individually weaker.\n- Since her soil is amplified by a percentage depending on missing health, Morgana will actually lose more damage than is shown on the PBE.\n- Morgana loses a chunk of damage towards champions as her real damage source is Tormented Soil, not the binding or shackles.\n- Morgana has to max her soil rather than get 3 points in it and then max her binding.\n\nThere is also the fact that your Tormented soil becomes useless for farming as soon as your team groups for objectives.  Many times I&#039;ve put my 130 mana cost pool down under some minions only to have an ADC last hit every single one of them with a well placed skillshot.  It is incredibly hard to farm as Morgana past 20 minutes for this reason.\n\nMorgana is already one of the weakest champions at gold generation and damage output in the mid lane.  The Tormented Soil nerfs will only exacerbate these weaknesses of hers, and for no reason, because she&#039;s not even picked as a mid laner in competitive play.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-05-08T00:32:14.601+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"Only time Morgana was competitive lately was with 3 second hard CC and CC immunity in duo lane...\n\n...lets nerf most important spell on mid Morgana and least important on support Morgana.","replies":[{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2015-05-08T13:18:07.540+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well her pool is the least interactive skill in her entire kit, and hard cc is kind of her strength, so I kinda see why they nerfed her pool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"One Bind Morgana","date":"2015-05-08T00:32:53.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":19,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulquiorra995,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A61WLUQh,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-05-08T00:32:14.601+0000)\n>\n> Only time Morgana was competitive lately was with 3 second hard CC and CC immunity in duo lane...\n> \n> ...lets nerf most important spell on mid Morgana and least important on support Morgana.\n\nDark Binding doesn't have hard cc attached, but you're right otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-08T01:09:42.101+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"Snares are hard cc :X","replies":[{"poster":"One Bind Morgana","date":"2015-05-08T03:39:11.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":20,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cameron2325,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A61WLUQh,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2015-05-08T01:09:42.101+0000)\n>\n> Snares are hard cc :X\n\nHard cc disables enemy actions, a snare does not, therefore a snare is not hard cc\n\nThink of a snare as a 100% slow that disables dashes and blinks.
