However, what exactly are the rules on it? My LoL keeps freezing/crashing near the end of the game and I'm really worried that I might get banned for such activity (AFK at the end of the game). I had to close my LoL twice in 2 hours.\n\nAlso, I'm VERY new to this game...

Thanks for stopping by, and I'm happy to help!  If you leave while a match is still going on, then you can receive a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty even if you return to the game.  It's important to get whatever is causing the crash fixed up to prevent this from happening.  Let me know what exactly the issue is, such as what you're seeing and when.  Are there any error messages?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Nyxwolfy","date":"2016-10-08T00:11:32.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a time limiting program, in order to maintain how long I can play. Normally, league games that I have played in last for 20 minutes, which is sufficient for the 30 minute block. However, occasionally it passes that mark, and when I come back about 2 minutes later, the game has already ended, and I'm left with a frozen \"VICTORY\" screen.","replies":[]}]}]}
