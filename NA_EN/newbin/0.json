I have not updated and video card graphics nor as my computer crashed that would cause file corruption. \n  \n Today I got on and started a match. When i came to the champion splash screen my monitor turned off and gave me a screen resolution warning. I thought it was a bug so I reload the client. It said I crashed and if I wanted to reconnect so I did.Same problem on champion splash screen loading the match.\n   \n     So next I went into the LoL folder and modified the config file called \"game\". it was set to my normal resolution 1280x768.I I modified it to 1280x900 and windowed mode and reloaded the client. When I did get into game and switched off windowed mode and my boarders were very wrong. So I tried the change the resolution again back to 1280x768 in game.Same problem. So I assumed there was a setting wrong somewhere so I hit default settings button and it changed my resolution out of range again which was 2560x1600 . I waited a bit for it to revert since I can't even see the ok button and it did but  It zoomed me into a view that was almost 2nd person view and I could not see my hub or access to anything other then a 4x4 inch view that I would normally see and normal resolution. I could not zoom out. So I just deleted the config file \"game\" hopping it would default without that to a lower setting. It didn't still stuck at 2560x1600 and the game did not create another config \"game file. \n\nwould a full repair wipe all my settings to fix the issue or is there another file I can delete that would cause the client to scan and replace it?\n\nEdit. I rembered I did n't cntl delete the \"game\" file. So restored it and checked the setting. Colors=32\nHeight=980\nWidth=1280\n\nseeing as it says the right setting I went ahead and joined a Bot game. Samething happened. Dispite what the config file says. Monitor goes black and says out of range set to 1440x900 at 60mhz. trying a client repair next. Is there a hidden game file I'm missing? this is what is in my current config file.\n\n\n\n[General]\nGameMouseSpeed=14\nUserSetResolution=1\nShowCursorLocator=0\nShowGodray=1\nBindSysKeys=0\nSnapCameraOnRespawn=1\nOSXMouseAcceleration=1\nEnableTargetedAttackMove=0\nAutoAcquireTarget=1\nEnableLightFx=0\nWindowMode=0\nShowTurretRangeIndicators=1\nHideEyeCandy=0\nRelativeTeamColors=1\nPredictMovement=1\nWaitForVerticalSync=0\nColors=32\nHeight=980\nWidth=1280\nSystemMouseSpeed=0\nCfgVersion=7.5.4441\n\n[HUD]\nPracticeToolScale=1.0000\nItemShopPrevY=0\nItemShopPrevX=57\nItemShopResizeHeight=0\nItemShopResizeWidth=260\nItemShopPrevResizeHeight=960\nItemShopPrevResizeWidth=1280\nDisableMouseCaptureDebugger=0\nShowSpellCosts=0\nNameTagDisplay=1\nShowChampionIndicator=0\nShowSummonerNames=1\nCameraLockMode=0\nMiddleClickDragScrollEnabled=0\nScrollSmoothingEnabled=1\nKeyboardScrollSpeed=0.0000\nMiddleMouseScrollSpeed=0.5000\nMapScrollSpeed=0.4500\nShowAttackRadius=0\nNumericCooldownFormat=1\nDisableHudSpellClick=0\nSmartCastWithIndicator_CastWhenNewSpellSelected=1\nSmartCastOnKeyRelease=1\nEnableLineMissileVis=1\nShowSummonerNamesInScoreboard=0\nMirroredScoreboard=0\nShowTeamFramesOnLeft=0\nFlipMiniMap=0\nItemShopItemDisplayMode=1\nItemShopStartPane=0\nGlobalScale=0.8400\nMinimapScale=1.0000\n\n[Sound]\nDefaultFXVolume=100\nDefaultMusicVolume=100\n\n[Performance]\nGraphicsSlider=3\nShadowsEnabled=1\nCharacterInking=1\nEnableHUDAnimations=0\nPerPixelPointLighting=1\nEnableParticleOptimizations=0\nBudgetOverdrawAverage=10\nBudgetSkinnedVertexCount=200000\nBudgetSkinnedDrawCallCount=100\nBudgetTextureUsage=150000\nBudgetVertexCount=500000\nBudgetTriangleCount=300000\nBudgetDrawCallCount=1000\nEnableGrassSwaying=1\nEnableFXAA=0\nAdvancedShader=0\nFrameCapType=2\nShadowQuality=1\nEffectsQuality=2\nGammaEnabled=1\nFull3DModeEnabled=0\nEnvironmentQuality=2\nCharacterQuality=2\nAutoPerformanceSettings=0\n\n[Chat]\nEnableChatFilter=1\nChatY=0\nChatX=0\n\n[Volume]\nMasterVolume=0.07\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ducksalt","date":"2017-09-09T19:17:48.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got a easy fix it only works if you have 2 screens \n1:install OBS\n2:try to capture LoL with the \"game capture\"\n3:place obs on the second screen\n4: navigate the menu  and change your settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T18:27:57.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your config has become corrupt, which can definitely happen if you try to make modifications manually.

Then tried what you said. Same issue. When my client starts up, even without the settings files the login screen is obviously max resolution. look s too amazing to be anywhere near what it's suppose to look like with my normal settings.Update to include practice tool as well to make it easier to troubleshoot. It insists on running at max resolution and windowed mode. Could it be the refresh rate that is actually running too high?\nAlso poked through more config files. How does the client first come up with the default settings when they game runs for the first time?\n\nI changed the setting to window mode manually. Runs the proper resolution in game 1280x900. but when I turn off window mode. monitor says out of range.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-24T15:07:26.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, thanks for trying all those steps despite the issue persisting.
