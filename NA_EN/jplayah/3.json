{"poster":"JPlayah","date":"2019-11-24T18:37:25.645+0000","title":"New support items are literally institutionalized poverty","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":93,"down_votes":12,"body":"Yes, there are plenty of \"new support items suck\" threads which all make great points about how supports are screwed as soon as they hit their tier 3 support item (for anyone who isn't aware of the issue, tier 3 support items lose the quest that lets you execute minions or poke enemies for gold, but continue to punish farming). But let's talk about the underlying problem, which comes in three parts.\r\n\r\n1. Supports don't get as much gold as other roles. This started as a matter of circumstance. As other people have pointed out, there are 4 sources of gold on the map (3 lanes and jungle) and 5 players on each team, so either one of those sources needs to be shared, or someone gets left out. As it turns out, people are greedy, so someone has gotten left out, and that person is the support.\r\n\r\n2. Riot has taken this idea that supports don't get as much gold and they've turned it into \"Supports *shouldn't* get as much gold,\" and they've done this by hard-coding it into the game in the form of the new support items.\r\n\r\n3. The only way to supplement the amount of wards you can place from trinkets/red wards is for someone on the team to take one of these support items, locking themselves into this situation.\r\n\r\nSo Riot starts by saying to players:\r\n\r\n>\"If you want to ward beyond your trinket and red ward, one of the reliable income streams (farming) is going to be penalized, and we'll give you this other income stream based on this quest instead.\"\r\n\r\nSo we've established that there is this person who doesn't get access to minions or monsters *anyway* (because there aren't enough gold sources on the map for everyone), but you're giving that person an alternate source of gold via this item. Sounds good so far. But then what?\r\n\r\n>\"When you've earned 1000 gold using this item, you lose the alternate income stream we gave you.\"\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\n\r\nSo we end up with two problems.\r\n\r\n1. The point of support items is to give this person who gets left out of farming another income source, while also deterring people who are already farming from taking these items, **but that doesn't work so well when you take away that income source partway through the game.**\r\n\r\n2. Why does it have to be **this** particular player who has to supplement the wards? What if the jungler wants to help ward? They're in a great position to do that with all the roaming they do, right? But no, they have to go through this quest which is designed so that only a duo laner can complete it (unless the jungler ganks a shit ton, but they can't do that anymore, which is a whole different issue).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n1. Riot, if you want a gold income item that meets both of your needs, then allow supports to keep getting gold through their quest after tier 3 items. Don't say \"You can't keep getting gold this way and you also can't farm minions.\" Players should get one source of gold or the other. They shouldn't **ever** lose both.\r\n\r\n2. Give us more options for placing (and maybe clearing) wards. Vision should be a dynamic game with opportunities for everyone to contribute, not a burden heaped on one player in a specific role. You know how there are a ton of different boots? What if there were a ton of different warding items?\r\n\r\nAnd you wonder why so many people hate playing support?? Give them the tools they need to meaningfully contribute to their team, and let them have fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Mahoh","date":"2019-11-24T19:12:04.334+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot hates vision.

If the support get's an assist on a kill, they get an addition gold bonus on top of the gold they would normally get for the assist.  Nothing huge, just a slight bonus to supplement their income.  \n\nIf Riot is focused on increasing the amount of plays on the map, this would give the support role additional incentive to roam more frequently and award them for successful ganks.   Additionally, when you think about it, when a support player roams, they are being hurt because they are not in lane getting tribute or spoils of war.  This can help make up for some of that loss if they're successful, but still have a punishing affect if it's not.  It can force supports to learn or plan better when trying to roam for potential ganks.  \n\nAlso, with the way the support items are currently set up, the window for abuse is negated.  The mechanic that turns off the gold generation when minions are farmed can also be applied to disable this bonus function as well.  \n\nThis is in no way trying to give the role an absurd amount of income, but just something to help out with the current woes that the role is seeing in that department.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2019-11-25T04:13:35.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 2.

If they buy your team 1 auto attack or even one ability rotation but you need even slightly more to win the fight in most cases your contribution didn't matter. The items themselves are good in a vacuum where you don't consider game state and everything is even, but since you can't contribute in other meaningful ways if your team can't do anything with what they give them they are effectively wasted, since Riot has accelerated the snowball this will be the case much more often.","replies":[{"poster":"waterflame1","date":"2019-11-25T05:49:13.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can though, for most enchanters they bring more than healing.

The other team isn't going to sit there and just let it happen. Doesn't change a thing if your team doesn't do enough damage or misplays. You are completely dependent on your team being able to do something with it. Soraka can also do a surprising amount of damage and wave clear if you build more carry, but you can't really try to do that without getting punished for farming to get there now.

In an even/close game it's not terrible, but if your team/lane falls behind the snowball now turns into more of an avalanche after these coupled with other changes and you don't even have hands to try and dig yourself out, much less a shovel. So if you go on a slide and lose a few games in row the feels bad man just compounds faster because you probably felt completely powerless to do anything in those games, and would be right in a lot of cases. Over time that will cause players to quit, forcing others to fill the role more often and begin the cycle all over again, since the vast majority are solo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hiyares","date":"2019-11-25T05:08:15.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=blindasleep,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F3ZceXZX,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-24T23:40:13.893+0000)\n>\n> Pretty much, if you can't kill you become useless because if you can't contribute to damage in a meaningful way, or your carries aren't ahead and spoon feeding you assist/objective gold so that your utility matters, the items that you are expected to build on supports {{item:3107}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3109}} etc. don't really impact the game, because they are reliant on at least one or the other of you to have meaningful stats.
