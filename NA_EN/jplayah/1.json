I saw a couple of sentences on both of them and thought \"Wow, their lore is really getting an overhaul. I'll definitely check back on their lore pages later.\" So I do that and find that their lore had been reduced to... the same couple of sentences I saw on the sneak peak.\r\n\r\nRiot, this is not adequate lore. You know this. You can do better. Please fix it.\r\n\r\nAnd I really hope that \"a couple of sentences\" does not become the new norm for champ lore, because that would just be awful.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2014-10-12T18:21:06.557+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was said that there were technical difficulties with the official page.\n\nOriginally they palnned to put the short lores in the client and the long lores on the official page,but they didn't knew that the main page draws the lores from the same source as the ingame client,which proved problematic.\n\nHowever they also want to consider our feedback of the shurima-event and improve some things in the full lores.","replies":[{"poster":"SchaakaKon","date":"2014-10-12T18:42:12.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You'd think it wouldnt take this long to fix a text issue.

That's something which mortals like us can't fathom in our tiny minds.\n\nThe only new extended stories published as of now are \"Arisen\" for Azir, \"Unbound\" for Xerath and \"Invocation\" for Kalista. You may find them on the boards (for the first two, the quickest way it's to google them).\nTwo months since Shurima, three stories, one of which for the new champion, while other champions retconned to be tied to Shurima didn't get anything but the short summaries. This is all at the moment and there's no ETA on anything.\n\nMy personal stance it's that they do not have any story ready for the other Shuriman champions (otherwise they would have published them on the boards) and are working on something else on the to-do list. The technical issue is but a poor and lame excuse, since if they had any content to publish there'd be a plethora of ways to get it to the public. Pro tip: they have social networks' accounts, a site with the dev's blog tech and forums.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kagory","date":"2014-11-22T20:04:38.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really hate the new lore.
