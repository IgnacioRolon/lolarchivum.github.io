It&#039;s nice to have some clarity that certain things will work, and when you expect certain roles to be in certain places, you have a better chance of putting together a decent, balanced team. However, there&#039;s a problem when a few limited combinations of champion, role, and position get so cemented that people freak out whenever something different appears; i.e. when someone tries to break the meta and the immediate reaction of their peers is to ASSUME that it won&#039;t work just because it&#039;s DIFFERENT. That is when we have a problem.\r\n\r\nNow the context for this came when I decided to try Ashe mid (I like mid lane because it feels less stressful to me than bot lane), and almost every time I found a match, I would be either immediately kicked or everyone else would panic-leave (if it was team builder), or someone would dodge as soon as I called Ashe mid (in other queues). This makes it pretty clear to me that people are reacting to seeing something new without thinking about it (&quot;Oh I haven&#039;t seen that before it&#039;s not meta it must not work bye-&quot; *dodge*).\r\n\r\nThe few times I did find a team that would take me, I tended to do okay, especially in my more recent matches (9/1/5, 5/1/8, 12/5/3), but that&#039;s not the point. The point is that there are unfair standards being placed on things which are not accepted as &quot;meta&quot; compared to those that are accepted. No Ezreal bot lane has to call his scores in chat to avoid being kicked. No one questions a player who picks Darius top. But try bringing an ADC mid and by my count, ~95% of players will refuse to even TRY playing with you.\r\n\r\nThe problem isn&#039;t that there is a set of things which is believed to work. The problem is that everything outside of that set is assumed to not work, including the things people haven&#039;t even tried yet.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Give people a chance to try new things. Don&#039;t be driven by fear.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-31T06:43:35.545+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have no problem with people trying out new things in normal.

Two things stick out to me as to why nobody wants Ashe mid, as it's not a 'Meta' fear. Also your opinion on midlane is wrong for one reason; I might be completely wrong though.\n\nFirst off, you want to go Ashe mid. That's cool. But the reason nobody wants this is because Mid-Laners are 80% mobility and burst-mages/assassins. Ashe is immobile and the only way you'd win is if they were Melee\n\nThe fear itself comes from your team probably thinking you'd have to face any of these champions, you lose because you're too squishy compared to them. But that's my thoughts if I saw Ashe going mid...\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} \n---\n\nSecondly, you say Mid-Lane is less stressful than Bot-Lane? ... Want to try top? Top lane can go one of three ways: \n\n* Being hard zoned because your damage/or/range doesn't compare\n* Both of you are noodle fighting, having to farm and wait on ganks to break the top lane tug-of-war\n* One player is pushing so hard that they can't do anything after they've reached the turret range (because Melee) and when they do, the enemy player farms under turret, and repeat... Until one leaves/or/recalls\n---\nThe reason I don't like Mid and why it's the most stressful to me, is because has 6 ways to be ganked; that alone makes me grow grey hairs.\nThe champions you have to face in Mid are annoying to me, all of them are too quick and bursty so you always have to be on your guard for them to hit level 6 and 3-shot you...

ADC are squishy and most of them lack burst or escape\n2. Mages tend to have good wave clear, some kind of CC, and sometimes some form of escape\n3. The main reason bot lane takes a support is to protect the early game vulnerability of ADCs, so an APC/Support lane could probably exploit that weakness. It's the same reason you generally don't take ADCs mid.\n4. AP is much harder to itemize against, defensively, than AD is, so having and AD/Bruiser jungle and AP mages in mid and bot could actually be fairly hard to deal with.\n5. The real reason, you bring an ADC at all is for sustained dps, which comes into fruition late game, and is usually used for taking objectives like Baron, Turrets, and Inhibs.
