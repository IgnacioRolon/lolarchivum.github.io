It is the blindest of blind picks. Here's how champ select works.\r\n\r\n1. You pick your champion, having no visibility of what the rest of your team or the enemy team has picked.\r\n2. You and your allies can see each other's picks and have 1 minute to figure out your roles before the game starts.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer of Night9","date":"2019-05-31T10:56:15.000+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically the most toxic mode ever?\nEveryone would instantly pick a mid lane champ since mid is the popular role.\nImagine a team of full yasuo or a team composed by 2 supp because eachother think that noone want to play support and u got stuck with 2 support that has to choose the only role left (jungle or adc for example)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-05-31T04:28:09.842+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean you could have 5 Yi if everyone picked him?\nI'm down for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronzsuo","date":"2019-05-31T06:05:53.537+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't wait for a 5 man support team","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xedlord","date":"2019-05-31T08:18:22.930+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooh, I thought you said instalock Morde","replies":[{"poster":"radetari","date":"2019-05-31T11:22:41.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it will happen tbh and it will keep me, a lvl 7 morde, away from playing the champion because of 0 mastery points morde people that \"loved him and enjoyed him since he was released\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RÄ±ots Bad Client","date":"2019-05-31T06:03:32.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"normals blind pick?
