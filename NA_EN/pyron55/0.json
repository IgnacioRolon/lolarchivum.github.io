I only played twelve games as old Sona before her rework. So this isn't going to be about \"Statistics\" or \"What type of role she is\". No. This, is about Sona, the maven of the strings. The fact is, I don't care if she was nerfed, I don't care if she was buffed, what I care is when the nerfs or buffs affect the outline of what that character is supposed to be. \n\nFor example, Sona. Before the rework, Sona was EXACTLY what she was supposed to be, A beautiful prodigy of a mystical instrument that in her hands could masterfully conduct the emotions of others, and each battle was an epic composure in the making in which she had no fear of mistakes. The composure influenced the battle itself as it was written.\n\nBut the rework happened... and Sona  fell from that. Now, instead of a prodigy, she's more like those people in band class who struggle to play the **scales.** Instead of conducting her ally's emotions, she now gives them hope that she practiced for one second before they realize it's the same old song. Half of the song she's too afraid to play effectively and thus nothing but 100's of counts of rest. She isn't proud enough to play her instrument loud enough for others to hear unless they're right near her. And her epic composure is Failing at playing a song they know. Her allies can only enjoy it they're all together and really just ignoring her.  \n\nSo now, instead of an epic being composed, it's a 7th grade D-  band student failing at a playing test for not playing until what little music she actually knows. While the old Sona was one to speak through the etwahl, the new Sona does not fit the image at all. She's... quiet compared to her past self. Too quiet. This is why I dislike the new \"Sona\".... because it's no longer an epic musician... it's someone else trying to replace them. \n\nSo, comment away. I may have screwed up in describing this whole thing... The thing is, this has a deeper meaning behind it than if she's playable or not, if she's good or bad, or the fact of how the new stuff is more \"Fun\". so ask  for clarification on any parts you don't understand. Or ask me about something I didn't account for. Also, please make some good points, I may fight back with my own views, but that's what I do to get the center of someones opinion.

That's everything Sona needed.\n> \n> New Sona works under the same unrealistic concept old Karma's mantra'd Q did: That all you allies will be clustered togheter to apply your \"auras\" at all moments. The short lived Shield new Sona provides with her \"aura\" is more or less like the long range aura. Old Q aura helped a lot early game, and that laughable 20AP bonus is still more useful for casters than making them go and land an auto on the enemy to trigger the new \"aura\" effect. New E is an extremely selfish spell for a support to have. It's only purpose now is to make Sona rush in an attempt to give \"auras\" to the entire team, inestead of being the short cooldown team wide movement speed bonus that helped old Sona's team move swiftly through the map. \n> \n> Just because you can now see more flashy lights does not mean Sona got better. On the contrary, it is just hiding how her overall effectiveness has gone down.\n\nAnd there's a reason I dislike SoNo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2014-11-28T16:04:18.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed make her songs global.","replies":[{"poster":"pyron55","date":"2014-11-28T16:39:09.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the problem, But I agree she needs to be a little louder.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrSlowDie","date":"2014-11-28T09:19:26.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually I just came out with an idea, about her 4 skills become notes, and different song you played, will enchant your passive differently.
