Hence you get around 60% of the people in your games as smurfs and the other 40% is there to keep que times down.  \n\nMy smurf is like level 12 and I'm regularly facing level 20-25s because I've pretty much won almost all of my games up until this point.  Now its just like playing on my normal account but I don't have proper runes or masteries (my god do I take that extra 15 ad and 26 ap for granted, you do so much less damage early game) and my champion pool consists of ziggs and jhin.  \n\nThen again that doesn't bother me because im just leveling it up to 30 for ranked not for stomping level 10s.\n\nEdit: Didn't realize you were the 40% of new players not the 60% of smurfs.  Welp sry bout that then,  its kind of a lottery of which 4 newbies get to join the smurfs.  Keep playing, riot recently made it a lot faster to climb and get proper gear so you can focus on getting better.  good luck","replies":[]},{"poster":"RampageRafshan","date":"2016-03-23T11:22:59.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its because most people get banned and get new accounts.\nPeople in rank Troll and people react to the troll being toxic and then riot bans them as punishment.\nThem make new accounts and punish new players like you and make your lives hell.\nWhile the guy who trolled in the first place would never be punished because riots robot system cannot detect that.\nThis is a cycle thats been around for a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MXXXXXL","date":"2016-03-23T11:14:34.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're smurfing at low levels because they're leveling up a second account for whatever reason.","replies":[{"poster":"arwinaragon","date":"2016-03-23T11:20:00.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol...like the first one was not enough or the next 3","replies":[]}]}]}
