You get its bonus and have a choice of 3 lines of traits. Pick the ones you like the most or seem most suited to you. You can't use the same 2 traits from a single line/likeness. One would trade out with something else. \n\nYou get a second line with the main as more of a utility usage/ passive play boost. You will get a boost from the 2nd one also but you will only be limited to 2 lines from 3 lines of selection.\n\nTheres a line for each role +1. Here's an example of my Healer Support page, but not every one will use the same thing. Its what suits you that matters. How you use it and if it works and you make it look good then you're OK.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/eb237a1ca94892afd0f935a148518c6b","replies":[]}]}
