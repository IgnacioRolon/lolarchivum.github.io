Pretty excited to get into my first game with the new and improved twitch invisibility gameplay mechanics. wish me luck!\r\n\r\nedit: Honestly, fuck the invisibility rework. Why is shaco still set in patch 6.21? Honestly they could get rid of the invisibility on twitch as a whole and very little would change about him. Over half of his operating ad range is taken up by that stupid bubble of &#039;&#039;oh shit there he is&#039;&#039; juice. Why not dump the invisibility as a whole and just make it so his Q is a damage and attack speed buff. Things I used to like twitch for: invisible engagements where you appear on top of the enemy and no matter where they run to, they&#039;re taken some poison cummies damage and invisible fleeing where no matter where i run to, i have an inkling of a chance of survival. but honestly fuck shaco. he gets to be invisible whenever he wants and no matter what position he sits atop your head, you cant smell his disgusting clown ass anywhere near you. \r\n\r\nedit: I&#039;ll get over it","replies":[]}
