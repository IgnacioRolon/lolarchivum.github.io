People are also allowed to consume alcohol and other substances before/during play.  It's a game that is intended for entertainment.  Some people enjoy the game more strapped to their seat, white knuckled, while hyped up on stimulants.  Others enjoy the game more while relaxed in a stupor of booze and sedatives.  Unless you're playing professionally, it's all fine and the primary concern should be if you're paying for your entertainment is being paid for with your health or if you're spending too much time with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juice","date":"2019-10-08T05:31:35.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes absolutely.
