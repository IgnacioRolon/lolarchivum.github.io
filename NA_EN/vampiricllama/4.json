Why does it have to be such a slog?\n\nWell, if it's taking you a long time to gain Honor, then it's probable that you're still misbehaving in games. How frequently do you play, and how do you behave in the matches you do play? Do you talk at all? If so, do you have a tendency to make passive-aggressive comments, spread negativity, or harass players?\n\nYou should be striving to put your best foot forward and be honorable. If you're not doing that, then you're not going to be progressing much at all.","replies":[{"poster":"VampiricLlama","date":"2019-12-19T08:07:53.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have both allied and enemy chat, as well as all emotes muted, I never type anything, only ping when necessary, etc. I play maybe 2 games per day on a normal day. 3-5 on a day where I have some extra free time.\n\nI was honor 5 in 2018, and top 20% of behavior on 2 accounts as well has having the mentor, honorable opponent, and friendly player ribbons back in the old honor system.\n\nThis punishment is the result of me retaliating against harassment. I never call people out for poor play, or flame or anything like that, but until the ability to disable allied chat was implemented, I would most definitely retaliate against negative behavior directed towards myself or another player in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinful Succubus","date":"2019-12-19T08:12:47.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I have both allied and enemy chat, as well as all emotes muted, I never type anything, only ping when necessary, etc. \n\nhence the problem\n\nby not typing or communicating with your team other than through pings, you're displaying a refusal to communicate, not a refusal to be toxic. And there's a difference\n\nyou'll progress, sure. But it will be at a much slower rate than if you actually used the chat in a constructive, non toxic manner.\n\n>This punishment is the result of me retaliating against harassment.
