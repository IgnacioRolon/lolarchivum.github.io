I already messed around and gave it as much RAM as I can and maxed out the multithreading for my CPU, but it's not helping.\r\n\r\nAre there any programs out there that are more stable with a similar interface or a shallow learning curve that anyone would suggest I look at? I'm working with 1-2 GB .avi files.","replies":[]}
