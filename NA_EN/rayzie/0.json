My mastery pages and runes are fine when I'm making them and choosing them at the beginning of the game. However, as soon as the load screen starts they are no longer appearing and don't show up once in game play starts.\n\nI don't know if this is possibly an uncommon glitch or something associated with playing on a Mac. I used to play on a pc and never had this issue, but now I can't play a single game using my mastery pages and I'm not sure what to do in order to fix it.\n\nIf you've ever had this issue or know of a way to fix it please reach out because I'd love to have them back before I start playing ranked again and I know it might be something super simple that I'm just overlooking.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T00:46:32.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't look like this account has any tickets submitted, click this link for a ticket if you still need to submit one to make sure it goes through correctly-> [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nI'm not exactly sure I'm understanding correctly, because Mastery and Rune pages are not meant to show up *during* the game. You can pick between them while in the champion select lobby, but once the loading screen starts you won't see those options anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Rayzie","date":"2017-10-11T02:02:57.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, that's on me not you for being horrible at explaining things, I wasn't sure how to best explain it myself. Basically, every time I would save my mastery pages they wouldn't appear when I went to choose them at the beginning of the game which in turn meant I didn't see keystones in the load out screen.\n\nI ended up trying to uninstall, then reinstall and it seems to have fixed itself, sometimes the easiest/most obvious fix is the best option and I was too stressed to think of it earlier.\n\nThanks for reaching out so quickly and sorry for confusing you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T02:26:44.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhhh gotcha! Sorry for not understanding the first time xD!\n\nYea that's been known to happen in the past, and typically we can fix it by doing a quick config reset. Follow these steps exactly and let me know if that fixes it or not!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Rayzie","date":"2017-10-11T15:37:03.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems all good now, thanks a bunch c:","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
