You can't go a couple posts on these boards without people bringing up Lee Sin again. I'm going to be honest here, Lee Sin isn't as big a problem as he was. I don't know how hard he's crushing things in bronze/silver/gold/idk but he's not worth being discussed this often.\n\nWhen people see \"Gameplay and Balance\", they assume that it's a place to go and talk about game balance, like the name insinuates. However, this isn't the entire case.\n\nThis section is basically \"the Place People Come to Cry About Game Imbalance.\" There's no point in posting here unless you just want to bolster each other's beliefs that some champions are just completely unbeatable and that Riot's balance team undoubtedly consists of 7 disabled monkeys because they're so bad at their job.\n\nReally though, Riot doesn't care at all about your insight on game balance. They have an entire team of people dedicated to adjusting the game and studying the game to see how they should handle things. Some things they do aren't the best choice of action, but they don't care. They're not going to seriously take the opinion from some random person on their forums that has some people agreeing with them.\n\nI'm not saying that all of you are dumb. Most of you say some things that are pretty stupid but some of you make good suggestions and start reasonable discussion. But Riot doesn't care and this is just the place they created so people can vent their anger about a champion so they don't have to hear it.\n\nI mean, it's obvious from just a glance that the people here strictly believe that Lee Sin is insanely broken and is impossible to beat but you guys haven't changed anything by making a 1000 threads about this champion, so just quit it. I've been here three days and already I believe 95% of you don't even have the game knowledge to contribute anything meaningful to any kind of discussion. It's not even surprising that Riot tends to avoid and ignore this section of the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-02-22T02:55:23.690+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"More than that, I think this was the place of hope where people thought that Riot was offering them a place where they could talk with them.

People have been complaining about how Riot *very* obviously favors him and avoids ever changing him *almost the entire time he's been in the game*, and many people believe it's simply because he's a flashy moneymaker for twitchTV views (which honestly I'm starting to believe with time).

It's been a long-ass time since they stepped down from their throne and acknowledged they might *not* know more than literally everyone else playing their game 100% of the time, and many players are having a really hard time adjusting to the fact that Riot doesn't give two shits about what their players think unless it involves their wallets these days (note that we still see community input affect skins, yet nothing else... hmm.... :D).

Just one veteran players viewpoint of the situation, but hey, I'm 99% sure there's a fuckload of other vets who feel the exact same way.\n\nTrust me I've been on the original forums for a long, long time. I left as soon as the old forums got shut down and Riot made the transition to boards. I know Riot used to respond from time to time but you can't really blame them. The community base is massive.\n\nI made this post as more of a message to the people here rather than to Riot. By here, I mean on the Boards. I see far too many posts that are just blatant complaints and rants after they just got fresh out of a ranked game vs Lee sin. It's polluting this entire section and it's impossible to enter a populated discussion here without someone bringing up Lee Sin avoiding nerfs and such.\n\nLike I said before, I don't think we can blame Riot. Riot has created a huge game with a huge playerbase. Some of that playerbase comes to these boards to complain about a champion in a repetitive, unproductive fashion. Why would Riot listen to some random people arguing like animals on their little rant forum than just go create champions, skins, work on esports, or do a ton of other things high on the priority list.\n\nRiot's viewpoint on balance has clearly developed throughout the years. With the rise of competitive League and massive playerbase on their ranked  queue everyday, balance has probably become something a lot more sophisticated than \"people complain about lee sin. ok we nerf now.\"\n\nI'm just trying to tell the people here that no progress is being made towards contacting Riot by posting here. This is because pretty much 90% of everything said here is garbage and isn't even true. The best we can make of this section is to start meaningful discussion so that maybe Rioters would not just flat out avoid us most of the time.\n\nObviously it's not going to be easy. There's always new people coming to start spewing dumb arguments because they don't know any better. But there are some regulars that come here often and if those people would say something productive and not pointless, then it would set a good standard for discussion here. And that could lead to a bit more Rioters than the occasional one per month.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-02-22T23:38:43.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And the reds do talk.\n\nBut as far as fielding the 9756 Lee Sin QQ threads, they aren't going to bother because there is simply no reason.\n\nAnyone that has been on these boards more than a week either thinks that the people on here know more about balancing a game than professionals, or they have a brain and realize 99% of the people on here haven't got a clue what balance is.\n\nThe sheer number of people that still claim that Lee Sin has never been nerfed is enough to prove that many people never bother doing any research before making claims and raging at a company providing them with this game for free.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-02-23T01:54:25.531+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, alright, what's the hardest nerf Lee Sin has ever received? The removal of the 60% attackspeed slow on his cripple?\n\nThat definitely knocked him out of top tier, for sure.\n\nWhen people say \"he's never been nerfed\", what they really mean is \"He's never ***actually*** had his power hit\", which is true.\n\nIf you were to, for example, nerf the AP scaling on Xin Zhao's dash (excluding the AP xin players), nobody would call that a real nerf. That'd just be Riot trying to cover their ass for an obvious balance problem. If you nerf something that *doesn't actually mean shit for the power of the champion*, you didn't *actually* affect the champion power.\n\nLee Sin has a kit that does ***WAY*** too much, and is good at doing *all* of what it does. Riot's \"nerfs\" to Lee Sin in the past have been obvious attempts for them to beat around the bush with the fact that \"No, a champion should NOT literally have ***every goddamn thing a jungler could possibly want***\".  They need to nerf his *actual power*, not just delay and delay and delay for several *years* until they find some number to hit that doesn't *actually* make him noticeably weaker.\n\nI'm not saying there's not a bunch of idiots without a concept of balance on the forums, what I'm saying is there's *more than enough* evidence supporting the people that have been saying for *three and a half years* Lee Sin is way too versatile and powerful, and that there's enough people who *do* know what they're talking about that the tons of people who don't are basically irrelevant numbers.\n\nNot to mention, as people (almost always in low tiers, but no less a valid point) frequently point out, using your rank as a justification for balancing knowledge is almost an ad hominem argument, as you don't *have* to be Master tier to see an obvious balance problem staring you in the face. Unless you make arguments like \"well lee sin gets countered at high tiers\", which is untrue as it happens and is the exact reason he gets picked MORE the higher you go up.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-02-23T05:10:49.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too powerful, I don't think so.\n\nToo versatile, very much so.\n\nPersonal opinion, rather than nerfing everything, just tweak him and push him into more of a niche.

That should be common knowledge in game design. A generalist character will *always* be too weak or too powerful, and Lee Sin is way too powerful, as he has been for years without people banding together about it: Kinda hard to get a movement going for \"this champion is too strong\" when he's played more than any other champion and has a bunch of dogmatic fanboys.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-02-23T16:52:58.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to make the remark that a champion can be too versatile while simultaneously being not too powerful.

I not only say to nerf him, i demand to nerf into the ground like u did to yi without any reason whatsoever.Is that fare? Riot your only measure balance is only around zed and adcs and what pros say(specifically the last one). U have completely forgot about solo quaue players. Ooooh did u forget? I THINK THAT THEY ARE THOSE THAT THEY ARE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN LOL AND IF U DON'T LISTEN THEM, NEVER ALMOST LIKE U DO, THEY WILL STOP PLAYING YOUR GAME AND THEN U WILL CLOSE AS A COMPLANY, WHICH IS HAPPENING OF COURSE. SO PLZ CONSETRATE   AND MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN FOR PLAYERS AND NOT COMPETITIVE FOR FAKER AND DYRUS IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE MONEY, BECAUSE WE ARE, THE PLAYERS, WHO DECIDE THE ENTIRE GAME WITH OUR ACTIONS AND IF WE STOP TO PLAY YOUR GAME THEN IT'S GG. I'm not saying that u should do everything that any bronze kid says out there, but plz at least do what the players, the average players say. For example like WTF why u should remove devourer. First some junglers, the majority of them out there they don't have so much strong hard cc, compare to some others or strong early game due to overloaded kits(lee sin, elise, nidalee e.t.c.), so they need to farm and scale up and giving them this opportunity to stack up and become more effective in the late game was a huge advantage of them and if they fully stack( combined with the old guinsoo's which was also badly changed) they could counter the entire game and hey they maybe,in duels, were pretty frostreighting to play against, but they had a lot of punishments and balanced weaknesses like they were easily kidded and they were weak against hard cc and you could destroy them early game if they were about to get invaded and get rekt in team-fights by tanks building attack speed reduction and having a lot of resistances(sion, maokai,maplhite(attack speed slow with his e) e.t.c.) or by exhaust. Giving them right now this useless extremely high cost not 8 stacks not aoe dmg, guinsoo's plus the bloodrazor where honestly it deals, even with a minimum dmg to monsters, more dmg to them rathen than onto tanky champions, and because of that they have been all melee devourer junglers(except ww and volibear and kindred) completely unplayable and if not unplayable their win rate taunted down by 8-9% like master yi's win rate( 50%-52% down to 42.5% or so...). Yes feral flare was broken but devourer wasn't the same :(. I'm really unhappy about lol now and after my favourite junglers got destroyed well sry for that where i'm going to say, but fuck u riot. Yes u fucked up. U are not so good at ideas anymore(Taliyah, the new champ) or at balancing the game as u used to be 3 years ago and this is why the half of the percentage of your players in league have abandoned the game(and i will), cause you care only about faker and dyrus and high rank players and not about me, the average players and a starter to lol, u don't even give the opportunity to people to entry lol with extremely high costs to rounes, having to level up to play jungle and all that staff...\n\nRemove bloodrazor and add again devourer and rework guinsoo's but to its old state. Not now. After years cause i know that u cannot add again something old back again fast and remove something new faster before it creates gameplay dynamics. But come on only kindred and ww use this, this is not balance and even after u buff yi he's still underplayed, at least on the jungle.\n\nPlz i'm not saying that u must do whatever someone like me says, but keep at least opinion in your mind.\n\nAaa and also don't u think that patch 6.9 changes were good for the average players.

I understand that balance with 120+ champions is a difficult task, a daunting one at that, but I feel that the strongest are far above those without particular tools to combat them in many respects. The damage numbers coupled with constant mobility makes combating them a test of 'who's going to mess up first' with low mobility having a much larger room for error, as positioning is a much higher priority with them a majority of the time. While it is not an impossibility for a Viktor to destroy a Zed, Viktor has to put forth a fair amount more effort to get to the same place as a Zed pressing his R, combo then poofing away.

I personally want Lee Sin nerfed for different reasons that actually do echo from a lot of people I have been playing with for years. Lee Sin is unfun to play against, overplayed to the point I am not exagerating, every time I played in the past 3 months and didn't ban him, he was played. Yes, he may not be broken, but 2+ years of seeing him a dramatic amount does get old when Sona gets nerfed for being \"unfun\" from \"magic statistics you aren't allowed to see\". Yes, I am well aware he isn't overpowered. But I actually had a lot of faith in riot, and I wanted to make it clear why I was leaving with a lot of my posts. and No, that isn't a \"idle threat\" or a \"we'll see you in a week\" My match history will tell you I have played maybe two games in 2+ months because I got tired of how the game was operating. Tired of my favorite characters being fucked up for years and getting nuked out of playability or till they aren't fun for showing signs of dominance for a moment.(Skarner, Sej, tanks in general that don't end up toplane). \n\n2nd) Most complaints stem from actual logical arguments that other people bastardize. For example, Cass rework? About fifty of us actually did a lot of math before her release. We told them, showing the math step by step, equation by equation why it would end badly. And how did it end? Yea, she is good now(in a sense she can win games) but she is still unenjoyable as hell and it took them constant tweaking. I told a lot of people Elise would end up top lane on release. I usually can call how things will end by looking at numbers. And I know a lot of people who post there are better then me, cause I miss things or my conclusions I have a feeling but I can't find the logical string to why. And I have seen people do better. And Riot ignores these and they end up being right. \n\n3rd) As others have mentioned. Half the time, people have emotional and financial investment in things(I have spent far more then I should on this game, and I am done with that, even though they are releasing an ultimate for a character tied for my alltime favorite(with shyv, who is unplayable except top since the end of season 2, and I am a jungle/support main), this is because Stashu is the only one I recently saw who communicated. Yea, he screwed up, yea I don't agree with his results, but honestly? At least he tried to be straight up with us. A lot of this crap is honestly disgusting on communication. Sona changes? People post math explaining it, and Riot blatantly said \"Yea well, we don't care, we are pushing it to live\". When stashu was working on cass, I KNEW it would end bad, I had ddone the numbers, I had posted about the numbers, I had corresponded with others who had. And Stashu dissappeared and came back with Morello, the right option to do, and I still disliked it, but at least he tried to talk with us to a degree after he dropped the cherry picking crap. And that got more respect from me and I actually defended him a few times, though not as much as I should have. \n\nBut if Riot won't even take their own boards which they forced on us seriously?(and post to reddit instead, or twitter, and not fix any problems with this boards) then why should we take them seriously? Communication matters with your clients. Any professional knows that. Even if you can't give a good answer, saying you will look at it or why you can't, is better then just saying \"F you\" which they have essentially done or not given us an answer at all a lot lately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-02-22T05:29:00.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't doubt it if this is all true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-02-22T04:09:18.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot is waiting out this storm until the next patch comes through.
