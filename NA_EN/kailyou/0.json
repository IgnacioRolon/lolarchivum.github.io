Neither chromas, stupid icons or other useless stuff. For real, who even cares about icons?\r\n\r\nGive us the possibility of grinding skins with BEs.\r\n\r\nI mean, I have 8 chests and I am not even allowed to spend all my ~200k BEs in key fragments to open them lol. \r\n\r\nI invested so much time and money in this game, I cannot believe there still is no way to getting something useful of grinding.\r\n\r\nI hope there will be a useful change which can give me back some motivation in playing.\r\n\r\np.s. even Blizzard allows people to play for skins in HoTs.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKailyou","replies":[]}
