That someone or some amount of people have either found a very effective strategy or perhaps a hidden OP or maybe some more games might perhaps level out the win rate back to ~54%. On the interesting side of things, Jarvan top lane has been sitting at 54% win rate on an average basis for the last 2 patches on champion.gg and surpassed kayle both patches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-10-28T21:33:10.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And wasn't kindred nerfed repeatedly for the same reason that OP is asking for with jayce?.....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2016-10-28T20:29:58.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what are u smoking?
