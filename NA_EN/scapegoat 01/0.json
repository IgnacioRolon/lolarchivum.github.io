Talon got reworked, and being as how is is strong as fuq.... almost broken (pretty much broken);i decided to stop playing Blind pick since he basically has 100% pick rate (even 200% since 1 on each team) and its annoying to deal with (almost 0 counterplay to his OP state atm). I decided to start playing Draft again so i can perma ban this mess that riot create..... so... long story short i banned Talon, now this dude starts crying how i banned his champion, then picks a troll and proceed to try and take over my top lane and even walking under enemy turret feeding my Opponent First Blood Assist (since enemy support had to move in at this point). The enemy team spotted the behavior and asked whats up and i kindly ask them to report him sine he wouldnt stop. Now apparently him and his buddy who he Queue with decide they gonna report me, and some idiot on the enemy team the 1 idiot out of 4 on the enemy team decide to sympathize with this troll and even went as far as trying to tilt/troll me for the entirety of the game... why? because they hate Darius... and i am playing Darius..... LOL????\r\n\r\nnow seriously... why is this community so fickle and retarded? if i prefer not to deal with a champion i deem broken and almost impossible to play against... how hard is it to play a different champion? why need to be a bitch and throw a hissy fit about it? and then have your friends report me for what reason? ...... one of the very reasons i hate dynamic queue in this game.... ppl can simply banned together to do outrageous shit and get away with it.... cuz the majority has spoken. \r\n\r\nsigh.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-12T13:34:43.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning a champion a teammate is hovering on is pretty rude tbh. Also don't ask people to report others. It's actually reportable and it's 100% pointless, 1 report in a single game is worth as much as 9. What matters is the number of reported games, not of individual reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Scapegoat 01","date":"2016-11-13T04:33:28.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the dude was last pick..... u want me to allow someone to pick 1 of the top 5 strongest champions as LAST PICK? when the enemy team is clearly going to have a higher chance of picking it? not to mention he wanted to play Talon JUNGLE... like... WTF!? Talon jungle = no, last pick = no..... enemy team getting Talon and snowballing = JUST NO! and like i said, the champion ban system EXISTS FOR A REASON.... i dont want to have to deal with a particular broken champion in my game? ban it.... easy as that.","replies":[]}]}]}
