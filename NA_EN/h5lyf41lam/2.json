Also, I'm a bit confused. Are we talking the infinity stacking Devourer or the sated one? You mentioned in the Op \"Stacking\" but your reference to Rageblade suggests the sated one. (FYI it has since been reduced to 6 stacks) \n\nThe biggest problem I saw with the infinity stacking was the AFK farming that was a result. Problematic in a Deveourer vs Devourer match up, as who ever stops farming first, will basically lose. \n\nAnd with sated, I think it was just hard for them to be shut down. (Given the power you get once sated) And despite the fact that it only really worked against jungle camps, it still seemed too subjected to lane abuse at lower ELO. \n\nI'm not saying I didn't enjoy the item when we had it, I just don't think Bringing it back is going to fly.","replies":[{"poster":"h5LYF41Lam","date":"2017-02-01T22:20:32.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whether it was the infinitely stacking item or the one that capped at 30 it was still a nice adition to the game,that is probably my last response to this thread i dont plan on following it further due to the negative resposnses from the community.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-01T21:46:33.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None is a burst meta.
