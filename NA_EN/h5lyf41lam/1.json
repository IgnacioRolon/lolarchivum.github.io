Oh right... Not care. It's hard enough for me to get games in since I work from 2:30pm until 12:30am 4 days a week and I usually spend time with my family on the weekends. When I get home from work it's usually around 1am. And in all honesty I don't want to go to work tired.\n\nWhat's funny is that I already plan to play a FUCK TON more normals and then go play ranked this season. If I'm Bronze, fuck it I'm Bronze and I can improve. I've had some back during Team builder. Was it annoying? Fuck yeah!

We all make mistakes you are just on the other side , you consider everything toxic so im not gonna call you bad or insecure or anything like that because i dont wanna offend your soft side. Will gladly agree with your point be competetive playing vs bots and enjoy it :) at least you will never meet a troll because you are literally playing vs a computer :) btw you shouldnt care about your rank it was just a joke , there is no legend of Poro ranked que so you can say you're in a highest division cause there is only one\n\n\nBtw i love how most of insecure guys that care about toxicity more than about the game itself ( you are the one mr i play 5 games a month and meanwhile post in every thread about toxicity on boards repeating how bad it is etc. ) are from NA its actually pretty surprising, even funnier thing is that the lower rank you are the more you care ( this is just my observation based on few threads and comments i responded to not a fact, its also related to hoow long person is playing for, most crying guys like you play for season or 2 max everybody that plays for above 2 seasons do not give a fuck about it and whine about inting like me)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-12-29T22:01:53.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faie","date":"2016-12-30T04:24:57.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LBmyBB","date":"2016-12-30T04:13:02.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats that word I am looking for.......
