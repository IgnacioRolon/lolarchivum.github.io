If they aren't banned, they are picked.  16 champs are banned/picked every game, that leaves 9 champs that are interchangeable in the usual lineup.\r\n\r\nBut wait the nay sayers shout, there are a ton more champs picked than 25.\r\n\r\nOk your right.  Over the course of the summer split, I beleive 67 champs were picked/banned out of the 120+ that are in the game.  However, the pick/ban rate for those champs varied immensely.  Champs like Lee Sin, Zed, Elise, etc had enormous pick/ban rates, being in almost every game.  By contrast, other champs that were selected such as veigar were picked maybe a handful of times, never banned and almost exclusively picked by one pro because its a niche pick.  So, in reality, it really was just about 25 champs every game that were seeing action.\r\n\r\nI love watching pro games, but watching games were every game looks so similar to every other one being played across the entire season gets to be a bit boring.  So, I humbly submit this change to the LCS series games.\r\n\r\nEach time that a champ is picked/banned, they are disabled for all following games in that series. So, each game, the champion pool decreases by 16 champs and no game will feature one pro playing the same champ over and over and over.  In a best of 3 series, at least 32 champs will be picked or banned, at most 48.  Way more diversity.  In a best of 5, 48 champs will see the rift (or be banned).  Or, if it goes to 5 games, a whopping 80 champs will see some form of the action.\r\n\r\n\"but this will stretch pro's champion pools to limits where they can't even play\"\r\n\r\nNot really.  Sure, they won't be on their mains or whatever is FoTM, but I've seen pro streams.  They can play way more champs than what they actually do in the LCS, they just don't play them in the LCS because they are more comfortable on their pool of 4-5 main champs.\r\n\r\nI might get downvoted to oblivion by people who like watching LCS the way it currently is, but having watched it for years I can honestly say that it has gotten stale and watching games now looks basically the same as it did 2 years ago, barring a few changes to the main champion pool.  Change is scary, but variety is the spice of life, and LCS desperately needs variety.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-01-07T01:54:40.644+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":9,"body":"It's definitely an odd space.\n\nOn the one hand, you're right: The number of unique champions played in top tier competitive play is dwindling slowly over time. The real question is \"Why?\"\n\nYou could certainly force a wider variety. You could say \"Okay, you can only play each champion once per month / once per series / if your opponents haven't played it either.\" Enforcing a wider variety of champions can be interesting because you'll see more of them played. You could have 20 bans. You'll definitely see different stuff played if you do that.\n\nAnother question can be if just \"Champion named Ezreal was picked\" counts as one unique pick. What about Mid Ezreal vs. ADC Ezreal? What about Support Nautilus vs. Jungle? Kayle Top/Mid/Support? How about different builds? AP Amumu vs. Tank Amumu? You can track the specifics of \"Champion named X was picked.\" Does that tell the whole story? Do you care if they were built differently? AP Mid vs. AD Bot Kog'Maw? I'd argue this counts as a \"different\" pick, but it's of course not tracked as that. Certainly, an edge case, but it's food for thought.\n\nOn that line of reasoning, I think 2014 was a year full of flex picks. We saw Karma, Lulu, and a whole host of other mages go in various lanes. Would a better line of reasoning be, \"How many Supports did we see this year? How many Mid Laners did we see this year?\" Double-counting Jayce doesn't make for a very interesting comparison, but Annie might count. I think we saw more flex picks in 2014 than any other year. There were probably at least two dozen champions that were played in more than one role this year in professional play.\n\nThe game has also become more homogenized. Up until halfway through Season One, many teams weren't running ADC+Support bottom lanes. Now it's considered commonplace. Not everyone knew Kassadin was crazy strong throughout 2013, Cloud9 least of which, but he defined the first half of 2014's Ban phase. Nowadays everyone's watching the Koreans and saying, \"Ah, LeBlanc and Corki are contested. We should all learn them.\" The fact that all the top-tier players have a standard to look to and compel themselves to emulate shrinks our champion pools significantly.\n\nI specifically asked Cloud9's Hai about this at the beginning of 2014. He said they sat down, had a meeting, and told me (paraphrased), \"We chose to drop our old playstyle. We should play like SKT. They won the world championship. Let's be like them\" Well, SKT couldn't even qualify for Worlds the next year. I'm not certain that emulating a specific team or style of play in a constantly-evolving game is the right way to thrive. Cloud9 had, consecutively, their worst splits ever after making the decision, \"Let's copy SKT.\" Throughout 2013 they made their own rules. Meteos made his own jungle style. Sneaky and LemonNation pulled in their own champion pools and style (Hello, Ashe/Zyra). Certainly, other factors than just \"not innovating\" led to teams taking more games off C9 than before; I'm just bringing up trends I see.\n\nI think the trend actually feeds on itself. Because everyone's compelled to learn specific champions because \"better teams\" do so, everyone shares similar champion pools. And because you can easily predict your opponent's champions, and magically you ALSO play those champions, it means you have heavily contested picks. I know they want Corki. Well I know how to play Corki! Let's first pick Corki. This repeats for every role, 2-3 champions deep. Some players branch out and have their own fun touches (Xerath players, Rengar players, Rumble players, Vayne players, etc.) but anything that sees a lot of success falls back into the old pattern of, \"Oh this champion's successful, let's all learn it.\"\n\nIn my opinion, almost every single champion in League of Legends can be that champion. The next Rengar is out there. The next Support Annie or Support Morgana is out there. People just arbitrarily started playing them and everyone decided it was a good idea. But people seem to glom onto them really, really hard, so the pools decrease.\n\nWhat's the way to fix that? Is it OK to \"force open\" the champion pools? Should we just track \"# of Supports played\" across seasons and trend that? What should change?","replies":[{"poster":"Gorzke","date":"2015-01-07T02:00:58.343+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know this doesn't belong here, but the \"Same champion making different roles\" has been against every balance change you have ever made in the game (Except a MF AP buff).

We're fine with Lulu working in 4 roles right now. We're fine with Karma working in the same ones. We're fine with Hecarim as a jungler as well as a Mid Laner (and I'm sure he's fine Top also).\n\nThe changes to champions when they worked in certain lanes came from the **gameplay impact** of that lane. When Janna walked into lane, Pressed Q in the vague direction of the minions, and then immediately last hit the entire wave, that was an issue. When Lulu clicked \"E\" and then pressed \"Q\" twice, causing you to lose 50% of your health without it honestly being a real skill shot, that was the issue. When Annie's low level base damages and stun were so obnoxiously high you immediately lost any possible 2v2 fight bottom lane, that was the issue.\n\nNotice how literally nothing changed about Karma after we saw Bjergsen get a pentakill on her in the LCS playoffs, despite being played as a support the week before. Lulu hasn't been changed in about 4 months (E duration on enemies being the big change) after her mid lane pattern became significantly less toxic.\n\nThe awkward thing about all of this is that it's not that pro teams were looking for support mids to play. They didn't immediately replace Janna with Morgana, or Karma, or Lulu, or Soraka. They played mid Janna because she was bullshit. They played mid Soraka because she was bullshit. Pros really like to pick champions that are un-counterable. Their opponents are, just like them, extremely skilled League of Legends players. If you can find a champion that **CANNOT** be outplayed, that's a **really** strong champion to play in top tier play. So while a lot of people see, \"Oh, Janna got played outside of her recommended lane, so Riot nerfed her,\" what's actually happening is, \"Janna mid has no counterplay, let's add some.\" And then to pros go, \"Oh, this champion has counterplay? Time to find something else to abuse.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-01-07T04:25:43.127+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Phreak,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=aYUEYaY2,comment-id=001400000001,timestamp=2015-01-07T02:47:41.430+0000)\n>\n> They played mid Janna because she was bullshit.

I have yet to see Riot acknowledge this. The pro pick bullshit champs because they give them the best chance to win. This is 100% correct. \n\nSo the best move would be to maybe nerf the champs that are ALWAYS at the top? Last season Jax was a monster top lane for 5 weeks in the EU & NA LCS. Then you guys nerfed him. And a few buffs, Gragas and Mao became the kings of top lane. Kassadin was in the top 3 picks for mid lane in 20 out 22 weeks over the same period. (Not counter playoffs and Worlds) Are you **really** going to say that Riot doesn't know why he was picked so often? And why did it take SOOOO long to address it?\n\nI can go on and on. Lucian was top 3 in 20/22. Elise 22/22. Thresh 22/22. I can go on and on. It's not the random Hec in mid lane. It's being bored of Elise vs Lee Sin. Thresh vs Leaon/Morgana. \n\nIf the game has gone stale, and we have this much domination from so few champions, we can only come to one of three conclusions. \n\nNumber 1~ Riot doesn't know they have a problem.\nNumber 2~ Riot doesn't know how to balance over loaded kits.\nNumber 3~ Riot doesn't care. They WANT Lee Sin. Kassadin. Thresh. \n\n\nPlease tell me how I am wrong here. I want to love the game. But I watched every NA LCS game last year, and most of EU.

For example, we could say, \"Okay, we're just going to nerf and buff every champion's base health until everyone has exactly the same pick/win rate.\" That wouldn't make a very good game, but it would produced a balanced one. Definitely not the goal. Certainly, that's an extreme example, but that's what you get when you don't make the right choices.\n\nSo instead what the designers do is slate reworks, direction shifts, take time to try to make the right changes, etc. Right now Kassadin, I would argue, is in a really good spot as a result of this work.

We're very aware of overplayed as well overpowered champions.\n\nThe following is personal opinion, so feel free to disagree. Lee Sin isn't actually the best jungler, he's just the most fun (and the most played across the entire playerbase). Thresh isn't the most powerful support, he's just the most fun. Do you really think we should nerf champions because they're more fun than others? You can make your own reasoning and have your own opinions on champion power at the very top tier, but as far as our actual matchmaking gameplay, **objectively** Lee Sin and Thresh aren't anything close to the most powerful champions in their role.

They are both thought of (as proven by their competitive pick rate) as being top of the line champions. But why don't they get looked at? Is it really just being scared of the blow back, or do you HONESTLY think they are not the best all around at their role?\n\n> \n> The following is personal opinion, so feel free to disagree.

Froggen's Anivia, okay I'll agree on that. But come on. Is there some data you can share that backs this up? If Lee Sin and Thresh are the among the top 3 picked in their role in competitive from day one they are allowed in pro games... are you telling me that it's just because they are fun and not the best? That pros who are doing every little thing to win (playing bullshit champs as you said) would rather play a weaker champ than the best all around at their position? This just doesn't make any sense.

For matchmaking, as reflected by the patch notes, Janna and Sona are just **actually** the best supports in the game. They just outright win games 20% more often than they lose games. Lee Sin and Thresh, they're 50/50.\n\nThe data is that we know the win rates and picks rates of every champion in the game. We literally know how often each champion wins a game of League of Legends. We also know the pick rates of every champion in the game. The bar graph over \"Jungler\" is hilarious when you see the gigantic spike for Lee Sin. We know that Pick Rate is actually not very heavily influenced by champion power. Fiora had one of the 10 highest win rates in the game for I think over a year and remained unpopoular. I can tell you pretty much unequivocally that the general League of Legends player picks what's fun over what's powerful. We are all playing a game, after all.\n\nThe point I'm the least strong on is competitive pick rates. I admitted as such. I said you guys can all have your own opinions and that I was merely stating mine. But I can pull out a mountain of facts that back up what I'm saying.\n\nHow long between the last Kayle change before she was #1 Pick and Ban? How long did it take for Kassadin to go from unplayed to #1 in I believe the beginning of 2014 (when his Q became a magic damage shield). For how long did everyone ignore Janna until NJWS GorillA was like \"Guys, Janna's OP\" and then everyone was like, \"Oh shit you're right!\" Go watch the VoD of the Analyst Desk in the Group Stage at Worlds. I literally said just that on air and MonteCristo and Krepo directly laughed at me or straight disagreed. What did we see at the end of worlds? Janna became the #1 or #2 contested support pick despite being COMPLETELY UNPLAYED for the year leading up to it.\n\nWhat I know is that pros have some very weird decision making around what they pick. They all have their reasons, but from where I sit it looks arbitrary. I know they copy the Koreans. I know they copy Solo Queue when they face a champion without counterplay. Otherwise, I know they just play what they enjoy playing. Why do you think 90% of all Support players' Most Played champion in Solo Queue is Thresh? Why do you think every Jungler's Most Played is Lee Sin? Again, I'm talking about specifically Matchmaking games. Games where Rammus is **provably** stronger than Lee Sin. Where Fiddlesticks is **provably** the best jungler in the game. They're clearly not picking just to win Solo Queue, otherwise they'd pick based on win rate. They're picking to play things they enjoy playing. And that's where the rest of the picks come from.

You make it sound like Fiddlesticks and Rammus would enjoy the same win rates if played as much as Lee Sin, which I do not believe. They're chosen because they're strong in a certain composition/situation (just like wanted with the design goals).\n\nThat Lee Sin is chosen to the extent that he is and still is able to maintain a 50/50 chance of winning (as stated in your post) rather tells me that he is strong in every situation and lacks counter picks (and goes against the jungle design goal).\n\nSo if you're first/second (even third) pick Lee is almost always your superior choice (and will likely give a higher % of winning that Rammus). Even if technically there are higher win rate champions, Lee gives you an equal chance to win in every game, while you have to know the team compositions to a greater extent to enjoy \"superior\" junglers win chance.\n\nThen there's also the question; what would you spend time learning to play? A champion that is strong in all situations or a champion that is a niche pick but stronger in certain compositions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-01-08T02:02:03.385+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't judge power by win-rate allone like you are trying to with Sona/Janna.

If Lee Sin was actually overpowred (like launch Rek'Sai, or 4.20 Warwick overpowered) you'd see obnoxious winrates. You don't, because he's not overpowered.

I am too. You can say he's not overpowered *according to you*, but when you say \"He's not overpowered because I have info that doesn't prove it and I can't provide\", then there's an issue.\n\nYou keep bringing up his win rate, yet consistently write off the fact that he's popular. How it's so hard to believe bad players pick good champions escapes me, but the fact is his win rate being low doesn't prove he's not overpowered. Hell, I'd argue it doesn't prove anything, except that people play him a crapload (which you well know) and that there's a lot of people who are bad with him. *That does not make him balanced*.  Lee Sin wins less games because more people are playing him. It's already been addressed that there's a significant difference between some guy picks up Lee Sin because he saw pros winning with him, knows he's OP, and figures he'll get easy wins, and someone who mains that Support Sion and knows the playstyle in and out. \n\nLogically, if he was balanced, but had his crazy high play rate, his win rate should be low, because the majority of weaker players should be losing to equal-skill players with stronger champions. If win rate = balance, that is.\n\n\"Low Win Rate = Balanced\" is a pretty flawed argument that has been torn apart a billion times in these forums, yet it's the only thing you've provided us over and over. \nMeanwhile, I, and many others, could easily provide you with a point-by-point analysis of where his problems are, why this makes him too powerful, and have multiple times throughout this thread provided reasoning for why a champion *who has literally been a top-tier pick at the highest levels of play for a few years* probably is imbalanced.\n\nWhy all the sudden, when it's a champion that Riot likes, is it okay to *not* base a balance decision off top players, but for *every other champion in the game*, it's perfectly fine to dumpster a champion when a pro player steamrolls with them? I used to love playing Ezreal when I was newer before you guys tossed him in the trash bin with some panicked nerfs immediately after S2 worlds, Olaf got absolutely dumpstered following a pro game where you guys got to see his power, etc, etc, etc. In *those* cases, it's fine to base decisions off the top level, but when it's Lee Sin you guys change your tune? \n\nPeople have been saying for *years* that Lee Sin is overpowered. A lot of people. At all levels of play. As I pointed out earlier, Scarra asked why he wasn't nerfed harder *on Riots patch rundown* and got baffled looks, and in my opinion it looked like it hadn't even occured to the Rioters on there that \"wait, people think he's overpowered?\".\n\nI'm not saying he's 4.20 Warwick Op, etc. I'm saying, and many other people are saying that *Lee Sin is too strong a champion*. That does not mean he auto-wins games. That means that *he has too much power*. There's a difference. A champion can be too strong in a game and have a low win rate, just as a champion can be considered weak and have a high win rate. Win rate gives you a ballpark *at best* of a champion's power, except in a few extreme cases. This should be obvious. \n\nNobody is saying \"pick Lee Sin = Win the game\". People are saying \"Pick Lee Sin = beat the shit out of your jungle opponent, have every tool you could want as a jungler, and have no/almost no significant tradeoffs for it\". This is the *exact* same thing people have been saying the *entire time he's been top/near the top of the charts for years*, and it's honestly kind of pathetic that the first remotely extended discussion on champion has had to come from people saying \"we're bored of seeing him\". I mean think about that. In order to get a legitimate response on easily one of the top junglers in the game's balance, he had to be top tier for so long *people are just plain bored of seeing him in e$ports*. I should add the fact that Riot can't seem to recognize the difference between \"basic usage of Lee Sin's kit\" and a \"Big Play\" to spotlight is a little disheartening as well, but that's a different topic.\n\nHe's \"obnoxious to play against\" *because his kit allows him to be better than whatever jungler you're playing at damn near everything your jungler is supposed to be good at*. He feels \"incredible to play\" *because he's good at everything and when played right, he can do whatever the hell he wants with impunity*.  He has every tool he could want and doesn't trade anything out to have them. Meanwhile, ***everyone else*** has to make some major tradeoffs for whatever they're good at (at least in the jungle. Other lanes are a different story/discussion).  Lee Sin can viably duel, and counterjungle, and gank, and tank, and assassinate, and push, and steal, and sustain, and so on and so on and so on. Hell, most of those things he can do better than champions *who actually have an identity and make tradeoffs to do them*.\n\nI have to reinforce that the *only* truly numeric \"fact\" you've given us is his win rate, and play rate, and repeatedly espouse them as the holy grail of balancing gauge (except when it's not Lee Sin), calling your statements on whether he's balanced \"fact\" as a result. \n\nMeanwhile, everyone has been able to see win rates and play rates for the entirety of the years-long overbearing status of Lee Sin, and still provide solid explanations for why..\n\n 1) Win Rate is not an end-all representation of champion balance: By your *own* logic, every high-level jungler who really wants to win would be playing Fiddlesticks, particularly the ones whose jobs are based on this game.\n\n2) Lee Sin is too strong, and has been for ages, and needs fixed.\n\nThe fact is, the \"average player\" who you're basing the \"Lee is balanced because win rate\" is *not* at a high enough level for it to be relevant: In the low tiers, where the majority of players are, there's a whole bunch of shit that's balanced with a little game knowledge that those players don't have.  Wanna know why Fids is a top win rate jungler? Cuz he can absolutely trash a team with his ultimate when that team doesn't have a clue how to react to it. A bunch of low-tier players don't know how to react to it. Ta-da, insane win rate. \n\nMeanwhile Lee Sin has too many tools, too much power on each of them, and low-to-no counterplay against them.  He has had these things for a long-ass time. People have been saying he's been too strong because of them for a long-ass time. Riot ignores them because it's cool to watch Lee Sin trash people in e$ports, or just plain can't see the picture in front of them. Either way, when you continually say \"nah man he balance cuz I say so\", it just sounds super arrogant, and honestly a little ignorant. \n\nLastly, even IF, in a hypothetical situation, your assessment of \"Lee Sin isn't overpowered, he's just fun to play and infuriating to play against\" were true (which, as I've pointed out several times, just serves to prove his imbalance), that alone should've been cause to change him *ages* ago. \n\n  -First, why is 1 Lee Sin players enjoyment in dominating another person worth the 5 other player's fun? The assumption would be, that since he's been this ridiculous and infuriating this long, you guys are saying a Lee Sin player's fun is more important than the other team's fun.  I can tell you, from personal experience, that a Lee Sin being better than my champion in *what my champion's defining trait is supposed to be*, while also being strong in every other jungler area, is *not fun*. And using that unjustified strength to completely dominate my team *was probably not be fun for them either*. Lee Sin probably had fun though. Yayyyy....\n\n -Second, this argument would wholly go against *exactly* what Riot has made several balance changes in the past contradicting, that being that \"no counter-play, frustrating champions are bad for the game\". Lee Sin is a top played champion in the jungle. *That is a hell of a lot of games that he's ruined the fun for other players over the last few years that he's been too strong*. Apparently it's fine to nerf *other* low counterplay, un-fun champions for being unhealthy for the game, but not Lee Sin.\n\nFollowing this logic, there's only a few possibilities for why Riot has left him where he is this whole time:\n\n-Possibility 1: Riot legitimately believes he's a perfectly balanced champion. The fact that he's been a top tier pick for *at least 2 years* in pro play alone would seemingly contradict this, but more on that in a minute.\n\n-Possibility 2: Riot is unaware of people believing the champion is heavily imbalanced. There's little to say on this other than \"I call bullshit\", because believing Riot just hasn't *noticed* people think he's overpowered is kinda.. bullshit.\n\n-Possibility 3: Riot doesn't know what to do to fix him. A crapload of people have offered suggestions. Also calling some bullshit.\n\n-Possibility 4: Riot legitimately believes a single Lee Sin's fun is worth making other players feel completely powerless. I doubt this is the case.\n\nThe first three of these are the most likely, with, if your ***opinion*** is to be believed, 1 being the most likely (The patch rundown with Scarra catching you guys off guard lends some legitimacy to the second one, but less like than #1 imo). This *still* means that you guys have such favoritism for the champion that you're willing to go against *repeatedly stated game design goals* in order to preserve his place near the top of the food chain, and have been willing to go against those goals for *a couple years now*. This, to me, is frankly very frustrating. While the many champions *other people* enjoy playing, who are unhealthy (sometimes even just borderline unhealthy) for the game and are un-fun to play against see nerfs, and in some cases full reworks, to change their unhealthy playstyle to make them less infuriating, ***Lee Sin continually remains immune to significant balancing changes***. \n\nPerks of being a favorite I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-01-08T08:47:53.984+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're running into problems with correlation and causation here.

The majority of champs who have a small % pick rate have an above 50% win rate.  In fact, many of the champs who have a really high win rate, top 10, are niche picks who have sub-par pick rates.  For instance, WW and Rammus both had really high win rates during 2014 (before the jungle change) but had really low pick rates and were considered lackluster junglers.  But against an AD team, Rammus will win almost every game. Warwick is one of my favorite picks against teams whose mid is a crazy assassin (ie fizz, kat, akali, etc).  Ult them and the game is won because you lock them down.\n\nOn the other hand, champs who are considered OP or strong, such as Lee Sin or Thresh see staggering pick rates, but have poor win rates.  But that's because more people play them, aren't as good with them as someone with over 1000 games on a niche champion, and since they are picked more, they are in more games to lose.\n\nWin rates mean nothing, but pick rates really show most champions power potential IMO.

LeBlanc certainly **FEELS** overpowered because she has almost no counterplay. Landing her E doesn't typically matter once she's ahead.

Back in the height of Zed in 2013 when everyone banned him, I'm not doubting his power in the hands of a professional LoL player. But he literally lost more games than he won on the live servers. If you wanted to win a game of League of Legends, you hoped your opponent picked Zed. Hundreds of thousands of games said so.\n\nBut again, I will reiterate that everyone's subjective feedback of, \"Lee Sin feels overpowered. Thresh feels overloarded\" is valuable information.

Cuz that'd just be... kinda ignorant.\n\nIs your logic that \"well, his win rate is about 50/50, despite his pick rate being stupid high for junglers\"? Because then I point out the fact that the pros play him because he's an overpowered jungler, which makes every kid trying to win their games start picking him all the damn time because he's easy and powerful with every tool he could want, and some of those kids just aren't good enough to play him properly and thus cause many losses.\n\nI'm just not seeing where you're coming off with all this \"objective\" speak, with literally no way to prove objectively he's NOT overpowered *in an actual game*, yet for years Riot has ignored the community, minus Lee Sin mains (obvious favoritism) and the Chinese (if Ghostcrawler is to be believed, go figure the Chinese might favor a Shaolin Monk archtype),  saying at least once a season in a massive wave \"Lee Sin is overpowered\".\n\nIf you have some magic, unknown statistic, please share it, but I mean c'mon: His win rate is a bad display of his power, *particularly* since anyone at any skill level can play him regardless of their aptitude for him, his pick rate is super high *for pretty damn obviously more reasons than \"well he's more fun\"*, and everyone is tired of seeing him and everyone minus his \"mains\" is saying he's got too much power.\n\nHe's got everything a jungler could possibly want and has been the, or at least one of the, top picks for *years* without actual repercussions, while everything that actually manages to overtake him in power is quickly nerfed.\n\nI'm not saying Riot should balance by votes necessarily, I *am* saying however that after *years* of him being too strong, Riot's blind refusal to fix him (excuse the bad joke) is getting exceedingly tiresome for many, many players, and that the defenses you guys provide of him have been, thus far, been plagued by contradiction or a lack of solid reasoning beyond \"we've got a secret drawer in the back that somehow immediately quantifies balance and it says he's fine\".\n\nHe *is* as strong as people think, the problem is you guys insisting 100% of the time regardless of input, *particularly* with regards to Lee Sin, that you know better. Even the people playing in your World Tournaments state, and prove, that Lee Sin is too strong and you insist you know better.\n\nHell, the last time he got his lovetap nerf, you had Scarra on the patch rundown and he said outright \"why didn't Lee Sin get nerfed harder\" and the best response he got was \"well... uh.. cuz we didn't want him to be less fun\".

But again, League of Legends is the most played online game in the world. We can slice data pretty finely and still get incredibly reliable statistics. We can look at something like \"win rate for # of games played.\" We can take EVERYONE's first Lee Sin game and average it. We can specifically take just for the relevant patches anyone who played Lee Sin for the first time, second time, third time, onward, and make a very convincing line graph for learning curve.\n\nEven the Lee Sin experts aren't pushing ludicrous win rates.

So basically you guys have made a decision to cut the champion pool in LCS in half simply by doing nothing to counter the extreme dominance of mobility in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-01-07T02:41:00.541+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":17,"body":"I absolutely disagree.\n\nRyze, Warwick (except ultimate), Orianna, Jinx, Morgana...

Which is why I find this response a little surprising, and can't help but disagree to some extent.\n\nTo the extent that you are suggesting that many champions have mobility abilities and that's why it seems like mobility abilities dominate... I think that that comment doesn't necessarily address the issue that the champions without mobility abilities are at risk of becoming second class citizens.\n\nFirst, I understand it was just intended as an offhand listing of immobile champions who have thrived recently, but ironically I think even a cursory analysis of this list reveals just how important mobility is.  \n\nRyze was strong because he was over tuned, but he also had a strong self-MS buff and a root which impairs enemy mobility.  \n\nWarwick was also strong because he was over tuned, but he actually has a flash like ult that also disables enemy mobility.  He both has a mobility ability to flash to someone, and a suppression to prevent an enemy from using his mobility ability.  \n\nMorgana has a root which impairs enemy mobility, as well as a shield which preserves mobility in the face of CC.\n\nOrianna is an interesting case.  She has an MS boost, but most wouldn't consider her a mobile champion.  At the end of the day, I think she's played because immobile mages can have enough power to make up for a lack of mobility, and she's best of class in that archetype.  She has a game changing ult and great utility elsewhere in her kit.  The problem this poses for other immobile mages is that if she's best in class, there needs to be a compelling reason to play another immobile mage over her.\n\nYou bring up Worlds, but as an impartial observer I found Worlds to be a huge testament to how important mobility is.  \n\nFirst off, I think Twitch has to be addressed.  Champions with stealth dominated at Worlds to an extent that I think most people don't realize.  Twitch went 17-7 while Rengar went 12-2.  Some of this is that they happened to be the favorite champions of very strong players, but there is a reason these champions were favored by these players.  Mobility is valuable because it allows you to create favorable situations in a way that less mobile champions would not be able to.  Stealth is a mechanic which provides the same ability, but is even rarer.  Notably, Eve (certainly not overpowered now) and Akali (can't say the same) both went undefeated at Worlds (in a really small sample size).  To be fair, Talon did not do that well, going 3-4.\n\nAll of this is just a way of saying that stealth has its own unique advantages just as mobility does, so I don't think it is fair to say that just because Twitch can be a highly competitive ADC pick that means that other immobile ADCs can too.  In point of fact, nowhere was the emphasis on mobility as apparent at Worlds as at the ADC position (except maybe jungle - more on that in a moment).\n\nAt Worlds, Lucian was picked or banned in 78% of games, Tristana was picked or banned in 50% of games, and Corki was picked or banned in 28% of games.  The only immobile ADCs who were picked or banned (more than once) were the hypercarries, specifically Kog'Maw who went 7-9, and Jinx who went a poor 2-5. The only other immobile ADC picked as Varus, and he lost.  \n\nNotably, the 2-5 record overstates Jinx's performance at Worlds, as she averaged a .4 KD ratio, and only a 1.57 KDA ratio.  The .4 KD ratio represents the only negative KD ratio of any ADC.  Kog'Maw averaged a 1.45 KD, lower than any mobile ADC except Graves (1.4 KD in two games), and a 3.55 KDA, lower than any mobile ADC except Trist (3.36 KD).  As far as I can tell, it's impossible to keep Jinx alive when she's getting dived by mobile champions of equal skill.  And of course, she isn't completely immobile anyway as she has a huge MS buff on kill/assist.\n\nEvery mobile ADC picked at Worlds (Trist, Corki, Lucian, Cait, Vayne, Ez, Graves) had at least a 50% win rate except for Trist (12-20) and Ez (0-2).  No immobile ADC picked at Worlds (other than I guess Twitch, who is discussed above) had a win rate 50% or above.\n\nThe jungle was arguably worse.  Lee Sin, Rengar, Kha'zix, J4, and Elise accounted for 147 picks.  Once again discounting stealth (Eve picked twice), if you don't count Rammus as immobile (picked twice), the only unquestionably immobile junglers to be picked were Nunu (once) and Fiddle (once).  The jungle role at Worlds was all about mobility (which makes sense for the role).\n\nAfter jungle and ADC, the picture gets a bit fuzzier, and your comments ring a little more true.  Jayce was one of the dominant picks in the later stages of Worlds, but he clearly does have mobility, even if his dash is limited to jumping onto an enemy.  He also has a passive MS buff and an active team MS buff.  Ryze was very successful as well, but he was clearly over tuned and has since been nerfed.\n\nOri and Rumble made the best case that champions can be strong despite a lack of mobility, but both have a game changing ult that gives them a huge team fighting impact that makes up for their lack of mobility.  Unfortunately, there is always a risk that if you create twenty champions with the immobile mage archetype, but one of them is best in class (e.g. Ori), that one will be played while the others will not.\n\nIt's certainly possible to have immobile champions who have enough power in their kit to make up for their lack of mobility, but I think this is only true at certain positions, and generally involves having a defining ability that a lot of their power is wrapped up into and justifies picking them despite their lack of mobility.\n\nAs I said, however, I do not claim to be good enough at the game or experienced enough to judge this in the abstract, I am just extrapolating based on the champions I see played competitively at the highest level.\n\nLastly, I want to say that I think that a lot of these issues do NOT exist (or are not that big of a deal) in solo queue, and in particular in lower tier solo queue.  At lower levels of play, I think almost any champion is perfectly viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whitakker","date":"2015-01-07T15:22:37.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could do us a favor and stop saying \"literally\" every other sentence, that'd be great.

This is in comparison to the new champions with kits that are overloaded with mobility like Kalista's dash every AA and an ult that gives mobility to her teamates these seem like she's just varus with mobility added on. Then there is RekSai with that global presence ult alongside an at-will MS boost with the burrow and a dash through a tunnel ability.

RekSai can kite, chase, waveclear, poke, tank, sustain, split-push, have gloabl map presence, and do them all quite well. \n\ntl;dr the mobile champs are either better versions of immobile champs and/or have no real weaknesses in comparison to the immobile champs. also mobility isn't just dashes, move speed is mobility.

The real question is \"Why?\"\n> \n> You could certainly force a wider variety. You could say \"Okay, you can only play each champion once per month / once per series / if your opponents haven't played it either.\" Enforcing a wider variety of champions can be interesting because you'll see more of them played. You could have 20 bans. You'll definitely see different stuff played if you do that.\n> \n> Another question can be if just \"Champion named Ezreal was picked\" counts as one unique pick. What about Mid Ezreal vs. ADC Ezreal? What about Support Nautilus vs. Jungle? Kayle Top/Mid/Support? How about different builds? AP Amumu vs. Tank Amumu? You can track the specifics of \"Champion named X was picked.\" Does that tell the whole story? Do you care if they were built differently? AP Mid vs. AD Bot Kog'Maw? I'd argue this counts as a \"different\" pick, but it's of course not tracked as that. Certainly, an edge case, but it's food for thought.\n> \n> On that line of reasoning, I think 2014 was a year full of flex picks. We saw Karma, Lulu, and a whole host of other mages go in various lanes. Would a better line of reasoning be, \"How many Supports did we see this year? How many Mid Laners did we see this year?\" Double-counting Jayce doesn't make for a very interesting comparison, but Annie might count. I think we saw more flex picks in 2014 than any other year. There were probably at least two dozen champions that were played in more than one role this year in professional play.\n> \n> The game has also become more homogenized. Up until halfway through Season One, many teams weren't running ADC+Support bottom lanes. Now it's considered commonplace. Not everyone knew Kassadin was crazy strong throughout 2013, Cloud9 least of which, but he defined the first half of 2014's Ban phase. Nowadays everyone's watching the Koreans and saying, \"Ah, LeBlanc and Corki are contested. We should all learn them.\" The fact that all the top-tier players have a standard to look to and compel themselves to emulate shrinks our champion pools significantly.\n> \n> I specifically asked Cloud9's Hai about this at the beginning of 2014. He said they sat down, had a meeting, and told me (paraphrased), \"We chose to drop our old playstyle. We should play like SKT. They won the world championship. Let's be like them\" Well, SKT couldn't even qualify for Worlds the next year. I'm not certain that emulating a specific team or style of play in a constantly-evolving game is the right way to thrive. Cloud9 had, consecutively, their worst splits ever after making the decision, \"Let's copy SKT.\" Throughout 2013 they made their own rules. Meteos made his own jungle style. Sneaky and LemonNation pulled in their own champion pools and style (Hello, Ashe/Zyra). Certainly, other factors than just \"not innovating\" led to teams taking more games off C9 than before; I'm just bringing up trends I see.\n> \n> I think the trend actually feeds on itself. Because everyone's compelled to learn specific champions because \"better teams\" do so, everyone shares similar champion pools. And because you can easily predict your opponent's champions, and magically you ALSO play those champions, it means you have heavily contested picks. I know they want Corki. Well I know how to play Corki! Let's first pick Corki. This repeats for every role, 2-3 champions deep. Some players branch out and have their own fun touches (Xerath players, Rengar players, Rumble players, Vayne players, etc.) but anything that sees a lot of success falls back into the old pattern of, \"Oh this champion's successful, let's all learn it.\"\n> \n> In my opinion, almost every single champion in League of Legends can be that champion. The next Rengar is out there. The next Support Annie or Support Morgana is out there. People just arbitrarily started playing them and everyone decided it was a good idea. But people seem to glom onto them really, really hard, so the pools decrease.\n> \n> What's the way to fix that? Is it OK to \"force open\" the champion pools?
