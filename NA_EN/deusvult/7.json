Its almost as if riot doesn&#039;t understand what a huge difference there is between melee champs and ranged one, and even on shorter ranged champs the safety that their inherent range provides.\r\n\r\nADCs that have gone top in the past are going to be going top all the time now, thanks to lifesteal on every item, basic items meant to counter health tanks and armor tanks, and the LW upgrade now has GW, so forget about trying to play {{champion:36}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:266}} .\r\n\r\nAnd with this huge buff to adcs across the board, you know who is going to return with a vengeance?? Assassins.  The game is going to become a rock-paper-scissors match played out at champ select, even more so than it is now.  Because if a team goes tanky, the other team is free to go with an almost all ADC lineup and utterly smash the tanks/fighters.  If a team goes into a multi-ADC lineup, the other team can go assassin heavy and delete them before they get the chance to attack move.  And if a team starts going assassin strong, the other team will go tanky fighters who can duel the assassins.\r\n\r\nRiot, pls reevaluate your preseason patch, in regards to much of the marksmen itemization.  Yes, you finally broke up the &quot;these 5 items are the best and I will get them every game, no matter what.&quot;  {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3006}} .    But as a whole, the marksmen itemization change puts them too over the top.  They even took items away from other classes who that item was designed for.\r\n\r\n{{item:3078}} Revert the changes.  Like wtf, {{champion:81}} does not need this item to only be about him.  Triforce is a bruiser item.\r\n{{item:3156}} Get that passive out of there.  You can add a &quot;lifeline&quot; passive, but MAW was meant for bruisers/fighters who need the MR/shield to keep from getting blown up when they are in the other teams face.  Ranged ADCs dont have that problem.\r\n{{item:3153}} Make it deal less damage for ranged champs (as in the current PBE value.)  Otherwise, the % current health remains the same for melees.\r\n{{item:3035}} On the last whisper + executioners calling upgrade, make the passive GW into an active, with reduced time on the GW (1.5 sec vs 3 sec.)\r\n{{item:3071}} Revert the health changes.  This item is meant for fighters, not ADCs.  It is literally perfect as it is ATM, if you make the PBE changes, you run into the same problems you had before when it was a high AD/low health item.\r\n{{item:3157}} Revert nerfs. You can&#039;t introduce all these new items that are going to put AD mid laners over the top AND nerf the AP armor item.  1 step at a time riot.\r\n{{item:3075}} Put on active where when activated attacks receive higher return damage and GW for 1.5 sec.\r\n\r\nAlso, GW should be reworked (on everything except ignite, which should be renamed to &quot;deadly wound.&quot;)  where instead of being a i hit = full apply, GW now stacks up to 4 times, with 10% healing reduc per stack.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents on the upcoming PBE patch for Season 6.  Riot is taking a huge step forward in finally addressing the state of AD items, but as usual they are overbuffing the hell out of one class all at once, while simultaneously nerfing most of their counters.  Hopefully we will get some more response from Riot before the patch goes live in a couple of weeks before we have another &quot;league of black cleavers&quot; &quot;league of assassins&quot; type deal with ADCs in every lane and kindred banned because they can jungle","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2015-11-02T02:51:52.707+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"I really think it's going to be a nightmare.

It nerfs AP assassins so AD assassins are a stronger choice by comparison, bu I'd argue there are other changes that indirectly nerf  AD assassins in ways that don't make it a buff overall (even if it's easier to kill mages and AP assassins w/out them having access to zhonya's as soon). Tank supports get a buff having the new mastery trees allowing them to get both utility and defensive masteries without sacrificing access to the other, so more often supports will be harder to one shot. Additionally with ADC's likely being stronger there are two issues that nerf AD assassins as a result. The first is that killing the APC is worth less if the value of another target is higher because you are having to give up more and getting less from killing the target who now lacks zhonyas, so if you have to trade lives to do it, there is less value now. Second, ADC's having more sustain options and EC again to hurt other champ's sustain may let champs like quinn or graves top be stronger picks, and picking an AD assassin w/ two AD champs already let's the enemy stack armor which is a huge nerf to AD assassins. It may not turn out that way but it's hard to predict shifts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dragonlord7137","date":"2015-11-02T04:13:21.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well, I like Riot's ambitions but they are really trying to bring back adc's after this season so at least give them credit for trying. i think they are going a little overboard as well but I would rather them screw around with everything to make the game interesting for a month or 2 then do almost nothing and have adcs sit in the bland place they are now.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-02T12:20:18.921+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dragonlord7137,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dv3uA1wq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-02T04:13:21.678+0000)\n>\n> Well, I like Riot's ambitions but they are really trying to bring back adc's after this season so at least give them credit for trying. i think they are going a little overboard as well but I would rather them screw around with everything to make the game interesting for a month or 2 then do almost nothing and have adcs sit in the bland place they are now.\n\n\"bring back\". adc never went anywhere, theyre still carrying lategame. \n\nthe only thing they seem pissed about is that there are other champs now that can bring similar damage to a teamfight as them. its not that theyre actually lacking themselves.\n\nnever mind their additional strengths when it comes to taking objectives.\n\nall this salt from adc mains this season seems more about sharing the spotlight than not dealing enough damage or being ineffective.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ARequestOfDeath","date":"2015-11-02T15:56:24.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"adcs are not mandatory. though they are nice to have i prefer doing my double bruiser bot","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-02T17:50:36.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pokemaster275,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dv3uA1wq,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2015-11-02T15:56:24.601+0000)\n>\n> adcs are not mandatory. though they are nice to have i prefer doing my double bruiser bot\n\noutside of normals, they are mandatory.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-11-02T20:25:51.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Several things you're forgetting\n\nMajor AD items all will have WAY less AD than before, while their costs are remaining about the same.\n\nZhonya's Nerf was Unintended and will be fixed\n\nGrievous Wounds is now only a 30-40% reduction instead of 50% reduction\n\nLW and it's upgrades only give 30-40% BONUS Armor pen, making them less effective against everyone, even tanks.\n\nMaw is getting Guinsoo's old Surge Passive, that's all\n\nTrinity Force Most Bruisers like CDR over AP.
