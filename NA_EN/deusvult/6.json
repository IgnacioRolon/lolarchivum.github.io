Don't all Rioters have Riot in front of their names?\n\nAs for Evelynn, I kinda expected her to have a wall/shadow theme going on. I expect the walls will have shadows on them rather than being exactly like Taliyah(that shit's kinda buggy and could mess Eve up completely if she accidentally moved one tiny bit away from the wall). I didn't expect \"going through walls\" to be a thing, but it'd be pretty darn cool. There'd likely be areas you just COULDN'T go through though. Either way, ACTUAL STEALTH on Evelynn would have me jumping up and down even if I have to stay next to walls to have it. It'd open up so much gank potential. If her \"tentacles\" are \"shadow arms\" I could expect she might have a sort of grab move though to pull people to her from the wall. Can't imagine they'd give her shadow arms for nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2017-05-26T06:25:42.908+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may be mistaken but im sure only about 90% of Riot staff actually have Riot in their names.\n\nI can think of WAAARGHbobo, Cactopus, GhostCrawler, Phreak, CertainlyT and i know there are a few others i cant name.\n\nHell even Meddler only goes by just Meddler.

Depending on how well it was executed it could be very exciting. Evelynn already has a sort of feeling of someone who wants to watch from the sidelines until they find the right moment to strike. Being able to actually do that up close without breaking your stealth could be amazingly good for her, as right now your initiation is kinda sloppy. You just gotta hope the enemy team doesn't react quick enough for you to go in honestly. With this she could be right beside someone without them even knowing it, while also having the counterplay of people knowing where to stay away from.\n\nAlso this opens up the possibility of Evelynn still having ACTUAL tentacles and I would not be okay with that.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=KmoneyIZsExy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=liE1QR35,comment-id=000600000001,timestamp=2017-05-26T23:59:17.172+0000)\n>\n> There is a post somewhere that reave or whatever his name is spelled commented on saying that for eve it wouldn&#x27;t work but maybe a cool concept for a different champ.\n> \n> Edit:link.    https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/E7mOieG3-that-leak-is-fake-confirmed-by-a-rioter\n\nUnless they want to take Evelynn away from being a champion all about shadows(walls generally have shadows which would fit perfectly with her specifically), I can't see them putting it on a different champion.","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2017-05-27T05:12:15.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just going by what the rioter said..I hope they do something cool with eve because I love playing her from time to time","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eternal791","date":"2017-05-26T22:37:05.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, being invisible near walls I think makes more sense than being invisible everywhere since lore wise, she hides in the shadows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2017-05-26T17:20:21.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a Rioter called Beluga whale or something like that.
