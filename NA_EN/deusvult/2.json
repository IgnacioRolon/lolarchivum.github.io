All of those champions need that healing. Thornmail shouldn't counter melee champs, it should be tuned to specifically handle marksmen who heal AND kite. \n\nAlso the Rioter already said GW on the item wouldn't work out.

This outright removes agency from the attacker due to the \"if I don't have specific counter stat line y, this target is outside my hit list\". Marksmen in particular should be target-agnostic to a great degree and the need to get the particular combo of lifesteal+mr should not get in the way of that.\n\nThat being said, thorn mail should be a direct counter to life stealing and other forms of on-hit sustain including on hit sustain that does not depend on damage dealt (Aatrox, Xin, Irelia). It's purpose is not to kill the attacker, but to make sustaining during the attack impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2017-05-17T06:29:35.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if that direction warrants renaming it something like \"Skeleton Armor\"\n\nChina would not like that tho !\n\nI'm also thinking if Sunfire is less strong itself it opens up the option of a better Thornmail.\n\nOr an MR upgrade of Bami's cinder that does damage in a \"caster style\" to contrast Sunfire Cape and launch fire back at those filthy mages!

It is always super frustrating as a tank to have the only valid strategy to deal with a split pusher with lifesteal be running away and hoping they can't kill you before you get under tower.\n\nAlso - have you guys ever looked at giving jungle minions Grievous Wounds and reducing their damage output slightly?  It seems like a lot of the problems in jungle diversity come from the fact that autoattack focused champions can do camps with no net change in health thanks to lifesteal allowing them high health ganks but tanks or mages get trashed by the damage output necessary to make camps non-trivial to people with lifesteal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-05-17T05:50:00.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must admit, this makes me a bit sad :(\n\nI think thornmail and randuin are in a quite bad spot, and that the \"anti-autoattackers-niche\" for Tank items is quite crowded with them and Frozen Heart.
