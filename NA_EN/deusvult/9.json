No way in hell he kites a tank with any mobility or cc.\n\nSwain can kite, once he get's Rylais, but only to a degree, and of course he usually builds tankier rather than full ap.\n\nVel's q is a easily dodged skill shot, as is his knockback and his true damage is flat meaning it doesn't do much to counter high health tanks unless he procs it a shit ton with his ult(which means he's rooted, catchable, and likely dead if he doesn't get the kill)\n\nI'm sorry, but holding up immobile champs and pointing out that they do in fact have a few forms of cc, doesn't mean they automatically become some kiting gods.  \n\nThings like Mao's huge snare, and his point and click dash, Zac's long range knockup, and Sej's dash, and multiple stuns kinda make those item dependent skill shot slows look weak and unreliable.

Yes, they have their ults to make sure they can get onto targets, but that is what the likes of Sej, Maokai and Zac are supposed to do: force fights to start.  If you want to keep them off your backliners then put someone in the way to eat that CC or slow them down.\n\nWorth remembering:  you can walk faster than a Maokai ult, Sej ult only stuns you on a direct hit, and Zac's E has a one second warning to avoid.  Combine that with a popular new AP item called Banshee's Veil and you won't have trouble not getting caught (except maybe with Zac, getting over big distances is his thing).\n\nBrand doesn't kite by throwing his entire kit at someone then walking away, he spreads out his spell usage to allow his passive to burn you as much as possible.  That whole time you are slowed by Rylai's and he can potentially stun you as well, but he probably doesn't need to.\n\nWhen Vik builds his Rylai's his main kiting tool against the likes of Sej or Mao would probably be his E or W, not his ult.  The ult is good, yes, but his E has a short enough cooldown, applies the slow again after a delay for longer slowing and has no cast time so that it also works fine for this.\n\nSwain has a slow on his Q and has a snare on his W.  He has no issues kiting without Rylai's, go ahead and walk through his bird's laser field and into the snare.\n\nVel's Q isn't so easily dodged when you want to walk towards Vel.  He shoots it straight at you, so you sidestep it and then he makes it split into you or makes you dodge backwards to avoid it.
