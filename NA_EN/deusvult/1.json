His first was for defending his position at the US embassy alone against over a thousand enemies, inflicting 200 casualties and holding the position, by himself.  His second was during the US military involvement in Haiti, where he and 35 other Marines were ambushed by over 400 rebel Haitians, Daly led his men to victory against overwhelming odds.\r\n\r\nHis quote was during WWI at the Belleau Woods in France, where he yelled to his men before charging headlong towards the German line, facing heavy fire the whole way.\r\n\r\nI really love that this was included on Odessey Jynx, as it fits her character so well while also paying tribute to one of the biggest badasses of all time.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-09-17T21:31:21.469+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a great story, and an inspiring individual.\n\nHowever, knowing **Carnival Knights** as I do, I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be a reference to Valeria from 'Conan the Barbarian', or Jean Rasczak/Johnny Rico from 'Starship Troopers', either... ;-)","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-09-19T19:13:55.169+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a Starship Troopers reference, but that was a reference to Conan which was a reference to Dan Daly.\n\nReferenceception.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-09-20T02:05:07.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carnival Knights,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=px8tFEJt,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-09-19T19:13:55.169+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s a Starship Troopers reference, but that was a reference to Conan which was a reference to Dan Daly.\n> \n> Referenceception.\n\nDo you want to know more? >>>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2018-09-18T13:37:40.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A reference of a reference, that's pretty meta.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2018-09-18T13:40:41.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good artists create.
