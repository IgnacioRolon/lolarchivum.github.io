And they keep nerfing everything EXCEPT those champs while saying they are trying to buff other junglers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after DFG got taken out of the game, a clear nerf to Veigar and Morde, they talk about giving them buffs to make up for the loss.\r\n\r\nAnd they change morde so he deals way less burst damage and has to build tanky to get his shield.  Yet he still has no CC and no mobility, so its not going to change anything.  He will still be as kitable as ever, and deal less damage if he ever gets to his target.  Even less because now he doesn't even build damage, yet has no % health on his kit except for his ult.  This is a straight-up nerf.\r\n\r\nOr how they are changing Veigar:  TAKING damage from his ult and having a delay on his E.  And saying he can farm more to make up for it, yet increasing CD on his Q.  As if it wasn't hard enough already to land a veigar E.  This is a nerf, yet they have the balls to call it a buff\r\n\r\nRito, you have nerf and buff confused.

Of course you don't.\nYou know how every Zed just split pushed 24/7 post laning phase so maybe the nerf was a good start that would't completely destroy him? Nope\nYou know how Morde never ever burst anyone down anyway unless he was 20/0? Maybe focusing on his identity as tank more than as a useless mage could be a good idea? You know how he's dominating PBE? Nooope\n\nThe white lies about the Veigar changes are so stupidly dishonest that I'll stop with the rhetorical questions. Yeah they're reducing the *ratio* (1.2 -> 1.0) from his ult, the damage remains the same and the cooldown and mana cost are reduced. Oh no! Now D-Cap rush Veigar is useless... which it was anyway.\nHis E was impossible to hit anyway unless {{summoner:4}} or {{item:3117}} (this was, incidentally, the strategy that high level Veigar players had going for them, *much diversity*) and they're increasing its range and reducing the mana cost and cooldown (hint, hint this is a trend). Now it's the zoning tool that it was against competent players. EDIT: If he played like standard mage, I mean.\nHis Q gets the exact same treatment, except it has a higher CD post rank 3 (by .5/1 second, mind you) and now is a skill shot which stops at the 2nd target hit. Considering that his W *also* got CDR and mana buffs, yes this is a buff to his farming phase. \n\nBut by all means, keep cherry picking from the changes you don't like to make them look like a nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-02-14T11:49:47.184+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":29,"body":"*sigh*\n\n>Remember a while back, when they said that they were going to nerf Lucian, and they ended up giving him a manaless dash that got its CD lowered when he used his passive?

Now? Why would you pick anything but J4 and Lee? you can pick Vi as a secondary jungler and Nid is seeing some play there... that's about it. All other junglers are pretty hurt with this new jungle... except those that are only usable in low tiers since they can just pubstomp everyone (looking at you shaco)\n\n3) Morde is going to deal less damage overall and the trade-off? be slightly tankier... doesn't change the fact that he has no cc or mobility so people will just ignore you and take out the real threats in your team unless they see you out of position so have fun playing your slightly tankier Morde (if you can even get enough gold to do so) while adding nothing to your team other than this Garen wannabe that really does nothing but beg you to be stupid enough to attack him and not his teammates that he has no way of protecting.\n\n4) Veigar doesn't need to wait till late game to hurt people right now, what type of useless build are you doing that you need to wait until late game to dish damage? Veigar will need more than numbers tuning in order to be even remotely close to being as useful as he is now and he isn't that great now so that should tell you something","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-14T23:48:22.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I bought Lucian as soon as they made that dash \"nerf\" lol. \nZed changes were actually pretty significant, it doesn't stop him from killing you, but it did nerf the previous style of Zed play.
