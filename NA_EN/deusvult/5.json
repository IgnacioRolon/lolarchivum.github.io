If you had Annie and Zed both at 450 IP, you'd have a lot more new players (genuine new players, not the smurfs) who run into an extremely complex champion when they barely have the most basic grasp of the game and its mechanics. Then when you do consider the smurfs that actually do know how to take advantage of the champ, they have an even easier way to roflstomp genuinely new players and make them feel bad for ever trying the game.\n\nAdditionally, with the cadence of champ releases slowing significantly, having price reductions at the proposed rate makes it incredibly easy to collect all the champs with little effort which decreases the incentive to buy them with RP (it's still a business). It's already been over 2 years since a champ was released with me not having enough IP to instabuy them and for a solid few of them that was at a 7800 price point. I recently got tired of having so much IP so I bought up every rune I could ever conceivably use (meaning everything except things like AP/lvl Marks or Energy Regen Quints). I'm still currently sitting on over 8k and I have no idea what I can do with it because it will likely be over 15k by the time the next champ releases and that's the biggest factor. With fewer champs coming out in longer periods of time, there's more time to farm IP and catch up.\n\nBesides, if you're still lacking in runes, that's what you should be focusing on, not champ collection.

To ball park it, most people are capable of unlocking 1x 6300 champion a month with fairly dedicated gameplay.\n\nThe problem is, we haven't accounted for runes, rune pages, or an opening champion pool (aside from luxury picks).  How much of Riot's player base plays LoL more than 20 hours a week? That's the only way new players would have a remote chance to unlock their needed content to play ranked effectively in a single season.  Most people don't want a hopeless grind, nor have the time to do so.  I suppose that's the entire point, to force people into buying RP for things other games give for free (i.e. DOTA2).\n\nIn fact, I had 3 friends that I convinced to start up LoL in the last year that all got to around level 15 before they gave up on the pointless grind that is IP and XP gains.  Speaking as a player who started LoL in Season 1, back in 2010, I hit level 30 in a single month, and earned enough IP to buy everything in the game in 6 months.  Players starting now would be lucky to hit level 30 in 6 months, and have absolutely no hopes of unlocking just half the game's champions in 2 full years.

I'd have to do research into which champion gameplay and design I like so that I wouldn't have wasted all that time. I played DOTA 2 for a while as well, but quite frankly, I was a bit overwhelmed by the large amount of heroes that I could choose. The large amount of characters and ip costs help me slow down and try each of them one by one, instead of playing one game with them, do badly and pick another. Another thing I find is that I wouldn't WANT all the champions. My heart sunk a little when I got Trundle for my mystery champion after the pool party event.

Then they tell other players to do it, but what people don't realize is that if a person didn't do it already they probably don't have the extra cash to throw around. \n\nif riot where to reduce champion prices even a little, it would be a god damn godsend to players who can't afford rp. not that it will ever happen but there's some food for thought. and before you say anything like \"its a bad idea, they'll lose money\" let me just say this. lol esports <-- they are making  thousands if not millions off this.
