Make it more difficult to build up his passive shield than just walking around lane.  When you call CotC cancer for lane because it lessens trades but Yasuo exists and can block a solid chunk of his opponents damage every minion wave is just absurd.  He should actually have to interact in order to build his shield rather than just run around while its down.\r\n\r\n2. Get rid of 2 mechanics that he really doesn&#039;t need:  \r\n           A. The ult mechanic that places him as far away from a tower as possible so that he won&#039;t be hit by the tower while having the animation go off. \r\n           B. How his wind wall spawns slightly behind him and pushes itself in the cast direction, so that it blocks projectiles that have literally already hit Yasuo.   Also, his wind wall blocks projectiles from all angles, even behind.  It should only block projectiles from the direction it is cast to, in the same way that braum shield works.  So that he can&#039;t pull the dodging from 1 side of the wall to the other and negating all ranged damage for 4 seconds.\r\n\r\n3.  Make his free double crit passive scale with levels as you have done with literally every other champ in the game.  So he gets 10-100% increased critical strike chance based on champ level, scaling from 1 to 18.\r\n\r\nAll of these would help reduce Yasuos early game dominance, since he is currently an early game monster with one of the best late-games in the whole game","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-16T23:05:50.133+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"These are solid suggestions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RlP K0BE","date":"2017-01-16T23:09:41.996+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like 1 and 2 but his crit passive needs to stay the same.

When you think of a high risk-high reward champion Yasuo should be one of the first to come up. Right now he can access a lot of the reward while also staying safe. I think that his base stats play a part in this. His base stats are actually **really** low for a melee champion so Riot gave him his shield and wall to compensate for that.
