One (or maybe more!) new one(s), plus the older ones.\n\nI would give both Victorious Morgana and Championship Riven for Victorious Janna. \n ~Uiru","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-12T17:44:44.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a cool idea, but I don't think it's totally fair for those who earned the older Victorious skins in past seasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Uiru","date":"2015-02-13T00:36:49.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=QoPBqEg1,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-02-12T17:44:44.656+0000)\n>\n> It's a cool idea, but I don't think it's totally fair for those who earned the older Victorious skins in past seasons.\n\nWell, those people would still have more of them than others. Choosing an older skin means you don't get a newer skin. Someone who has been gold for five seasons would have five, while I would only have two. Janna is just one of a small list that are actually important to me.\n ~Uiru","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScottyRawr","date":"2015-02-13T06:17:16.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone talks about 'fair', but then you have people who don't even like to play Ranked or do not play it at all.
