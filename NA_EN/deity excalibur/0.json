And I thought about this.\n\n**Why not make Lifesteal and Armor Pen share the same unique passive?**\nIn order for this to work, all lifesteal items should be reworked into something else.\n\n{{item:3033}} {{item:3036}} Stay the same\n{{item:3072}} ~~Lifesteal bonus is upgraded to 40% and is unique passive with the same name as the 2 items above.~~Converts 20% of damage dealt by basic hits (before defenses) to health.\n{{item:3139}} ~~Lifesteal bonus is upgraded to 40% and is unique passive with the same name as the 3 items above.~~Converts 20% of damage dealt by basic(before defenses) to health.\n{{item:3153}} Lifesteal removed, other stats buffed idk.\n{{item:3156}} Lifesteal and spellvamp removed, this item should give proper stats for its intended users (bruisers).\n{{item:3812}} Melee only. The lifesteal part doesn&#039;t share passives with any other item.\n\nNow you must all be thinking, what the fuck is going on here? I&#039;ll tell you what I have in mind.\n\nMake adcs pay for sustain, make them either be able to sustain and facetank everything, or melt anyone and blow up when focused. You now have the option to either go full crit mode with pen and melt everything or you can sustain yourself and kill them by outhealing their damage, you can&#039;t do both at the time.\n\nSo now, you have basically 4 options, you can go\nMortal reminder to counter those annoying trundles and mundos\nLord Dominiks and make short work of their sions and nautilus\nBloodthirster and withstand poke damage\nMercurial and just go HAM on their carries\n\nThere&#039;s no more lifestealing armor penetrating carries doing 800 crits on tanks and healing for 300 while also having massive shields/heals from their team.\n\nThis would also reinforce more those lifesteal oriented tanks/bruisers by actually being able to outsustain adcs should they opt for penetration.","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-12-30T01:00:55.763+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"because all you're really doing is nerfing lifesteal out of the game while pretending to be fair about it","replies":[{"poster":"Deity Excalibur","date":"2016-12-30T01:02:33.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why?

The rest are supposed to do that, they are bruisers, their whole job revolves around killing the enemy adc lol. And most of them have had counterplay added with the reworks and items added. And besides, try to think for a bit. With the exception of malph, the others will most likely do 2 hp items, at most 3. and one of them will be armor. With the new lifesteal system not requiring you to actually bypass their armor to get ridiculous amounts of health, you are now free of 2 slots (1 thatÂ«s usually for the armor pen, another for more lifesteal/crit) to basically double your damage == sustain and get a GA. as I said. You should either do one, or another, not both. And bruisers are pretty much unaffected whether the enemy has pen or not, they barely build any armor/mr, they just stack HP.","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-12-31T08:06:03.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly i didnt list any tanks, just what I assume you mean by tanks. \n\nAnyone could build this sort of thing though.

(Armor pen and warlords, Lifesteal and blackcleaver). With the new items being absurd in terms of sustainability and people screaming for nerfs, I figure why not instead re-balance ADCs around them.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-12-30T01:14:50.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, but then you are garunteed to see a high increase of champs like malphite/rammus.\n\nBuild a thornmail and basically an adc has no way to kill them, or any tank at that rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Deity Excalibur","date":"2016-12-30T01:20:24.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Bloo Banana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XIpWXOz9,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-30T01:14:50.934+0000)\n>\n> Maybe, but then you are garunteed to see a high increase of champs like malphite/rammus.\n> \n> Build a thornmail and basically an adc has no way to kill them, or any tank at that rate.\n\n\nRemove thornmail.

Even when full build and with 40% lifesteal + armor pen, he will kill you if he gets to you.\n\nThat's his thing. He's this tank that is bad in teamfights because he lacks any true CC to be a decent frontline and in exchange offers excellent AoE damage and killing potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-12-30T22:51:23.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the whole point is that in the lategame is when an adc is supposed to shine, and tanks aren't meant to 1v1 an adc unless they got ahead in their lanes or from getting a lead from other lanes.

Rammus was specially designed to take out ADCs in a 1v1 in exchange for a mediocre teamfight presence (lets face it, a 200 range taunt on a character that has one of the most predictable mobility ability is not enough for a tank). Even with the items currently as they are, rammus can still 1v1 pretty much every adc except vayne.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
