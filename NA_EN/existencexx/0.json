Since patch 6.9 myself and many other users are experiencing frequent lag spikes in game of up to 200-500. Even my use on this website is affected by lag issues but I am not having difficulty on any other web or game service. The game isn't playable right now for me. I have confidence that Riot will fix it, but many people are posting about it in threads right now and I haven't seen any notice put out that they are aware its a serious issue affecting this many people. I would really like to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-09T20:29:55.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah this is the 4th day that i am experiencing this packet loss its only for this game as well..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revive Aatrox","date":"2016-05-08T03:24:50.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got same problem but didnt happened today, sended a ticket to riot support about it. got a breif answer with more files to give to them. Maybe there's something that changed since it didnt happened today. tillg et this error message when ever I creat or join a lobby. Anyway best way to check with this is to send a ticket to riot support. they must be really busy caus ei havent had response today after sending the new files. Oh and after patch 6.9 i had an afk on both side almsot every game. I almost thought DDOS where coming back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ojou","date":"2016-05-07T05:43:25.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting this a lot today as well. Yesterday was fine but since OFA came out it's been horrible. My ping is 34 and my FPS is a constant 60. Those are always fine. My computer isn't overclocking, but I've been getting a ton of in game lag to the point where even I click multiple times I don't move and my spellcasts are extremely delayed. \nUpon using a recording device it makes everything 10x worse, it just automatically disconnects me. Please fix this Rito.","replies":[]}]}
