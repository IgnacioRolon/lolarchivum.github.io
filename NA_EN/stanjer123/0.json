She's a broken design in the core, so how much we can fix her broken design? This is Riot's question to fix her. Her low win rate doesn't mean she's just hard to play as, most mains/otp are good at her, but since her team fighting is trash at the beginning of the rework and still is (because of her weak burst + heavily nerfed Shroud). Yes her ban rate did go lower (70% to 40-50%).\n\nShe's impossible to balance, annoying to play against and the fan base of that champion already doesn't like how Riot is handling it.\n\nNerf her shroud, and Akali fails as a champion. Nerf her execute base damage or/and scaling, now she is a viable AD/AD Crit melee champion. Nerf her healing significantly without compensation, it will make her survivability way lower and might lead to her death faster.\n\nAs OP pointed, Shroud takes too much power from her kit, reverting 8.24b nerfs and taking away the mechanic that towers can't reveal her might open up some power to other parts of her kit. If her survivability ability is so strong, her burst is shite. Which it is, (Unsurprisingly).
