I used task manager to shut everything down and restarted league. I was able to load in and click to lane, but lost control of my champion and died to auto attacks from minions... I'm running a full repair now (sorry teammates that are now forced to fight a 4v5. Also they couldn't /remake cause i technically loaded back in then died)\n\n\nI have never had this issue before. My ping was proportionately out of control. Is there something going on right now?  It seemed server side since the rest of my internet worked fine\n\nTo add insult to injury, i have to type \"I Agree\" to not leave games from leavebuster. The repair is done, but my chat is broken and I cant message people. Anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T00:56:40.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I double-checked our records and was unable to find any recorded server issues.

I'm hardwired in and have played hundreds of these games from this location. As far as I know nothing has changed. I had regular access to the internet (twitch / league boards). I've been able to play a bot game then a normal since then so I guess it was just a fluke.\n\nIll check out the link you sent me anyway.

Once you accept that you can simply just go through the trouble shooting guides(following the same 3 basic steps they all offer) and hope that by the time you're done reading them the issue will have passed. \n\nI really can't fathom why Riot thinks its impossible for their servers to have hiccups or small issues. Not everything has to be a massive issue that affects everyone.","replies":[]}]}
