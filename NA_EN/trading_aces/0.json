Malphite isn't the only one who is scaled down in size in-game. Skarner, Maokai, Nautilus and Vel'Koz are also giants compared to the avarage champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-10-02T21:04:35.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not as big as malph, cho has no relevant scale to his size since his splash is still only him and nothing next to him for reference. Zac is actually not a giant... he just looks like one in game. Nautilus is only slightly larger than a normal man as he is merely trapped inside a suit. Skarner also has nothing to use as reference for his size. Maokai is also not as big as you would think, in most of his splash arts there are other trees around him that are much larger than he so i would say he is big but not a giant.\nVel'Koz is scaled down a bit but not by much.\n\nMalphite however... just look at how small helmet bro is hanging off his hand... he is a fricking colossus and yet is smaller than garen in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Destínum","date":"2014-10-02T21:19:26.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho'Gath's probably has potential to be unlimitedly large, which is why it's so much his thing, and I only said partly Zac since he has the potential to get unlimitedly large as well, depending on the amount of goo he has access to.\n\nAs for the others, you don't really have your facts straight.\n\n* Did you miss the \"A New Dawn\" cinematic? Nautilus is *huge* and really living up to his title. He might not be quite Malphite's size, but he's pretty close.\n* Skarners teaser comic and splash art (comparing him to a minecart) shows him being pretty damn big.\n* Maokai is a spirit inside a twisted ancient oak. Oaks tend to get pretty big, so not much logic is needed here (his splash art is pretty old, so probably just reflecting on his in-game model size).\n* Vel'Koz is actually scaled down by quite a bit (although not as much as the others). Just look at him in his Battlecast splash art for example (that tentacle going through a fucking building!).","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-10-03T00:43:07.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"helmet bro is the size of a single segment of malphites finger...\n\ni also wouldnt put to much stock in skin splash art.\n\neven if maokai is a twisted ancient oak all of his splash show normal trees towering over him so I would say his transformation into sentience reduced his size as well.\n\nnautilus is big in that cinematic yes, but if you were to reference that to malphites splash... hes the size of one of his fingers.","replies":[{"poster":"Destínum","date":"2014-10-03T05:01:13.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying Nautilus in that cinamatic is like one of Malphite's fingers, even though you just said helmet bro is that size...?","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-10-03T21:02:42.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look at your finger, notice it has 3 segments and 2 joints separating those segments :P\n\nhelmet bro= segment\nnautilus= finger","replies":[{"poster":"Destínum","date":"2014-10-03T22:24:03.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually did the math from what we have to go after, and Malphite is about 23 metres tall, while Nautilus is about 5.
