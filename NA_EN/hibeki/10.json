The system is garbage.\r\n\r\nSaying that every game just because the numbers add up on a team makes them equal is such a terrible way to go around things.\r\n\r\nAnd let me make **crystal clear** this is majorly a league-only issue. \r\n\r\nI'm master tier in heroes of the storm. You know how often in ranked play games were decided from who was the worst, not who was the best? I could probably count the number of games out of a thousand on one hand.\r\n\r\nPlayer skill is much more prominent in other games, because they are given methods to shine out above the others. Shoving *every* mechanic onto *every* champion and buffing *every*one and *every*thing to be a massacre comes down to a point where its no longer whos the best, because the enemy can still match your power. It comes down to who's the worst, who CANT use that power.\r\n\r\nEvery. Single. Game. its a stalemate until 1 or 2 people come out and say 'yeah sorry im trash' and that team loses. This isn't just for my losses either, this is always my wins too. My wins = enemy has trash, my losses = my team has trash 90% of the time. This game is become how you deal with dead weight not how you play the game.\r\n\r\nAnd I can tell you why. Champions dont have identities anymore. Everybody in the game has been givin every mechanic so everyone ultimately does the exact same thing in slightly different ways. Congratulations riot, you buffed everyone to the same level now look what the game has become.\r\n\r\nWhen you take on the motto of 'buff buff buff!' this is what the game becomes. Fights are over in seconds and one mistake means youre fucking dead and the games over.\r\n\r\non the contrary, while 'nerf nerf nerf!' isn't a fantastic motto either, when everything is so weak its more open to player strengths not player weaknesses. Mistakes aren't punished so game endingly as they are now and if someone does get ahead they are only slightly stronger than you are. Still play-around-able. \r\n\r\n>Matchmaking is the worst part about this. It's just a blind number that adds up to 100 to fill teams. \r\n\r\nYou got a 10, 10, 30, 20, 30. The enemy got 20, 20, 20, 20, 20. These are equal teams, go duke it out.\r\n\r\nExcept, they aren't. Two members of the first team are god awful and are going to cost them the game. While sure, they also have 2 really good members, all the enemies being average means they can respond decently and appropriately to the better laners, while the awful ones wont.\r\n\r\n>Matchmaking enforces a 50% winrate.\r\n\r\nIm sorry, but this is true. Patterns in streaks clearly show its forced.\r\n\r\nLet me explain something called the Gamblers Fallacy. Gambler's Fallacy is a phrase where someone believes because they have lost a lot, they will win soon. Or that because it landed on red in Roullette, it will land on black soon. Which isn't true, every instance is independant of eachother and the odds of another thing happening do not increase.\r\n\r\nWhich should be equivalent here. Except its not. Games that are independant of eachother wouldn't show clear patterns.\r\n\r\nIf you have a long loss streak, you will eventually be met with a win streak once the algorithm determines that you are able too. This is why you see patterns *all the fucking time* in your history of \"7 losses in a row, then 7 wins in a row\" within a very short time period.\r\n\r\nEven people who are way too high skill level for the elo like boosters (outside of bronze and silver) will still have AT MAX a 60% winrate. Which shows that the system is actively working against you. Either its forcing the games in the enemy teams favor, or the game as a whole is not determined by your skill. Or both.\r\n\r\nWhich means that your own personal rank means literally nothing. Your skill isn't the primary factor of your games any more. You are no longer the most common denominator. Your rank is referred to 'did I have good teammates or not for X games' and only in extreme minority cases (like QT) its determined by your extreme talent in micro and macro mechanics. And even then, QT still can't win with terrible teammates if the enemy is decent.\r\n\r\nSo, safe to say, Im quitting this game. Permanently. Im sticking to Hots. Ill wait for this game to die out. As soon as a real competitor comes and the community is fed up, this game will die. Easily.\r\n\r\nOh and just a reminder, if you think Riot actually cares, look at who bought them out. Tencent. You know what other major games they bought out? Games like Candy Crush. Their main concern is forking over every penny and not making a decent game, and if you think Riot is any different, well sorry to disappoint you.","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-02-19T03:15:03.040+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":37,"body":"\"League is gonna die, I'm sticking to HotS.\"\n\n*goes to look at how the games are doing on Twitch*\n*League has 61,000+ viewers*\n*HotS has a whopping 4,222*\n\nlul","replies":[{"poster":"sarii fox","date":"2018-02-19T03:19:08.799+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":4,"body":"\nHe has a point, though.

To achieved that it looks at your winrate :\n\nTo describe unaccurately what the system does :\nYou have 75% winrate vs 1800 mmr ? Let's try to make you play against 1850 mmr, you keep winning ? 1900, 1950, 2000.\nOk now winrate is dropping to 55%. Let's go 20 by 20 : 2020, 2040, 2060, 2080, 2100 ... 2160.\nOk, now you lost 7 of your last 10 games, maybe your opponents are a bit too strong for you : let's drop to 2100.\nStill losing a bit too much : 2075\n\nAnd then the system keeps adjusting your mmr every single game, step by steam it will aim, not at forcing you a 50% winrate, but forcing you to opponents of your skill level, which will enventually lead to a 50% winrate.\n\nThe only case in which it will not lead to a 50% winrate is : low number of games, or you improving so fast your skill level keep changing too fast to be tracked accurately by the algorithm.\n\nBut your improving will eventually slow down, or you will reach the top of the ladder, and then the problem is different : since the system can't match you against opponents of your skill level because there are not enough gifted peole, you'll probably keep a high winrate (and no the system will not put silver in your team in order to force you back to 50% winrate).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-02-19T06:15:59.473+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Wow!

The only people satisfied with the game through their 'surveys' are not their target players or prime audience for the game, they just use that information because they can cherry pick it.\n\nThis dissatisfaction shows this game is dying. It's growing due to being big name and really only being competitive against DOTA, which long outlived its time.\n\nWhen a new competitor pops up, you can bet that the majority of none asian regions are going to mass migrate to that game.
