Nothing is fed when it's late game and everyone has 6 items and I wouldn't really call you a tank when you only have 2 items against what you died against which is the enemy adc's which are suppose to counter tanks and are good late game especially twitch. Also tanks do more then just tank that would be stupid. They also cc and do other things volibear specifically is suppose to snowball the early game in the jungle or lane stomp his opponent so that it's a 4v5 and win easily and quickly.\n\nSo when you have a champion that is suppose to be used to win early against a very very late game team with twitch,yasuo,poppy,rengar all who are shutdown easily for the easy early game win. The nerf to yasuo was to his early game base health so that he had a harder time in lane but that doesn't matter if you let him get 6 items in the late game with a late game team. All these people are ad and if you want to call yourself a tank don't buy only 2 items against armor when your agaisnt an all ad hyper carry comp especially when your more of an early game tank.\n\nAlso we don't know how he died. Did he get caught out? Did he run in like an idiot and get hit with everything it looks like it considering he got hit by nami wave and poppy and twitch bork and poppy usually goes into the enemy team to dive. Also he has a thornmail so even though he didn't do a thing and had almost no armor defense items against the best late game tank melters he still did a lot of damage to twitch with thornmail. and then the other people in his comp like rengar and yasuo can be completely countered with exhaust. and as said against a team like that your not suppose to let them get 6 items the game is suppose to end before that.\n\nMost tanks are tanks because of there kits so like gnar for his passive or poppy because of her ult that lets her live for like 7 seconds and do tons of damage.\n\nalso 4 seconds is a long ass time to be alive. Play vayne and get hit by a cc like annie flash tibbers or just some random cc and see how long you live even without much hitting you and if volibear flipped twitch he would probably die. Watch ziggs ult hit you for 60% of your hp while having more long range abilities that both zone and do a lot of damage to your team. so when against a late game team that does all ad with only 2 armor items as an early game tank with no abilities to gap close other then flash 4 seconds is a long time he almost got the twitch he had to be real close to get borked by him and it's amazing he got close with nami and poppy peeling for him and even then he got close so those 4 seconds don't look long he almost got the adc in a cc that would most likely kill him and he forced the poppy to not dive your adc but peel for hers and forced nami abilities essentially with an early game tank that is suppose to snowball and win early he almost killed a late game adc hyper carry against a late game hyper carry team that deals all ad damage with only 2 armor items and he diverted the attention of your whole team to do so. and if tanks die fast think of how fast everyone else dies in that same 4 seconds what was your team doing? Probably still dieing considering your against a late game hyper carry team but if your team comp was the same they would do a lot to the enemy in those 4 seconds and even though he still died that thornmail would still do a considerable amount of damage I mean think of the damage done to twitch sure he has some lifesteal but if volibear had more armor then twitch would have taken way more damage and remember how many champions like ziggs ult does 60% of adc health that itself would be enough to litterally kill him sure the twitch has a banshee's veil but that's easily popped and there's a reason people generally take QSS over banshee's veil.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Opistach","date":"2015-01-02T17:12:19.931+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks are in theory... \n\nSupposed to initiate the fight, and get out just before they die.

You want to know why people don't play much yasuo anymore? It's ebcause his early game was nerfed. Same with jax. Though this doesn't apply to late game and if you let a twitch a poppy and a yasuo and a rengar reach late game your going to lose and it's no suprise that a twitch can deal 2k damage in 4 seconds even to a tank especially since this particular tank is suppose to snowball his team early with either ganks or cheese his lane opponent and snowball that way he is an early game tank with only 2 ad defensive items. against about the most late game oriented and ad focused team you can get. Even then 4 seconds is a long ass time especially against that team when it's focusing you. Twithc only did half his life and poppy and twitch borked him and that means other people did damage to him and by his comments the yasuo Q'ed him twice while probably AA'ing him and considering yasuo and poppy counter tanks and are late game game oriented. I would the early game voli did pretty well with 2 ad tank items against full ad damage. especially since poppy and yasuo would rather dive then peel and thornmail would have done some damage to twitch though not as much if he had more armor. Volibear was also close to flipping the twitch considering he was close enough to bork the volibear and that would most likely kill the twitch but that team is so late game focused and since they all have 6 items they could probably 4v5 the team without twitch especially since there all ad and are tank killers and there tank only has 2 ad defensive items and though poppy Q does magic damage the poppy should be diving the enemy because her ult makes her a tank/diver.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-01-03T17:37:59.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"um, tl;dr?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bwooday","date":"2015-01-02T07:12:05.706+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't even see a point on going full tank anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-01-02T07:39:53.203+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kill or be killed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2015-01-02T08:27:55.979+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"dog eat dog.\n\nI don't want to eat dogs T_T","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-01-03T09:05:19.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst or be bursted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IceKingChernobog","date":"2015-01-02T23:34:02.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad ain't it, Used to love just going full tank voli/mao/cho now it's you gotta build at least 2 damaging items then go tanky.
