Only movement. People who die or leave vision remain on the map where they were last seen, and the same goes for minions.\r\n\r\nMinions will endlessly attack eachother just like they would in a full disconnect.\r\n\r\nBut you know you are still receiving some packets, because you can actually still 'fight'.\r\n\r\nIf youre a jungler, you can use your abilities. if you have a dash, the game will still use that dash and move you. But no animation is played.\r\n\r\nWalking into fog of war to see jungle camps they will not appear. But, if you have attack click on and use an ability to draw aggro, you can still kill them. You know the camp is gone when your attack click stops making you move back to attack.\r\n\r\nSo youre just pressing buttons and attack click shows when camps die.\r\n\r\nThis shows that you are still PARTIALLY CONNECTED. The game still registers there is a hostile entity, but doesn't display their health bars, models, animations or anything.\r\n\r\nIt's reasonable to think that you're missing packets.\r\n\r\nExcept this is literally only a problem in the east-southeastern US. Everyone I know just has this happen at random times throughout games.\r\n\r\nAnd riot just doesn't give a fuck. They seem to have this warped idea that I can tell an ISP to route everyones connection to a server differently. \r\n\r\nWhich I cant.\r\n\r\nIt makes the game unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T01:42:10.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gee, really sucks when the Tech Team has no further solution to offer. Often though it's because they've examined any possible solution that could apply and can't find none. Further, it typically means that we've got nothing in our pockets they haven't already tried.\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}} \n\nI'm not sure about 'packet loss without packet loss', I've never heard of that before. But if you're concerned about your routing path, one thing you could try to improve this is [**reconfiguring your DNS**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5). While we normally suggest this only for players outside the US/Region, you may find it could fix your own problem as well provided Tech Support hasn't already suggested it. If you're playing on Wifi, I'd also suggest using a hardline connection instead.\n\nWe hope these help out, but if they don't in the end or Tech's already tried them, it may be time to discuss the trouble you're having with your ISP.","replies":[]}]}
