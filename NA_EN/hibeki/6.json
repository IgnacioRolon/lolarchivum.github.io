That's starting to just sound like meaningless buzzwords to me because those words are constantly thrown out, whether they're applicable or not. Andrew Ryan is right in that it's realistically just an engine thing - basically the difference between hitboxes, model size, and hurtboxes playing out in an isometric top-down game summed up. Doesn't mean that the hooks aren't too wide, but he's not wrong when he points it out. It's like Roadhog's hook in Overwatch: mercifully large so that the character who's built around the mechanic isn't required to have pinpoint aim to be useful with their central mechanic (but unlike Pudge who does need good aim to reliably land his hook). Besides, I think both Thresh's hook and Blitzcrank gain a T-shape at the end of their hook range too, don't they? One could propose its removal and see if that helps, but that still only does anything at the end of the hook range.\n\nDoes this mean I think the current hook width is fine in terms of the hitbox displayed by the hand flying out?
