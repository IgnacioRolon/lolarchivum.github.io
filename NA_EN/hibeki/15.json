It's not hard to recognize problems. That doesn't take leadership. It does take leadership to address the problems without getting emotional or upset, without casting undue blame, without making assigning blame the focus of the complaints, and without casing insults or getting aggressive. All of that helps to communicate with other people and help them bring the best possibility for success. Bitching does all of that wrong. It tries to blame people for mistakes, it gets extremely aggressive, and it creates responses almost entirely from emotion. It's a terrible communication strategy, and it completely lacks any leadership elements.\n\nIf you want an idea, here's one: tell players that questioning why someone made a mistake is a terrible idea. It gets you nothing, particularly when the answer usually won't improve future play. Giving proposals for what to do instead and developing plans is a much more effective use of limited time and it actually has a chance of bringing a team together. Bitching and whining won't.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2014-11-17T06:19:41.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not everyone has problem solving skills.\n\nBitching can be whining, but it can also be \"Why the fuck didn't you take dragon while i was top\" etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-11-17T13:26:24.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why the fuck didn't you take dragon while i was top\" etc.\n\nThat is whining. It doesn't matter why they didn't take dragon. It's completely irrelevant. There is no leadership in complaining about mistakes. What is important is establishing plans for future action and trying to improve team communication. That does neither of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2014-11-17T08:28:02.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing good about that aggressive statement.

Unless you have a QQ-powered time machine somewhere, saying something like that does nothing to help you or the team. It just makes whoever didn't go for dragon more likely to be upset.\n\nSomething like 'next time [this situation occurs] go for drag, they can't contest' is a lot better, because it sidesteps the 'YOU made this mistake' feeling and is entirely proactive. I can go for the next dragon. I can't go for the one that died 10 seconds ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Friendly Cop","date":"2014-11-17T05:48:08.014+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Here's my two cents: people need to stop being so god damn sensitive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AloneInTheCrowd","date":"2014-11-17T11:49:42.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need to bitch more ?
