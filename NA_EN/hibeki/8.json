I find it absolutely mind-boggling that one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world is still making no real effort to supply data in a manner that is clear to all, and that still relies primarily on third-party sites to supply vital information. As an editor on the LoL wiki, I've seen typos shape the entire perception of a great deal many players, including pros, which to me shows that that site, rather than any official Riot resource, is where people get information from the game, and any discussion on statistics here refers to sites like op.gg, again a third-party site. Riot's practice of denying player claims without actually substantiating their own rebuttals with data, data _they readily have at their disposal_, comes off as super shady to me, and on the few occasions where Riot has indeed produced that data, the logic and conclusions behind those posts were... questionable. I'd like to pin this on Riot still growing and learning through trial and error how to process and display data, but that's not really possible when Riot is as big as it is, or has grown for as long as it has. As such, it does feel like we the players are being deceived, or otherwise manipulated through very selective usage of data, itself pre-packaged and dressed up to suit a very specific PR goal, rather than to genuinely inform the playerbase. There is no transparency to League's data, and it feels like this issue is deliberate.\n\nAdditionally, what irritates me with Riot's recent communications strategy is that, for the most part, it's not really communicating at all. We've thankfully seen a few exceptions like Jinxylord, who takes in and directly implements player feedback, but most communication between Riot and the players is only one-way, with Riot talking _at_ us, rather than _with_ us. Back when Riot was a smaller company with a smaller playerbase, they had this phenomenal communication with their fans: while it's understandable that this communication is more difficult at a time when there are literally thousands of times more players, the problems with Riot's communication go further than that, and I think their communication has degraded overall. Besides developers who spend much less time with us players, we've gotten replies that frequently don't say anything at all. Riot themselves have repeatedly said that they don't want to announce their plans for fear that a change might disappoint us, and what few indications they give are frequently non-committal. There's no real indication of how Riot incorporates feedback or listens to players, despite their claims, and it feels more like Riot is resting on their laurels from their early days to keep telling us they have the best player communication around, even when that is clearly no longer the case. There's also been this disturbing recent trend of Rioters talking down to players, and arguing in toxic threads without contributing anything at all, while much more constructive threads remain completely unanswered. It doesn't feel like the relationship between Rioters and players really has the respect and mutual goodwill that it once had, and I don't think the critics are the only ones to blame here.","replies":[{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2018-04-16T20:09:19.979+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is really well said.

I understand Riot may want to keep totally new content somewhat of a secret, since it makes sense to build hype to an entirely new addition, but I think it is the absolute worst strategy to apply the same thing to changes to existing content. Even when a champion gets relaunched, that champion is a piece of content many players have become attached to and want to follow through development, to make sure that they turn out right. Similarly, while it's understandable that the devs may not have all the details on upcoming gameplay updates, or may change direction farther down the line, I don't think it's been healthy of Riot to keep us all in the dark when making sweeping changes to the game itself, e.g. the map, itemization, and so on. Fixing broken content is not the same as releasing new content, and Riot trying to apply the same secrecy + hype formula to both I think has had majorly negative consequences on both the game and player trust.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Altonius Amakiir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ljZuQ9bX,comment-id=00170000,timestamp=2018-04-16T20:09:19.979+0000)\n> \n> I want the surrender@20 red posts articles to be full of rioters answering questions again instead of context quotes, I want it to take more than a few minutes to read again.

I joined the Boards specifically so that I could give constructive feedback and engage in dialogue with the devs, and even joined the Warden team (now the  mod team) to make that dream happen. In practice, though, getting a Riot response is a crapshoot, no matter how well-written the post, and when a red post does happen, it's still a gamble on whether or not the Rioter in question will say anything of substance. I find it tremendously disappointing to hear from Riot that their devs don't have the time to answer players (and that is indeed often an actual problem), and then see a fistbump icon on a popular thread, only for the red response in question to be some one-word response to a pun, or alternatively some pages-long rant about how the OP was being hyperbolic and how the Boards are just a minority echo chamber of baseless negativity. I've been here since before the Boards even launched, and to this day I still don't know how exactly Riot incorporates feedback most of the time, if they even do so at all anymore. Most threads on Reddit comment on e-sports, and the only surveys I received from League asked me whether I wanted to buy a particular skin. The Boards were meant to offer clear feedback channels between the playerbase and Riot, but due to the complete lack of resources and effort put into the site, no such thing has happened.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Superspick","date":"2018-04-16T14:30:18.727+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"They'll also choose stats from other servers to argue/explain the state of things on a separate server. \n\nI think one of those posts took data form like the OCE or some other smaller server on the eastern hemisphere to answer a post regarding the NA server.\n\nHere's the thing - we don't have insight into their internal systems and processes. Because of that, we always are at a disadvantage in these conversations, because we are forever susceptible to \"well, you just don't have the data we have and that's why you're wrong\" stance.\n\nBut i dunno bout you...for me, if you're addressing, say, your EU players and explain your stance by citing numbers from the Korean server, i think two things about you:\n\n - You're depressingly incompetent by lacking the capacity to identify where i'm from OR just not doing your due diligence by being prepared with relevant info.\n- You're hiding things.\n\nEither way, not a good look. \n\nOnce again peepies, the game is not catering to you all anymore. Skin sales are not the income they are after, those will not be sustainable the way a presence in entertainment (e-sports) will bring.

The main reason for not releasing the mmr for example is so that people can't copy how it's done and apply it to other games. For example I'm sure league has it's own algorithm for figuring out your mmr. IF they released that then they would also release their way of doing it. Also there are some studies (very few actual studies done but almost all of them) show that by not showing what rank you are or really these studies were more general but basically shows that by not showing how good someone is at something they are more likely to try harder and play longer to make sure that they are where they want to be. People if they knew they would set a goal and say something like 1900 mmr is my goal then would try super hard and once they get there they would feel accomplished and stop playing as consistently. Not saying this is everyone I'm just a normal college student that is going into video game design while taking business classes.\n\nAlso there might be some other business reason's riot can't post their data. My thought is riot either have to tell us why they can't or just post it.

That comment was, as far as i remember, downvoted to hell for doing nothing else but providing evidence to debunk the false accusation by a certain player and many sheep in the same thread.\n\nThe thing is, when a witch hunt is being prepared for someone, people usually already decide where they stand and won't back down even if proven wrong. Because then they'll make up any excuse to still retain the belief that they're right so that they don't have to apologize. But Riot sure as fuck always needs to apologize about something to someone who was \"personally\" offended by a specific change.\n---\nWhat i absolutely hate about the boards is that instead of asking for an explanation or more information, they intentionally want to make a wrong point in order to force Riot's hand into having to defend themselves.

I wrote 3 bug reports (one on the pbe boards, one on the boards, and one from the client) and they still had no idea. I had to hunt down a rioter on the boards to get it fixed. And not trying to say how hard it was to fix, but it was fixed next patch after that.\n\nI tried to find out what happened to Ghostcrawler's monthly Q&A for about 4 months and couldn't get an answer, Riot wouldn't respond and the moderators/the community responded with something along the lines of a link to an Ask Riot thinking that's what I meant. The only real response I could get was from Scarizard who isn't even a part of Riot anymore, and he didn't know.\n\nI tried to figure out what is happening to the Item Set Tool and I got a bunch of snarky comments from moderators/the community thinking I was asking for it to be added to the new client. It took me 6 months to get an actual response, and while I treasure the response because I'm no longer in a state of extreme stress over it, it wasn't exactly an answer to my questions on the subject. Being: Why is there a limit to the sets? Why are updates to the tool never in patch notes? What is the priority on it since I know people are working on it? And when might we get unlimited item sets again?\n\nOther questions I've tried to get info on: What happened to the melee itemization changes early this year we were promised (Repetoir happened to answer that this week coincidentally)? When is the attack speed rework going to happen/ is it still planned? What happened to the Wukong GU that was predicted to be early this year by Rioters/ when was it moved back to approximately? When is the tenacity rework to be expected?\n\n------\n\nI don't have so much a problem with them sharing statistics, although a website that just auto updates every day on winrates and playrates that they provide would be nice, I have a problem with that they seemingly have suddenly changed how they communicate with the community. They used to talk about stuff they were planning way in advanced like the Yasuo update which we were told in a big post would happen down the line, but is seemingly cancelled (according to Repetoir). Now they don't mention anything it seems. Would you honestly be able to tell me what is planned for midseason? I couldn't. I think back on previous midseasons and I remember hearing things almost as soon as preseason ended and then them building on it as the date came closer. All we know at this point, with maybe a month left, is that it has to do with bot-lane.\n\nWhen I first started playing league around season 5 end I would come on the boards and it would take me close to an hour to read the red posts on gameplay from the day prior. It took me 7 minutes to read the last weeks worth today. This is a problem for the community and Riot. How can you expect people to trust your gameplay changes if you aren't talking to them? How can players get hyped for the future of league if they don't know it? I honestly don't know what is slated beyond the Ahri changes, the Aatrox changes, the LeBlanc changes, and the Akali rework; and none of those champions particularly interest me. I have a list of changes they were looking at doing for this year before preseason shipped, but I can't expect that to be relevant info anymore because it hasn't been talked about. I thought that they were no longer doing the fighter itemization this year because it wasn't mentioned, but apparently they are. It makes me angry. I want to know what's going on in the game. I want to discuss things with Riot about which direction the game should be heading in. I don't think I should need to be asking a company to communicate with it's player basis, let alone Riot. This was supposed to be one of their strong points, something they were immensely proud of as a company when I joined, it put me at ease seeing how much they talked with us and knowing it meant they truly cared. I was prepared to take what they said at face value, as I've noted from doubting whether talked of changes are happening or not, I can't take them at face value anymore.\n\nTo any Rioter that might read this: Don't let the player-company trust die out, I know it's hard to talk on the boards right now, but ignoring it isn't going to help anything. You're losing trust simply by not communicating, and it's a lot easier to lose trust than gain it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-04-17T19:44:43.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do know what happens when they announce work way ahead of its time?\nAo Shin.\n\nRiot's VGU/GU timeline is [here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule) After every VGU, there's a new champ in between and that's about 6 VGUs and new champs per year.
