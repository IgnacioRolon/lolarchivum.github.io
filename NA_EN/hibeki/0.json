Are you on the updated client?  If so, what happens on the legacy?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nThe updated client is still in testing, so if it's exclusive to that be sure to report it via the bug icon on the test version.
