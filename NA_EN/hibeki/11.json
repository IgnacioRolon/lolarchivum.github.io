If two adc&#039;s have a combined pick rate of 50%, there are clearly balance issues with them.\r\n\r\nIf they have a below average win rate (49% and below) it just means people like the champ and is fun. But if the champion is above average winrate, this clearly shows that it&#039;s being played because they are too strong. \r\n\r\nYou also have to keep in mind the bans, and that only one team can pick the champion. So in reality if everyone got their way, the pick rate would be MUCH HIGHER.\r\n\r\nChampions should at NO POINT EVER have a 30% pick rate. 30% pick rate (Which in reality is higher for the previous reasons) clearly is not played because they are fun. A fun champ would not be in half the total games, because they have weaknesses. Fun champs don&#039;t win games. Strong champs do. That&#039;s why you don&#039;t pick a fun champ that much.\r\n\r\nCurrently most of the 12% ish champions are META. This is because since there is a small meta pool, the will have a drastically higher win rate. This is expected every season.\r\n\r\nHowever, the top 5 play rate champs right now are 3 ADC&#039;s, a Support, and a Jungle.\r\n\r\nThose three ADC&#039;s in order are Lucian, Ezreal, and Jhin. The support is Thresh, and the Jungle is Lee Sin.\r\n\r\nLee sin will always have a high pick rate. A strong champ that is satisfying to play and can make plays. This is to be expected.\r\n\r\nBut Lucian has a 33% play rate. This is clearly an indicator that Lucian is way too damn strong.\r\n\r\nAll of the top playrate champs do their jobs too well.\r\n\r\nThresh has the lockdown of Leona while having a Blitz hook.\r\n\r\nLucian can destroy any target with any amount of AD, and his ult does too much damage. If you could grab his ult at level 1, with nothing but a dorans blade and your starting runes/masteries it already does 700 damage. About 1100 at level 6.\r\n\r\nEzreal does his job too well, too high DPS and kiting potential\r\n\r\nJhin crit&#039;s oneshots anyone because of Duskblade. Playrate will decrease once Duskblade is fixed though.\r\n\r\nAm I the only person who sees a problem with champions having 30% plus playrate?","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-18T21:26:33.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet Lucian's winrate is still garbage.\nEzreal really isn't anything worth noting.\nJhin is just decent and popular at the moment.\nAnd Lee is not \"strong\", are you smoking?\n\nSome champions will always be popular, while others will be less popular.\nLCS and the top 1% or so of the playerbase generally defines this because the champions they play are the flashy ones/high skillcap ones/versatile ones.\nThat doesn't necessarily make them actually good, nor are they usually good for the other 99+% of the playerbase.\nHigh playrate/banrate =/= broken/OP/etc.\nHigh playrate/banrate = perception of popularity/strength.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-09-19T00:03:54.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except for roles such as ADC it's extremely easy to go over 20% pickrate while maintaining decent winrate.\n\n1.
