Braum needs teammates who are AA reliant (preferably more than just 1 champion) Leona will just faceroll. I don't think either are really worth a ban (and the suckiest thing you could do is give people enough bans to start basically banning out all of the tank supports in  good spot now so that you're forced to make your toplane tank or pick a support that is outclassed by more trad/mage supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2015-02-10T06:10:37.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leo at least is single target and CANT BODY BLOCK PROJECTILES FOR FREE.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-02-10T06:26:11.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add, in botlane he doesn't really have a dive mechanic making him a lot less scary to all the Sorakas and Sonas out there who don't have hard CC early.

Not to mention that Braum's CC is on a continuous stacking basis that without an ADC focusing takes forever to stack.\n\nBraum has a great level 1 for invades but Braum has a really weak early game whereas Leona dominates early and then scales well late. Braum only becomes a monster to deal with late if you don't screw over his mana costs, lack of follow up, and lack of presence early game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ImaChickIRL","date":"2015-02-10T06:12:06.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No Vi?
