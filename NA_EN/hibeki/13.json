That's cool.\r\n\r\nThe real problem, is the FAILSAFES.\r\n\r\nNo matter HOW badly zed fucks up, now matter how much he gets caught, he can just R or W for an instant escape unharmed.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have someone camping his shadow, (Which you shouldn't, thats 1 team member out of the fight) He will get out 100%. Unless you are a dumb zed and don't lead them between attacks and stand still, you can be in three places at once.\r\n\r\nWhere you are now, where you will be if you E, and where you will be when you R.\r\n\r\nThat is RIDICULOUS presence with an assassin. Leblanc had the same power, but in response they cut her silence so you can do something about it.\r\n\r\nBut zed still has EXTENDED untargetability. He got an extra .5 seconds of untargetability later after release, meaning he can dodge more damage, and follow you if you dash, flash, or whatever it may be. He can pursue, destroy, then blink away.\r\n\r\nThat's not good, Assassin's have an all in, and some form of safety, but the safety only lasts so long and there is a way to rid it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Akali has her cloak, but it only lasts so long and can be negated by a pink ward.\r\n\r\nUnless you CC Zed for a SIX SECONDS, which is TWICE as long as it takes for the mark to trigger, than he will get away.\r\n\r\nThe second thing, is that he can build nothing but tank shred, and still have more than enough damage to KO a squishy.\r\n\r\nThis is partially because tank shredding items are a bit too strong, but also because he has RIDICULOUS scaling and base damage.\r\n\r\nBC, LW, and BOTRK for tank shredding, but i'm not a tank so that shouldn't do anything to me right? WRONG. He will scale off the slightest AD, and for some reason BOTRK actives APPLIES to his mark, dealing another half an active upon trigger, and his base damage is so sky high that without decent AD he still has massive damage to kill a 2k health carry.\r\n\r\nThis is why I think he is an unhealthy champion, no other champion in the game can build nothing but tank shred and KO a carry, then get out whenever he wants no matter how bad he fucks up.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2014-11-27T20:55:56.951+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":11,"body":"Yeah Zed being claimed as a \"healthy\" assassin is the biggest joke in the history of this game.\n\nHe forces you to use a long cooldown to survive his assassination attempt, which he has no problems engaging so the only counterplay lies in what you do when he engages.

Definitely against Fizz than Zed. Fizz can be stopped much easier than Zed due to:\n\n* No blinks. Fizz Q and E are dashes and as such can be stopped by well timed CC, Veigar Event Horizon, Azir wall (Fizz can't get over it).\n* Safety based on delaying and waiting, not by blinking out. When he uses E/Zhonya, he'll become vulnerable again as soon as trollpole/Zhonya ends, therefore giving time to delete him.\n* No ranged abilities outside long CD ultimate. Fizz has to all-in, he has no ranged poke.\n* Much slower burst. Fizz can't get in, burst, get out and wait until you die, he needs to land 2-3 AAs to secure a kill. Zed can execute his entire combo in less than 1 second, blinking twice in this time.\n* Vulnerable to anti-divers. As above, Zed is one of safest divers and anti-turtle champions, Fizz under tower will be deleted with any kind of CC.\n* No sustain on Fizz side. Zed almost always has BoRK, giving him sustain, also he has energy. Fizz is mana-constrained and usually has no lifesteal/spellvamp, delaying him and making him waste mana (poke hard from range) will end with harmless Fizz.\n* Escape range. Fizz can jump up to 800 range in about 0.5 second, which allow you to follow him and burst even if he tries to get in-burst-get out immediately. Zed can go (by backing to ult shadow and then using W to increase gap) 1175 units in about 0.1 second.\n* Waveclear and turtling is extremely efficient against Fizz. He'll get low on mana when he tries to push and need to handle wave after wave. Half HP Zed dealing with wave after wave will soon get to full health and energy, then dive and kill you.\n\nTBH I don't play Fizz a lot, he's a champion which can be countered by strategy and playstyle, not only by mechanics, items and summoners (as with Zed/Katarina).

But in lane I feel that a lot of champions trash Zed, yes I main Zed, so he relies on farm, which his passive really helps, but if by then the enemy laner has a Zhonya's or anything similiar then you're worthless and have little chance of getting fed. \n\nSame for ADCs, if you get fed and they build Mercrucial Scimitar and/or have a support who is ready to protect them from you/react fast enough to CC you then you're not worth anything but a split push. Zed's laning isn't the best in my opinion considering many Zed's use their W and Q combo to harass which leaves him VERY vulnerable to ganks early on which completely shut him down.\n\nZed is much easier to focus then champions like Akali, Fizz, and less so Talon. Akali with Zhonya's is quite hard to focus, Fizz is Fizz and most likely has Zhonya's, and Talon has his ult which is easily countered with a pink so disregard him. My point is that i'd much rather deal with a fed Zed than a fed Fizz, Akali, or Talon any day because building against Zed only consists of one item. {{item:3157}} Give's both armor which already is awesome against Zed but the active just wrecks him entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2014-11-28T00:42:21.506+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"QSS is not viable counterplay.\n\nYou have to go out of your way to build an EXTREMELY expensive item which is NOT EFFICIENT AT ALL for the item slot.\n\nYou have SIX SECONDS after casting ult to get away, there is not a single bot lane in the game with that much CC.\n\nGanks in mid lane are VERY easy to avoid.

He can't run in and attack adc's. he has to ult. Now name the amount of champions in a team that have knockups, stuns, knockbacks, roots etc.? Also you say that it takes like 6 CC's? He's so squishy that if you stun him once you can pretty much instagib him immediately. He takes very good positioning and timing.\n\nPretty much this. A good Zed with a lot of experience destroys. New Zeds are completely terrible in general. The can't assassinate to save their lives and  generally just feed. Zed has one of the highest skill caps and skill floors in the game. To understand him takes quite a bit of practice. I understand you think if he fails he can just press a button and escape. But this is a teamfight. I think you are greatly overestimating zed's ability to escape. Even a 2 second hard cc on zed is enough to instagib him. \n\nHonestly, the only thing I agree with is itemization. Right now Arm Pen is really strong and so his ability to instagib anyone is good.

If he screws up, maybe he gets out, but he wont get that kill unless he's insanely ahead. You also don't have to CC him for 6 seconds to kill him.

The thing with Zed is that while he has huge damage potential, his kit is mechanically difficult; his Q and E are skillshots/AOEs that can miss, for example. Talon, on the other hand, is relatively easy to dump on enemies with. His one skillshot has a wide hitbox, and his ult AoE can be closed back up on command, making it more likely to hit.\n\nAnd I see little issue with using his ult defensively if needed, though I like using it more like Shaco's invisibility (pop ult, go into the lane, E on the enemy champion, watch the damage fly).\n\nAgain - the \"uselessness\" of Talon with his lack of silence is only relevant if the enemies he targets are ALWAYS in possession of an escape mecahnism EVERY SINGLE FRIGGIN TIME he moves in to attack. Take Flash, for example - it can have a 210-300sec CD (assuming points in the Utility tree for decreased Summoner Spell cooldown AND the Distortion boot enchant). Talon's E has an 18-10sec CD (down to 6 with max CDR). Unless his opponents reserve every form of escape they have for Talon (and suffer the potential CC of the other 1-4 members of his team), then there are ample opportunities for Talon to jump on and wreck face, in regards to Flash's availability.\n\nTL,DR: Both Talon and Zed are good in their own way. Zed may do higher damage in the late game, but is harder to get the hang of and a bit more prone to missing with his abilities than Talon. Both can wreck lane or be wrecked depending on their own performance and that of their opposing/allied teams. Both are also fairly squishy. :P","replies":[]}]}]}
