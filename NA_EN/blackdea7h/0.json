You guys should add even just a little of blue essence per game because it is harder now. Now we players must lvl up just to get blue essence and if we don't have the rite amount we need to disenchant some champs. The new runes are good just need some getting use to but pleas add some blue essence per match because other players like me cant get a lot because we are low on lvl and its a bit slow. RIOT PLEAS FIX THIS.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T21:50:09.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does kind of feel weird that you don't get any currency after games anymore, but that's just because there are so many other ways to get blue essence in general. You get some from chests/capsules sometimes, you can still disenchant shards as you always could, and you can start getting more champion mastery chests from S's and such once the new season starts!","replies":[]}]}
