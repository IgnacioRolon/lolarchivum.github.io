Recently I have been having problems access the game after the client starts the game up. I keep on getting messages that says there was an error in DirectX and that I should check for updates on my video driver. I have checked for the any new updates on my system or video driver and there were none. I have also run the DirectX diagnostic, but it has not found any problems.
