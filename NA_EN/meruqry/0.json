It feels very off and slow. I decided to look into this to see if it was just me. It wasnt just me and everybody thinks the same thing. People say that the animations are off and when you hit a target with the project yasuo sword, the sword isnt even touching the target for a tiny bit when the damage is being dealt. Overall the skin is very sluggish and slow and feels very off. I was just wondering if riot would ever fix this skin because i feel like i wasted my money on this skin and i would hate to never use it again because it effects my gameplay performance. This skin looks very good and i really like it, i just can&#039;t use it because i play poorly in the games that i use it in. It would be really cool if this skin was fixed and was synched like the high noon yasuo skin or blood moon yasuo. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-15T18:44:15.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nWe did make some tweaks that should hopefully aleviate these issues.
