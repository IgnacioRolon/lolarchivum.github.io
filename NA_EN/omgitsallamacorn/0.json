When I click it, nothing loads. It shows that my (desktop) PC is trying to load it, but won't. So as far as I know, It might be my browser (google chrome) or where I am. (NA, North America). Anyone have any advice? \n\nEdit: @Riot\n\nC'mon Rito! Tell me if it's a bug with my part or if anyone else is having trouble.\n\nEdit 2: I was looking and saw @Targon Embrace  try to solve this problem for others and it worked, but not for me. The blitzcrank error message pops up (error 500) and he said to use a VPN network, which I have no idea how to use. I cleared my cookies and everything! But nothing works.\n\nEdit 3: Player support will figure it out...most likely.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T03:04:27.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohai~\n\nAre you still having problems with this page? A number of players have reached out to let me know that the page isn't throwing the 500 error at them anymore, so I'd double-check to see if this was solved for you as well.\n\nPlease let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"OMGitsaLLAMACORN","date":"2017-01-25T02:08:40.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope! It works. I sent a message to player support and they said they were working on a fix and it's out now. Thanks for your time anyways though!\n\nEdit 1:..just..got 4 A+ in a row..as {{champion:16}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} ....I NEED 2 S's ..for mastery 6.
