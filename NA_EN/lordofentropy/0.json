Judging from the screen shot below, what isn't updating/syncing correctly is the current IP I actually possess. That is, I thought I had more IP than I apparently did, but my IP available didn't reflect that. In fact playing further matches, the number would go up reflecting the IP gain. But at some point, either I spent some IP prior to trying to buy this rune, it didn't accurately reflect that deduction, or I gained some and it didn't add it. It's not a big deal, but something to pass on to the dev team.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/O7XDn1e\n\nYou will note my total available IP displayed, 1464. The cost of the rune is 1025 IP. However it says my balance after buying said rune will be 215 IP, inferring that I actually have 1240 IP not 1464. After purchasing the rune AND after a restart, it still displays an apparently incorrect IP amount remaining of 439 IP. So somewhere some calculations are being pulled from different fields and those aren't syncing properly lol.","replies":[]}]}]}
