I've played a few normal games and am now playing bots because I heard it's the fastest way to level up. I'm getting give or take 55 ip for a win and with this I still have 90 games to afford a 6300 champ. Is there a faster way to get ip or is this a sick joke and a waste of my time","replies":[{"poster":"XinCrin","date":"2016-10-03T01:47:11.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest for you to not play against bots because you really will not learn much and will hurt you when you try to hop into ranked when you hit level 30. Also, to answer your question about getting ip faster, there really is no way of getting ip faster. But remember to win at least one game a day so you can get your free win of the day ip.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-10-03T00:41:55.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me m8, you have it easy.

The longer the game, the more IP you get. Winning gives more. If you want a cheap champion, I'd suggest Jax. He's only 1350 I think and is a good fighter top, and he can jungle. Same with tryndamere. Also, cho gath is good and cheap.\n\nAnd don't worry; just because someone costs less doesn't mean they're less powerful. Even those base stats and bars they show aren't very accurate for champion power.
