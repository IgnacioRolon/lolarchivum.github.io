I went ahead and rebooted/restarted/repaired my system.... after that I downloaded League.... and checked the skin again. It seems like nothing changed, her e still looks the same. Some of her abilities I think are missing some little particles as well (it was already like this before I repaired my system), it's  not that noticeable though, I just feel like they are missing some bits of particles. \n\nI think there is something wrong on my end. Do you think my video card is corrupted? \n\nFrom the video, I decided to take Screen Shots and look at the difference of the particles between low graphics to high graphics.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/43S7AhN.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/0jduhNy.jpg[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-26T16:15:54.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lower settings will have less particles - that's intended.
