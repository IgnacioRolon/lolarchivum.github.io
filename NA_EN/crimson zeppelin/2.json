No sustain. but with the trade off being beefy, doing aoe damage and having a MASSIVE cannon as her ult...just like a modern military tank! I used to love playing her, how she was a real threat to enemies. One of my favorite moves was to flank using righteous glory and T-sliding into them and shooting a perfect ult at the enemy team.\n\nNow she just seems like a shadow of her former glory. She lost all the fun she had in her.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-09-01T15:17:54.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to say that to an extent,this post is right, but the old sejuani if i remember, had a lower pick rate, correct me if i'm wrong.\n\nbut they kept the sejuani gameplay theme with the rework, high damage after a combo(15% max health with even more damage.... wooooooooo) and AOE abilities, her ult was changed from multi-target cc to single target-cc, which makes her a good pick with the meta that riot was(not) trying to create.\n\nover-all her rework is a success, but i see what you are arguing.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Zeppelin","date":"2018-09-01T21:58:38.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IulJsf8y,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-01T15:17:54.632+0000)\n>\n> I have to say that to an extent,this post is right, but the old sejuani if i remember, had a lower pick rate, correct me if i&#x27;m wrong.\n> \n> but they kept the sejuani gameplay theme with the rework, high damage after a combo(15% max health with even more damage.... wooooooooo) and AOE abilities, her ult was changed from multi-target cc to single target-cc, which makes her a good pick with the meta that riot was(not) trying to create.\n> \n> over-all her rework is a success, but i see what you are arguing.\n\nTechnically she has not changed. But there is a HUGE shift in the felling you get to play her now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-09-01T15:17:55.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Sejuani was unhealthy for the game.

That is a tad too extreme to compare.\nThat is like bringing pre-rework ap sion to compare.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-09-01T22:09:40.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of them unhealthy all of them got reworked that is all that matters.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
