But aside from the meta, I just simply began to hate playing them since their kits are composites of &quot;How to make your enemies sitting ducks&quot; rather than &quot;strategically ambushing&quot;. It is a faceroll. Thus I currently only play Evelynn since she fullfills what a REAL assassin is in my own eyes - which is to lurk near a unsuspected enemy by foot, and while when you are attacking you are in your most exposed state. It is a trade-off that you can minimize your risks, but when you trade you are paying a risk.\r\n\r\nI know that assassin&#039;s need hypermobility for their kits, but &quot;waiting for a enemy to come close&quot; is now not a thing anymore because of this. Punishing the ASSASSINS positioning when they are exposed (Thus deeming them a BAD assassin) simply doesn&#039;t exist. Another thing I dislike about the current assassin tools is that they have in some form, a way to COMPLETELY render them untargetable when they engage. Thus counterstriking them is IMPOSSIBLE. This compounds the former about exposing a assassin is pointless.\r\n\r\nAssassins don&#039;t outplay. They faceroll the whole GAME that doesn&#039;t have the system to punish them.","replies":[{"poster":"Toppien","date":"2018-07-16T19:55:28.044+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"and yet riot is happy about the changes and the new meta, living in their happy little world of balanced and perfect development","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2018-07-16T19:57:10.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"WAIT WAIT WAIT?\n\nYOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW UNHEALTHY ASSASSINS ARE YET YOU PLAY EVELYNN\n\n\nAHFJKSDHFAJKSDFHASKLČGASHLKASHLĆEČFHLČĆFSAHDFFSAJKEGHZFIOLČASEUFOASEČLF THE AMMOUNT OF BRAINCELLS I LOST\n\n**EVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSINEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSIN\nEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSIN\nEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSINEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSINEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSIN\nEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSINEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSINEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSINEVELYNN IS CURENTLY THE MOST UNHEALTHY ASSASSIN\n**\n\nGetting inevitebly CC-ed because everything she does procs it then dying while you are fking charmed is 10/10 gameplay.

You are diamond. You can spare a few braincells.\n\nShe needs to get up close by foot. You will be warned that she will approach. She is easily spotted pre-6. If her cover is blown she needs to sacrifice a 2 min ult.\n\nAssassins are supposed to make picks. But are NOT supposed to FORCE picks by hypermobility and untargetable stealth skills.
