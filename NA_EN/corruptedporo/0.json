I looked around at the boards and they suggest using yolomouse. Will it get me banned and are there different ways to fix the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"cheekz","date":"2016-08-22T23:24:09.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Riot,\n\nI honestly believe that the cursor should be allowed to be changed in size, and/or adjusted. I personally have always had issues with the size of the cursor simply because it's one of the most difficult things to keep track of in game and playing more than one or two matches despite wanting to play more is near impossible. I do not use 4k and yet I still have issues. I simply have a tough time following where the cursor is. But I have vision problems. I've always had problems seeing the cursor during rapid movements. Personally, I believe that Riot should explore a way to make the change an ease of access change for someone like me that has trouble with vision without making it unfair competitively. This would fix the 4K issue as well, I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T16:31:01.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cursor you use in-game is specifically the gauntlet, so I wouldn't recommend changing that as it could cause a competitive advantage.
