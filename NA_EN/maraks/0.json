I will probably be penalized each login/ exit/ restart/ attempt. And until it's resolved I can't access anything but reconnect to a 2 hour old game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T16:23:23.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still experiencing this issue?  It sounds like your network had trouble connecting to our servers, and our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide can help fix this up.  Unless the game had already ended, in which case the game just needed to communicate to the server that it was over.  There was a patch last night, so it's possible a hiccup like that may have occurred.  Hopefully, everything is okay now!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraks","date":"2016-08-24T15:39:26.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not quite true i can access the chat menu :/ lol","replies":[]}]}
