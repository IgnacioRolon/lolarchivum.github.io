It&#039;s nice for people who honestly do not care what role they get assigned, even if that means 80% support. it&#039;s nice for people who don&#039;t care what their secondary role is.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if fill could get some sort of variant, or if there was a different option entirely, that allowed us to get an even distribution of role assignments. Before team builder, pick order was used to determine priority of role choice. Of course, your role distribution was impacted by people who preferred certain roles (&quot;top pref&quot;), but you ended up getting a much more even distribution of role assignment, which has been lost with the implementation of team builder.\r\n\r\nI would really like to see a feature to allow for this. Maybe have a way for players to queue up with a role selection that ensures they get an even distribution of role assignments over a long period of time?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-13T14:24:30.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it be nice if they just allowed you to fill for you secondary but still pick a primary role choice because currently you have to either pick 2 roles or fill.
