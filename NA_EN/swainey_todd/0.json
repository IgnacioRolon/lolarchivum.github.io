This is absolutely amazing.\n\nMessages like this and knowing that the music could hold such importance to you is truly a huge motivating factor for me each morning I come into work. I try to pour as much love and attention into each theme I have the pleasure of working on. Swain's music, just like everyone prior to it, was a group effort & I had an immense amount of support from all the people on the team. To see that passion translate to a Swain main like yourself makes my day. So Thank YOU for posting!\n\nP.S. Thanks Reav3 & Ed for the shoutout :)","replies":[{"poster":"Swainey Todd","date":"2018-01-30T20:06:23.202+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, shucks.
