Here to make an impact with the ideas I have in mind for a better game, community and overall experience for people in League of Legends. For my first act..\n\nAs a passionate player on the Rift, I truly believe that requiring a minimum honor level to compete on the ladder will significantly improve this game&#039;s climate. Ranked games in general should be held at a higher standard than normals/rotating game modes, especially because a significant amount of the game&#039;s culture is depicted around rank itself. \n\nWhen you make the decision to log on, and try to compete among others to climb through the ranks, the last thing anyone should have to worry about is if their teammates are trolls, inters, ragers, etc etc. I don&#039;t believe this will permanently fix negative experiences, but it will dramatically reduce the frequency of these kinds of encounters. Less dishonorable people to worry about, more focus on game.\n\nThe best comparison I have is a driver&#039;s license. It&#039;s pretty standard, and the purpose of it is to make sure that you&#039;re a safe driver for EVERYONE ELSE on the road, not yourself. Honor should be like a driver&#039;s license for ranked essentially. When you queue up, and you hit champ select, you already know everyone there is at least honorable to an extent because they couldn&#039;t be there unless they were. \n\nI think that&#039;s a pretty good feeling to have nowadays, being able to focus more on games than players.\n\nEven with a driver&#039;s license, accidents happen, and road rage still exists. It&#039;s not to say this is a cover all fix that will cure the community of it&#039;s issues, but if there&#039;s a way to reduce them with something that already exists in the system, such as honor, I say why not. Ranked rewards and other things are already restricted below honor 2. I think by furthering that restriction to ranked queues, where passionate people like myself and others desire a quality game, would be a giant leap in the right direction.\n\nWhat do you think friends?","replies":[{"poster":"BDE MoonpÃ­e","date":"2018-09-24T05:29:18.154+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude this is the best thing I have seen on the boards today.\n\nThis man is the Riot games Genius","replies":[]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2018-09-24T04:26:40.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why? level 0 and 1 honor usually has nothing to do with poor gameplay.

At the moment, there are so many flaws in riots player punishment system. Many of us take rank seriously, we spend hours and hours trying to climb the ladder. Sadly, It only takes one game ( say you're in promo's )were you queue up with a troll player ( for so many reason, maybe tilted from past games who knows...) and he/she deliberately ints, feeds and lose you the game. A passionate player who would start of nicely telling the player to stop might eventually lose their temper and type something bad out of anger/frustration. It only takes few line of bad words to put a once level 5 honored player into  a 10 game chat restriction aka honor level 0. See, the system will only filter what that frustrated player typed, not the troll who ruined the game for his 4 teammates. In summoner rift, if a player wanna fakkk  your gaming experience they could easily do it without any consequence, the key is to type NOTHING! \n\nWith that in mind, i don't think a player deserves to sit out and grind number of normal games before they can level up in honor for a ranked queue. Its harsh and will have so many players furious.\n\nOn the other hand, if riot somehow can mange to review games and punish inters, feeders, trolls etc..i'm all up for what you proposed. \n\nHappy thanksgiving!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-09-24T04:20:49.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When you make the decision to log on, and try to compete among others to climb through the ranks, the last thing anyone should have to worry about is if their teammates are trolls, inters, ragers, etc etc. I don&amp;#039;t believe this will permanently fix negative experiences, but it will dramatically reduce the frequency of these kinds of encounters.

Their game. Who cares about what is solely based on the person. And it was a metaphorical comparison. Not direct.

More games without toxic people.\n\n\n> Please don't bring up that they can still play norms because that is of no relevance to the discussion about ranked because if they are a normals player having a ranked lockout makes no difference to anything but to a ranked player it means everything\n\nNorms are part of the game.
