So, thinking I had a problem with some of league's files, I uninstalled it and tried to download it again really quick. However, I can't downlaod it anymore. Half way trought the setup, it freeze while downloading Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64) or something like that. It says it failed to install one of the assembly. I've been looking up for many solutions and one of them was downloading Microsoft Visual on Microsoft website. It did the same thing, so this is not a solution. I am out of ideas for now so any proposition would be welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"Naked Zedster","date":"2017-05-31T00:47:13.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell me the full solution to fix this problem really have no idea how to fix this so I download the c++ 2005 and then I tried to download the game but it doesn't work it shows the x64 not the x86","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T04:05:23.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.. First, I'd recommend running windows updates to ensure everything is up to date. Next, go ahead and [uninstall all existing versions](http://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/) of *Microsoft Visual C++ 2005*.

After a whole week of trying everything I could, I realised my computer might have more problems than I thought. It's like a vicious circle, an older problem prevent me from finding a solution for a more recent problem. However, I found a solution, I made back-ups of my important files and I will formate my computer again soon. After this, it's supposed to work and if it doesn't... Well I still have another plan, Reimage should be able to repair my stuff since it's scan was successfull, but honestly I don't want to pay for that. Thanks a lot for your help, it's really appreciated!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AuNg PyAe PhYo","date":"2016-11-09T13:10:23.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hay,I'm Austin.I can't update the LOL.I am updating to 100% and it stop at 25% or 28% and show  retry.How can I update.Pls help{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]}]}
