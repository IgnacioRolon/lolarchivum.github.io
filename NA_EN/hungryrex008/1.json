After restarting it still crashes even without playing league when i'm watching Youtube/Twitch.\r\nHowever one morning i decided to have an entire day playing another game (Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn) and it didnt crash once. Not even short crashes or FPS drops.\r\n\r\nI'm running;\r\nA single AMD 480\r\n8GB of RAM\r\na fairly old motherboard and processor (not old enough that it cant handle most games made back in 2013)\r\nI have restarted my PC to factory settings about 2 months ago\r\nI'm using the newest drivers for AMD\r\nMy motherboard bios aren't up to date as i have no idea what model i'm running (Planning on getting a new one)\r\nI run the game at medium settings in windowed mode (however i have tried both windowed and full-screen)\r\nThis mostly started around patch 7.11-7.13 however i had the issue once or twice over the 3 years I've been playing only recently has it become every 2/3 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-14T17:39:21.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you getting a bugsplat, or just outright crashing?

In my case my GPU was getting too hot and my PC was shutting down/restarting to protect itself. in your case it looks like you're running on board graphics, potentially from your CPU. What i discovered in my case was that the fan on my graphics card stopped working. In your case it could be a few things, assuming I've diagnosed your issue correctly: there could be a big build up of dust on hardware, a fan(s) may have stopped working, you need to re-apply thermal paste that connects your CPU to the heatsink attached to it.\n\ndisclaimer: I'm not a professional at this so take everything with a grain of salt. Also, when i opened up my case and touched my GPU to see what was going on i burned my hand pretty bad so please be careful :)","replies":[]}]}
