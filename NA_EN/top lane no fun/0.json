A rework, a re-making of skills (looking at her E specifically). She&#039;s definitely not trash tier, but she definitely lacks depth. Her kit is incredibly feast or famine, she either out damages you (she wins) or you out damage her (you win). Other then that, there&#039;s nothing she does. \n\nSo, any changes in the works? C:\n","replies":[{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-04-07T00:19:59.415+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, her E is so weak. It's existence in her kit is pretty much meaningless now that it doesn't procc mark.\n\nThe AoE damage is pretty vital for her however. It's one of her best sources of spellvamp proccing against large groups, her only waveclear, and helps phenomenally for clearing jungle camps when playing her as a jungler.\n\nIt's just that insta-damage skills are so binary, especially when combined with an insta-gapcloser. So in it's current state it can't have any real meaningful power because it's too easy to hit with.\n\nIt needs to be changed, given some utility and made trickier to use.\n\nI really wanna see it as an empowered auto with an attached front arc AoE (kinda like Vi's E but without the charge system, and wider but shorter arc) or a wide short cone AoE.\n\nmaybe with a slow or a phage-movespeed boost or an energy return mechanic attached.\n\nMake her kit more balanced. Because currently, her Q and R is doing all the work, and then W pulls it's weight when you need it... While her E is just really there to get her even more DPS and waveclear while adding no meaningful play.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-04-07T02:09:40.803+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is, although her E being a small cone effect would be pretty cool and a lot better than what she is, it would still basically be impossible to miss because of her R\n\nI know the whole ''Getting rid of point and click abilities'' routine is getting old in some people's opinions, but Akali really, desperately needs some counter play added to her kit. \n\nShe needs a major rework, not just a change to her E :|","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top Lane No Fun","date":"2015-04-07T00:35:46.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"While I agree that E is meaningless, your spell-vamp on E is only 33% due to being AoE, so you need to hit minimum 4 targets to get the full effect of spell vamp out of it. Yes, it's not 'hard' to get 4 targets hit, but it also doesn't do a lot of damage, so couple minimal damage with 33% spellvamp and you don't get a huge return in terms of spell vamp, her Q and R are what really give her the spell vamp sustain.  \n\nHer E is her only wave clear, but it's quite pathetic at best unless you're insanely ahead. or you're going AD Akali (lol)\n\nIf you're jungling Akali, that's a whole different thing entirely, as she was designed (I think) for being a laner and that's what I'm basing everything off of, I do not consider jungle Akali to be even note worthy. That is just my opinion.  \n\nAnd I've thought about her E being replaced by something similar to an enhanced auto, but that's just another binary mechanic. It basically has 1 use, out put more damage. However, if you change it similar to Vi's E (cone of damage) then you add a little bit of intricacy in the form of positioning. Which again, isn't all that interesting.\n\nThey should really put her passive into her kit more, by this I mean she has twin kamas, make her E switch between kamas (a passive or active on her spells based on which kama she has toggled) or something similar to that. It would add something unique as well as make you decided on which kama is best for which situation, along with removing the point and click nature of her kit and replacing that with a skill shot or 2.\n\nAs for her W, I find it pretty lack luster at best, it's an invisibility ability that's confined to a small bubble, so if you don't see her, she's in her shroud, thus you know her general where-abouts, but I find it especially useless come mid-late game, as vision trinkets cost 250 gold now, so everyone has one by the time team fights roll around. So you're shroud essentially turns into a vision trinket waster instead of actually being useful.

Perhaps there's a super small pool of situations where you could secure a kill or survive a gank because of the removal of the cast time, but that's incredibly small and rare in occurance. So in the end it doesn't really add all that much. The removal of cast time on E along with another buff or a just a change of the skill would do a lot more. As it stands her E does NOT mesh with her kit, it's basically used to clear minion waves (approx 3 uses of it clears a wave) so even then it's sub-par on wave clear, it does mediocre damage at best, is a fairly large energy sink (with pathetic returns)  and offers no utility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2015-04-07T01:15:39.169+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think she's fine.

Playing Akali is depressing sometimes, her autoattack is so messed up and yet is her only way to do some damage. \n\nI'd like to see her reworked into a healthier champion, especially her passive, which is one of those ''here, free stats for you'' passives that I hate so much. \n\nThe problem I see with the nerfs is that they're the wrong kind of nerfs. Instead of trying to balance her o rework her at least a bit they just gutted her feeling and viability, all at once. She's super cluncky to play right now and fails to be at what she's supposed to be half of the time.\n\nIt's so sad to play the champion you started playing League for only to get frustrated half of the games just because said champion feels so bad. Why would Riot remove her E proc on Q? That's the worst they could have done. They have just abandoned her in a dry well to die.

Nerf everything in her kit to find out what's actually OP and then buff what would make her healthy, if they even can. If we're being honest though there has never been a season where Akali was healthy to play against because she's either really OP or a really underwhelming choice with no in between.. \n\nI personally hate Akali because I feel like no matter how much I shut her down, as soon as she buys gunblade she catches up and there is nothing I can do. The \"nerf\" they gave her with Q>E proc was unreasonable because now she has no way to harass or trade in lane, but I didn't expect much since they didn't even give context to the nerf anyways. GGWP, Rito. \n\nShe should be reworked, so +1! Even a tiny rework to one or two skills would be completely nice.. change Q & E around and tweak her ulty charges and I think she'd be well off. \n\nEdit: Not to go off on a tangent, but her \"unique identity\" is how excellent she can stick to targets so I don't want charges completely removed, just more dynamic so it doesn't feel so point'n'click. Maybe an \"Akali can jump to a different target for a couple seconds after she's hoped to her first for increased damage\" so she hops around a bit to throw off the enemy?
