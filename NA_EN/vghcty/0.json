Let me lay it out straight.\n\n\nYou can change your summoner name (in-game display) in the shop for 1350 Riot Points. (Purchasable through \"real-life\" currency) This will change your display name when you're in game. (i.e. \"ghcty has slain SparklyCats\")\n\nHowever you CANNOT change your username. (The username you log into the client with)You can restart an account at level 1 and can level it back to 30, however you cannot use your existing username. There is no way to delete an account all together. Riot did a summoner name sweep a few months ago, however they have not done a username sweep ever. (As to my knowledge)\n\nI hope this helped! Any questions, just respond.","replies":[]}]}
