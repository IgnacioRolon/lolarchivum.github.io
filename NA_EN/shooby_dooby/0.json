I&#039;d say this happens on about 30%-50% of ultimates, tending to happen more towards the beginning of games. It might only occur or occur more often with his level 1 ultimate, but I haven&#039;t seen enough of this bug to be sure. When this bug does occur, it seems to always only affect the first charge. If it makes a difference, I use smart cast. I apologize if this bug has been reported before, but I figured more reports = more notice = faster fix.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-04-23T20:24:47.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Valkyrius, we know about this issue and are working on a fix for it. Thanks for reporting the issue. I know it really sucks to waste the first R as Xerath. It's the most important one since they don't get as much warning! x.^","replies":[{"poster":"Shooby Dooby","date":"2015-04-23T21:40:49.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the timely response!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-04-23T04:06:06.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You the same guy that posted this before?\n\nIts not a bug.

It once would stall until fully expanded... now it just throws your first Q which is very unforgivably. That and this has already been addressed by riot as they claimed to be having someone looking into it.","replies":[{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-04-23T19:52:23.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, guess it is then.
