Not even the lower teir lcs teams wanted golden as a starter but hes replacing jensen who is one of if not the best mid in na? The last few season have been all about comparing jensen and bjerg as the two mid lane titans in na. If i was jensen id just quit pretty much any team would take him and probally sneaky and smoothie too. I dont care about esports teams i liked hai even after he left c9 and i still like meteos and if they move the last core c9 member to academy as well as jensen who ive come to like then it looks like ill be doing something ive never even considered sense season 3 when i started watching lcs- moving on to rooting for tsm or mabye clg or 100t. All c9 has now is a bunch of players that barely deserve the academy team, tsms leftover jungler no one wanted a top laner that for some reason decided picking lucian top against huni of all people was a good idea (and getting cucked royally) and a bot laner that literally had bench keith memes going for over 2 splits. Absolute bs. If theese changes stay permanant im moving on to following other teams. Mabye even just Eu teams like UoL who at least make things intresting or just watching bronze streams like saltyteemo.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMinionLeader","date":"2018-06-14T01:18:02.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh.

Like the origional UoL was always amazing to watch because it was always a fiesta doing things like udyr shaco and tf jung. C9 back when they had hai and the origional line up was more fun to watch imo felt more like a \"family\" team sort of feeling having the same roster. Changing players out all the time every season would make them no diffrent than any other team so nothing special to watch. Its just not the same. Hai leading c9 from relegations to worlds in back to back reverse sweeps and the year c9 beat najin and kabum beating alliance to knock out eu's number 1 seed will always be c9's highest points in my opinion. with all the diffrent players coming in it might still be named c9, but its not the same team anymore. its a completely difrent beast. Espically if they lose sneaky and the boi who \"clapped\" faker.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yxgl222HaX","date":"2018-06-14T00:38:10.296+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZiLess,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=ZFc20vIG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-14T00:34:27.084+0000)\n>\n> Calm down, you don&#x27;t know whats going on behind the scenes.\n> \n> They may have been looking to leave c9 anyways for whatever reason, or they could just be in a major slump atm and this can be motivation.\n> \n> \n> Not everything is black&amp;white so stop looking at it like that you monkey.\n\nAn unintelligent reply like that isnt even worth my time.

If this is what it takes to get results fine, but I don't see how a probable 0-2 start against 2 teams you didn't drop a game to in spring helps you make worlds. All I know is if the roster hasn't swapped back before the TSM game in week 3, this season is over.\n\n\nSide Note: I saw something over on Reddit last night about how Jensen and Blaberfish (C9 Academy Jungler) were duoing a lot so maybe they're thinking of using this as a way to test Blaberfish?
