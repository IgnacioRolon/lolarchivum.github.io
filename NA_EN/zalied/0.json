He did not receive an email explanation and is never toxic and hasnt even received a chat ban before. as riot says &quot;all bans are final&quot; even in their support page there is no way to send a ticket asking for chat logs proof or even a real reason he was banned. Im not saying he doesnt deserve it (he is though) but iv seen chat bans into perma bans before usually you get a 2 week or so many game suspension or limited chat first you dont get perma banned on the first offense unless it is terrible and we never got the email.\r\n\r\nis there a way we can contact riot to get the log or proof im not asking for him to be unbanned we just need to know where to go for more information as riot support doesnt allow tickets","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-09-17T05:06:33.991+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he makes a support ticket asking why he was banned they will send chat logs if logs are relevant to the ban.\n\nJust tell him to submit a ticket selecting the most relevant options and put all the points you described in.\n\nDont submit multiple tickets or bump the ticket as that will send you back to the end of the line.","replies":[{"poster":"Eightba1l","date":"2016-09-17T17:45:47.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't always provide proof.
