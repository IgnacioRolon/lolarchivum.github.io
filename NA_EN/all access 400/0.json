What if I derive equations from the plots? What if I take double derivatives of the equations just like disposition -> velocity -> acceleration learned in physics?\n\nSo, I actually tested the idea with NA & EU LCS playoffs semi-finals took last week.\n\n1. I made scatter plots (time vs. team gold) for each sets of a series.\n2. I drew trendlines (thanks to Excel)  in quadratic equation to get constants as results of double derivatives rather than different functions.\n    Interestingly, the R^2 values are very close to 1.00; the equations and plots are highly correlated.\n3. After deriving the constants(I will call these constants \"gold acceleration\"), I calculated the averages for each teams&#039; performance in semi-finals.\n\nI don&#039;t major in math or stats, so there may be some mathematicians who have better ideas,\nbut I&#039;m pretty confident that these numbers are meaningful in judging teams&#039; performance.\n\nAccording the numbers I got, Fnatic and C9 will win this LCS playoffs. (check the attached files)\n\nLet&#039;s see how it goes next week.\n\nPlease share your thoughts with me.

You may want to incorporate some power/gold ratios at the champion level. A hyper carry with 6 items is a lot different than a tanky support with 6 items. Would be interesting to account for that.\n\nMakes sense to me though. Generally the teams that are earning gold faster are doing more things correctly, working towards winning the game. There's still value here even with the small sample size.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2015-04-14T15:54:08.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Not enough sample data\n2. Each player plays significantly differently with different champions\n3. Gold income is very strongly correlated to which team they are facing\n\nThese all make over 50% of your underlying data meaningless.\n\n~ A financial engineering graduate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ixionas","date":"2015-04-14T15:46:54.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to me that the assumptions of independent observations are violated, so can you say that this data has any significance?","replies":[]}]}
