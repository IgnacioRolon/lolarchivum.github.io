It&#039;s not a game breaking bug, but it is very irritating to the point that I don&#039;t even play the skin anymore because I can&#039;t stand the audio. I have tested it on 3 different computers and it happens on each one, so it is a client bug. Please fix so I can go back to using the skin, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"jjileugi","date":"2015-08-18T17:13:23.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When he throws his axe, a swift noise is associated as he throws it, however that audio does not occur until about .5 seconds later than it should. It's not a noise that Draven makes it's the noise of the axe. It's only with that one Gladiator Draven skin, if you compare it to Soul Reaver or his classic skin, maybe you could hear what I'm hearing a little better. If I knew how to send in a video of it I would because that would make it a lot easier to explain. Sorry if I am confusing you. And also, it has been like this for over a year now so this is a late report on it, but after playing it a while ago and then during one of the season 4 patches was when I realized something had changed about the audio of the skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-18T16:55:31.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Calphen,\n\nThanks for the report! I took a look at him in game, and things appear to be lining up properly for me. Are you referring to the actual axe, or the grunt audio that's associated with it?","replies":[]}]}
