However, in these lore bits, we have a couple of hints to some real names in the game. \r\n\r\n-Urgot, it seems, is his last name, with his full name being Jeremiah James Urgot. This may or may not apply to the canon universe, but it would definitely make sense, since Noxians seem to have both first and last names (ex. Jericho Swain, Katarina and Cassiopeia Du Couteau, and possibly Evaine LeBlanc).\r\n\r\n-It seems that Twisted Fate&#039;s full real name is Tobias Felix. This would fit very well as his full canon name (we already know Tobias is his first from Burning Tides), especially since his High Noon skin is closest to his canon cowboy-esque theme. It&#039;s pretty much a given that most people from the most advanced regions like Bilgewater and Piltover have last names (ex. Malcolm Graves and Sarah Fortune), and Graves, one of the few who knows his real name, always calls him &quot;TF&quot;, so it&#039;s assumed those are his actual initials that he prefers to be known by. &quot;Felix&quot; also means &quot;lucky&quot; in Latin, which, of course, fits right onto TF and his family and clan of professional magic-cheating gamblers. \r\n\r\nP.S. Does anyone know where High Noon Yasuo&#039;s lore is? Whoever posted the rest of this didn&#039;t seem to have access to it, or just didn&#039;t put it in at the time. I&#039;d like to hear the in-universe reasons why Yasuo&#039;s bringing his sword to the gunfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-08-15T00:02:07.683+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo's lore ran into a really awesome (it is not awesome and I hate it) giant office scorpion that we're currently attempting to kill.
