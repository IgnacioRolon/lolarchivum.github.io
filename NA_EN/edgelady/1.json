Two rival champions are given legendary skins in a universe which pits them against one another as opposing godlike figures of order and chaos. While it may seem black and white on surface level, both figures will have their pros and cons. Yasuo and Riven seem to lean toward the &quot;both options are good, in their way&quot; angle, while Garen and Darius seem to lean toward both of them being evil, in their way. The event itself also asks players to pick a side, so that we, the players, &quot;decide&quot; who wins the ultimate conflict in the end, even though those outcomes don&#039;t seem to be canon. Regardless, with the success of the first two Versus events, people seem to be looking forward to the next ones eagerly. \n\nThese are some rivalries that I would love to see get Versus skins, and they&#039;re the ones that I could see being the most likely to have the event in the future.\n\n{{champion:98}} vs {{champion:238}}\n\n{{champion:89}} vs {{champion:131}}\n\n{{champion:10}} vs {{champion:25}} \n\n{{champion:126}} vs {{champion:112}} \n\n{{champion:22}} vs {{champion:113}} \n\n{{champion:23}} vs {{champion:2}}\n\n{{champion:107}} vs {{champion:121}} \n\n{{champion:4}} vs {{champion:104}}\n\n{{champion:59}} vs {{champion:50}} \n\n{{champion:38}} vs {{champion:90}} \n\n{{champion:75}} vs {{champion:58}} \n\nLess cut-and-dry examples: \n\n{{champion:51}} vs {{champion:222}}? The thing is, considering canon, one would have to add {{champion:254}} into the equation, who is sort of a middle ground between the two, more orderly than Jinx but more chaotic than Caitlyn. She also has a closer relationship and rivalry with both Caitlyn and Jinx than they have with each other. \n\n{{champion:516}} vs {{champion:106}}? This would work really well, but it could also possibly be {{champion:34}} vs {{champion:106}}, considering canon. Both her and Ornn are Avarosan in alliance, though Anivia is much more blatantly so. However, Ornn and Volibear have the stronger rivalry, so I would almost certainly predict that they'd cut Anivia from the picture in a Versus event. \n\n{{champion:68}} vs {{champion:17}}? Well, one is Satan and one was friendzoned by Satan. We all know it's the best rivalry in League history. \n\nVersus is an event about contentious rivalries where both sides have an equal point, so more direct hero-and-villain pairs are out, such as {{champion:236}} and {{champion:412}}, {{champion:22}} (or {{champion:113}}) and {{champion:127}}, {{champion:268}} and {{champion:101}}, or even {{champion:21}} and {{champion:41}}. Some of these rivalries are definitely not obvious contenders for the event, such as how both Twisted Fate and Graves are basically good guys and definitely on the same side. Rengar and Kha'Zix are also a bit more of a black-and-white rivalry, even though Kha'Zix isn't so much of a pure evil Void creature, since his and Rengar's motivations are basically their pride in their hunting skills (and they're even on the same overall side in their Mecha skins). \n\nHowever, considering the lore of the skin universe, there&#039;s definitely one Versus pair I&#039;d like the most, and here is why: \n\n{{champion:98}} vs {{champion:238}}. Purely for the potential that their lore could have. We know that God-King Garen is the last descendant of Dawnbringer Riven, and God-King Darius is the last descendant of Nightbringer Yasuo. However, Nightbringer Yasuo and Dawnbringer Riven make constant allusions to having a tragic romantic relationship, given that their existences are both mutual and constantly in conflict. Therefore, we can assume that their descendant deities are from children that they had with each other. Shen and Zed would be the perfect candidates to be those children. Whereas in the lore, they're adopted brothers, here, they would be blood-related brothers, and they would still have a degree of parental angst, but here, it might be for parental favoritism, duty to their roles, and so on. Brothers with opposing godly duties, parent-related resentment, and they're *divine ninjas*? This could have so much potential for drama. \n\nAlso, Yasuo hates ninjas. Maybe he doesn't like either of them. That could be pretty funny. \n\nWell, those are my ideas for the upcoming Versus events. What are yours? Did I miss any rivalries? Any lore ideas for the other ones?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-09-04T23:17:06.900+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to say that I _loved_ how for the length of this year's event, the boards morphed a huge debate over the _nature of good and evil._ Definitely food for thought on any future events.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferr√∏s","date":"2018-09-03T21:28:36.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really really want day vs night {{champion:131}} {{champion:89}}","replies":[{"poster":" Queen Of Yuri","date":"2018-09-05T00:14:04.787+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what if instead of fighting each other they just share their secret love for one another <3","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-09-05T13:06:15.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then we see an eclipse symbolizing how sun and moon became one.\nI like that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-09-03T18:57:42.985+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:202}} VS {{champion:98}} & {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2018-09-03T20:11:09.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4 Step Cadence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=06lWQrdQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-09-03T18:57:42.985+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:202}} VS {{champion:98}} &amp; {{champion:238}}\n\nOh yes, Jhin and Shen and Zed are another three-person scenario, but Jhin isn't exactly a middle ground in their case, more of a common enemy.
