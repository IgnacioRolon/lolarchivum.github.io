What sort of skin do you guys think he&#039;ll get? Although Heimerdinger isn&#039;t the sort of champion who readily fits into many skin lines, here are a few of my own ideas:\r\n\r\nI personally think the most obvious route to go would be Arcade Heimerdinger. His whole blingy science kit would translate so well into an 8-bit theme, as would his status as a certified genius. Plus, it helps that Corki and Ziggs, two fellow machinery-using Yordles, are already in the Arcade universe. \r\n\r\nAnother fitting possibility is Professor Heimerdinger, since he&#039;s basically already a professor. This would go in with the Academy universe, and I think this one would be particularly funny as a legendary skin.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s also the possibility of a Candy Kingdom skin, with turrets shooting candy or something. Heimerdinger would fit very well in the universe&#039;s underlying creepiness as well...\r\n\r\nLastly, there is a Mecha universe skin, since Heimerdinger, Rumble, and Ziggs were the Mecha&#039;s creators (although I doubt the upcoming skin would be for them, since Rumble just got a skin). I imagined that it would be Resistance Heimerdinger, but that name would only work if Riot does finally decide to re-merge the Mecha, Battlecast, and Project universes back together.\r\n\r\nWell, those are my ideas. What about yours? What sort of skin do you think Heimerdinger should get after such a long wait?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-08-24T21:18:12.480+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimerdraven\n\nYou heard it here first","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-08-25T12:30:52.340+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean \"Dravendinger\"?\nBecause Draven never settles for second best.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-08-24T02:44:34.551+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always wanted to see Dragon Trainer Heimer.

That's more subjective than anything.  Skins are meant to bring out an alternate fantasy in a champion anyway, so I'd say having science related ones aren't gonna be better for him as he's already a scientist.","replies":[{"poster":"EuphoricToaster","date":"2018-08-24T23:27:08.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only remotely science-y skins he has are hazmat and alien. Anyway, i agree with you about the point of skins but i play heimer cause hes a goofy scientist (well that and i like his playstyle), and considering how rare it is to get heimer skins id personally like to keep that intact. Heimer already has a lot of abstract/joke skins as is (snowmerdinger, piltover, blast zone, alien). Anyway so long as the skin is well made ill be content with whatever they make, im just not a big fan of the dragon trainer idea. Also find it a bit strange that people who dont even play heimer are talking about what skins they would want when they probably wouldnt even buy it or play heimer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2018-08-24T22:20:46.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another mechanical/sciency skin is not what he needs.
