He had such potential.\r\n\r\nIt was rumoured he would be big and tanky. I was hoping for big and sneaky, since usualy big guys are tanky and its getting boring. A big fat, though very vulnearable, fish would have been cool. I got the impression sneakiness would be his way of survival rather then tankyness, since his trailer was hinting at alluring and seducing (i know yuck!). It also felt like mysticism would be a thing for him. Deception. It was quite awhile since we had such a champ.\r\n\r\nLastly I thougth he would be alot darker with a bunch of gloom. But no, hes just Another one of riots teddybear creations. And it surprises me since the trailer, again, went in a really unusually dark direction at the end\r\n\r\nI Always Think about this. Games like this is getting more and more childish. Is is because the audience is getting younger? Would kids really mind some doom and gloom (other then what they get in the damn shooting games)?\r\n\r\nIt seems its the creators who want it to be cute, but I dont know why. I really like this game but I feel like a friggen carebear %%%%man when I play now adays.","replies":[]}
