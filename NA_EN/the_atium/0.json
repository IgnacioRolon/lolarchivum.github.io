This has occurred for the last month and is causing difficulties playing a game. My internet works perfectly. I am currently playing on a Mac book pro. Both myself and my housemate struggle to log in and he is currently using a lenovo laptop. I imagine that this is a problem with my internet settings however I cannot find information on how to solve the issue.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!\r\nI have followed the connection issues guide however this only applies to the laptop itself. I would appreciate help with how to correct the issue with the internet.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAtium","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-01T18:34:10.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your home network might be having issues and blocks if you're both having these issues.
