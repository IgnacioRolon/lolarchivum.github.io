When modifying your hotkeys, it's possible that you might have unbound or changed a key without realizing it. It's also possible that your hotkeys are conflicting and not doing what you're expecting it to do. Or is the issue occurring when you have all default settings? If it was the first case, I would restore default settings and seeing how it responds.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-29T18:21:59.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Kokua knows what's up!","replies":[]}]}]}
