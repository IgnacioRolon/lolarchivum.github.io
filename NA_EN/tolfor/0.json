Me and the rest of my ranked team just finished (unsuccessfully) our promotion series... to get out of Bronze V. We started very late in the season, don't all have the opportunity to play with one another extremely frequently, and are under no delusions of being \"pro.\" But we try our best, and mostly have a good time of it.\n\nThe first match, we got set up against a team that outplayed us to a pretty staggering degree - particularly their Ryze, who was just untouchable. We were a little frustrated after the loss because of how helpless we felt, but we figured, hey - just gotta win two matches in a row and it's all good!\n\nSo we queued again, banned Ryze just to be safe... and got into the loading screen only to discover that we were up against the very same team a second time.\n\nThis time, they had picked a full initiation tank combo - Cho'Gath, Malphite, Amumu, Blitzcrank, and Shen. They wiped the floor with us. We had counted on a \"traditional\" enemy teamcomp and didn't realize what they were doing fast enough to react to it with any sort of counterpicks. The teamfight phase was abysmal.\n\nThen, once they got into our base, they started toying with us - backing off after acing us, or standing around and spamming emotes, or chasing people onto the spawning pad and dying to the laser. This went on for nearly an hour; none of us wanted to surrender on the off chance that we managed to overtake them after farming up some CS and taking the free kills that they were giving us. Which, in retrospect, was probably just another psychological game on their part.\n\nAfter finally losing the match when they decided that it was time to end it, we looked them up in the client, only to find that:\n\n- They were Bronze IV in 5v5, but Gold in 3v3\n- One of their players was Platinum II in solo queue\n- Another player was in Diamond league\n\nSo, to reiterate and summarize: during our promotion series, we got matched against the same team, *twice,* which was composed of players who **dramatically** outskilled us, and who we stood no realistic chance of defeating.\n\nNot to speak for the rest of my teammates, but the experience has certainly left me pretty frustrated and more than a little demoralized. And what really gets me is that, after some websearching, I found that these guys have a Twitch stream where they basically get their jollies by smurfing ranked and stomping \"noobs\" (AKA me and my teammates).\n\nI don't think that it's too reactive of me to say that this type of behavior is pretty disruptive to the ranked environment. These guys had no business being anywhere near my team on the ranked ladder, and there's an extremely good chance that they deliberately engineered their placement there. We just lost our first promotion series as a team of five because we had to deal with the same team of smurfs in two separate games.\n\nObviously we want to take some lessons away from it and try to keep improving as a team, but I also think it's important to have a discussion about the effect that smurfing has on low-tier ranked play. It might seem hilarious when you're watching wacky teamcomps steamrolling people on a livestream, but the people on the losing team mostly just feel frustrated and helpless. It creates a very negative experience for five other players, and frankly it's just not fair. It's like if Michael Jordan barged onto a high school basketball court, slam dunked the home team into oblivion, and then started laughing at their comparative lack of skill.\n\nSo, Riot, are there currently and plans or discussions about smurfing being tossed around in the office? Is this something that your recognize as an issue, or am I overreacting here? I mostly just want to talk about it right now because I'm bummed out and ticked off, but I really do think that smurfing is a pretty uncool thing to do regardless.","replies":[]}
