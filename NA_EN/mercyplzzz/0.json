Stress levels are higher and people tilt harder. Also you are required to play with whichever players the matchmaking system gives you, there is no \"leaving the party\" as an option because you are punished for doing so. All this combined means that harassment hits a lot harder in this game.\n\nFun fact, tilt is actually the same thing as emotional flooding. It's the same concept as when children can't stop crying even when they forget why they were crying in the first place. The emotions (and stress) course through the person's conscious overtaking all rational thought. **You're right, most rational people wouldn't take you seriously if you told them to kill themselves, but a person who is running purely on emotions is not going to react rationally to anything.** By saying \"kys,\" you directly exacerbate their suffering.\n\nYou might say, \"good, they deserved it.\" But that's not really the point here. It's not your place to enact justice and vengeance for yourself on them for ruining your game. Report them and leave them in Riot's hands.\n\n> Yeah, so that&#x27;s the thing.
