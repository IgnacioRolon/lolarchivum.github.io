Because of this, I will provide some information that should help for both!\n\nFirst, in order to make sure that there aren't any certificate or IE/Safari settings, follow all of the steps in this Knowledge Base Article:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues\n\nIt will walk you through in-depth steps to ensure that your computer is properly configured for League of Legends.  Every step is extremely important, so don't skip over any!\n\nSecondly, if you are still experiencing these errors, it might be due to a larger connection issue where your computer cannot connect to our Servers.  To that end, try all of the steps in this guide:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nThere are quite a bit of steps here, but make sure that you complete all of them so we can rule these out as a possible root cause.\n\nIf everything is returning this same haunting error message that brings you to a boiling rage, don't smash just yet!  Make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our Tech Team!  They can help you investigate this issue much more in-depth, and provide some specific troubleshooting steps.

I can type and describe my problem on submit a ticket page, but when I try to submit my ticket it shows me 'Webpage is not available' Hope you don't mind if i post here. If u need my email to send me the solution could u notify me here?\n\nRecently whenever I open LoL, either 2 of these messages pop out.\n'Unspecified error occurred, please check the logs for more info'\n'did not receive a response from the server (retrying 123) n failed)\n\nI have read many threads on how to solve the problem but still can't solve it. I have tried DNS flush, and used the google DNS 8.8.8.8 and the other numbers but still fail to be able to connect to LoL, I made sure my firewall wasn't affecting. Right now I have Google Chrome and Safari on my computer only, and I am using a MacBook Pro Version 10.9.5\n\nI am currently faced with 2 problems.\n1. After trying so many ways, I made a foolish mistake and tried unistalling and reinstalling LoL. However, when I tried to download the client again and visit the download webpage, it comes up with 'The Webpage is not available'  (Just to clarify I mainly use Google Chrome) even though I can access other websites. I have tried resetting my router but nothing seems to work. So right now, I cannot download the client until I can access the page where I get to download the LoL Client. i read on different threads that others have the same problem as me.\n\n2. I cant connect to LoL, it frustrates me a bit as I cant find a solution and when I went to my friends house yesterday, I was able to access the LoL server and my account when I used his computer, his computer is a Windows.\n\nAnyways hope Riot can fix the problem!

However, were you able to view the Knowledge Base Articles that I linked?  Were you able to complete every single step found in those articles?\n\nIf not, can you try using [this VPN](http://www.hotspotshield.com/) to see if your issue gets resolved?\n\nLastly, if all else continues to fail, can you let me know what ISP you are currently using?","replies":[{"poster":"MeGusta43","date":"2015-01-15T10:33:20.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using the VPN you provided me with, I'm able to at least visit the LoL website and download the client.
