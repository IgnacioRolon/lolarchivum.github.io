We're long distance so I planned on making them when he comes down for Dragon Con... Well now we just happen to cross paths in California on his birthday weekend, so next Saturday we're going to the LCS. I wanted to share my creations and HOPEFULLY he won't see them lol. I also wanted to reach out a bit and see if anyone knew if it was possible for me to bring these things to the actual LCS studio since he's catching a flight right after or if maybe there is anywhere near by that would be cool to have cakes and drinks... I worked really hard, so being able to share this with him, on his birthday at LCS would be so awesome!\r\n\r\n[Pics here!](http://imgur.com/a/kseLy)\r\n{{champion:115}} is his favorite Champion, thus the theme!\r\nI'm also thinking of making {{champion:201}}  Mustache candy pops filled with either caramel or peanut butter, but  already have the mold so we'll see...","replies":[{"poster":"rarax3","date":"2014-07-14T22:33:23.361+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see a problem with bringing edible {{champion:115}} bombs to the studio or any other outside food for that matter.
