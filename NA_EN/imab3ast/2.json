I believe with tenacity you can reduce the duration of sleep but after you wake up, you can still take bonus damage.

She's TECHNICALLY an immobile mage (i.e. not ahri lul) so once she gets dove, AS DO EVERY IMMOBILE MAGE, she will get bursted. \n\nThe problem is that she doesnt LET you get on her. Thats what mage mains try to avoid.\n\nTherefore, your arguement only JUST holds up\n\nplease, think deeper on this argument. Not saying that you were wrong for not knowing that, and i want you to look into the argument logically instead of opinionated-ly, but that's the standard of mages who dont have escapes in their kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-03T10:00:46.242+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"The difference is she gets more risk/reward.\n\nLux and Xerath are more flexible and can play safer.

While asleep, if you take any damage you will take bonus true damage up to the cap. Sleep is not an ability, it is a new type of CC Riot is implementing (like {{champion:69}} and {{champion:27}} Grounded, or {{champion:516}} Brittle).
