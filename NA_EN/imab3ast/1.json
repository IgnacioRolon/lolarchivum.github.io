The particles are different from base, but only slightly. You've got a white ultimate instead of a yellow one. Compare that with Project Ashe, where every particle looks completely retouched.\n\nEzreal himself needs a visual update as well, and has needed one for a few years now (his walk cycle belongs in a museum), but Iron Stylus specifically stated that Ezreal is being held back because of Pulsefire Ezreal. The skin is old enough and jerry-rigged enough that changes to Base Ezreal's model or animations will almost certainly break it. His kit is mostly fine (you could argue the W needs a new direction), so he's not likely to get a VGU anytime soon, which makes it seem like he's going to be ignored for a few more years because of an overpriced skin...","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBot666","date":"2016-08-10T23:14:18.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your argument makes sense, but it has to be wrong because his ult is blue and now white.\n\nAlthough in all seriousness I agree some skins seem a bit lackluster when compared to other skins of comparable price.

That said, when pulsefire ezreal came out I looked at the skin, looked at the price, and thought that it was worth the cost.  If riot releases better skins or cheaper skins or whatever, I'm not entitled to any sort of compensation or an update on the product because I paid for it at the price it was 4 years ago.

Upgrading that skin to the standards set by new Ultimate skins would take the same amount of time as making a _new_ Ultimate skin. It would have to be completely redone from the ground up to fulfill those standards and that's just not something that's going to happen when they're not going to make a good enough profit off of it.
