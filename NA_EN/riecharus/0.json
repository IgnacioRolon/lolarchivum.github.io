I looked up what peoples solutions to these problems were and I all I could see back from riot support was that the problem was on their 'to-do list' over 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nHave any of you guys found your own personal work around for this problem? It took a lot of humming and hawing to get my friend to play league and i'd hate for this journey to but short by such a trivial but impactful problem as playing on a tv.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T22:38:22.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it a 4K?  It's not totally supported yet, so you can run into issues on that or beyond 1080.  Manually adjusting your tv settings could help, or swapping to another screen.  You can also adjust UI scaling while in a game to make the hub bigger, but it may not do too much for text.  I know you want to get your friend to play with you, so I'm really hoping that can help in the meantime.","replies":[]}]}
