Riot knows this, they are planning on changing her, they are already attempting different things on PBE. But I want to discuss my take on her considering the recent changes.\r\n\r\nThey had modified her W from the current 5.6 W (cooldown reduction on spell hits) to a version which had both of the passives (stacking passive movement speed AND cooldown reduction on spell hits) which of course is fantastic. The passive stacking movement speed honestly is extremely important and I believe is necessary for her kit. But I would rather NOT have the cooldown reduction on spell hits at all, because I believe that it is an unnecessary addition to her kit which just takes from her power budget without giving her any real relevant returns, and I believe it will just be overall just be hindering her being buffed in another way which would be more beneficial. \r\n\r\nIt would be much better to have something else in her kit. There are many things that could be helpful, obviously some of the things that have been asked for such as a minimum damage on her ult, or something like that. I think that would be fantastic, but there are many ways to improve her aside from straight numbers. Some ideas:\r\n\r\n1) As stated above, minimum damage on her ult. The balance team is split on wanting this, so yeah. But it&#039;s always something that would be nice. \r\n\r\n2) Minimum damage on her ult AGAINST MONSTERS AND MINIONS. Or maybe even max % health against them. At least then, it can be used as an execution vs. Dragon/Baron, for amazing steals and plays on objectives like that. \r\n\r\n3) Her ult will give her at least 2 stacks of shield, even if she only hits one target. This would help her assassination (her identity), without just increasing her damage. Treat it like Karthus Q but instead of double damage, just get a shield as if you hit two people with it. Or maybe treat towers that are in the AOE of her ult as champions and grant her a bonus shield. \r\n\r\n4) An execution mechanic on her Q for minions. Currently it is very frustrating when you Q and it leaves a minion with like 3 health. It would be really helpful if it were to be able to execute the minions that are very low on health (maybe only if they are less than 5% health or something) Currently it costs a huge amount of mana to try and push fast without missing any in some situations because you have to intentionally aim your Q to miss some targets that are low but not low enough to be killed by the Q, without walking all the way over to auto it. Would just be a nice addition.\r\n\r\nThere are many ideas on what can be used, but honestly I feel that the W getting its cooldown reduced by spell hits is an unnecessary use of power budget, and it would be MUCH better for her to keep her passive movement speed stacking and just work from there.","replies":[{"poster":"Skyfox0","date":"2015-04-01T19:06:18.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"My friend plays Eve a lot and he has been having a LOT of success rushing Luden's Echo on her.
