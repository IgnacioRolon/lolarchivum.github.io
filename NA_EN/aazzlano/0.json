Even if you proc the reduction multiple times and have some CDR, how often are you really reactivating that ability in a single fight? So many fights are just *over* in the 6-10s (minimally) that it's going to take. The old ability gave you a movement speed bonus right away that had a chance to impact the fight right away; the new ability at best will probably just help with cleaning up a won fight or getting away from a lost fight (which isn't nothing, but isn't the same thing as actually helping you win the fight).\n\nTo be honest, I think this is a similar problem that happened with the Kassadin nerfs. They nerfed the ability but decreased the mana/cooldown to compensate. But, the most critical moments of an engage are usually the first few seconds, i.e. the first activation of the ability.\n\nThe only good news (I hope) is that they seemingly intended these changes as a buff so if Evelynn indeed performs worse they'll probably give her more love in the somewhat near future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-03-27T02:42:45.401+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't understand why an ability that resets on kills ALSO needs another method of reducing the cooldown.

How does the change help with chasing compared to her previous passive? \n\nThis is a bad change, I haven't even tried her with this nerf and I know its garbage. How? Because gaining movespeed on spell casts was/is a much better mechanic than reducing the cooldown on this ability (especially since it already resets on kills/assists). It gave you more freedom to choose to weave/run around the target or run away, it also made it so you didn't have to hit W every time it was off cooldown to go fast, you saved it to get away/chase **faster**(if you needed it) or, more importantly, to remove slows. Now you are using it as your only chase and escape option on top of what it already does. Its harder now to decide if you want to save it, because you *have* to use it to chase and escape.\n\n\nAnyway, I really want this reverted.\n\nEdit: Or leave it, but add it so AAs give the stacking movespeed.

The calculation is difficult but here is the result:\n\nWith 0% CDR you need 7 seconds. (8 seconds without using R)\nWith 10% CDR you need 5.5 seconds.

I mean, the ability to break CC is rare in this game while the ability to gain speed is common.  Furor, Trinity Force, MoveSpeed Quints, Luden's Echo, Iceborne Gauntlet, etc.  Theoretically, the ability to break CC more frequently would give her more potential overall because she can find extra movement speed so many other ways.  \n\nAssuming  you are able to get 40% CDR (which is entirely possible and easy to get by your 2nd or 3rd item) your Dark Frenzy is going to be on a 9s CD, 3s of uptime makes 6s of downtime.

Not many champions have the ability to break CC and I bet if you could accommodate your builds to meet the new change, you might find it works out.

Additionally, if their main ability is a 500 range projectile on such a short CD it better fly out of there FAST and it ought to be a skill-shot instead of some random attack move mechanic.

I think it was the second iteration of Malice and Spite?\n \nThen maybe she can be an auto-attack based AD assassin again. \nI really miss playing her in Season 1, using ult to dive towers, getting the reset and a chunk of HP back on kill, then racing on out of the tower again. I dunno... maybe that's a stupid wish. That ult was basically broken down into her W and E anyway. I'd just like to recapture how she felt back then.\n \nWhy is it that in the 4 seasons I've been playing League, the vast majority of that time one of my favourites is considered 'weak'. Why is that allowed. Hell, people used to pick Eve just to make someone dodge in champion select for the longest while. I had to talk people into trusting me when I wanted to play her. We have the terms \"Eve tier\" and \"Eve-d\" when talking about something drastically weaker or over-nerfed than everything else.\n \nBah. Whatever.

When you think assassin you think Zed, Leblanc, Talon, Akali, pre-nerf Kha'zix, people that delete squishy champions in 1-3 seconds and don't really need to \"stick\" that hard. Her original kit and pre-DGF nerf rework let you do her job and assassinate select targets and GTFO like a good assassin should. Now shes like \"hi, im ganking you with minimal damage that I had to use my W just to pull off\".

They don't buff her, what they only do are changes to her kit.

This is sad, i also thought the changes to her W would help her.\n\nBut the only real buff she received was to her shadow walk.  The other ones simply aren't buffs, they are changes - maybe nerfs.
