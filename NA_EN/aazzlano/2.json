And then on top of that it gives free attack speed which lasts longer than the cooldown. \r\n\r\nAlso this mastery scales incredibly well into the late game again ESPECIALLY on trynd and yasuo but also on ADCs so its not like its just an early game lane sustain thing, it just scales even harder late making them incredibly difficult to kill and increasing their DPS by a lot. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s bad enough with the AP item nerfs (especially to Zhonya, which could be used to counter these AD champs) and the increased crit from items but they have to add this now? Like really. Way over the top. This mastery is WAY too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-11-09T18:49:43.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2015-11-09T18:52:56.458+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=H3rCarry,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOsgtMRq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-09T18:49:43.434+0000)\n>\n> Your forgetting {{champion:22}} .

Attack Speed makes the 15% lifesteal from the mastery become increasingly inefficient, as more attacks mean that less of them get the bonus. You're much better off building any lifesteal item than relying on the mastery.\n\nAlso, mid is when it's arguably the strongest since attack speeds are lower, but then so are crit chances. Really, only Tryn and Yas can make full use of it, though more so at different points in the game. The mastery is fine, but the two aforementioned outliers might present an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-11-09T20:54:12.151+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not just he LS, its the 4s 20% increase in Attack speed that you can consistently have up.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-09T21:48:33.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a good point and I kind of forget about that particular effect on the mastery.
