Flexibility is what makes a great player great, and it also helps a good player understand how each role functions and how best to counter each role at various stages of the game. If you don't have the champ pool and role knowledge that would make getting filled into any role a simple thing, maybe you need to reevaluate your own skills.\n Also, it is *incredibly* easy to get a few champs for roles you don't play. A few good games and your first win bonus will get you Annie, Ashe, Soraka, or Garen (if you don't have him for free), and within a few days you can have all of them. All of these champions are quite viable, and if they're not, a good player can at least make the best of it if it comes down to it. You make it sound like getting champions is this long drawn out chore, and it is if you want nothing but 6300 champs. As it is, there are a vast many good champions at the lower ends, so your argument about having to blow real money or grind IP falls really flat on its face when you have champs like Garen and Annie dominating in certain areas of the game. \n\nIt all boils down to this - would you rather sit in queue for 30 minutes waiting for your ZOMGIMAINZED role, or would you rather wait at most 10 minutes and actually play the game? For me, I value my time, and games are a way to escape. Being in the game is escaping. Waiting waiting waiting is not.

You don't need to have a broad champion pool to be good, in fact, you can perform better with a select few champions or in a single role or a single position. That's why pros play a single position and rarely deviate from it. You perform at your best on your best position/role. Why do I deserve to lose because someone can't play a role they got autofilled to? Or that they cannot perform at Diamond level? \n\nFor example, if I got ADC, my team would be at a huge disadvantage. I am terrible at ADC. With that said, I am still far better at ADC than most players ever will be, by the simple virtue of being a better player, but I am not able to consistently carry in the role and will perform subpar FOR MY RANKING on that role. It's not that I cannot play the role, it's just that I am not at the level a Diamond adc would be at. Like if I played on a smurf and only played adc, it would take me a lot longer to climb than it would on my main roles. I would still easily stomp bot lane until mid-high plat, but is that what my Diamond team wants, a mid-Plat adc? No.\n\nAnd yes I would rather wait 30 minutes for my role than get a random ass role. Apparently there will be a notice that the autofill is active, and I will NOT queue during this time. Not only because of the risk of getting some random role, but the risk of some random getting a role they don't play or are not specced for.

If say, you selected top and mid lane as your primary and secondary, And a notification, that says you may get a different role because Q times exceed 10 minutes, what actually guarantied? The 10 minute wait time, cause if you get deferred you get a role that will be more in demand, and if you don't it means your position is available within 10 minutes. \n\nBut why is this important? Because if more people line up for top/mid lane than there are games found. That line will continue to get longer, which would drive the wait times even higher. The only way to bring the wait times down would be to decrease the length of the line, or increase the speed in which people are served. and This actually does both, since it quarenties a maximum length to the line, while filling in the in demand roles, thus increasing the speed they are serviced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2016-06-01T00:47:15.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It is entirely your fault and you deserve to get flamed and lose if you don't have champs for other roles.\n\nRegardless of how Dynamic que works, there is NO EXCUSE for anyone that plays this game to not at least have a champ or 2 for each role.
