Now it seems I have to say farewell to Mid Kog.\n\nThe nerfs to AP Kog are going to hurt so badly. \nMana increase on R by 10\nAP ratio decreased by 0.05\nVision granted decreased by 2 seconds\nMana debuff duration increased by 4 seconds to 10 seconds (this by itself kills AP Kog)\nNo longer deals 100% increased base damage to champions \n\nNow his R is pretty much solely for Execution purposes. \n\nThis means that the identity of AP Kog (a poke heavy champion who uses primarily R to poke at enemies from a distance) is completely destroyed. While Kog R may be stronger if the enemy is low on HP, remember that AP Kog is a POKE champion. Your job is to get people low on HP with your long range spells, not to execute them. \n\nWhile the W is most likely an overall buff to AP Kog and builds with Nashor&#039;s Tooth may become more standard, I don&#039;t see how the negatives of completely gutting AP Kog&#039;s main spell outweigh the positives of giving Kog more damage through auto attacks that require you to be somewhat close to the enemies. AP Kog is a MAGE. \n\nI may need to get a name change after these Kog changes go through.","replies":[]}
