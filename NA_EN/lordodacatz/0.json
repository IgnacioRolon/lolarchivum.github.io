I don't have one yet, but they look nice and Microsoft's E3 really stuffed the idea of needing one in my face.  :x  4K isn't fully supported with League just yet, though.  Using a 4K or resolution exceeding 1920x1080 can result in issues like this.  Your best bet here would be to reduce your resolution in-game as well as your monitor to get a better display.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"LordODaCatz","date":"2017-06-15T00:25:18.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the fix, changing the resolution of the game to 1920x1080 fixed most of it, however my cursor is still much smaller than it should be. Is there anyway to change the cursor size in game?","replies":[]}]}]}
