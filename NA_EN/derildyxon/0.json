I would really like a fix because League is unplayable with these ping spikes. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-22T15:31:43.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random lag spikes like this can usually be due to packet loss or  a connection issue with your network trying to reach our server.  I recommend running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) which can find out what's going wrong and get you squared away with a series of solutions.  Let me know how that goes or if you run into any problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Lightsity","date":"2016-07-23T07:22:41.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a game prior to this message. It was the game to decide series and I was doing fairly well. The reason i'm quite angry as of now is because suddenly on the most important moment to defend I have a massive lag attack. I used the logs and no errors returned. This has been happening since patch 6.9, and now it's cost me a very important game. I can very well understand if I constantly had this problem in other applications, but its only league. I've always been told that its my fault when it comes to dealing with this game. So since its probably my fault somehow what shall I do from here.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T15:05:44.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate you running the log reader, and it's a bummer that the issue is still happening.  If this is only happening with League then there could be other issues at hand, such as your ISP's routing taking a long way to reach our servers.  When you have some time, run a [traceroute ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)which will get an overview of your routing, and attach it to a[ player support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our tech team will be able to help out as we dig deeper into this.
