Also i kinda feel like the mouse being yellow is kind of an issue because with all of the effects that are going off in a team fight, it has been a very difficult task for me to simply keep track of my mouse on-screen (i play with all settings at max, which means all effects are really prominent, and most of the effects in game are yellow for the most-part). another reason this came to mind is because the ping mouse (when you press &#039;G&#039; in-game, recently got a visual update so it stands out even more that the normal mouse doesn&#039;t have an update. \r\n\r\n(tl:dr)\r\nSo basically all i&#039;m asking for is to be able to change the size of the mouse, freely change the colour, and for the mouse to get a well-deserved visual update.","replies":[{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2017-06-13T14:46:41.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I notice sometimes as well. I look at it and just think \"Why exactly is my cursor a chainmail gauntlet?\" I know it's a classic thing but it could probably be upgraded to something a bit more league specific.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-06-14T17:08:20.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be cool if the champion you picked changed the cursor.  If they wanted to space out the work they could give it to us in a similar way to ward skins.  Wouldn't mind seeing a cursor skin in a hextech chest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holloaway","date":"2017-06-14T11:46:32.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they are working on it.

I **love the current cursor**. Its the one of the only things that hasn't been completely revamped. It works and its fitting. When I see it, I think \"Thats the League cursor.\"","replies":[]}]}
