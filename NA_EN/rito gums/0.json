Unfortunately, I need a bit more information.  When you say that you can't join the game, what kind of issue do you experience exactly?  Do you get an error message?  What does it say specifically?  \n\nAdditionally, your ping issue might be unrelated.  What is the ping you normally receive versus the ping you are currently getting?\n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Gums","date":"2016-06-14T11:10:55.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem just fixed itself, but i am afraid it might happen again idk what to do, maybe i should download vpn","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-14T20:41:06.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that the issue seems to have fixed itself after a bit of time, it sounds like there may have been an issue with your ISP, or the route that your connection was taking to our Game Servers.  It's hard to say whether this issue will happen again, but if it does, you may want to try using a VPN to see if it helps!  Keep in mind though, VPN's are inherently unstable, so it may cause some other issues as well!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rito Gums","date":"2016-06-14T08:28:19.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, there are no error messages its just I can't move in game and the others just jump around, awhile the game keeps saying reconnecting, also my connection was working that time and there were no downloads, I also reconnected to the game couple times hoping it would fix itself but sadly it didnt :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Gums","date":"2016-06-14T08:27:04.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regular ping is 180 , during lag it jumps to 300-500","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ToxiC9 ShaDo0ws","date":"2016-06-14T01:28:42.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got the same problem .. first the ping is normal for me at 190-220  (i live in Middle-East ) at loading screen and on NA server ip address  then when the game starts it rises to 300~600 and dc from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"TicklesTheBrave","date":"2016-06-14T02:04:02.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your in the middle east, and connecting to NA servers? your jumping over the Atlantic ocean.
