His very first sentence was threat to report xin for obviously failed gank. it was never against rules to fail gank, its not reportable offense and OP obviously started with threats just to be toxic.  Then he lost lane and blamed Xin, then he blamed Xin again and threatened with reports for not ganking (which again is not reportable). Then he kept threatening and Xin obviously warned him that he is being toxic. OP is just one of those players who cant accept fact that he was beaten on lane due to his own incompetence and in order to feel better about himself he decided to abuse his jungler. He got punished for it and it was deserved","replies":[{"poster":"Zozzi","date":"2017-06-21T13:49:56.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"League is one of those games that is just unbelievably soft.
