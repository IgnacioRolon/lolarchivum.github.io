When a teammate comes to your lane multiple times especially the jungler who hasn't helped me once this game but take my kills. Then jungler proceeds to say sht like why are you not winning lane or why are you feeding or stop being sht at league just uninstall. \r\n\r\nI have no idea how to deal with this kind of stuff and it is just so extremely tilting. How should I deal with this kind of situation and are there any ways to prevent me from getting tilted in this situation or in any situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-12-19T02:04:10.383+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realize you probably aren't going to see these players again. Realize these types of players are more likely to be on the enemy team than on your own. If you are getting frustrated and tilted yourself, take a break. Realize it's a game and if you aren't enjoying yourself anymore, perhaps it's time to find another game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-19T06:03:37.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kill stealing is a misconception in League.\n\nEveryone else says the right things, but I came to emphasize this. Frankly, \"KS\" and \"Kill steal\" should be added to the bot's list of trigger words.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2019-12-19T04:24:16.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why get tilted?

Thats how you carry them , just dont tilt them even more and try to give them gold with your lead \n(btw im still new with ryze i have around 7 games with him \nwhen this was recorded so i still habe no idea how to do his combos, im sorry for that if it triggers you lol ) ..

The goal is to win the game, not earn the flashiest KDA. By your jungler securing the kill and you getting an assist, your team is now worth more gold than it would've been if you'd taken the kill and no one got an assist. You also have an opportunity to push in the lane, pull a cs lead, and reset, giving yourself an item and xp advantage over your lane opponent. Rather than getting upset, shrug it off and make use of the advantage you just got. \n\nAs for the tilting comments, your jungler is being pretty dumb by trying to tilt his own teammate. He'd climb faster if he instead tried to encourage you and be supportive. Still, you have no control over his actions. You're better off muting him and moving on. People like him aren't worth the time it takes to get upset. \n\nCheers.","replies":[]}]}
