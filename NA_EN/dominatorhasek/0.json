Most changes in latency are caused by routing changes at an ISP for specific traffic to that server or service. Sometimes local settings can influence your latency as well, so going through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) isn't a bad starting point in troubleshooting this issue.\n\nLet me know if this guide helps you with your connection.","replies":[{"poster":"DominatorHasek","date":"2016-07-26T02:30:09.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so i did work tech support for a year for my ISP so i know enough to do things, but I also know enough to be aware I really have no idea what I'm doing, if that makes sense. \n\nWith that said...\n\nI'm using a wired connection\n\nfirewall is Microsoft Security Essentials, added an exception or whatever for League of Legends\n\nPublic DNS didn't change anything so i reverted to automatic\n\nhttp://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/ wouldn't work in chrome, did it in Firefox, has me lost though.

I've had a ridiculous spike in ping both on my account and my boyfriends. We've tried EVERYRHING.
