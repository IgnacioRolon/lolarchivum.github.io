Never occurs to you to stop doing the act that creates stress? Fucking A man. Just take a break for fucks sake. Youre not forced to endure league of legends lol. Its supposed to be fun, and to me it is, so it really sounds like a personal problem you have with anger and consequences of actions. You do the same thing over and over as stress builds and builds, and then you blame the game for the rage when your stress builds too much. Youre defining literal insanity man.
