Here's the link to the [**actual post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/2o61aM5L-evelynns-kit-speculation-thread).\n\n\nSo here&#039;s my take on Evelynn&#039;s kit. (Sorry for any and all mistakes.)\n\nWhen we look closely at the vid (you&#039;re better off at x0.25 speed) we can see a few elements relating her kit\n\n**Charm:**\n\n* we don&#039;t yet know what triggers it but it seems like the &quot;Heart&quot; mark always appeared before the fight even started (you can see that Lucian had been marked before he was hit by Evelynn&#039;s **&quot;throw a pink spike thingy&quot;** move),\n\n* we can see that if the mark completes, target gets charmed and has it&#039;s MR reduced (breaking blue shield animation),\n\n* it also seems like this **Stab** (the stab with her tail followed by a flip in fight with Lucian) breaks the charm channel,\n\n* we also see that her **Hate Spikes** (or however it will be called, the thing that looks like her old Q) do not break charm channel.\n\nSo that&#039;s what we&#039;ve got about the charm. \n\nI speculate that it will trigger off of something or when enemy champion sees Evelynn, not work as an ability cast. I think that because of the sheer amount of mechanics in her kit. If charm was an ability it would be hard to fit everything in her Q,W,E,R.\n\nThe other option is that it would act like Valeera in HotS where you have a different kit when in shadowy form but that&#039;s less likely because it would put too much complexity, without much needed depth, into her kit.\n\nI also think that the **Stab** will work something like this: _&quot;Your first basic attack against the target marked for charm will do bonus magic damage but will break the charm channel.&quot;_\n\nWe also can say for sure that completing the charm channel will charm (no way!) the target and reduce it&#039;s Magic Resistance\n\nAnother observation from Lucian fight is that the **Stab** consumes a single **&quot;throw a pink spike thingy&quot;** mark\n\n\n**&quot;throw a pink spike thingy&quot;:**\n\n* it looks like it&#039;s a skill-shot,\n \n* it applies 3 **&quot;throw a pink spike thingy&quot;** marks to the champion hit,\n\n* the marks are consumed on **Hate Spikes** and **Stab** but not on basic attacks.\n\nThe **&quot;throw a pink spike thingy&quot;** move is a skill-shot that applies 3 marks if it hits an enemy. I assume that marks are consumed on ability hits as we can see that they were consumed 1 per **Hate Spikes** use against Yasuo and weren&#039;t consumed on a basic attack against him.\n\nWhen fighting with Lucian, we can see that the **Stab** also consumed a single mark. It would work against my theory that the **Stab** is a basic attack with bonus damage but we know that some abilities that make your basic attack do bonus magic damage apply effects that should be applied on ability hit (for example Rylai&#039;s ).\n\nWe can only guess what effect is related to consuming a mark but it&#039;s unlikely that it&#039;s anything but bonus damage or reducing cooldowns.\n\n\n**Evelynn&#039;s Stealth**\nWe can see 2 versions of Evelynn&#039;s stealth in the video\n\n1. Shadowy look: there are two moments in the video where we can see Evelynn in her human form but when she&#039;s not bright pink and white. She look&#039;s greyish but we can say that it isn&#039;t **Stealth** because we see a grey/blue cloud appearing right behind Eve when she activates her **True Form**. The grey/blue cloud always appears when a champion is coming into **Stealth**, not out of it which would mean that her shadowy look is not a true **Invisibility**.\n\n2. True Form: we can see Eve transform into her demonic form in the video when she is running down the river. It looks like she&#039;s coming into **Stealth** and gains bonus Movement Speed. Yeah. That&#039;s all we can see.\n\n**Glowing hands**:\n\n* at the start of fights with Lucian and Yasuo we can see that Evelynn&#039;s hand are glowing. Glowing hands in league always mean some bonus to basic attacks whether it be Lich Bane, Energized attack or Ardent Censer, etc.\n\n* if you look closely, you can see that during both fights the glow doesn&#039;t disappear after the first attack,\n\n* we never see what activates the glow.\n\nAs we know glowing hands always mean some improvement to basic attacks. We don&#039;t know what effect does this particular glow visualize but we can point out a few things. We can see that it doesn&#039;t apply any slows or other CC.\n\nIt also doesn&#039;t disappear after the first attack. We can assume that it&#039;s some basic attack steroid (maybe Attack Speed) that she gains for a few seconds.\n\nThe only thing that we cannot see in the video is Evelynn engaging her target so my guess is that she gains this attack bonus after dropping out of **Stealth**.\n\n**Goodbye Counter-play**\n\n* we can see Eve performing a slash attack in front of her dealing it looks like A LOT of damage,\n \n* she can then teleport to a shadowy mark that appeared during the cast,\n\n* the mark always appears a fixed distance away from Evelynn, directly opposite to the direction of slash.\n\nI think we can safely say that it&#039;s her new ultimate. It looks sick. It is shown a million times during the video. It kills stuff.\n\nI don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything more to say about this ability. You slash and then you can choose to blink a fixed distance behind you (at the moment of casting this ability).\n\n\nSo if I were to guess her ability layout it would be:\n\n**P - Charm + Shadowy form\nQ - Hate spikes\nW - True form\nE - Spike throw\nR - Shadow slash**\n\nPlease comment, any feedback and your ideas would be much appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2017-09-24T16:28:34.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm excited for her mechanical update, but apparently she's now full-on demon as opposed to an assassin with demonic elements.\n\nI don't like that.","replies":[{"poster":"MrKiller2 PL","date":"2017-09-24T20:20:23.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering how outdated she is we could expect some big shifts in her lore, I didn't expect her to turn out as a demon, though.\n\nI think that, although it's the easy way, it's the right way to explain why she's killing","replies":[{"poster":"Grimm Howl","date":"2017-09-24T23:46:12.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reav3 has also confirmed that in Vayne's new lore, it was Eve who was the demon that killed her parents.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2017-09-26T02:28:03.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the one hand I'm excited for Eve since she's one of many champs I dare not play since I don't find their current kit/playstyle/looks/etc. enjoyable, but with the last few updates like Urgot and Yorick I've picked them up and really have fun with them now. Riot's full VGU I feel are the best that they offer to the game so far.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm somewhat concerned that maybe this streak Riot has of reworking champs that I actually want and like to play now will end or Eve won't exactly be what I hoped her to be, or just whatever else.\n\nI'm still excited to see what's in store, but I don't get my hopes up as much anymore, for updates or new champs.","replies":[{"poster":"MrKiller2 PL","date":"2017-09-26T06:30:42.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Evelynn is kind of a tricky one. She hasn't been touched in years and it can be hard for her to live up to the expectations (especially that it's hard to figure out what we want her to be except \"permastealth assassin\")\n\n I hope that Evelynn rework will make her exciting (and possible to play against), not at the cost of her getting the Ryze treatment, though. \n\nHope she will turn out great after this rework as I enjoyed playing her but her kit was too unhealthy to make her strong and competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2017-09-26T17:26:09.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mmmmhh I don't think she will get anything like the Ryze treatment, not even close. The thing with Ryze is he's almost always kept the same: his Q is just now a skillshot than point n' click + random rune power now, W is almost identical, & E just requires more setup to bounce and proc damage. \n\nThe only thing I ever feel really changes is his ult which is either a stat boost or now team utility, which on a mage like Ryze, at least to me, feels out of place, and his passive which before was casting spells lowers CD, gain power through constant spell stacking, and now it's just gain power= more mana. I feel like Riot is still trying to keep him too much of the same and thats the flaw of why he can't work.\n\nEve on the other hand when I look at her has far more potential to improve. Right now her only notable abilities to her character are stealth out of no where and her hate spikes. Everything else I feel can go out the window for something new if they're trying to make her more of an assassin, which she really is suppose to be.\n\nAnd from the looks of things so far (since PBE update isn't shown yet on 20) it feels that way. She still has some form of stealth, she has hate spikes but lookes like tied in with a charm or something, and a possibly terrifying ult. She feels more along the lines of say Urgot or Sion for keeping iconic abilities but actually adding more new things. Ryze is just try to keep the exact fucking same but switch to a new passive and ult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-09-24T15:01:27.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"still not going to buy her.","replies":[{"poster":"MrKiller2 PL","date":"2017-09-24T20:22:29.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_\"You can still count on me.
