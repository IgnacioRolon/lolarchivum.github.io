By continuing the argument, your opponent has two options, back down, or escalate. This is the internet. He's going to escalate.

When people even remotely start to cause problems, you get out of the situation or shut it down, it's as simple as that. \n\nIn the game, you can mute them and still communicate through pings, and then ALL conflict will be avoided. After the match, you report them and they will eventually get punished if they continue in their ways.\n\nSaying things that you *know* are specifically prohibited by an automated system, regardless of how the words are used, is just opening yourself up to trouble. I'm sure you've heard a few adages regarding this - \"Those who live by the sword, die by the sword,\" and \"If you play with fire, you get burned.\" You played with a bonfire by constantly typing massive red flag words that the automated system *WILL* issue a punishment for, and then act surprised when you get punished. If you acknowledge that the system is flawed, then you on some level acknowledge how it operates, and if you know that it's flawed and operates based on keyword searches through chat logs, then you are well aware that you are endangering your account by even typing those words. \n\nFurthermore, I'm sure you've heard this in school and elsewhere, but *bullies have no power over you unless you give them power over you.* Actively railing against them and lashing back at them and feeling indignant and hurt and angry gives them power over you. If you ignore what they say or shut them off entirely, their words are empty and meaningless. So in the future, simply shut them off at the start, don't put yourself in a situation that gives them the upper hand, and especially don't let it escalate like you did here to the point where you gave them so much power that they used the very system you should be using against them to further harm you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2017-03-17T23:26:06.113+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Each person will be punished based on each individuals actions.   \n\nThis doesn't excuse or mitigate your actions.\n\nYou brought a outside(discord) issue into game.   \n\nI know what it is like to be discriminated against.

Care to explain now?\n\nSure!  It takes more than one report for a punishment to be issued.  Players have to reach a \"punishment threshold\" before the system determines that they have been negative enough to warrant a punishment.  Even in the case of hate-speech, if a player has played hundreds of games, and never been reported before, but receives a single report for hate speech in a game where they use a slur one time, they may not be issued a ban.  And out of all the toxicity categories, hate speech is usually considered to be the worst.  The lesser-evil categories tend to take more reports before a player will reach the point where the system decides that it is time to issue a punishment.  \n\nI'm sure you've seen some of us talk in other threads about how a player can work themselves back into \"good standing\" by playing games without being reported.  This sort of thing probably also comes into play prior to a punishment being issued.  With some cases, it is not so much that a player received X number of reports, but X percentage of reports.  Players that are consistently negative will be punished, while players that are not consistently negative are much less likely to be punished.  So, if you happen to report someone who is a consistently positive player, then no, your single report won't get them banned. \n\nAnd if you are reporting copious amounts of people for the things that you listed, then you really are diluting the importance of your reports to the system.  Swear words by themselves are not prohibited, it's only when they are directed at other players in derogatory manners that they begin to violate the rules.  As far as saying \"ez\" or asking for a report, you need to use a judgment call.  If a player says it one time, but does or says nothing else in the entire rest of the game that is out of line, you run the risk of having your report tossed out.  Is it considered poor sportsmanship to say \"ez?\" Yes.  Is it considered harassment to call for reports?  Yes.  Is the IFS going to issue a punishment for someone saying it one time?  Most likely not.   99% not.  So when you flood the system with reports like that, you can make yourself look unreliable to the system.  In those cases, it may be better to let the players who say it one time, but have otherwise been a pleasant teammate/opponent slide, so that when someone comes along who is genuinely toxic, your report is taken seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2017-03-19T02:59:07.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":">And if you are reporting copious amounts of people for the things that you listed, then you really are diluting the importance of your reports to the system.

And somehow, this is going to get these people to stop instead of continuing on.\n\nAnd then if we actually have people trying to report and mute, instead of flaming and fighting back, we should punish them by making their reports worthless.\n\nThen you and others wonder \"why can't we stop the toxicity\"?","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-03-19T09:16:22.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make no mistake, while I will almost always use the word \"you\" in a generalized sense, not referring to a specific individual when giving examples in my posts, in the excerpt you quoted, I was in fact referring to **_you_** specifically.
