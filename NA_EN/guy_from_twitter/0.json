Literally everyone on my friends list and in my games are the types of people who do this. You say you're having fun with the game, but honestly if you're low elo I don't blame you, the game is fun down there.\n\nUp in higher elos however it's exactly how I described, it's full of egotists who care more about their rank than the game itself. I can speak from experience because even I went through a phase where I felt like that. Essentially they don't care about the fun of the game, so long as they have freelo champs they can abuse to reach their desired rank. They find fun out of the end result, not the journey in getting there.","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-06-06T13:49:27.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lovesick,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JkJvLZEB,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-06T11:55:56.512+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s not a broad statement at all, I have plenty of proof.
