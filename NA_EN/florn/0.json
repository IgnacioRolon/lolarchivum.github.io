When i have played in the past I remember it sitting at a constant 60fps  but recently I noticed it was drastically lower (20-26) and would jump around a lot more.  So I figured that somehow my video settings had been changed to a point that my computer could not handle.  Looking at my settings they were at very High so I figured lets just turn everything down to low and see what happens.  This is where things get strange, my FPS is now hovering at 7 - 10.  So i went back and tested the different settings and i noticed that my FPS was doing the opposite of what you would expect when changing graphics settings. The lower I turn my graphics the worse the performance gets.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the sake of giving all the information here are the specs of my laptop:\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-2630QM CPU @ 2.00GHz  2.00 GHz\r\nRAM:  8.00 GB\r\nGraphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T20:54:50.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the troubleshooting done so far, and the issue may not really be the settings of your graphics but something else entirely.  For example, if you have windows 10 a recent update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has caused fps issues for some players.  Disabling that could help!\n\nYou could also have outdated drivers causing your game to hiccup.  I suggest going over our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to tune up your PC and make sure everything is in shape.  Hopefully, that helps fix this up!","replies":[]}]}
