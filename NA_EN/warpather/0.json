This is EXTREMELY dangerous to do. Personally i've been through a bit of depression and I believe someone would actually do this if depressed enough. It actually happened to me recently which caused me to post this. I ask that we do something to let Riot know that this is not ok. It poses a real threat to peoples lives. If anyone has any ideas on how to get the word out to riot, i'd like to stop this behaviour as I believe it is exceptionally dangerous.\nTL;DR Summoners telling their allies to kill themselves has got to stop. It's dangerous and unacceptable under any circumstance. Help me tell Rito it has to stop!\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all who have shown your support. If you are just reading this for the first time please post and tell me your examples of how something similar has happened to you! I want RITO to see this. It is important.\n\n\nEdit 2: The amount of support I have received for this post is amazing! I thank you all so much for taking time to add to this! I would like to clarify what I am looking to achieve, I understand fully no system will ever be perfect and its impossible to eliminate trolls and hateful people, but I would like a better system to help remove some of these particularly nasty and harmful people. I do not have the answers but together, I believe we can come up with an amazing system! So I implore all of you brilliant minded people out there to help me think of a solution! Together we can make a difference!","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-04T03:36:30.611+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":3,"body":"Stuff like what you mentioned has happened before, but through other media sources, and since League has such a large playerbase, player toxicity should be dealt with more severe consequences, since more people (especially teens, since there are so many decisions in that part of their lives, that sometimes they get seriously overwhelmed by it all, and tend to take some comments more seriously than what they were originally meant to be taken).\nI haven't really had this happen to me recently, but I feel like if I was feeling down and I saw that, I would probably take it the wrong way as well.\n+1 to this post, and I hope Riot takes this into account REALLY SOON!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kosmic Rider","date":"2015-01-04T18:43:36.919+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":2,"body":"The biggest problem is certain people have come to accept toxicity as a fact, they have given into apathy and simply give up. The saying \"evil wins when good men do nothing.\" Definitely applies. Yes, realistically there will always be children (whether it is mentally or physically), who get their jollies off by bullying others online. Would they say these things to another random stranger in person? What if they actually had a face to talk to and noticed the individual they're talking to is twice their size. There are competitive parts of other games that are heavily policed by game companies to prevent said toxicity. You look at some high end massive mult-player online role-playing games and their player versus player content, and you won't see the same level of harassment by its community due to the potential of being banned. I know, I used to be one of those immature individuals who would talk trash. Then, I got banned from blizzard for three months. \n\nOne cannot simply say \"grow thicker skin.\"\n\nThere are too many variables involved in individuals lives and it can get to people. Yes, this is a highly competitive game, but it still doesn't excuse this behavior. It still isn't right to accept it and \"deal with it\" as if we are obligated to. In the end, it's harassment. It's bullying. These things infringe upon the rights of individual. I mean, doesn't everyone have the right to play a game without being verbally insulted? Some people play league for fun and don't even do ranked. It actually is against most laws aka cyber bullying and harassment. The reality is, yes, it's incredibly difficult to police this behavior, it takes constant vigilance by Riot Games and a desire to do so. \n\nI myself am getting tired of seeing this in the majority of my games. People blaming others and just simply raging at things that are out of their control. Their inability to analyze or look at their own behavior and take out their unhappiness on others. I had to report 3 people in 3 different matches last night just because of trolling or their inability to resist typing filth. I guess all we can do is try to constantly reach out to Riot and keep reporting these players. It might have an impact or it might not. But, at least you are doing your job and not standing by idly as said behavior runs rampant. I don't know all the answers, but when someone says \"don't be sensitive\" I immediately think \"grow a pair and stand up for what's right, rather than be part of the problem.\"","replies":[{"poster":"ParParadox","date":"2015-01-04T19:55:40.318+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":17,"body":"\"Yes, realistically there will always be children (whether it is mentally or physically), who get their jollies off by bullying others online.

You dont have the right to physically or mentally abuse people IRL, why should that be allowed online? It's bullying and no matter where you go, and it's **illegal**\n\nAnd telling people to abide by rules on your property definitely Isn't censorship. \n\n> Someone wouldn't say these \"random\"(not random) things to a stranger because they wouldn't have a reason to.\n\n**Bull Shit.**\n1: then by that line of thought there is no reason to say it in-game\n\n2: if you were placed on a team IRL with strangers would you talk trash to them and tell them to kill themselves? No. Anonymity doesn't justify Dickheadism nor should it ever.\n\nThe fact that you could even attempt to defend that kind of behavior is utter garbage.\n\nAnd that whole censorship spiel is a straw-man/ Red Herring...

It's not that some random dick decides to say something rude but rather that everyone else stays in silence and I believe this is because of the bystander effect. So next time you see someone being verbally abused I ask that you at least consider standing up for them.\n\nLike I already said before, I think trying to eliminate negativity is a great goal and all but I still think it's better if the people that are positive would spread their kindness around more instead of just remaining bystanders.
