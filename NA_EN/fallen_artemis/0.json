Ive been really stressed out about playing ranked because im scared that if i lose one or two more i will demote back down to Silver 1. \r\nI recently looked at my profile and i saw a yellow warning sign above my rank saying this: https://i.gyazo.com/b061557ad8c5a9b728243a7c17cabfdf.png\r\n\r\nAs far as i know, the shield is only there when you promote to a new division or tier. How come it is there for me at this moment? I havent been promoted lately, just demoted. Its also really confusing because it says im being shielded from demotion, but i have also lost enough games to maintain my rank. What does this mean? Do i actually have the shield, and if so, how long do i have on it?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hidden Swamp","date":"2017-10-13T07:36:36.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m at gold V with 0 lp and the warning....

Someone said the system works like this: If you are gold 5, you will not demote to Silver 1 unless your MMR reaches a point an entire tier below your current rank. (aka if you're d5, you have to drop down to g5 mmr to be demoted to d1.)\n\nAnother thing to consider: I was demoted last season from s2 to s3, I got into s2, lost 4 games (dropping my MMR) but then I won a game. However, I lost my next game which demoted me back down to s3. From this, I assume the shield was given, but expired once I won a match.\n\nNot too confident in this, but hope it helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T03:04:00.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straaaaaange. I'm looking over your ranked history now and your right about your rank and LP, so it's actually really weird that you're seeing a Demotion Shield. You're only supposed to get those after recently being promoted to a new division or tier to prevent you from feeling the pain of immediately dropping back down. I'm honestly not sure why your client is showing that shield, but let me know if it never goes away.","replies":[{"poster":"Fallen Artemis","date":"2017-07-07T04:45:02.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could it be a glitch?

I would probably ignore it. It's not intended for you to get a demotion shield when dropping a rank, so there's a chance it's some type of visual bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Noxbox","date":"2018-01-27T13:45:40.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, does this mean we will not drop down to silver from Gold?\nI have this thing too after a horrid losing streak.
