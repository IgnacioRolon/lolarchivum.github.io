But now take a closer look below his waist. \n\nHis legs are both SHORTER AND THINNER than either of his arms. For real Riot? I thought we learned something in the past 10 Years. \n\nImagine him running at you. This is how I see it:\nhttps://media1.tenor.com/images/9c82818e04611cc764dea644a7f18507/tenor.gif?itemid=11887683\n\nFor real, I can somewhat accept that Mordekaiser needs such an appearance due to his mace, animations and all that jazz, but if this is a champion that is going to keep running towards the enemy team it will just look bad and comical to me. Pantheon was a step in somewhat the right artistic and anatomical direction. Please don't add more babylegs to this game. Ty.\n\nEdit: Yes bear legs are shorter than their arms in some species. But they are not disproportionate like they are in this artwork. I could put 3.5 of his legs in one of his arms.

Although it should be noted that gorillas aren't made to run fast, they are built the way they are with a non locking knee joint because they are intended to climb in trees, not run along the ground.  At least I'm pretty sure it is still true of gorillas, I know chimpanzees work that way.  In fact, the way a gorillas hips are set up it would be bad for them to run like a human does for an extended period of time.\n\nThey get by on being extremely strong and escaping their predators by being above ground level.  Well, that and being extremely aggressive to enemies.\n\nFun fact, humans also being an arboreal species are able to look straight upwards so we can see where to climb and is the same reason we can raise our arms over our head.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-10-18T05:12:29.687+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't take this too serious.

I'm sure they are going to go back &amp; make proper adjustments. That's the point of concept art.\n\nAlso, why the hell are you comparing the anatomical direction Pantheon to Voli anyway?????? Pantheon is a straight up human. Voli is an anthropomorphic demi-god in a fantasy universe that's based on a bear.
