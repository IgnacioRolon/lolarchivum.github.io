It means that there aren't other meaning ways to build.  Take for example mana.  Most champions don't have a meaningful interaction with mana like they did in previous seasons.  For the most part mana is something your champion will get and not have to worry too much about.  I know there are energy champions... and that reminds me that RIOT moved away from trying to develop a more interesting energy economy.  So it's like this, damage provides the most interesting choices and the most benefit in game regardless of whether or not more or less damage exists in the game in this season compared to previous seasons.  It's a Damage META.\n\nAnd yes, burst is not in the right place for a bunch of champions.  I have personally experienced the one-shot by Shyvana in Silver ranked play.  And yes, it was a literal one-shot - not some combo of abilities, but literally Shyvana throwing out a single long range ability and if that ability connects my champion dies from the damage from that single ability.  And I experienced this in multiple games, not just a single isolated game where some Shyvana happened to get fed.\n\nAnd I think about the casters of pro games from previous seasons talking derogatorily about the tanks and \"wet-noodle\" fights.  Is there a negative perception within RIOT concerning defensive options?  Because you look at the Runes (I recently had to redo all my Rune Pages because a bug deleted them), and you see \"choices\" like: would you like to do damage using Rune A, or would you like to do damage using Rune B?  In other words, crap choices.  For example,\n\nPress the Attack: 3 consecutive attacks deals 40-180 bonus adaptive damage.\nElectrocute: 3 consecutive attacks deals 30-180 bonus adaptive damage.\n\nAm I seeing double?  There's some extremely minor differences between these two keystones.\n\nAnyways that's just one really glaring example out of many examples of how Runes offer really bad, borderline meaningless choices to players.  Real crap.  And a lot of times it's all about the damage and there aren't any really great defensive options.\n\nSo when we talk about Damage META we are referring to a lot of different things revolving around damage that are all problematic for the game and are particularly bad during this season 9.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2019-11-18T12:50:02.158+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree.

Also we currently lack an anti poke keystone in any shape or form besides fleet footwork maybe?\n\n{{champion:8}} is a weird case, he has two possible playstyles, back line one shotting burst mage, or drain tank mage. As long as {{item:3089}} exists in its current uncontested state he will always play as a late game back line one shotting burst mage with no counter play. Uncontested meaning that there is no other possible build paths aka no AP bruiser items.\n\nAP {{champion:54}} isn't a problem anymore, and wasn't a real problem before his nerf either. His AP ratios were never that good, he relied mostly on magic penetration + base damage + {{item:3285}} / {{item:1402}} proc + maybe predator to oneshot and by the time magic penetration falls off and the game gets to late game (20-25 minutes) he is useless. One missed ult in a teamfight and he loses his lead and the enemy team probably wins the game. In the jungle he is basically an easier to play but worse and less reliable AP {{champion:79}} and in lane he is a worse burst mage.","replies":[{"poster":"LightswornLance","date":"2019-11-18T03:14:01.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"3 downvotes and no replies almost like I'm right but no one wants to believe it.\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}}","replies":[]}]}]}
