You say that 99% of leagues community loved the old Rengar? OH really? Well I just loved getting oneshoted without having a milisecond of reaction time, while simoultaneously having a mild hearthattack. Old Rengar was a ****  that just allowed weak players to snowball like crazy, while only requiring rengar to be better then single weakest link in the enemy team. \n2. You cry how his old Q was his identity? Yeah, sure! Who doesn&#039;t love a 0 skill abbility that allows you to shred through anything lategame.\n3. Nobody gives a **** about your champion being nerfed. If you really cared about your champion you would have been crying how his identity was ruined the moment the rework came out(or a tiny bit later), not now when his winrate reached 47%. Also 95% of you are just bandvagoners that want free LP while not investing any time into a champion.\n4. You cry how Bruiser Rengar is only viable build for Rengar atm. So what? There are 10 more assasins with similar problems, and i don&#039;t hear any of them crying now do I? For Gods sake we have 4000HP Shaco, Hybrid AA Leblanc and Ahri, Trinity Force Fizz etc. And you keep crying how Rengar is in a bad state? Yeah get in the line, some mains are waiting 3+ years for Riot to get to their champion.\n\nI am done, let the hate and comment war commence.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Augustusx","date":"2017-06-12T18:38:10.731+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. New rengar can definitely still one shot, not much different. still snowballs. Keep in mind, he is an assassin, he's supposed to do that.\n2. His new Q doesn't take any skill to use either\n3. If nobody gives a shit about the rework, why is the whole front page covered in rengar rework pages? If you look at the R/rengarmains page, they've been complaining about the rework since the day it came out\n4. A champ with no versatility is boring, and no one would want to play it, which is evident by his dropping play rate. A lot of people are complaining about the LeBlancs current state, so you're wrong about that.","replies":[{"poster":"CØulrophobia","date":"2017-06-12T18:49:09.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's sad. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Augustusx","date":"2017-06-12T19:07:45.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lexy123,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tadAs8fN,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-06-12T18:49:09.214+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s sad. {{item:3070}}\n\nI don't even own rengar, why would I be sad over him","replies":[{"poster":"CØulrophobia","date":"2017-06-12T21:11:54.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's sad you reply on troll and rant, with relative decency.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Its All Skillzz","date":"2017-08-02T17:54:19.375+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gonna leave this here to anyone who thinks rengar is trash at killing someone\nhttps://youtu.be/jOFENQS-35c\nWhat rengar has in this video, an insane score amazing farm and tons of items.\nlmfao j/k he is 3-11 has like 100 cs and has 2 completed items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exiled Jaeger","date":"2018-02-13T15:29:07.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rengar Revert just right around the corner{{champion:107}} ;)","replies":[{"poster":"CØulrophobia","date":"2018-02-14T14:55:05.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see you like playing Necromancer.
