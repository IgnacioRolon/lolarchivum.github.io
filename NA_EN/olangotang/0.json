Starts at 3200 KB/s and proceeds to drop until &lt; 500 KB/s.\r\nI have no clue why it drops to that speed, I live 40 minutes away from the server, and my ISP goes straight into 350 E Cermak, where the servers are being hosted. I can download a 2 GB Overwatch patch in 10 minutes, but for some reason, the new League Client takes EIGHTY MINUTES for a patch the same size. Pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T21:31:51.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a little odd that you're able to download other patches much faster. It could be due to how your connection is being routed, which you can check by doing a [**trace route**](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available) to our servers at 192.64.170.1. Hit me back up with that traceroute and we can go over the results!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akaterina","date":"2017-07-13T04:20:29.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im dling the patch at 37kbs atm ><","replies":[]}]}
