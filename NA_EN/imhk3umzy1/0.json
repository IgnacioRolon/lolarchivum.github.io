I got on my other account to see if it was still active, and it was. My main account was still the owner, and was in the club; on my main account, since I had no active clubs, I was able to make another club, despite still being the owner of one. Also I can't invite myself to the club on my other account since I'm still the owner of it on my main account. \r\n\r\nSo I would like to know if there was any way to \"rejoin\" my club, even though I'm the owner.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-13T00:38:35.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything looks okay now with your specific case.
