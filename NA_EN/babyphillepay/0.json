In season 7 I had been chat restricted early in the season and got to honor 1, but I have improved so much since then. I have had a better look on the game and become less tiltable. I just want to know if I can still even level up in honor because I know for a fact I should at least be Honor 3 by now. My brother who I won't include his name, has flamed so much more than me, and rarely gets honored, yet he is level 5. I would just like some clarification on this subject because I have been Honor 2 forever now. (Also, don't just say I would have it if I deserved it by now because I am confident I do.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-10T22:04:41.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's never good to compare your Honor progress to others, since everyone is going to be playing a different number of games and getting honored different amounts. Overall, you *are* still progressing at the normal rate though.","replies":[]}]}
