I lose 20lp because your shit game froze and I had to restart my computer. What the fuck is wrong with this game when I lose lp for your shity game. But people that legit go afk or fed on purpose get a slap on the hand or I get banned for calling someone bad for not understanding going bot lane with baron up at the 35 min mark is a bad idea. This game is crap idk why I've put the time or money into the game that I have since the game just promotes bad behavior in ranked. Now I know I'm going to get \"If you're good 20lp isn't a big deal\" and yeah you're right it's not but it's the fact that I came back to help the team win and didn't get shit for it is bullshit. So next time why not just turn off computer of go play a different game. Since that rule is just fucking over people when it's not their fault. For the people that are saying \"you're crying over 20lp\" they're the reason this game is shit and why this game is never going to be better. Go ahead and ban me now for bad language or some other bullshit you want to do since the game is nothing but toxic anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-20T01:00:11.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game freezing is almost always due to issues with the PC hardware, i can think of maybe two cases out of hundreds where it was the client, and that was  years ago on the old one. If you had to reboot your entire system, than is 100% a problem with your PC, userspace software cant lock up a system like that all by itself.\n\nInstead of bitching about it, post full hardware specs and any event viewer error logs.","replies":[]}]}
