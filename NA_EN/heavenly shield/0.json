Can we get a timer icon some where?\r\nHis clone does nothing when he dies, makes sense, can we get a self destruct option when shaco dies, Can the clone go after whomever is closest (and actually attack the champion, not just follow them)?\r\nCan we make his boxes useful for Ad players? Better scaling? More Hp? \r\n\r\nShaco is perfectly balanced, I don&#039;t want attention coming to my baby, I don&#039;t want him to be op, but these tweaks would be nice","replies":[{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-05-22T03:20:04.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There isnt a timer icon? Or a timer on the skill itself?\n\nIt already hurts when the clone dies, making it die when shaco did would just be too kog-ish\n\nYou can control the clone with R\n\nBoxes are magical, hence AP.  And plenty of AD champs have AP scaling skills.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-05-22T11:52:48.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but they killed the AP {{champion:35}} playstyle when they introduced the fear. It's more toxic now that AP shacos in ARAM for example max E for high harass instead of clever, hilarious and rewarding boxes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heavenly Shield","date":"2015-05-22T16:46:26.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ALRIGHTY SO THE Ult Timer Should Be A GOOOOO!\n\nBox scaling meh, make them useful, I mean you guys keep saying its to much, Shaco is by no means Op, and scales to nothing at all late game, compared to other champs.\n\nIf someone trips a box past 20mins and has like 50 hp, they wont die. \n\nI play shaco a lot, I don't see how the clone attacking the clostest person when you die would be op? It already follows them, just doesn't do anything.\n\nAND I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS, The Shaco Clone Does Not Attack Wards, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-05-22T13:53:45.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco has a pretty good winrate with a pretty good playrate. I don't think any changes are really that justified. \n\nIt would make a lot of sense for his Boxes to scale directly with his AS tho. His boxes HP needs to be low because of how strong they can be,","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-05-22T11:06:17.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus for the timer icon.
