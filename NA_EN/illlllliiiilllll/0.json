However, there is a tendency for one of the two to blame the other when things go pear shaped.

That leaves the solo player at a disadvantage where they can and likely will be caught out.\n2. 4-man premade defend their friend when they make a mistake leaving the solo player frustrated and feeling like they are facing a pointless task.\n3. 4-man premade troll or don't play seriously resulting in a frustrating game for the solo player. It's fun when it's all 5 friends messing around, it isn't fun when you aren't part of it.\n\nAs for duo bot lanes I have a special hatred for those as a solo player. They have the advantage of likely playing together at least a few times already, they have communications and picked their champions based on each other's strengths. Facing that as a solo player you have a support / adc that you don't know, who most likely picked a support / adc they are comfortable with that you may not work well with and at best you can hope they use pings smartly and ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trash sion","date":"2016-06-07T14:51:53.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"4 mans inconsiderately force a solo to fill their gap and deal with their shit for 35 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Twiggles","date":"2016-06-07T14:55:58.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Inconsiderate how?

They're also much more concerned with their premade than the solo player, so the solo is often left to fend for themselves. It doesn't feel good to get carried by a 4 man, get stomped by a 4 man, get trolled by a 4 man, or get harassed by a 4 man.

Maybe it's just the group that I play with and the groups I end up with when solo, but I barely ever see the issues you're bringing up. I always see it as there being 5 people. Sure, I might be in the same room as 3 of them, but we still need the 5th one to do well. I, and the people I play with understand that.\n\nA more accurate closing statement for your above post would be premades **_can be_** cancer for solo players. Of course, solo players can be cancer for solo players too. Premades are no different from randoms. We're all here to win and hopefully have some fun while we do. Premades are not inherently bad or good, and the same goes for solo players.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-07T15:39:33.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Whenever I'm in a premade I always post the curse voice link so everyone else on our team can join.
