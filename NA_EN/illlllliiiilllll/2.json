If the champion you want to complain about has a high winrate, use the following template. Guaranteed to get the boards circlejerk engine running if your champion is Yasuo, vayne, or lee sin.\r\n\r\n[insert X champion] has [insert winrate above 50%] and [insert playrate only if playrate is high] and still hasn&#039;t been nerfed!!!\r\n\r\nTemplate B - The &quot;Why is it okay?&quot; approach\r\n\r\nWhen you go to champion.gg and find that the champion you want to complain about actually has 46% winrate and 2% playrate, this should be the second resort. Because Riot designs every champion with well defined strengths and weaknesses, it&#039;s easy to select some of the champion&#039;s strengths and make them seem OP!\r\n\r\nWhy is it ok for [insert X champion] to have [insert hyperbole adjective][insert things X is strong at] [transition phrase] [something X is strong at]?\r\n\r\nEx1: Why is it okay for Aatrox to have insane sustain, amazing initiation, and a revive passive on top of being an oppressive lane bully?\r\nEx2: Why is it okay for Kalista to have great mobility, easy kiting, and unbeatable objective secure as well as a free engage tools?\r\n\r\nTemplate C - The &quot;I cherrypick statistics&quot; approach\r\n\r\nWhen all else fails, go to champion base stats on lolwiki. Compare your champion to similar champions and choose high base stats to make a point. You can also combine this with the &quot;Why is it okay&quot; template for even more emphasis!\r\n\r\n[insert X champion] has [insert X&#039;s base stats] while [insert similar Y champion] has [insert lower base stats]\r\n\r\nEx1: Jinx has more range than even Caitlyn even though having long range is supposed to be Caitlyn&#039;s niche\r\nEx2: Why is it okay for Urgot to have the highest base HP and the third highest HP per level scaling out of any ranged champion in the game?\r\n\r\nNote especially the finesse I used in crafting example two. Although Kayle has higher HP scaling than Urgot, I did not include Kayle in the statistic because she is technically melee. Furthermore, the use of &quot;in the game&quot; implies some greater significance to the fact, despite it being redundant and useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-24T08:42:02.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You should add what not to do's, like leaving room for constructive debate.\n\nAnd maybe how to flame the people who try to propose potential constructive solutions or playstyles that beat the champion in question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-11-24T17:35:01.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Omgnerfurgot","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLLp","date":"2016-11-24T12:00:52.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NastyMcOutplay","date":"2016-11-24T11:59:51.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"someone is  salty","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2016-11-24T07:25:26.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Based on what I've seen on the forums and on Reddit, I thought the process was as follows:\n1.
