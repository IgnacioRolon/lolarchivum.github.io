The problem is his windows are tiny. His ult has a short CD and his Q and E make him really hard to deal with no matter who you are unless you are {{champion:90}}. To top it off he has one of the best combinations of defensive abilities in the game (a decent personal shield and a shield that can protect him and his team from all projectiles and there are a lot of them). Sure the CD is decent, but as he ranks it up the windows go down. His kit needs bigger windows really. From his ult being on almost a 30s CD late game to his ability to infinite dash. I personally think he should spend  his flow for wind wall or it needs to actually spawn in a set place and not instant spawn and drift forward. And then maybe look at nerfing his MS to 335 and removing his wind wall giving vision.","replies":[]}]}]}
