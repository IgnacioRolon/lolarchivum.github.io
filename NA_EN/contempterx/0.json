You commented the same thing multiple times, and this one is the latest one I found, so.....there's no point in writing the same thing everywhere.\n\nNow, let's MATH TIME.\n\nMalzahar at level 2 has 600 HP, with Doran's Ring, it's 680, but he's not at max HP, right where his HP bar was then, it was around the 500-550 mark.\n\nLet's just go with 550 since it's more stable.\n\nQiyana's E damage is negligiable as she broke the passive with, but visually, it did like 20-30, let's go with 20 as it was her passive that dealt the damage.\n\nSo that leaves Malz with 530 HP, her AA since it's empowered would've hit for 66+10 LS + 10 adaptive + 12 = 98. 530 - 98 = 432, then she uses Water Q, which deals 89, so 432 - 89 = 343, then another empowered AA, which this time applies passive, so it's 118, leaving him with 225, taking him bellow half HP, then Wall Q, which deals 89 + 54 as bonus since he's bellow half, equalling to 143, leaving Malz with 82 HP, Ignite deals 110 damage at level 3, and since he died on the last tick of Ignite (as he used his potion way too late), the Ignite dealt it's whole 110 damage, so Qiyana, with electrocute (which I didn't math it, as I didn't math in the armor Malz has, too tired for that) did around 440 damage.\n\n440 damage using 1 Q, 2 AA, 2 passive procs, Electrocute, 1 Q with execute damage.\n\nJust for amusement, let's look at Zed vs that Malz with no passive.\n\nZed has 68 base AD at level 3 + 10 LS + 10 adaptive = 88, so 2 AA from Zed is 176, + 41 being from his passive = 217. Considering the position where Qiyana and Malz are, Zed would've easily hit a double Q, there are no minions between them, so Zed's Q would deal full damage, being (80 + 20) x 2 = 200, then E adding another 78, and we have Zed being able to deal in that exact situation, without counting the electrocute proc or the armor, 495 damage. Qiyana did (again, without counting elec or armor), 468. That's almost 30 less damage on Qiyana, with a much more complex combo than what Zed would have to do.\n\nBasically, in that exact same situation, Malzhar's getting a new one, regardless if it's Zed or Qiyana.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2019-08-22T21:40:02.150+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"level 3 Qiyana EQWQ with 1 auto does 332 + 434% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n\npassive, procced twice since it resets on W:\n23 + 55% bonus ad \n23 + 55% bonus ad\n\nQ, procced twice since its reset, plus bonus damage on low health:\n80 + 90% bonus ad\n80 + 90% bonus ad\n48 + 54% bonus ad\n\nW from single auto:\n8 + 20% bonus ad\n\nE:\n70 + 70% bonus ad\n\n\nZed full combo WEQ with 1 auto does 270 + 280% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n\npassive:\n6% max health, like 40 damage\n\nQ twice:\n80 + 100% bonus ad\n80 + 100% bonus ad\n\nE\n70 + 80% bonus ad\n\n\nlevel 3 Qiyana EQWQ with 1 auto does 332 + 434% bonus ad + 100% total ad\nZed full combo WEQ with 1 auto does 270 + 280% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n\nhmm","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2019-08-22T21:58:36.347+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aazzlano,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aNLo3j6e,comment-id=00070000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-08-22T21:40:02.150+0000)\n>\n> level 3 Qiyana EQWQ with 1 auto does 332 + 434% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n> \n> passive, procced twice since it resets on W:\n> 23 + 55% bonus ad \n> 23 + 55% bonus ad\n> \n> Q, procced twice since its reset, plus bonus damage on low health:\n> 80 + 90% bonus ad\n> 80 + 90% bonus ad\n> 48 + 54% bonus ad\n> \n> W from single auto:\n> 8 + 20% bonus ad\n> \n> E:\n> 70 + 70% bonus ad\n> \n> \n> Zed full combo WEQ with 1 auto does 270 + 280% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n> \n> passive:\n> 6% max health, like 40 damage\n> \n> Q twice:\n> 80 + 100% bonus ad\n> 80 + 100% bonus ad\n> \n> E\n> 70 + 80% bonus ad\n> \n> \n> level 3 Qiyana EQWQ with 1 auto does 332 + 434% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n> Zed full combo WEQ with 1 auto does 270 + 280% bonus ad + 100% total ad\n> \n> hmm\n\nAnd you're not factoring in that Qiyana is allowed to slip in several more autoattacks, given how her trading pattern and mobility works.\n\nThat guy's math is questionable at best.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-08-22T19:28:08.795+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they do not.","replies":[{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-08-22T19:34:22.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MiracleMorg94,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aNLo3j6e,comment-id=0007000000000001,timestamp=2019-08-22T19:28:08.795+0000)\n>\n> No they do not.\n\noh yes they do.\n\ntalon you just have to W both strokes, melee Q, 2 auto's and ignite.\nthat's a dead someone it doesn't matter who it is.\nmaybe 3 auto's for the beefy boi's.\nfor malz you just get his shield down on a previous rotation and assume he positions like the example in the OP.\n\nkata is more finesse, you leave a dagger out on the map, as it's cooldown is coming back up and your opponent just so happens to be just in range of it, you begin the dance.\nshunpo onto the champion, edge it to the blade so that you pick it up and get the dmg off.\nauto, auto, q, auto, E (onto champion not the dagger, but do collect the dagger at the same time), ignite, press B, finisher shunpo, and shunpo out again cause you're now under turret.\nwell done you are now the katarina master.\ni wish i was fucking playing with this shit lol.\nif she's against a malz then she no doubt q'd off his shield ages ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-08-22T20:06:35.586+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they do not.
