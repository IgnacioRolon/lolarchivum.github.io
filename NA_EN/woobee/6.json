Its silliness factor is incredibly inconsistent and clouded by children&#039;s desire to win and get what they want.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-10-21T07:45:17.491+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like every other game mode... ruined within the first two days by people taking it too seriously and spamming the same lame picks every match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ll LifeSiphon ll","date":"2015-10-21T07:28:38.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My biggest question is: Why wasn't this mode played on Howling Abyss?  Summoners Rift takes way too long to kill the enemy with odd champs...  The light, crazy fun needs to be able to be had on a lighter, friendlier map.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-21T10:58:33.155+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Rito did that last year, and people hated it. I wasn't playing League at the time, so I don't know the details. I think it was OfA Mirror, so you always went against yourself. I think it turned into monotony in overdrive (imagine 5 nidalees vs 5 nidalees in ARAM). Half the fun of OfA is hilarious matchups (i.e. eve vs rengar, soraka vs darius). You lose that the moment you make everything mirror mode. It also drastically reduces the chance for comebacks, which is half the fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Joyous Queen","date":"2015-10-21T21:44:52.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this variant will always be somewhat dour since most of the win condition is determined in champion select. if your opponent has lux and you have shaco why even play it out?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-21T08:25:06.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#\\#OfA-Teambuilder","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-10-21T06:47:48.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of these game modes are best the first time around, when no one knows what they are doing.
