They're death machines. Now, don't think this as me wanting to enforce the meta, no. I'm fine with off-meta picks as long as they are actually playing the role, not just \"oh hey, I'm support, but I'm going to farm and play like a mid-laner instead\" So yes, I have a problem with the examples of supports going counter-jungling without the team being on board. But that's another bucket of kittens.\n\nAs for those three in bot lane, there's this problem in botlane right now where you're either being completely oppressed and unable to do something--because of all the easy and quick CC available to these champions, as well as the high initial damage and scaling on top of that--or you're fighting the \"support\" for CS because they don't understand wave management and just throw out their abilities willy-nily.\n\nLet's also face the fact that these control and burst mages that are visiting botlane are starting to push out traditional supports. Why play Janna when you can just scare the other team away by burning their health away with Brand? Why bring Lulu when you can just drop Tibbers and erase 1/2 of their health instantly? That's the problem, in this scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"woobee","date":"2017-03-06T15:31:08.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point is that people are so quick to dismiss botlane mages as something to be removed, but only when they replace the supports.
