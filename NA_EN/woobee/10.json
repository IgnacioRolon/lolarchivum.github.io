I have long fingers, so it's easier to hit flash with my R finger than with my E finger, and I don't have to stop casting. It also makes it much harder to hit accidentally, and, since I have much more precise large motor (wrist) than small motor (finger) control, it's actually slightly faster for me than moving my middle finger down from E to D. As a bonus, flash-ulting is just a matter of pivoting my hand by one key (Q->W or Q->Q, W->E, E->R, R->G) for a moment, which again is faster and more precise for me than trying to coordinate two individual fingers moving in opposite directions. By similar logic, my attack-move and items are on my mouse.\n\nOf course, the F is for Flash people are all fooled. After all, Flash is in my second slot.
