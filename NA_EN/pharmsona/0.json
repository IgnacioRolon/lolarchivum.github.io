I will fully admit that I downloaded and used scripts in two games just because i saw some talk about it and just wanted to see what it was. I felt like it was clumsy and not easy to use. I had the acct since season two had played thousands of games have spent countless dollars and never even intended on continuing to script. I was literally just to see what it was like. I dont see how RIOT can justify perma banning a loyal player for this one time infraction. I loved my acct and have so much time invested in it. I get it i broke the rules but perma is to much. Strip me of rewards and give me suspension but please have mercy RIOT. I just want one more chance to have this acct back. \n\nThe acct im talking about is &quot;LokiToke&quot; and any RIOTer that can help me please do.\n\nEDIT\n\nThe whole thing wasnt intentional on the lokitoke acct. I had scripted on a lvl 5 acct to test out and forgot to uninstall programs and logged into a game with loki. I switched them off during the game but the program was still up and running during two games just not active. Thats what makes this frustrating is that this technicality doesnt matter and since program was running it really cant be proven that i did or did not actually use the scripts on loki. Also the lvl 5 acct was banned too.","replies":[{"poster":"KANSAS CITY STAR","date":"2017-07-12T11:04:29.023+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You knew third party programs aren't allowed and you used your main account to \"try it out\"?

You used scripts on 2 games, which means that you atleast intentionally tried to get an advantage by use of scripts.
