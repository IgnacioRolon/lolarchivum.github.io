When ever sand soldiers are issued an attack order, they will do one attack, then azir begins to move towards a random point to the right and bottom of his current location. It happens most of the time and the only way to counter it is to hold the right mouse button down and leave the cursor on the target. This sometimes results  azir moving when the unit is killed and keeps the player from putting his cursor anywhere else. It's a major disadvantage and makes Azir feel broken as hell.","replies":[]}]}
