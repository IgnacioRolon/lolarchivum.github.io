I&#039;d go so far as to say I am pretty good at the game having played since 2009 being Gold level and higher upon the introduction of Seasons. I&#039;ve also been around the block.\n1. I&#039;ve experienced the Nasus 1.0 ap ulti shenanigans. \n2. Jax dodging tower shots, Dodge being a rune, Sivir&#039;s dodge passive, Dodge boots ect. \n3. Release Xin Zhao 1v5&#039;ing teams. \n4. Ryze having the one shot combo with his ultimate AoE AP steroid from the halls of Odin&#039;s lightning storage house himself. \n5. Release Zyra (shiver).  \n6. Old Kat with +gold on kill passive and only 3 skills with about double her current damage on resets.\n7. The S2 holy trinity of corki ezreal graves with Irelia destroying any top laner that even looked her way with just a health regen pendant. \n8. The unending Kayle model and passive changes (I think their have been about 2 model changes and 5 different passives?)\n\n\nI&#039;ve seen it all. I took a break for about 2 months to try out other moba&#039;s and really just enjoy life as I have some time to myself again. Coming back just in that short time after the preseason has really got me stumped by the direction you, Riot, have taken the game. In all the time I&#039;ve played I have never felt it so unplayable as it is now.\n\n1. Too much damage\n2. Too much snowball\n3. Huge vision disparity.\n4. Personal thoughts/gripes (Less objective oriented and more just how I feel)\n\n\n\n* #Too much damage at_ ALL_ stages of the game.\n\n\n                  Simply put, there&#039;s way too many champs that simply have with way too much damage at all points of the game. It&#039;d be one thing if these champions are purely there for their damage and nothing else, they had a ramp up time, they have hard commitments, don&#039;t do all their damage in under 1.5 seconds or even were gated by items. However I&#039;ve discovered that many champs get to ignore most of these, or in some cases _all _ of these things and are just terrorizing this game.\n\nThe biggest offenders I see are:\n1. {{champion:104}} \n2. {{champion:114}} \n3. {{champion:5}} \n4. {{champion:77}} \n5. {{champion:96}} \n6. {{champion:238}} \n7. {{champion:91}}\n8. {{champion:63}}   \n9. {{champion:11}} \n10.{{champion:133}} \n\nNoticing a trend? All of these guys are doing so much damage at almost all stages of the game its pretty reminiscent of Pre season 1 league damage (IE the tibber drop or ryze combo at level 6). It makes me wonder, &quot;Why should I ever play other champions when these guys are just doing so much all the time?&quot;\n\n\n ######I&#039;ll help ya&#039;ll out and give you a couple freebee&#039;s that I&#039;ve noticed just slip the radar continuously even though they are always single handedly **_winning_** their teams games.\n {{champion:9}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:32}} \n\n\n\n#* Snowballing is the worst it&#039;s ever been...\n\nThis is not even a question. Snowballing is so hilariously prevalent that I can&#039;t even understand why the changes that have caused it went through. Whichever team happened to get lucky in the first 10 minutes of the game by getting FB and/OR the first dragon/tower almost auto wins the game at any decent level. There is literally no room for come backs. \n\n1. You can&#039;t do a late game strategy that can turtle for the late game (lol what late game we be 30 minute end game now) because games are just finishing too quickly.\n2. Gold is so scarce that** if you are behind** you can&#039;t even complete your first core item before the opponent is well on his/her way to finishing  their second item. \n3. Several &quot;late game&quot; champs now have stronger early games then staple early game bullies do now (Poor Renekton) who then later become mid game monstrosities ending games before 20 minutes (Master Yi). \n\n\n               To further extrapolate the more towers you push down the stronger your lane minions get... Why??? You already get the increased safety net because you can deep ward further more safely and put them in a tighter position WHILE being able to just shove lane then gank somewhere else FOR FREE. You get Uncontested Scuttles. You get free Rift Heralds when you push the top lane in correctly... Wait why is this a thing again? It&#039;s the single most obnoxious gamebreaking snowballing... **_thing_**... I have had the ~~dis~~pleasure of experiencing in this game during its entire existence. If the opponents don&#039;t react fast enough thats a free tower. If they refuse to act (lolthanksoloqueue) then that&#039;s 2 free towers and a dragon + free roaming ganks.\n\n\n\n\n#** There is not enough Vision to protect yourself **_by yourself_.\n\n             I wouldn&#039;t be as upset about the above points if it weren&#039;t for the fact I can&#039;t even defend myself with vision on my own. Even though I&#039;m getting 100&gt;50%&#039;d by [insert above champions mentioned earlier] every time I want to get a last hit, I could deal with that if I had a way to protect myself even a little bit from the enemy jungler. The sad part is I can&#039;t.  It **requires** my jungler or support or another laner to help me IF he can even spare the time since they need to be creating pressure on the map everywhere else and getting his/her own farm ect.\n\n\n##1. Wards are incredibly limited especially in the first 10 minutes of the game. \nPinks are required if you need a safety net since you can&#039;t have 2 greens out ever anymore. Should you start to lose lane to your opponent he now has all the vision control in the world since he will freely kill your wards with his own pink and safety net green.\n##2. The winning laner enables scuttles for his team and you simply can&#039;t challenge it by yourself.\nThis goes into the whole snowballing thing. You can&#039;t challenge vision from behind because you will put yourself in a bad spot and likely die. I&#039;m not saying everyone is going to experience this but in my games I&#039;ve noticed that it is incredibly difficult to challenge vision from behind because it is like S2 all over again. You die if you get in their range.\n##3. Heavy reliance on your jungler for vision\nI wouldn&#039;t mind this point if it weren&#039;t for the above sections** and **the fact that jungler is probably the most difficult to play _correctly_. I don&#039;t want to have to rely on my jungler for vision so heavily and I can almost garuntee he doesn&#039;t want to be responsible for ganking, counter ganking, vision, vision denial, jungling and counter jungling all at the same time. Supports help with vision too but leave your ADC too long / be by yourself too long and you&#039;re gonna have a bad time.\n\nAll this goes into the other 2 points. There&#039;s too much damage and there&#039;s too much snowballing to try to recover from.\n\n\n\n\n\n#So, for the TL;DR\n\n##Damage is too high across the board. \n\n           You can&#039;t just keep reworking champions and give them more and more damage to &quot;make the champion more fun&quot;. There is a reason why people hated fighting against every popular S2 top laner back in the day because as soon as one of you hit level 2 first the other died almost instantly. Then you died again because they had phage(back when this item slowed you) after they b&#039;d. So it boiled down to one of you literally sat under your tower never seeing a CS because once someone got ahead you couldn&#039;t get in range or else it was death.  Now this is the story of every lane this Season.\n**_By continuing to give everyone &quot;Tons of Damage&quot; you are continuously powercreeping the game._ **\nI actually must say I&#039;d be super happy if you brought back nerfmastersucktown for a bit and started nerfbatting everything in sight because this game in my opinion is hideously broken and half of it is just because damage is way too damn high for no cost\n\n##Snowballing is out of control. \nRift Guardian is too much power for how easy it is. It&#039;s literally Morde dragon all over again only it gets to go to every lane. Many \\*late* (hah) game champs skip the early game low power curve whilst early game champs still have no late game. Their early game does not justify their weak mid/late game. See above.\n\n##Vision is just too scarce and team dependent. \nWhoever is ahead gets free vision and vision denial due to scuttles + tower kills and you cannot adequately attempt to protect yourself with vision should you fall behind due to the limited wards and pinks constantly cleared. See above 2 points.\n\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Palantair","date":"2016-02-25T16:09:34.475+0000","up_votes":111,"down_votes":5,"body":"#Closing statements and my personal less objective gripes and complaints (More wall of texting coming your way!)\n\n**I really love this game.** I have been playing a long time and it just pains me to see the direction Riot have chosen to go. I have played many moba&#039;s including WC3&#039;s dota and other variations like AoS and Tides of blood. I will continue to play it league too. That said... I think  I can say with a great deal of confidence  that you need to pull the leash in a bit. You are making so many champions unhonest to play against that I feel obligated to play something equally as broken in order to stay relevant. \n\n\n##I have never in my life felt so completely outclassed against someone based PURELY on the champion they picked and not because of the skill involved. \n\n              My last couple games I literally had to play league by not playing at all, as in stay under turret  and &quot;don&#039;t die&quot; in the truest sense of the statement. IE: I pick a go to top mainstay Renekton, someone I&#039;m more then comfortable with. They pick Fiora. At no point at any stage of the game was I able to effectively fight her without losing trades constantly just because she does so much more then Renekton can. I have to play 100% defensive, which is an instant loss with an early game bully like Renekton. Couldn&#039;t CS and when I get pushed under tower I get 2v1&#039;d with a fiddle ult/flash bypassing all my 2 defensive wards like shaco.\n\nTo give you an idea how absurd this feels for me, I was maining GP before his rework and laned against people counterpicking me constantly with pantheon, when GP was garbage and Panth was a damn terror.\n\n\n######Also a little tidbit for newer players that higher leveled jungler mains will tell you. If you lose your lane he _WILL_ be helping someone else win theirs. Your job becomes &quot;just try not to die&quot;. \\#Feelsgoodman\n\n\n\n##I have been on the opposite side absolutely destroying the other team. \n\n               Recently I did it with Graves and I couldn&#039;t help but feel the victory was hollow. It didn&#039;t feel fair, I didn&#039;t feel like I outplayed them. I was just abusing a champion that has so much free damage that there was not a thing he/she could do about it. I mean how fucking hard is it to auto&gt;Q&gt;R&gt; someone and kill them in 1 second? Only thing the opponent can hope for is you miss which is really difficult to do with hitboxes the size of Sion.\n\n\n\n##Champion kits are just doing too much\n\n          When I have to sit down and take a FULL minute just to read and then another 10-15 minutes of re reading to  understand everything that just _one_ spell of Illaoi&#039;s actually does, theres a fucking problem.\n\n\n\n##Stop making champs fit into every lineup by reworking them\n\nI firmly believe you can&#039;t keep trying to make it where every champion is able to seamlessly fill into any and every team perfectly. Its not how it works. There are too many different champions to just make every team a cookie cutter. And yet that&#039;s what has happened as many champions play almost _exactly_ the same doing the exact same job only either better or worse (Hi Akali, meet Diana. Akali2.0) This game is constantly touted as a team game, and yet there is no way to effectively compose a team correctly in champion select, IE late game oriented, push oriented, early objectives, mid game power spike oriented, turtle oriented, hard initation, wombo combo, teamfight, splitpush ect ect. (though the new champ select one is a great start).\n\n\n                  \n\n\n\n#*To close, I just want to show you how absurd this games balance is with this statement:\n\nYou can&#039;t let a melee champion build straight tank items and still outdamage everyone in the game because &quot;luloutplayedbro&quot;.  \n\nWith just that one sentence how many champions did you think of that fit that description? \n\n\n...A lot right? That is what I want to drive home.  Why is damage so freely handed out that you can **RELIABLY** build full tank and still pump out hard carry levels of damage when leagues premise has always been about who is the better player and not who has the more broken champion. Thats for you to ponder and Riot to figure out.","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2016-02-25T22:54:26.643+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"Here's another interesting fact that you might not have noticed or maybe I just didnt see it, but currently all the OP champions you put up are AD champs.

Champions should be designed with a simple idea for example: \n{{champion:59}} : Lock enemy team\n{{champion:105}}  : Disable and eliminate one target\nOrianna  : Ball mechanics\nIlaoi point was spot on, his whole mechanic and purpose is too complicated and messy. On top of that, champs like {{champion:157}} had so many hidden numbers in their kits which were completely unnecessary. Blind mechanic of {{champion:133}} is completely broken unlike {{champion:104}} Smoke Screen or {{champion:56}} Paraonia because you can react to those. Regular blind was fine enough, but now doesn't matter whether you're melee or ranged, if you are blinded by her, you're gonna get 100 - > 0.\n\nI agree with the rest of the post completely, just had to give my opinion on what pisses me the most. I think Riot always had an idea about what they wanted from LoL but never used correct methods to achieve desirable goal. As a community I'm not even sure if we can find right way to balance things.

I can't help but think that 'Perfect Imbalance' is partly to blame for this in the first place. It's not the only factor, obviously, because not only one factor can lead us from the period where Cinderhulk had just gotten nerfed and League saw pretty great balance, to this Charlie Foxtrot of a situation. People saw what one champion could do and basically said 'why can't my champion do that?' and eventually Riot listened and made it so their champion could be durable and do decent damage, but possibly without the trade-offs the other champion had to suffer in the first place to have that combination, and so the cycle continued. At this point, I'm waiting for some sort of outlandish champion to come out and compete with some of the stuff we've got going on. \n\nI ordinarily like Extra Credits, but that video makes me cringe at this point.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"X Anivia X","date":"2016-02-26T19:22:19.767+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:34}} > ADCs.\n\nbut speaking of tanks.\nThere are certain AP tanks that are quite broken right now.\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:127}} \n\nSome mages are pretty strong.\n{{champion:7}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:99}} \n\n{{champion:37}} is just totally broken...I mean...she shouldn't be able to tank an inhib turret when she builds no tank.

So, I'd rather it be the exact opposite of what it is now. That 4th dragon buff is fine and all, but why take 20% less damage from turrets when they already tickle? It'd make more sense to have that buff and have turrets hit the way the do currently without it and have them hit like a truck without the buff.\n\nI love this game, and I'll be honest, I'm not going to quit due to imbalance. Hell, it's not even *that* imbalanced. Every champion is busted save for a select few. There are a minimal amount of champions that aren't ban-worthy, and that's good, but the problem is that they're ban-worthy for their damage or overloaded kit rather than what Riot intended bans to be for. (Does this champion counter our comp?)\n\nWith that said, overloaded kits are probably always going to be an issue at this point. Riot needs to start nerfing numbers across the board and bring champions down in damage rather than bring weaker champions up. I really do think that weaker champions/stronger objectives would be beneficial to this game. ADCs doing an assassin's job shouldn't be a thing. Assassins doing a tank shredder's job shouldn't be a thing. Those are the two biggest issues right now.\n\nHell, I don't even know if this game should be classified as too forgiving or too unforgiving. It's too forgiving with turret dives being so easily accomplished by squishies and it's too unforgiving when you die once and your lane is practically lost. Mages are a joke unless you're Lux, and AD is broken unless you're Yorick.

All valid points made by the OP. You need to be on your toes the entire early game. There is no safe farming when the waves are always pushed up on a tower. Why does this minion pushing mechanic exist? It doesn't seem to benefit anyone. The ones in the lead have to stay with their wave if they want to farm effectively, leaving them open to ganks. The ones behind can't farm because their wave disappears so quickly, and they can't clear the enemy wave because they're behind on items. It's not fun, it's not effective, and it didn't solve anything except ensure you keep the lead.\n\nTowers are a joke. I'm not those people that want them to do more damage than they should, but they shouldn't be the same consistency as tissue paper. Make them sturdier or increase the range or something. When the first tower goes down, the rest of the game spirals out of control. Doesn't help that gaining towers also contributes to minion pushing, which means the problems stated before just happen faster. \n\nThere is little room for comebacks, and they aren't satisfying at all. All it does is trade frustration. I want to play a game and be able to honestly say \"gg.\" I don't want these empty victories, torturous losses, or increased toxicity I've been seeing.
