This is blatant theft, and Riot is the judge, jury, and executioner. If you are like me, and have spent many years and dollars on this game, be forewarned and cease playing immediately. They have no interest in justice, only a quick and easy fix. Sorry Riot, but that will only result in a drastically negative chain reaction of lost loyalty and users.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2017-12-04T02:44:26.708+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr\nI spent money, so I get to be a dick without consequences","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-12-04T02:53:10.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snapp2Kill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YvnKdqB9,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-12-04T02:44:26.708+0000)\n>\n> tl;dr\n> I spent money, so I get to be a dick without consequences\n\nNot quite.

I actually have a BA in Business administration and one of the sections we took courses in was Torts and Contracts. If information or understanding is asymmetric, some parts of a contract become voidable. \n\nIf you actually read, btw, I didn't condone actually committing fraud. I said you can contest the charges with your creditor. If your creditor consents, then you had a legal foothold on which to argue your case.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2017-12-04T02:31:24.607+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not stealing.\n\nYou agree to the ToS when you create an account and play their free game.

As a contract participation you have rights too. You have a right to dispute charges with a creditor if you feel that the vendor you purchased from has entered into a position where they are no longer offering you what you purchased, as long as that vendor is active.\n\nLeague = one of the most Charge Back'd games in the world.\n\nNow, if a Ban-ee does such, they can expect to have every account locked from future purchases and your credit source will block any future purchases from the vendor, so it's a cautious position to take. They also usually only have a limited period in which they will review like 3 months.\n\nThey do have the right to dispute the charges.

Statistics are not static, and the system they have now works VERY different than the one they had then. The tribunal might have had a .005% perma ban rate because jurors usually understood slight infractions. The Automatic system they have now doesn't work like that. Slight in fractions are recorded and you can reliably get called on just getting mad at erroneous play and bossing people around or saying \"GG.\" You don't have to cuss, and you don't have to use hate.
