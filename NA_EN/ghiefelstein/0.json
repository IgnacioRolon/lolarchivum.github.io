Instead of nerfing the best top laner at that moment (Renekton), they wanted to buff some healthy other candidates. I feel like such an approach could work for supports too, since they have seen a lot more nerfs than buffs.\r\n\r\nOver the past year we have seen quite some nerfs for supports who were too strong. Annie, Leona, Morgana, Braum, Thresh, Nami, Janna, Soraka, Sona for example. Those nerfs were justified, but it made the support class as a whole weaker. The only two buffed champions were Alistar and Blitzcrank, after which Alistar became a top laner. Is buffing some of the weaker supports a good idea? Is it even possible without creating balance problems in other lanes (think Lulu)?","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-02-18T00:59:46.390+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh is the \"Renekton bar\" of bot late.  As long as he keeps the ability to pull allies across 2-3 walls to a target he hooked with his Q, or simply provided twice the distance of flash for an escape, he will remain insanely game breaking as a support.","replies":[{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-18T09:09:42.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is that not very, very similar to a support with a stun? \n\nAdc and support are trying to flee, Taric stuns for 1.6 seconds and the adc uses any escape they have and both are gone.

There is a difference in Thresh moving an allies champion twice the distance of flash with his W on a 15ish sec CD with some cdr, and both being safe, and in a champion using their escape+flash to go the same distance while leaving their support behind to fend for themselves or blow their own flash.","replies":[{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-19T04:50:41.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You want to hate on Thresh when so many ADCs and Supports could give the same result.","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-02-19T13:16:21.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um no there are no supports or adcs in the game that can flash/dash/etc the distance of Thresh lantern while making themselves and their adc safe.  Your attempts to defend him are extremely shallow lacking any substance, logic, or sound reasoning.\n\nUnless you are going to add something relevant, such as actual facts or examples, just go away and stop trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-19T23:24:13.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your attempts to tear him down are more than flawed. You're hating on Thresh's W for being the skills itself when it seems your real hate is its max range. It's max range is far but the very, very small chance Thresh is gonna be at or get to that distance just in time to save a teammate is so rare. You have a problem with a possibility, a small chance.\n\nCaitlyn's E goes pretty far and can hop walls, Jinx can bind you and get very far herself and you can combine some of these with supports like Taric stun, Sona E/R and go even farther. You don't like these examples? Then look at your own, you're providing shoddy 'could be' examples and thats all. \n\nYou're a slightly above average player and act like you know everything about the game. Like anything you say is fact, Thresh's lantern is not an issue in the game. You're just being sour over a very rare occurrence that probably doesn't even occur at your level of play.\n\nSo how about you quit whining without any actual points or reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-02-19T23:51:51.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um I'm not hating on Thresh, I'm expressing simple acts of hit kit.  Thresh pulling people distances that far surpass flash or other forms of dashes is not some rare occurrence, when he initially throws the lantern he is already pretty close to flash range all he has to do is simply walk away and he has surpassed it.  This doesn't even go to mention things like Thresh flashing when someone grabs his lantern, or using the 2nd part of his Q to further increase the range he can pull someone.  \n\nYou want to act like Thresh's lantern is some kind of risky or inconsistent tool when it's one of the most consistent escape, or engage, tools in the game.  It is one of the most game breaking skills any support has, and by far the most versatile skill any support has to date.  \n\nLastly I'm not tearing him down, quite the opposite, I'm stating just how strong he really is without any attempt to hide those facts.  There is a reason riot can't nerf thresh out of being the tier 1 support since his release no matter how much they have tried.\n\n\nLastly I would use the \"your a bad player who shouldn't talk\" argument when your sitting in Silver 4.","replies":[{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-20T05:48:22.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, activating his Q again doesn't pull someone even farther, it pulls him to the hooked target. He could then Flay but that's not what we're talking about.\n\nSecondly, There is no point in trying to convince you because you choose to stay ignorant.\n\nLastly, I didn't call you a bad player. I stated where you are on the LoL ranking system. You're slightly above average. You can over-react to the truth, which you seem to love to do, but that's not my problem. (Also, I used your highest placed ranked, I could have called you Silver as well because that's where you stand currently but I didn't c: )","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-02-21T01:46:48.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't pull them any farther hm....\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFRBDmGZQ-8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVIj1t5duP8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kDR7IeX-_Q\n\n\nOh look at that three examples of Thresh Lantern going beyond it's \"max range\" because Thresh flashed, or used the 2nd part of his Q as the person clicked it.  I suggest you go type \"thresh express\" into your friendly youtube search engine and you will be met with several videos displaying plays like this, at all ranks, where Thresh Lantern is going massive distances by using these kinds of tricks.  \n\n\nThere is no point trying to convince me because all you are trying to do is spread false, and frankly bias, information about a champ that you have displayed a rather significant ignorance about.  If you actually have relevant facts, or evidence to support your claims, you know like I do mine, then you might have a chance but frankly you don't..\n\nLastly I'll eat your last comment, mainly that you didn't call me a bad player, I misread and took it wrong my bad.  I will leave you with one more fun fact though, I'm not currently Silver, I was gold last season and so far I haven't played my placement matches for this season, IE as of right now I'm unranked.","replies":[{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-21T02:35:36.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like I said it can happen, its just rare and its definitely far from game breaking. Very, very few people consider it an annoyance even.\n\nYou're currently ranked Silver in team games, therefore you are ranked. Just sayin.","replies":[{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-02-21T02:47:47.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um you directly said \"activating his Q again doesn't pull someone even farther\" and yet actual gameplay shows otherwise.  Being able to Lantern+flash/hook to set up a gank is a pretty basic skill when it comes to playing Thresh this isn't some amazing high skilled rarely happens strategy, it's something I see pretty much every game that has a Thresh in it, it's one o his defining characteristics.  \n\nThe thing is you are here almost like you are trying to downplay his kit, almost as if you think I'm trying to say he needed to be nerfed.  Hell you even make a comment about me \"hating on thresh\" and while I do not like Thresh, mainly because it was his release that took the support role from a variety of picks to \"who can fight Thresh,\" situation I've long since accepted him for what he has become, and that is the standard for what all supports have to be able to achieve in order to be viable.  If a support can't handle laning against Thresh it will not be viable, it's one of the reasons Zyra/Sona/Karma/etc don't see play and Janna/Morgana/Annie/etc are highly valued.  While a lot of Thresh's kit is responsible for his strength his Lantern stands alone as being the strongest part of his kit primarily because of the versatility it provides to an already powerful kit without it.\n\n\nLastly, I have not played a single game of ranked in teams or solo Q.  Where ever you are getting this ranking from, most likely lolking, is wrong.  If you want to see where I really sit I suggest you log into the game itself and search for me there.","replies":[{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-21T10:11:31.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Whatever you say man.\n\nNo use trying to convince ignorant people, good day c:","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-02-18T09:53:15.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stunning one enemy =/= Retreating one ally.
