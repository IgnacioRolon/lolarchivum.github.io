I looked it up and tried doing the \"Run as administrator\" fix but it doesnt work for me, I tried deleting LoL but nothing I just cant get the game to even start, I really need your help guys.\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-28T18:36:11.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is super common with permissions issues.
