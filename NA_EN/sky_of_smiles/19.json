Maybe a boost of 5% growth in total revenue from this acquisition... Seems kind of dumb like ego stretching by flaunting their money as if they&#039;re swinging their big D around... Or maybe I&#039;m wrong and that $6.6 billion purchase for about $1.25 billion annual revenue (somewhat conservative growth estimate even at ~20%) may end up paying multiples giving Tencent a stronger foothold into the current 35-40% share that mobile games have of the ~$100 billion gaming industry. Anybody who&#039;s ever researched into app development knows how competitive that market is.\r\n\r\nI feel sorry for Riot because that $6.6 billion could have been reinvested into League of Legends. \r\n\r\n$6.6 billion and still no Dragon Master Swain.","replies":[]}
