The ability to choose fights is a powerful tool. In addition, many jannas will fail to interrupt your zenith blade with their whirlwind because they lack the mechanics. I make leona work in plat depending on the matchup (against soraka, karma, lulu, jinx, ashe, jhin... low mobility squishies).\n\nSorry I'm too lazy to imgur my leona stats, but here they are as per op.gg on 3/14/17.

I made an essay on that a year ago or so in the GD section arguing why people with less than 3.0KDA are in their real ELO and why those with more should get higher if they're performing that on their main.
