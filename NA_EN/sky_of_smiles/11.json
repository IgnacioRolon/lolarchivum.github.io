It was not held in the Situation Room, as had been a practice under previous administrations.\n\nHow do we know that mission&#039;s details weren&#039;t leaked which resulted in the casualties that occurred.\n\nThen there&#039;s this:\n\n> &ldquo;This was a very, very well thought-out and executed effort,&rdquo; White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Feb. 2 as questions first arose about the mission. He stressed that it had been thoroughly vetted and planned on Obama&rsquo;s watch.\n> Colin Kahl, a national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, however, tweeted his contention that Spicer was mistaken.\n>  &ldquo;Obama made no decisions on this before leaving office, believing it represented escalation of U.S. involvement in Yemen,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter.\n\nTrying to blame Obama much like how people tried to blame Hillary.\n\nYou wanted your &quot;God Emperor&quot; and now you have it with blood on your hands. Enjoy the rest of whatever you call your life cause there&#039;s now 3 kids that&#039;ll grow up fatherless because of you.","replies":[]}
