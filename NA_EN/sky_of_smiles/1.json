The moment a suspect is under pressure in fear of getting caught for a certain crime he&#039;s guilty of, the criminal may attempt to shift the focus away from him which is exactly what Trump is doing.\n\nJust in case for those who didn&#039;t see:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73bIlOzjFHo\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295 \n\n&gt; CORNYN: Yours truly did on multiple occasions. And that heightened your concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest with the Department of Justice which caused you to make what you have described as an incorrectly painful decision to basically take the matter up yourself and led to that July press conference? \n&gt; COMEY: Yes, sir. I ask &mdash; after President Clinton, former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel. And decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there. We investigated it very, very thoroughly. I know this is a subject of passionate disagreement but I knew there was no case there. And calling for the appointment of special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, uh-huh, there&#039;s something here. That&#039;s my judgment. Lots of people have different views about it but that&#039;s what I thought about it. \n&gt; CORNYN: Well if a special counsel had been appointed they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right? \n&gt; COMEY: Sure. But it would have been many months later or a year later. \n\nI hope ~~nazi~~ mods don&#039;t lock this thread cause I really do want to discuss this topic since I actually do value my freedoms as an American to debate how to better ascertain our core values (like Strawberry Ice Cream - the Superior Choice for Superior GD&#039;ers). Our system is based on checks and balances in case people forget. The President is not above the law. **-snip-**\n\nWhen it comes to protecting human rights, for me as an engineer, a weeb, and as a LoL player, money is not my main concern (I don&#039;t care how much it costs to save an innocent kid cause I meant it when said I&#039;m Pro-Life). What I do care about is how efficiently an investigation pertaining to protecting our right as an Nation is being conducted which means who&#039;s conducting it and what would be the best outcome for our American values are what affects it the most. Trump, as I have argued time and time again, is not the best outcome. The man will obey lobbyists who&#039;ll benefit his personal gains such as ISPs being able to sell your personal information (nobody cares what Tundra Fizz is into - in fact chances are some of us already know and we&#039;re trying really hard to pretend we don&#039;t know... if you&#039;re reading this, whatever you&#039;re thinking: No). What benefits lobbyists doesn&#039;t always necessarily mean it&#039;ll benefit the American people&#039;s interests as a whole and as an engineer, I believe its always important to first analyze your understanding of the system as a whole first before analyzing its parts to optimize/modify it for whatever reason. I don&#039;t see Trump doing that because he can claim others accomplishments to be his own (regardless of whether he actually contributed any effort into it or not besides just standing and smiling), but he never showed his ability to analyze and understand a system as a whole before implementing taking action. Imagine adding a new GPU that your power supply can handle and it performs great for a while, but then your computer fries from overheating since you didn&#039;t thought about the heat transfer issue. Another example would be building a large expensive hotel on a beach, but being stupid as to not consider the effects of global warming causing rising water tides would have on the investment in the future before it gives a ROI especially if your soil foundation is gonna be shit no matter what pile design you implement. Again, he can claim how he generated new jobs or &quot;brought back&quot; jobs to the U.S. all he wants, but if in protecting those, we end up losing more overall, that isn&#039;t the best outcome for our American values of having a hard work ethic in pursuit of happiness - that&#039;s actually a betrayal of it. So this special council investigating whatever it deems necessary, I don&#039;t mind how much it costs cause to me, our animu and freedoms are more important than money.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnrxCLaWgAAjsiS.jpg:large\n\nIf our tax dollars are gonna be spent on something domestic, it might as well be on this. I don&#039;t see any reason why if an investigation is needed that serves to protect our freedoms, why it has to be questioned. There&#039;s no pressure bullying out of this. Its not like bullying people into giving you money to build a wall to cover our border to Mexico which by the time its finish, it&#039;ll just be like one of the super structures that doom the USSR with its overspending on them cause they wanted to make it better than their U.S. counter parts. One can easily find past arguments used trying to justify that spending, but the results speak for themselves seeing as how the USSR fell (who in their right mind would even overprice a design with something such as gold if not for maniacs like Stalin).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_hOR50u7ek\n\nNo matter what, these investigations are better off continuing since a Republican controlled majority in Congress means any grounds for impeachment can be overruled by the House/Senate. And, I do mean investigations as in more than 1. Like good anime waifu polls, it doesn&#039;t matter how many good waifus you have; what matters is when do you use them otherwise you&#039;d get the Misaka Mikoto vs Inabad Himeko incident.\n\nFor years Republicans have argued about how things would be better if they got both Congress + President. Now they have and in these 6 months they&#039;ve accomplished nothing. Whats their excuses this time? Blame it on this investigation by the Democrats?  \n\nhttp://imgur.com/R2FfnFJ.jpg","replies":[]}
