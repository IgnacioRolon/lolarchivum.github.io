Male, female, gay Russian sushi bar bouncer, who cares which character(s) he voice acts for - that guy is awesomely entertaining.\r\n\r\nTo put it into context, I can enjoy watching some of his movies again as much as I do with Marvel&#039;s movies on Iron Man or The Avengers which is more than I do rewatching say Star Wars... I went there...\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this for people who either enjoy anime or like Adam Sandler&#039;s works.","replies":[]}
