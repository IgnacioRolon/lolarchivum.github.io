Yet, he chose not to because he was afraid of a split Democratic party while the Republicans put up a strong united front and thereby allowing Trump to become President? Hillary also had the option of running as an independent and splitting up the Democratic votes as well and also running the risk of Trump winning the election.\n\nWhether you supported Hillary or Bernie, the moment Trump won the election, all Americans lost. If you didn&#039;t support Hillary, you didn&#039;t support Bernie.\n\nhttp://www.adamdince.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/stone-cold.gif","replies":[]}
