I just got done downloading league of legends and when it was done patching. I try to login but it was not responding to the league sever. I do not know why and yes I have tried doing what you guys suggested and what others suggested but it doesn't seem to be working.  I have windows 8 so that might be a factor but I do not know. Please help me with this problem so I can keep on playing your amazing game and with my friends too. Thank you. {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T18:08:00.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, if you're running Windows 8, you'll definitely need to install the [Windows 8.1 update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15356/windows-8-install-update-kb-2919355) to ensure you have crucial windows assets on your system. \n\nIf you continue to have issues, check out our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) that addresses connection issues with the most common solutions for them.\n\nLet me know if your issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
