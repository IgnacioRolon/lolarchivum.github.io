It's not op it's just unfun to play against. Frankly I think there should be no ability that has both a dash or blink with untargetability. It's frustrating knowing that you can't kite that. Maybe fizz's e can just make him untargetable while walking. Kind of like an untargetable version of Twitch's q without stealth. Admittedly I'm not a fizz main but I can guarantee you my idea would at least be less frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-06-26T14:40:18.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't like him having the dmg to kill me at level 3, or  almost 100-0ing me with only his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Joxcab","date":"2017-06-26T23:19:50.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If he killed you at level 3, you weren't full health or you were playing like a reckless idiot.\n\nHe can't ever do that with ult in a realistic situation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oKILLeRoTrEloC","date":"2018-03-31T09:56:24.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is one of the most  stupid champs in this game because his spells are just 2 op. q=2 much dmg coming on to u, w insane dmg after one aa, e dodgin everything and being on the air and then  making so  much dmg when falling and finally r  just 2 much dmg slow and airborne","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-06-27T00:30:14.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same reason why yasuo is banned\n\n\nalthough another big reason he is banned ( atleast in higher elo ATM IIRC) is that his top lane tank build is coming back again.","replies":[]}]}
