Go to your League of legends folder, locate League of legends and the folder Config.\nInside this config-folder you find a file named PersistedSettings.json :) \nCopy this file to somewhere you always can find it.. Make a new folder and paste your PersistedSettings.json there.\n\nSTEP 2 : Go out of all folders except the new one you made for your PersistedSettings.json.\nLogin to your other account, go into your League of legends folder again, and once again locate the Config folder.\nThese files are linked to accounts and not your computer. Take the file from your new folder, paste it into the Config folder and overwrite the current PersistedSettings.json.\n\nNow your settings are the same as in your main account. \nYou could upload your file to your phone, email, or a uploading-service of your choice. Next time you are at a friends house and borrow his computer you simply overwrite  the PersistedSettings.json-file he got. But remember to cut out the current so you dont overwrite your friends laptop-settings :) Hope this helped. \n\nFirstprick","replies":[{"poster":"Name2Hard","date":"2017-08-07T21:13:13.998+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What you say is correct, but i dont know if they changed it or  whatnot.\nBut once you have copied the PersistedSettings.json over the old one you have to start a game (jsut a custom with no one is fine) so the settings get rememberd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ban Zed i int GR","date":"2017-10-14T23:25:56.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT WORKS!
