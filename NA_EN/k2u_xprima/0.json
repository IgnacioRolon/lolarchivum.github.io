At first, I thought it was maybe a lag or something, but my Skype was opened &amp; my Chrome was opened, where I was playing my music. Everything was working, just my game disconnected. I went online &amp; checked EUW server status and it seemed fine, everything was green and was working good. I restarted my League Of Legends. Next thing I know after logging in, there was no 'Recconect' button. i went to check my profile and BOOM. No game in my match history that I played &amp; I lost 20 lp. This happened to me a couple of times before. Is this fault from Riot, somebody DDOSing or is it a bug? Should I contact Riot Support? If somebody knows anything please reply. Thank you ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T01:59:20.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like this was simply a game crashing server side, no need to jump to DDOS theories just yet! This is a pretty rare occurrence usually, but when this happens everyone is booted and won't be able to reconnect (since the game crashed and doesn't exist anymore). \n\nYou also won't get any penalties or lose any LP (I did double check for you and your LP is current for what it should be).","replies":[{"poster":"K2U xPrima","date":"2017-09-25T08:16:10.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I lost 20 lp because the game didn't show up, my bad sorry","replies":[]},{"poster":"K2U xPrima","date":"2017-09-25T08:12:53.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you so much!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LissomMars","date":"2017-09-25T00:27:08.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens sometimes.
