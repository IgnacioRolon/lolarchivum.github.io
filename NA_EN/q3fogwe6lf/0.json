I was so amazed and excited with this game!! ^_^\r\n\r\nLeague became a very effective and entertaining distraction / &quot;therapy&quot; from the very dark things going on in my life during this time.\r\nPlay League was fun - I could even bond with my friends, even while I had to be stuck inside a clean room after chemo.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nBut you know what - **I just received my first ever 14-day ban... and it is all my fault**.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s right.  It&#039;s my fault.  Over time, I have become the most salty and toxic ~~son of a bitch~~  (ignore that, mom) person.\r\nIf I encountered myself in-game, I would undoubtedly report myself in the post-game lobby.\r\n\r\nHow did I even get to this point?  I&#039;m just a lowly Silver 4 {{champion:16}}  support main!\r\n\r\nBut guess what - I let my ego, my pride and a disturbingly toxic mouth (in chat) get the better of me.\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI know that I&#039;m better than this.  \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a rant about why my ban wasn&#039;t deserved.\r\n\r\nRather, It&#039;s a public rant against myself, knowing that I am better than what I&#039;ve been.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m in no place to tell others how to be better.\r\n\r\nJust, to the future me... \r\n\r\n1. Please be kinder.  \r\n2. And more patient.  \r\n3. Stop getting so upset... it&#039;s just a game ^_^\r\n4. And please, please, PLEASE stop being toxic and insulting to other people!  Who the fuck are you to insult anyone anyway?!\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nAnd to the rest of this mostly lovely community, I do apologize.  I pledge to no longer contribute to the toxicity in this community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo please, **The 7 DeadlySins**, reform your behavior.  Just enjoy the game for what it is.\r\n\r\nAnd if anything else - don&#039;t lose yourself in a sea of unwarranted and misdirected emotion and toxic bullshit.\r\n\r\nFor a person who shouldn&#039;t even (medically-speaking) be alive, you&#039;re lucky, and you should stop acting as though life owes you a huge favor.\r\n\r\n@ **The 7 DeadlySins**, get your shit together bro.  Check yourself before you wreck yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"shadowlord723","date":"2017-04-29T02:00:33.123+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Incredibly well said. Most people in this community tend to deny the fact on how toxic they've become to receive a ban. But you, my friend, you have downright admitted your mistakes. You not only chose the path to apologize to yourself, but to those around you as well. You have chose to promise yourself (and I hope you don't break it; I definitely 100% see great potential in you to keep it) to reform and not be the toxic man you had once become. You, sir, are a brave soldier, one which this community needs more of. With a post like this, you have gained my forgiveness (along with many other players who read this most likely).

That being said I only report people for 2 things. Leaving ranked games, and feeding then just blaming EVERYONE ELSE on your team the whole match, there is nothing on league that angers me more than that last one.

Which is nice, but Jesus Christ, who the heck cares that you eventually behave normal and act like this is a great thing. You are not a good driver just because you do less road rage either. \n\nApparently this sort of self-centering is a thing in North American culture, hence all the social media shit coming from that place.\n\nKeep this for your teacher or your psycho doc, they are more likely interested in what you achieved than some strangers over the internet - which you clearly over-estimate in both ways. They never care about you nor do they really want to hurt you with \"toxicity\".

If so, those don't get chat restrictions and will start with an account ban.\n\nIf it was for chat offenses, they can skip multiple punishment tiers depending on the severity of the behavior. Most commonly a chat offense skips tiers for hate speech (such as racial/homophobic slurs) or threatening or suggesting physical harm (I'm going to hurt you irl, kys etc.).\n\nIf you were punished by the Instant Feedback System you should receive a Reform Card upon logging into the client (also received by email), and if it was for chat offenses you'll get some examples of your chat logs which resulted in it.

Most of the people here can relate to some form of depression, or will be able to at some point in their lives, but to carry that burden at the same time as cancer?  That is enough to weigh heavily upon anyone's mind, and while even you are acknowledging that you did take things a bit too far at times, I would venture that there isn't a single other player reading this thread who has had to deal with both when they were so young.  \n\nBut even more than the perseverance that you have shown in your battle for your health, I have to respect your strength of character for being able to firstly, admit your mistakes to yourself, and secondly, be willing to admit them to others.  Many people prefer to delude themselves, seeking only for a way to cast the blame onto others and thus remove a need for absolution.  But we all know that this only works for so long before a person can no longer deny the truth behind what they have done.  And while it is never necessary for players to come here to the Boards and confess to any rule-breaking they might have done, it does take courage to do so.  Which is something you seem to have shown time and again.  \n\nThe last thing I will say is an exhortation to you.  As you have no doubt read in the email/Reform Card which accompanied your 14 day suspension, if you receive another punishment in a short period of time, and your account has not had a chance to downgrade itself to one of the lower punishment tiers, that next punishment is automatically a permanent suspension of the account.  Please, please be warned.  It does not take much to trigger the permaban.  A single use of hate speech, for example calling a duo queue friend a f-g or n----r as a joke, if reported by someone else in the game, would be more than enough.  People have said that it's actually easier to go from the 14 day suspension to a permaban than it is to go from no punishments to the 10 game chat restriction for the first time.  \n\nYou seem like a decent person, who has been through a lot of difficult things.  I would hate to see you lose access to an account that has been a large part of your distraction and amusement during a very difficult part of your life.  I don't mean to paint the situation as being bleak; it's far from that.  The fact that you have already decided to change your behavior on your own is the biggest and most difficult step to make.  If you ever have any questions about how to proceed with or how to handle a situation, you can always come to us here.  While the majority of us are not Riot employees, the Arbiters are volunteers who work closely with Riot, and there are many players who comment in this section of the Board daily, who will try to help you in any way we can.  There may be a handful of commenters who don't necessarily seem overly sympathetic, but the rest of us are like your own personal team of supports.","replies":[{"poster":"q3fogWe6LF","date":"2017-04-30T17:05:52.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much thanks <3\n\nThis comment leaves me wondering... a team of supports... it couldn't be all bad ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-05-01T00:57:22.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're meaning in game, I've done it quite a few times.
