Well, not really, but here's the thing: I like powerful characters, no matter in which story. What made me like Syndra with her first lore, is how she used her powers. She wanted to use it for herself, because she just liked it. I'm not fan of the \"I must use my power for the greater good without ever thinking about me\" cliché.\nAll she ever wanted (in her old lore), was to break her own barriers, to push away her limits (she was not \"power hungry\" as people used to imagine. She wasn't looking to take power from the land, like Zed for example, she just wanted to explore her own potential). \nNow, in her new lore, things are a bit different, but she still is this enormous powerhouse, that is naturally powerful. She's always been bullied and lied to, and now that she's finally free, she's ready to take her destiny into her own hands.\nPlus I really like her in The Dreaming Pool. Can't wait for her to get an actual color story :O!\n\n\"My potential is limitless. I will not be restrained.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Gilgayu","date":"2019-01-27T14:23:35.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Syndra is a good one.

The aspect of her training them subsequent betrayal is the point in particular.   Originally, Syndra was growing into her power and revelling in her constant growth, then the Elder who was supposed to be fostering her was revealed to actually be hampering her,  then he threatens to remove her powers in totality... so she lashes out.    From this original story, it was surmised that syndra has been bullied as a child and that there was a possibility that the Elders weren’t as benevolent as Ionians would think... whether that be due to needing to sap her power to fuel theirs for the war, being jealous of her powers or jsut being scared.        \nI think there were a few changes since the update, but even now there’s still an element of justification missing that gave Syndra some more understability.   The Elder didn’t threaten her but instead tried to console her....   keeping the”theeatene To remove her power” aspect is what made her outrage sympathetic.\n\n\nOther than that, the Dreaming Pool story was quite a damn good story haha.       Tho my personal favorite color story is The Eye of the Abyss,   So much tension, for me it was the first glimpse as to why the Void is such an important storyline, yes it was always an important and relevant plot line, but that color story cemented and sparked the “oh shit” factor.... and that was before we saw the first Voidspawn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-02-02T13:45:39.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:28}}  She run's around making happy people miserable, ruining their lives and destroying families({{champion:67}} ) how she came into being is interesting since we didn't really know much about Demon's until her rework, she's just cool, she looks amazing too. \n\n{{champion:103}} Sort of a similar story, except Ahri feels bad for what she did, i love how she looks as well. \n\n{{champion:518}}  There's a pattern here somewhere.
