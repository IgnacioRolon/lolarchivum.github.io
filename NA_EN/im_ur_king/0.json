On all game types, after the champion selection screen when the client launches I get a black screen instead of the typical loading screen and game.  After several seconds the game will crash, leaving the message   \r\n\r\n\"Unable to Connect to the server, Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to the game\".  \r\n\r\nI have verified that the game still works perfectly fine on my home network and one other however it continues to have this error at the new location.  I have edited my computers internal firewall to allow the League of Legends client access and nothing changed. (To be expected since it is being listed as a network error)\r\nI have reinstalled the game just to be safe.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know what network settings I need to change in order to allow League access?  I have administrator permissions for the router, I just need to know whether it's a matter of simply port-forwarding or something else entirely.\r\n\r\nIf anybody knows what's wrong, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T03:33:42.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd try out the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) first.
