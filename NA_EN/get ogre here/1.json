In my opinion if a champion is extremely strong late game, they MUST have a weak early game and Kayle accomplishes that.\r\n\r\nFrom the gameplay I've seen, Kayle has a very weak, but very manageable early game/laning phase for her first 2 forms. Then once she reaches level 11, she becomes an actual champion and is allowed to exist, and level 16 she wreaks havoc on everything.\r\n\r\nThis is what I've always wanted in a late-game champion. Vayne just does too much damage and has mobility and cc and everything early game, Nasus is just a fuckin nuisance, but Kayle actually has a very weak early game that smoothly transitions into a very strong late game.\r\n\r\nThis thread probably had bad structure and whatnot, but I just wanna get these thoughts out because I'm very happy to see this.\r\n\r\nGood job Riot! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-21T00:41:40.947+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, nasus is a mid-game champion though.\n\nIf you look at his winrates according to how long the game lasts (in like D+ elos) his win % falls if the game gets to lategame, whereas theoretically an infinitely stacking champ should get higher chance to win the more a game lasts.","replies":[{"poster":"Done25","date":"2019-02-21T00:56:39.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saezio,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gsnxeTIN,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-02-21T00:41:40.947+0000)\n>\n> Well, nasus is a mid-game champion though.\n> \n> If you look at his winrates according to how long the game lasts (in like D+ elos) his win % falls if the game gets to lategame, whereas theoretically an infinitely stacking champ should get higher chance to win the more a game lasts.\n\nThat's because the DPS marksmen melt him before he can get close by then.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-21T01:04:07.798+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are in agreement then.

Imot extreme powercurves are pretty unhealthy for the game overall, whcih is why i dislike the tuneing on new kayle.\n\nExtremely weak early and absurdly strong later never worked to well in the past, either the early is so weak that the champ is near unplayable cause it can't ever reach it's lategame potential(YI in high elo), or the champ is decent enough early to get to his powerspike and he puts the game on a timer for his opponents(yi in low elo)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"HollowMimic","date":"2019-02-21T16:15:37.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she stays behind it's difficult to catch-up.

(1-6) Yeah, she's a tower hugger and just gets the scraps of CS. Considering she's a late-game powerhouse, this is fair.\n\n2. (6-11) She has her ulti and a new form, so she's still fairly weak but can definitely put up a lil bit of a fight, she's kinda like Kayn before getting his form. Not super weak but will get stronger to compensate.\n\n3. (11-16) Now she's really doing well. She can kite people and do damage and now feels like she's really getting strong and can put up a good fight.\n\n4. (16-18) She's extremely strong now and is one of the strongest champions in the game at this point, which is good because the entire game has been leading up to this. Yes, her team has an advantage because she's on the team. This is because if she survived all of that weakness she kinda deserves to be rewarded with a ton of strength. And nothing is an instant-win. Kayle will still be able to lose at this point, just like how anyone who's fed can lose.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2019-02-21T03:28:20.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this will bring some balance issues though.

I don't think her being bad in lane will be that bad, she'll be kinda like Kassadin. Pretty shit in most match ups early on but will come back to smack you later. Just multiply both of those things by 3 and you got Kayle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
