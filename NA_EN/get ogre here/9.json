It&#039;s taken on Miss Fortune and Kayn currently.... And that&#039;s all I can think of. Sometimes people will take it for some kind of cheese build but other than those situations I very rarely see Dark harvest being used.\r\n\r\nPredator: Taken more than Dark harvest, but still not taken on a lot of champs. Volibear, Rammus, Hecarim, and sometimes Nunu among others for, again, cheese builds that are generally impractical in real-game scenarios.\r\n\r\nHail of Blades: Oh yeah, they added that into the game. Jhin takes it... sometimes...... Basically it&#039;s just a precision rune disguised as a domination rune. No champs who should be in domination should be taking it, and I&#039;m not sure why Riot wants marksmen taking domination.\r\n\r\nI really wish I could take Predator on Talon. I was so excited before the runes came out to run at people at the speed of sound and outplay them, but I have to take Electrocute just because it&#039;s so good. I&#039;m sure there are a lot of other situations of a rune that would be really cool on a champ but they can&#039;t take it for the same reason.\r\n\r\nSide note: I feel as if Sorcery has a similar problem with Arcane Comet, but that&#039;s another story.","replies":[{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2018-07-26T00:19:16.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hail of blades is really fun on Varus and Vayne too.
