I don't use any third party programs, however I will look further into it as much as I can. It is strange, I'm not sure why it keeps happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T20:53:11.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really strange to hear that you are crashing instead of receiving any errors, so I'd like to look into this more.  Are you currently using any third party programs?  If you have any running like play.tv or overwolf remove them and try again, as they've been known to cause issues with the client.  If that doesn't work, your network could also be having problems establishing a connection to our authentication server.  For this, go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) issues guide to strengthen your settings and connection.  Hopefully, this will get you logged in!","replies":[]}]}
