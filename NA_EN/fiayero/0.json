When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring a clean account to an instant permaban, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xox BaByDoLL xox","date":"2019-07-28T01:36:29.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying to game the system aside, you knew what you were doing was wrong and you deserve to be permabanned.\nI know too many white people think it's super fun/funny to come online and throw the n-word around and generally being nasty, mocking, dismissive, and aggressive towards people of color thanks to the anonymity the internet gives them, it's nice Riot doesn't play those games and actually - in more cases than not - gives af when someone throws out that slur.\n\nEnjoy your ban, i hope you lost a lot of money.....since we all know you didn't learn any lesson and somehow think what you did was funny, a simple mistake, and/or no big deal.\n\nI hate people and society.","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-07-28T02:01:12.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hearing the term \"people of color\" kind of pisses me off because each of us has different issues we face in our communities, which can't all be lumped together under one blanket solution.

It's like back in the day when people would say \"colored\"\n\n\nIt is beyond absurd to liken every usage of the phrase people/persons of color, to colored. In the Jim Crow south there weren't \"People of Color\" signs outside bathrooms  - okay?\nNo idea why that phrase bothers you so much since your post made no sense to me(seriously, not shit-talking), but get over it honestly. I think \"African American\" is stupid to say, but i don't harp at other black people for using the term, I deal with it and go about the actual conversation at hand.\n\nPersons/People of color is a broad brush phrase, yes, but when someone says it in text like I did the race they're talking about in the moment is usually pretty obvious and most people don't need it broken down for them.\nMe using it in the context I was, on a thread about the n-word, made it kinda obvious who I was talking about but I guess not for you, and nowhere did i say other people don't face issues blah blah blah. That's a common thing people love to throw out whenever black people wanna talk about race and the crap they have to deal with - especially in communities that run from ever having to deal with the topic, like the gaming community. It's a way to shut down the conversation and avoid any real discussion about racism. \nWe can never have it, even when we're literally on a thread about someone saying the n-word, it's either \"omg you think everything is racist,\" \"omg ur so angry,\"or \"omg everyone has struggles\"..........that type diversionary dismissive nonsense pisses me off more than people using \"Person of Color\" or \"African American\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-07-28T01:29:53.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I guess that was pretty stupid of you eh?
