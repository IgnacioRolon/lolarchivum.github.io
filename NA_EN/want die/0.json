I didn't notice it popping up. I was unable to close it, and once we got into picks/bans, it was still there. I was unable to pick a champion to ban, as the chat box completely covered the button, making me unable to click it. During this time, I was unable to type or chat in either the pick/ban chat or the chat window. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have any pictures of the bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T20:57:08.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really strange issue and I'd like to find out more, though, I'm sorry that happened to you.  Would you be able to reproduce this in a custom game and provide a screenshot of what's happening?","replies":[{"poster":"want die","date":"2017-05-24T03:16:49.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually happened to my friend as well, he's captured a screenshot of when it happened to him, just not in queue. He was also unable to close the client window. Restarting the client seems to work well, but the problem seems to crop up randomly. \n[(https://prnt.sc/fbeb8r)]","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T16:29:02.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the screenshot!  I don't have any info to share on this, but I've forwarded the report to try and figure out why this is happening.  In the meantime if possible, keep chat minimized during champion select to see if that can prevent the issue for now.  Let me know if that workaround works for the time being.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Noctis Snow","date":"2017-05-23T23:31:24.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me for 3 days now. i can't see the messages i receive. and when i open the msg box, i can't close it, so in a champ select i can't modify my summoners spells as the chat box covers them.\nwhen i'm in game i don't have a problem sending/receiving a message.","replies":[]}]}
