It basically tells the opponent that you&#039;re going to play passively and it allows them to bully you out of lane due to their superior combat stats.\r\n\r\nHowever, Cull is pretty much the new avarice blade. There is nothing stopping you from completing your first item and then getting Cull to start farming for your next item. By that time, you&#039;ll have enough suitability and damage to quickly kill 100 minions. The additional 400 gold you get once you reach 100 minions is insane. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, Cull is a great mid game gold item rather than the early game farm item that Riot is trying to sell it as. So get to it boys!","replies":[{"poster":"Azyrion","date":"2016-03-01T10:45:55.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it decent on some ADCs as a first buy supplement.

Lets say mid game starts when u are already on 100-150 farm. YOu need to get to 200-250 minions to get your investment back. And in current speed of games, increased overall gold gain. By the time that happens u gonna be full build. Hell there is chance you gonna have to sell it before u use 100 stacks to get your last item.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2015-11-13T20:11:29.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not really good mid item because its not worth it. Basically u pay 450 gold, u earn 400 gold. Then u sell it for 180 gold so all u earned is 130 gold. Unlike Avarice Blade u cant upgrade it into anything. Difference between Doran and Cull is: u use them both for its stats, only Cull u get your money back , on dorans u dont.","replies":[]}]}
