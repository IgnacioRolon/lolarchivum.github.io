So how does that warrant that? LOL I have more accts but like thats pretty dumb rofl","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-17T22:24:07.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked over what was said in that game so that I could get some context on this. Even though I didn't see any racist comments, just glancing over the logs show some pretty hefty negative comments. Regardless of whether or not you're being racist, what you were saying wasn't exactly the shining example of good sportsmanship. In some cases, certain things can make you skip certain punishments as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ok whos smurfing","date":"2017-08-18T00:31:10.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand I just didnt think one game of back and forth with another player when a game is clearly over would result in skipping two punish steps. Seems a little much or am I just in the wrong here? lol Obviously yeah I should have just not said anything but does it really warrant skipping two steps? Even without context of the other player? I think its much imo but im open to criticism im here to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-18T03:29:21.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off: I'm glad you're so open to learning just what it was exactly that landed you with this ban. I don't really want to give out everything that was said over a public forum, personal information and all.

Thats like saying if a rapist rapes you well shit you tried to fight back so guess you go to jail as well!

Justifying his guilt or innocence is beyond you from the information provided. You attempted to compare two unrelated topics. One being verbal abuse by both participating players with one of the player intentionally griefing, and the other being sexual assault and self defense. To make a related comparison to the topic at hand, you could say that they could have been acting in self defense, however we do not know how he responded, thus we cannot make that claim. Griefing someone who is griefing is still an act of griefing, and should be equally punished. Likewise, sexual assault committed on one does not justify them to sexually assault another.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
