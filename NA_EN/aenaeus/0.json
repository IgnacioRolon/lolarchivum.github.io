Not going to go off again but simply put, wait until Runes because that will effect him A LOT. He is likely a tad overtuned for that vary reason and nerfing him now would be a waste of time and resources. He is also in a weird spot where he suddenly jumped like 5% playrate so people are all of a sudden needing to relearn the matchup along with his new weaknesses.

In fact looking at the wiki it's about the same as his Q.\nAnd I'm pretty certain one of the changes they made to him is summon lots of soldiers gives you a very big attackspeed bonus. So it's not actually too far fetch'd as azir to just summon soldiers at point blank instead of relying on Q to re-position\n\nBut I think what's really making him shine and pushing him up there is his E always gives a shield regardless of context which makes him much more safer since you can use it defensively to run away the same way riven does.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-10-18T13:29:31.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can have 4 Soldiers up if you just get a little bit of CDR, it's complete bonkers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2017-10-18T05:19:51.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by reposition his soliders for quite some time?\n\nAzir maxes Q first, and that puts it on a 5 second CD at level 9.

Then since he's a DPS mage, his lategame is just stupid. The range nerfs weren't enough to balance the amount of damage he does. The rework didn't solve anything, it just made his damage higher, he gets free attack speed, and now he gets an AP scaling shield for just pressing E. It's impossible to lose trades as him unless you're against someone named Kassadin. It's impossible to get outscaled unless you're against twitch. That's it. Two champions in the entire game \"counter\" him. Since he has so much more access to soldiers he's even safer than he was before as well. Having 1-2 soldiers was a tradeoff between doing more damage or being safe and was easier to avoid. Just balance him around that...\n\nHe has something to answer anything in the game. He has no shortage of mobility, damage, range, safety. Haven't even mentioned his ability to knock enemies out of position for a guaranteed gank. And don't say that takes crazy mechanics, because it really doesn't. Wanna win a teamfight?

He can also more safely place soldiers  directly in range of lane minions without having to spend 70 mana on a Q.\n-Azir gains a shield on E even when using it purely defensively.\n\nBattle mage?\n-Azir's long range playmaking shuffles decrease a full ~150 range along with his Q, unlike his panic shuffles.\n-Itemization is shifting from Nashor's + multiplicative stats to Morello's + flat penetration.\n\nI'd say the aggregate of Azir's scaling shield, huge AS buff on W, and Q clumping mechanic more than offsets his situational loss of ~150 range.\n\nHowever, I still think a large part of Azir's recent powerup has been due to the new builds that skip Nashor's and even go for flat penetration over Rylai's.  Imagine if Azir had been given love tap buffs that specifically allowed him to dip into the ubiquitous midlane Morello's+Sorc's build.  I wouldn't want this, but I think he'd probably be viable.
