Riot doesn't just ban people for having one game where they are frustrated and negative and bickering with teammates. They do so when it's a regular pattern of behavior; i.e., it happens a lot. If it's happening a lot, you need to step back and figure out why you're behaving the way you are, and come up with a plan to change that behavior.

It's up to each individual to listen to that message, and deal with it the best way they can. For some that means recognizing what they've done wrong, and changing their behavior accordingly. For others, that means recognizing that they can't,  or are unwilling to, behave by the guidelines they've been given, and choosing to walk away until they can or will do so.\n\nRiot isn't going to change the community on it's own.

It is inevitable that in a large society such as human society that there will be those who disagree with the widely held majority opinion.

But a lot of the time, society gives an appearance that would lead you to think it is the general opinion, when it's not. Think about Clinton v Trump. I think society as a whole had you thinking generally people preferred Hillary, yet Trump won. And even as president, it almost still seems to be the narrative that everyone hates Trump. When it comes to thoughts and opinions like that, I don't think you have enough data or knowledge to say \"society as a whole\", because you might get your information from sources that tend to lean towards one way or another. Yet, even though that is a very vocal minorty, you would still think it's the majority of people who think that way. You know what I mean? I've lost the original point anyways, and I don't feel like refreshing myself on the topic so I will concede. I just wanted to point that out. A lot of those with an opinion these days that can be easily misconstrued, just don't speak at all, over the fear of people taking it the wrong way and labelling the person as some sort of monster.\n\nOkay okay, I looked again. Deriving hate from a word. Yes a lot of social media would lead you to believe society as a whole would disagree and they would say you CAN derive hate from a word. Such as, f****t. Yet, in REAL LIFE, not that fake, social media, high horse shit that people get onto, I hear f****t being used all the time by people who claim to have no hatred towards gay people whatsoever. I hear gay people call eachother f****ts. Some just grew up saying it and they don't make the connection between the hateful ways it was used back in the day. They call their straight friends f****ts,  yet they would never say it to a gay person, because they don't actually want to hurt gay people. No one is gonna argue this on Facebook. So it really depends where you're getting your information.\n\nObviously, there are generally accepted ideas, but those can't be things like \"Deriving hate from a word\". It just cant. Generally accepted things would be like, no one wants to get punched in the face. You can't say anyone who says f****t, hates gay people. You can say, society as a whole says it's not okay to kidnap a child and murder them.  So if one gay man calls another gay man a ft, how can that be if society as a whole has decided that that word is purely a hateful word? Gay people hate gays? Or is it merely a silly word with a very negative history that some latch onto, while others do not? I don't think you can fairly say \"society as a whole\" in this situation.\n\nJust my opinion, and I understand if you disagree. I'm kind of skeptical of a lot that goes on in society these days and the way things are represented. Our sources of information can be VERY misleading and sort of meant as a way of telling you what to think, not what people actually do think.
