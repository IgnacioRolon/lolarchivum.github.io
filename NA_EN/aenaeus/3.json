This queue is such a joke, to where people literally don&#039;t take it serious by any forms of matter. It&#039;s only used for 3-5 man parties who are high as a kite, trying out stupid shit like Redemption Urgot and flame you for absolutely no reason. People don&#039;t care that it&#039;s a form of ranked queue, they just give me the &quot;It&#039;s flex&quot; when i&#039;m over here busting my ass trying to get my bonus rewards, for I&#039;ve already got gold in solo queue. The funny thing is, I&#039;m GAURENTEED to see this from at least one of my teammates every game, that&#039;s how frequent this bullshit comes up in my games. Flex is better off just getting removed from the face of the planet at this point, it&#039;s a legit joke, and is taken less seriously than blind pick.","replies":[]}
