He goes on to say hes played with me before and i was a trash feeder while i never got a chat restriction and rarely talk as it is because of such non sense, i reply with you the only person feeding here is you, he replies with /all THIS XAYAH IS TRASH, the people i crushed in lane come back with /all Yeah xayah is utter garbage i feel bad for you, it then turned into a 2 man flame on me with the laner i destroyed and my toxic feeding mid laner just harassing me non stop.So i know the course of action i should of taken was swallow the lose swallow the defeat mute all and hope i dont drop 40 lp.

Why would you even try to reason with him? Of course the other team called you trash too, it's a mind game, and you lost hard. You gotta recognize this shit, or else use the mute button. Mind games is an effective tactic in league of legends. Imagine if you just didn't respond and the ekko didn't get any attention so he just shuts up... that's how it usually goes.

If you fall for it, then you'll less likely focused on the match & more focused on what everyone is saying. I actually turned /Allchat off 2 seasons ago because of this & I've noticed I have improved greatly since then. Your best bet is to use the mute buttons given to you & switch all chat off. After that, it's a matter of finding a champion you're good at & just focusing on the task at hand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-21T20:35:37.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoever feeds hardest cries loudest, no exceptions.\n\nThey think blaming someone else will shift eyes off their own worthlessness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2017-06-21T19:53:29.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"cuz i can","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-06-21T20:39:28.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MyBackFlipFailed,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=t6BBTW8p,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-21T19:53:29.377+0000)\n>\n> cuz i can\n\nReally?

But OP followed up with \"if you warded and used the map then you wouldn't ~~of ~~ have died\" (sorry I had to correct that XD). I think that clearly demonstrated his intention was to provide advice to help rather than being passive aggressive. Perhaps he could have phrased it even better, but Ekko still could have taken it any way he wanted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2017-06-28T17:40:39.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"down voted\n>:3","replies":[]}]}
