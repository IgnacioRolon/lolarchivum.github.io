My advice if you want to learn him is to one trick him for a while to get a feel for his ability ranges and different matchups, that's how I learned to play him half decently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-08-08T07:26:15.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On gold i rarely see it, but when i do, then he is some serious threat to deal with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crispy0Snake","date":"2019-08-08T06:43:15.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's really good, the potential the champion has in the right hands is really amazing\n\nSo the first thing is to read his kit in depth: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Aatrox\n\nHe's had a lot of changes recently so it's good to refresh your knowledge on what his ult does, how much damage he should do etc.\n\nThink intuitively about how you should build and play him (Trinity and Grasp? Black Cleaver and Fleet Footwork? Deaths Dance and Conqueror?), then compare how you play the champion to how pro players play the champion (they will play vs very good opponents that are amazing at the champions they play too so it won't be anything like a low elo lane/game, but you can learn how to cs as him in a bad matchup, how to pressure and punish mistakes in good matchups etc.)\n\nAlso watch lots of videos on wave management, (SoloRenektonOnly has a host of videos that are really old but still relevant) look at what items are good on him at Lolalytics, watch a few guides on youtube and see if you can learn some stuff\n\nAnd lastly a lot of practice\n\nAlso don't build all that AD and not auto!","replies":[]},{"poster":"enshine","date":"2019-08-08T05:42:27.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes\n\nland your abilities\n\nreset autos with e","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-08-08T05:41:17.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Statistically?
