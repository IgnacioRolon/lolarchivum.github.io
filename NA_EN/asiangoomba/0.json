It just Happened to me too just minutes ago i was on champion select in flex and then after all people selected it was my time to select a champion i select jarvan and tried to lock in but the button was grey like i lost the connection or something then at 0 countdown it tells me that it tries to reconect me in the client! then i open the browser to see if i have or not internet and the internet was fine!! and the cliend was freeze in the tried to reconect like i dident have conection at all so i did exit instead and then i login again and tried to make a flex lobby and it said that something unexpected happened while trying to create your lobby!!! and then after that it finaly was fine and got in a game... but the problem is that i lost LP cuz it was like i dodge that game and i was waiting then 5 minutes!!!! I dont want to complain but please at least you as riot dont talk like it was nothing cuz you had litle info or reports about it.... many people dont even bother to tell you that some things on the client or server are buggy or even bugged cuz they think of you and trust you that you will fix it so trust your community when someone actualy reports something!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AFK Farm Warwick","date":"2017-06-30T06:50:06.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had this problem, and it finally worked after I tried making a 3v3 game, but maybe the problem fixed itself. {{champion:19}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"G1v3MEch4ll3n63r","date":"2017-06-02T10:16:38.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem. I tried to initiate a full repair of the Client and it still dont work. But if i log into my main account everything works just fine.

Make a new account. Log into the new account, while you are logged in copy the content of the PersistedSettings.json file. Log into the account with the problem and while you are logged in delete the content of the PresistedSettings.json file and paste in the content from the new account. Save it and put it on read-only. Log off and log back in and it should work. You find the PersistedSettings.json file when you klick on Riot Games ->LOL->Config. I hope this helps you to solve the problem.","replies":[]}]}
