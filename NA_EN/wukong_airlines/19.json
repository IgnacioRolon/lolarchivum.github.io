The BE system is a total win for everyone, putting aside the fact that you dont have to buy anymore runes, you can now save to get your champions only,  and please, don&#039;t give me those calculations on how long it takes to get all champs, you NEVER had them all to begin with,  now you just wanna use that as an excuse to make the system look like failure?\r\n\r\nand is it becoming a trend to cry about AD assassins now?  just because your AP assassin is poorly designed/reworked, doesn&#039;t mean you HAVE to blame the AD assassins for doing their JOB {{champion:141}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} .\r\n\r\nHave you stopped for a sec and thought about it the fact that you&#039;re squishy that could be easily burst down? have you seen one of the latter AD assassins 1shot a tank? You wanna QQ about AP assassins , do it in a different thread and pointout why and how to fix them, just DONT try to bring any champs of equal class and compare that to them and try to TRASH them to balance the equation!","replies":[{"poster":"Yago","date":"2017-11-16T18:57:58.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My frustration with AD assassins has been the same for years.

If you want to count the health then you have to add the plethora of AP item with HP to the list.\n* {{item:3026}} does not provide any MR. It does protect you, but so does {{item:3102}} which is handy against an assassins burst combo.\n\nI'm not saying hex isn't too strong for a component item or that AP items feel bad (especially on AP assassins) or that there shouldn't be another AP armor option, but ADs do not have a ton of options to deal with AP champs. It would be cool if orb could change its damage blocking type.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2017-11-16T19:16:24.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People were complaining about AD assassins before the the rune rework hit live tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-11-16T18:32:06.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(insert whatever here) aren't/isn't top dog now, gotta complain about something else. - LoL boards community","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2017-11-16T18:31:31.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you follow the chain of complaints back far enough you'll see just about everything being overpowered or underpowered or even sometimes both at the same time.
