If this new \"superlanguage\" is the only langauge that matters in international affairs, I can see it becoming the primary language worldwide. Our language and dialects are part of our culture, no matter where you are in the world. This might homogenize our world, which I dont know if is a good thing or not. \n\nOn the other hand, I can also see it being strictly used for international affairs and nothing else. Then IA would be a separate kind of discussion for only the few educated elite - I would no longer be able to understand what the leaders from my own country are saying, and would have to rely on a translator. When I hear an English-speaker speak on an international level, its a lot easier to get their message when listening to them directly. \n______________\n\nThe problem is that Language isnt like math. Even in the same language you get adaptions, changes to dialect, changes to pronunciation, and changes to meaning. Language is first and foremost a method of communication - as long as the message is understood by others, the language \"works\". But because of that, Language is fluid. When languages first developed, do you think they had all these arbitrary rules? Of course not. but over time, the languages adapt, whether it was to incorporate a region and therefore create a new dialect, to borrow a new word from another language, or sometimes just because it sounds good. \n\nEven if you attempt to create a formal language with no arbitrary rules, overlapping words, or anything else, it wont stay that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-03-21T04:18:18.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The world is already homogenizing due to technology - media, transportation, communication, etc. The discussion that needs to happen is: Is homogenization a bad thing? Would losing parts of cultures really be that bad for humanity? Would it be worth it for the entire human race to be unified in a single, global culture?\n\nIf you think about it, despite the idealism of preserving cultural identities and keeping traditions alive, most of the major conflicts of the world throughout history have been between - and largely due to - different cultures. Just look at the huge conflict between ISIS and Western civilization right now. \n\nLanguage unifies - but it also separates. Ancient Rome referred to the Germanic tribes and others as \"barbarians\" and looked on them with contempt simply because they did not speak Latin. That was actually the root of the term \"barbarian\", coming from \"bar-bar\", the equivalent of today's \"blah-blah-blah\" - referring to the way their language sounded to the Romans. One of the issues with illegal Hispanic immigration in the US is the language barrier and the fact that many immigrants don't learn English. It limits their options and their ability to contribute to society and so paints a negative picture for native English speakers.\n\nA common language certainly won't solve everything, but it's a step in the right direction. And it certainly won't stay the same forever, but it would be more stable than the languages we have now. We can see even now that languages are far more stable than in the past, where the language could change slightly even from one village to the next (despite being one \"unified\" nation, Spain actually has 3 separate languages). With a governing body to regulate a new language, it would stay stable for a very long time, especially with regards to its structure and grammar.\n\nAnd don't forget - there has never been a language that was \"created\" by a group of people who set out with the intent to do so. All languages have gradually evolved from other languages through dialects and vernacular in particular areas. All of them inherited inconsistencies and arbitrariness from at least one, and often many (looking at you, English), other languages. \n\nA language that was crafted by a group of specialists with the intention to last indefinitely and fulfill all of our communication needs could endure for a very, very long time.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-03-22T03:04:37.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, youre right - the world is homogenizing.

Culture is unique and underappreciated. People in America, especially those of African-American descent, seem to put a lot of emphasis on culture and their lack thereof. Whether its really that important? I dont know. \n\nI appreciate your thoughts that a single created language can endure. I actually think it might be possible - when \"separate\" languages like C++ exist in the programming world, they seem to endure. Of course, a spoken word is a lot more complex, but in theory it can happen. Whether or not it will endure? I guess you can only tell by doing it, because youre venturing into a new territory.
