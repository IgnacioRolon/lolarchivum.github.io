It&#039;s not the game being {unbalanced}, sooner or later you end up toning/slightly fixing what&#039;s broken, it&#039;s the fact that you INTENTIONALLY deliver unbalanced and toxic changes to the game, you take no feedback from people, you don&#039;t take advantage of the PBE to secure a healthy gameplay experience on live servers, and you always disrespectfully apologize to the community after doing everything above on purpose.\n\nYou know what I find funny? You always {wonder} what went wrong and always  feel (proud) and (professional) when you fix something that could be avoided at first place.\n\nI&#039;m giving this game 3 years. GL.","replies":[]}
