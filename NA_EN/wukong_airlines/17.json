Although old E blink's you behind your target so often times it didn't matter, and it slowed so regardless ult would always hit the enemy. I take that back then, the only way one could argue he is faster at killing or equal is if he is able to Q in melee for the bonus damage. Otherwise, he cannot execute his entire combo as quickly.

If you are in range to Q when you throw out W, then the combo basically starts when your dash starts, and end when your dash ends. When Talon lands from his Q, he'll automatically try to autoattack hella fast, and so the passive proc happens literally in the blink of an eye. We Talon mains call it the flower combo, and there's no bullshit about waiting for the second W to come back or anything. It is every bit as fast as old Talon's comboing, shorter in terms of engage range and lacking in AoE for sure, but it's still pretty quick.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-04-23T12:40:45.861+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{champion:55}} was the only assassin rework that actually made the champ better","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-04-24T09:44:47.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Who Fed Ru,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QmhdE8M9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-23T12:40:45.861+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:55}} was the only assassin rework that actually made the champ better\n\nThe rework made {{champion:55}} for viable in exchange for her almost completely losing identity as the Reset Queen as well as her overall fluidity (she's very clunky now) and she became a lot less exciting to play due to delays.\n\nKatarina was certainly made more viable, but after the slew of nerfs she's received she's back to where she was pre rework, a mid tier situational champion. What was the point of reworking her to have a better laning if you're just going to gut her laning? What's the point of reworking her to have more mobility if you're just going to nerf that?\n\nSo I have to disagree when you say it made her \"better\". It made her a lot more viable and selectively fun to play, but it also made her a clunky balance nightmare that can never see the light of day unless Riot wants her to go back to having a 54%+ winrate and a 10%+ pickrate.\n\nAs for the braindead argument I can debunk that. Kat's daggers are conceptually easier to understand than Kat's old kit. Anyone could pick up old Kat, but not everyone understood her kit. Sure, it's similar with the current Kat, but when you get 2-4 Shunpo resets it's a whole lot more forgiving than only having one Shunpo to work with.\nAlso she could never braindead 1v5 the enemy team, that's just a myth :3\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Note:** Katarina main of 8 years btw.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2018-04-23T13:37:01.702+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"1/4. {{champion:7}} \n{{champion:107}} kept his new empowered W and new W healing, he kept his new passive “hunting each champion” interaction, he still has 4 stacks instead of five, his stacks still fall off when out of combat unlike before, and his Ult still has eyes on whoever he’s closest to unlike before.

Meanwhile talon needs to hit abilities and use auto attack to proceed passive his highest source of DMG. People are so often able to flash that auto. Plus hit abilities still don't deal even half the DMG rengar does with his Q and empowered q that is an auto. I wonder why some assassins are allowed for so easy assassination and some others needs to be in a gutter and useless. Rengar and khazix are the only assassins able to somehow kill ADC without him getting saved fast enough with shields from support. Which is a good thing. Thanks God something counters shields a bit. But it is still uneahlthy and wither make all assassins like that or better make them all in line and nerf shielding.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2018-04-23T19:36:19.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you don't even play the game so why are you talking, anyways theres more counterplay to the Q now with ninja tabis","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-04-23T21:34:14.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do play the game.
