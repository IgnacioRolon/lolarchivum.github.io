Yasuo its a failure of a champion (like Zoe and Kalista) . And they did not do nothing to making him fit in the game in a balanced state. They did a very incompetent job on Yasuo.\n\nYasuo was added in 2013 and they did not bothered on making any champion modification. Even if it helps Yasuo players and opponents alike.\n\nI look at his [Patch History](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Yasuo/History) and all i see is \"BUG FIX\" + \"stat increase\", this don't mean the champion is strong, it just means the champion have problems... it's shameful.\n\nRiot behaves like a big Yasuo funboy, so that ends up explaining a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-08-08T21:52:41.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah lets completely forget what people were saying two weeks ago.
