The blue buff has negative MR as standard, as an example.\n\nAlso while Void Staff regularly reduces less _numerically_, that's because MR is a little harder to stack to good effect than armour (due to the ADC _existing_, you pretty much always need some form of armour if you're building tanky).\nIt's still an increase in damage to _everyone_.
