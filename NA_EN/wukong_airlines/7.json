Wu ***is*** dog shit early. The only time you win trades early (outside some specific matchups) is if the enemy doesn't know how to play against Wu and let's Wu cheese them. To be fair this happens quite a bit because of Wu's low playrate, but that doesn't change the fact that if played correctly, Wu loses trades. Teemo especially. If it's a bad Teemo he'll lose very hard very quickly. Any decent Teemo is going to either save his blind for when you dash and ruin your whole combo or just simply follow you through your stealth and get 3-4 autos on you on the way out. So you kind of have to judge your lane opponent.\n\nThat's what most people don't get about playing against Wu. They get scared after he drops his E>AA>Q combo and pops W and run back. What you should be doing is following him through the stealth and returning the trade now that he's blown his load. Also worth noting that Wu has absolutely no sustain so an even trade is actually a winning trade for the majority of top laners.","replies":[{"poster":"1eone1","date":"2017-12-27T02:26:08.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"i think youre just a bad wu then im sorry for your time wasted and you still dont know how to play him.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-12-27T03:13:58.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guy who doesnt play Wukong at all attempts to tell me he knows more about Wukong.
