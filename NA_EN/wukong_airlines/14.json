He literally stuns himself in place unable to move giving the enemy enough time to react since he can't reposition himself.\n\nPeople seem to be misinformed as to why he is being picked in the lcs. It isn't just because of his ultimate. It isn't just because of his passive change.\n\nNor is it just because of those damn voidlings. The entire rework made it so he just functions better as a support. You are literally wasting his potential now by going malzahar mid. \n\nHis damage was severely nerfed across the board, voidlings are easy to kill now with just 2 autos, and they even instadie from aoe. He doesn't lose effectiveness because he doesn't have to commit or put himself in as much danger anymore thanks to voidlings for the low cost of 40 mana lol.\n\nWhile also being safer doing it to thanks to void shift.

Riot reworked him in complete ignorance of his playstyle (lmao @ ''he is a flash assassin'' I have never heard anything more ignorant of Malz in my life) with no intent other that change for the sake of fucking change, and now Malz is one of the most nerfed champions EVER because his reworked kit actually managed to increase everything that it was supposed to diminish, and increased his weakness to QSS, while making him be what Riot pretended he actually was.\n\nThe rework:\n\n- Lowered his skillfloor massively. Faster Q, lower mana costs, actually non-interactive, izi farm lane (which pre-rework wasnt posible without early AP rush and/or at rank 4 E), decreased his need for positionement exponentially and his sustain weakness with the same change, the shield.\n\n- Took away damage, and what was left, was put in a completly non-interactive spell, that also had way more effective range that .

That's like saying you can't use the standard maneuvers to perform an attack. Annie Flash Ult's all the time. Tell you what, disable everyone's AA and spell casting for 1 second after a flash, and I am ok with it. Otherwise, the idea is very one sided and picks only on Malzahar. \nMy recommendation is to leave the flash mechanic alone._\n\n\n**The real fix for Malzahar is a 3 step approach:**\n\nChange his W so that it casts a Pre-Rework Null Zone. From the Center of the Null Zone, ONE voidling spawns with frenzy potential and HP.  This voidling ONLY multiplies for Jg Camps and Monsters (NOT Champions).   THIS change addressed the concerns that the support lanes have with too many voidlings. And it allows Malzahar to Jg again.  It brings back the damage that was taken away by bringing back the null zone.\n\nChange E:   to add \"True Vision\" to anything affected by Malefic Visions.  (Which makes sense, and addresses the problem where an enemy champ afflicted with visions can run into a bush and the voidlings become suddenly stupid).\n\nR: Nether Grasp, IF it is interrupted by anything (CC, QSS etc), the suppress converts to a slow for the duration of the ult.  This allows Malzahar to at least have SOME CC on his ult target, and not lose all the damage when he gets interrupted. (Which is the single most important reason why he does not see Pro-play).\n\nLastly, Change his passive so that the cc block is back to 0.5sec.","replies":[]}]}
