No S of any form, No chests","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just curious how individual champion rankings work for support.\r\nI find myself getting final scores, like 0/3/21 with Soraka or 3/2/25 with Braum for example, and receiving no S of any form. Not even a minus.\r\nAnd therefore no chest. No reward.\r\n\r\nI am a Support main, but am finding myself asking \"Why? There is literally no reward for good performance.\"\r\nMain Supports are fewer in number than any other type of player, followed by Top and ADC.\r\n\r\nAre Chest Rewards for kills? If so, how does that help Supports? - We get harassed for most kills outside of teamfights.\r\nAm I just not performing well enough to earn them?\r\n\r\nI am lucky IF I get ONE PER WEEK!\r\nWhat is going on?

Keep at it!\n\nI plan to.\n\nYet, I have to disagree against weighting.\nIf my performance is compared to other players of that same champ in that same role - I am competing against the most specialized players in the smallest player pool that play this game.\nWith that in mind, it seems the game does not encourage diversity of champions but specialization instead because the reward for diversity is harder to achieve.\n\nThis means Support Mains can't really diversify until higher elo or must trudge slowly through various champs with no hope of getting higher elo in what is already a very slow climb - this hurts team a picks, even when looking at champs with similar kits that may be more useful than one's you have ranks in.\n\nI will keep at it. But to say it's not weighted is a fallacy. Supports are weighted against each other in this system, and it seems not encouraged to diversify.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-01-14T02:27:44.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr\nyou're bad :^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragnDave","date":"2017-01-16T16:45:20.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a way it's more difficult to get an S on certain supports just because of how they are.

At least on my mains, that is. Though I DID just get an S- on Janna that I haven't touched in... ages, going 1/6/30.\n\nQuestion is, have you already gotten an S on Soraka? An S on Braum? You can only unlock a chest on a champ once per season. If you've already gotten a chest on Soraka, you can't get one again for the rest of the season. Also, you can only get key fragments for wins (no matter what grade).","replies":[]}]}
