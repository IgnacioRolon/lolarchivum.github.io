In order to view this, I have to go into the Legacy Client and view the match history from there.\n\nWhat's the new acceptable way to get Summoner XP Earned stats?\n\n**UPDATE:** I have created this follow-up post in the \"Client Discussion\" board: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/a6j9vAE9-no-way-to-view-summoner-xp-earned","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-07T21:13:20.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, so some features or info may not be available yet.
