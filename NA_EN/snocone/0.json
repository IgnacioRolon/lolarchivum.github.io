At least if I have it answered now I'll know for future reference. I was playing a clearly winning game on my side and my internet connection dropped. So instead of being awarded my 20 something lp i dropped 15. I had no reason to leave. I was forced to by random badly timed internet outage. Thanks for any help or info you can give me.\n\n\nIf nothing else I feel like you should be able to challenge games in which you leave maybe? Then again people would probably abuse that","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T05:35:29.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you contact your ISP already? I'd reach out and ask if this was an outage on their network so you can confirm whether this issue was local to only your home or if it was a network-wide sorta thing. If it wasn't an issue with your ISP's network, then there may be something up with your modem/router. If this is the case, then you can pull the power plug from your modem/routing for 60 seconds, then plug it back in to complete a quick reset.\n\nLet me know if you run into further issues with your connection.","replies":[]}]}
