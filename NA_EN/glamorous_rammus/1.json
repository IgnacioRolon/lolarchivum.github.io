Once the bots have minion coverage, they hyper-extend, spam all of their abilities at once, then grind the enemy team with auto attacks until they die.\r\n\r\nI understand that bots may be used so low level players aren&#039;t waiting 10 minutes for a game; however, ARAM is PvP and keeps track of wins/losses, etc. If I&#039;m playing a match where 3 of my allies are bots then loss becomes fairly inevitable. \r\n\r\nI want to also note that the bots I&#039;m finding in ARAM might not be Riot bots, as they aren&#039;t immediately loaded in (Riot bots are immediately loaded up). \r\n\r\nI&#039;m starting to grow suspicious that players are creating Smurf bot accounts in order to take advantage of the new Honor system. \r\n\r\nAnyways- this has been my rant about bots in PvP. I hope something can be done about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-07-12T01:40:00.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are farming bots that are used to autonomously level up accounts that can then be sold.
