I wasn't aware I even lost my Honor Progress. I don't have any reports telling me what I did to lose Honor. I don't have anything to track my Honor progress. It's just log in and get notified that my Honor keeps getting reset.\r\n\r\nWhat was I reprimanded for? I'm playing this game, being respectful, being positive, having fun with other players.. and I can't gain Honor because a secret system gets away with punishing players without any explanation. \r\n\r\nThe whole Honor System just tilts me. I don't think we should lose/gain Honor that has no clear measurement. It's pretty much a scam at this point. We have to take Riot's word for it that the Honor System is judged fairly. We play nothing but good games, keep the peace, and don't know what's going on with our Honor until we get a message for the 253rd time saying our Honor was \"RESTORED\" to Level 1. \r\n\r\nI'm not doing anything wrong. And if I was then Riot should be informing me what is making me lose Honor. But they don't tell us. They don't show us anything about Honor Progress.\r\n\r\nI read it was because Riot doesn't want people \"grinding\" Honor. \r\nUmmm... you DON'T WANT people TRYING to be kind? Then why have an Honor System? People are more likely to keep a level head when they see what they have to lose. \r\nAnd like me, I'm sure other people are also tilted and put into a negative state of mind when reading that our rewards keep getting taken away without any warning our justification.\r\n\r\nObviously- TRACKING HONOR PROGRESS IS BENEFICIAL.\r\nPeople don't take Honor seriously. \r\nIt doesn't even exist for most of us because it keeps getting reset to lvl 0 without ANY warning or notification. It's a clever ruse. And you can't expect these players to behave for rewards that are nothing more than an empty promise.\r\nGive us a progress bar, show us the REALITY of an Honor Level- and people will **GRIND** kindness. Isn't that what we want? A **LESS** toxic community? The toxicity has been worse since the New Honor System. So to me, it needs to be fixed.","replies":[]}
