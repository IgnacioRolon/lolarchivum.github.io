Every support provides pressure in a different manner, I don't care if this is a late response it's just what you're typing is very wrong. The main role of support is to apply pressure, deny CS, and help the ADC scale out of the early game. Anyone who thinks otherwise just hasn't played the role enough. Even in DOTA most supports dont even have heals or shields, they just have opressive damage oriented kits made for the early game similar to Brand, Zyra, and even now Pyke.","replies":[{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-11-26T18:05:03.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nope.

Lower ranks arent good players if they try to actively climb and can only achieve a low rank, this isnt offensive it is fact. The ranked ladder is skill based. How do you not understand that. And I'll admit my other comment I replied to TheBannaKings with was offensive, and it got removed I definitely didnt receive \"punishment\"... Didnt even get a warning... It got removed for giving you the opportunity to pick a fight rather than just dropping it civilly, which honestly I don't know why I haven't done yet you're clearly trolling so Im just gonna be careful what I say. I wish that was a reportable offense but its so hard to prove because sadly some people genuinely hold the views you allegedly have. Ironically those with those views actually are lower on the ladder and probably because they take advice from the lower part of the ladder... something you should never do if you wanna climb.\n\nIll be as respectful as possible with this part of my comment just in case you arent trolling: If you are serious. Take a deep breathe and reread what youre saying. You are saying the people in the top 100%-90% of players are equally as knowledgeable and skilled as the top 1% of the ladder.

Anyway, I am not ignorant in the slightest.\n> \n> Meanwhile Pyke snowballs while the ADC does little to nothing thanks to that. \"Giving gold\" does barely anything. He should not be getting kills because SUPPORTS ARE NOT MEANT TO KILL. PERIOD.\n\nWhat? Kills give gold, and when Pyke ults he gets +1 to his KDA but also gives the ADC the same gold value. How does the ADC having a little +1 being added to the top right of their screen actually affect gameplay??? He gives gold, it is as if he and the ADC both get the kill, if you think that is bad you are just deluding the argument to your side. Its ok if he gets the kill with ult, it snowballs the early which is the job of a support to get the ADC through the early and scale. If a Pyke takes a kill early without his ult that is his bad or he had to have taken it. Supports jobs are to apply pressure to the lane through any mean and to have early game power which supports like Pyke, Blitz, and Thresh and ESPECIALLY Nautilus (Naut being top tier atm) all do with kill threat from hooks. In response to this all you've said is that Pyke giving him and his ADC both the gold value of a kill is bad because he gets +1 to his KDA and the ADC doesn't despite still having the same impact if the ADC got +1 to the KDA.\n\nAlso Im not trying to be an ass about it or disrespectful but a person's ranked is like their credentials when discussing something like this. For example would you believe an iron top laner or a challenger support when discussing supports? Higher ranked players are just logically higher rank for a reason because they have a deeper understanding of the roles, items, and champions. If you dont understand that and only say \"stop elo shaming\" when someone mentions rank then I dont know what to say to that, its just credentials, people who played in higher ranks just have more experience, its not offensive in any way whatsoever. Its like saying its offensive to mention a black belt is more experienced than a white belt.","replies":[{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-12-04T21:24:32.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everytime I fucking played ADC with a Pyke, I fell behind in the game while he snowballed out of control even with the \"gold\" he gives.

If you dont even say what ELO you are in your games with a Pyke dont matter especially when he is now listed as D tier support with a horrible winrate. High ELO games are just a more reliable sourcing for whats META, I am just baffled by what youre saying. People in lower elo usually complain about stuff being broken all the time and youre whining how about Pyke because he gives kill pressure like literally all supports do, its not offensive to say people in lower ELO have a weaker understanding of the game. They are lower ranks for a reason and people look at probuilds and sites like U.GG and OP.GG and twitch streams for a reason, they all are info from high ELO.\n\nLike god, you are unironically saying Pyke is a ksing and not real support because you had a bad Pyke support in your game.","replies":[{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-12-05T13:34:15.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes it is offensive because not all people in a lower rank have lower understanding. \n\nAnd yes, Pyke is not a real support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-08-27T14:48:23.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=overpoweredscrub,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mz1W0nM3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-26T18:20:23.588+0000)\n>\n> What pyke supporters say. \"Cause you know...

However, the answer is no since there are no other AD assassin supports. \n\nWhile him innately being an assassin is hard to deal with, DB does make it worse. I'd still say that the most frustrating thing with Pyke is his sustain. His W makes him very hard to deal with as you would normally deal with an assassin whether that be poke or CC Pyke can deal with both while still putting out midlaner level damage. \n\nI would say though that Pyke is not nearly as broken as frustrating. Players feel cheated when they land everything and he E's away and W's for 80% of his HP back. While this is annoying a losing team can never rely on Pyke to get them back into it as he'll certainly die in an instant if he jumps in first, and never get a reset if the 4 cannot deal enough damage.","replies":[]}]}
