I can see the squares where you can click and choose the color but I am unable to actually select any other than the normal skin. I tried again in a custom game and the same thing happened again? Is there a fix to this? I feel that I just wasted RP on a skin that doesn&#039;t work for me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T19:17:22.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DeadlyNinjaDrew - \n\nI'm not able to reproduce this. (I use the Nami chroma pack, and don't have an issues with it). Would you be able to grab me a screenshot of what you're seeing in champion select?","replies":[]}]}
