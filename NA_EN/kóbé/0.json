I believe you may have the Alpha Client confused with the PBE, which is a *different system entirely*.  The Alpha Client is for the live server you use (NA) and allows you to log in with your regular account and test the new client that will eventually replace the current one. The PBE is a test environment where you create a new account and try out balance changes or new champs before they're released on the live servers.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rularula","date":"2016-11-08T12:45:23.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ME TOO ~","replies":[]}]}
