I expected to find these in my loot, but there's nothing there. There were some popups with the images of the chest that I x'd through - did this delete them rather than put them somewhere to be collected later?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T05:19:10.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would have been automatically added into your collection, but it's going to be a little hard to figure out which ones are new just by looking there.
