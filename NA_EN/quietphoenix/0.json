Any other ideas or other information I could provide?\nSee also my above response to outcast5","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-21T17:17:38.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry the issue is still persisting here.  :(  I've created a ticket for you so our tech team can help you out.

After switching back to allowing the client to close during a game, it pops back up at game end. So keeping the game client open reduces the impact, or perhaps eliminates - I don't get the pop-up on login. Perhaps it's a bug in the code that allows the game client to close and then re-open on game end?","replies":[]}]}]}
