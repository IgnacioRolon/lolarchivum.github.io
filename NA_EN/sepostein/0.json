When I play it, the left clicker from my mousepad isn't immediately responding. I have to wait a little bit for my attack work. It used to work instantly. And I checked, it's not the problem with my mouse itself, it works instantly when I'm on other things. Can somebody help me out? It making my game more difficult to play than the assholes that bully me for how much I suck at the game. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T02:31:42.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't be having people bully you just because you're having a few tech issues!! I want to first point out, if they're bothering you too much make sure to use the after game report feature and send them our way to deal with ;)!\n\nAs for your weird left clicker, it kind of sounds like the input is going through fine, but for some reason, it's taking forever to reach our servers and get back to you which is why it seems like seconds go by before the champ reacts to your clicks. I want to check really quick for packet loss to rule that out first, so grab your recent game logs and toss them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Grab a screenshot of what it says (using Gyazo or Imgur etc) and post it here so I can see what we're dealing with!","replies":[{"poster":"Sepostein","date":"2017-05-07T21:27:56.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, how do I see my game logs?

You should be able to find your game logs at C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Network Logs if you installed League to the default Windows location. Make sure to put your most recent game logs in there that had the problems.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
