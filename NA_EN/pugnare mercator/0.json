GG","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Riot, best service ever.\r\nI get banned, cause i team up with 4Man premades trolling, 3 man premade trolling and 4man premade trolling again.\r\nSo i know i flamed a lot in the paste, but then i quitted it, but riot sees &#039;please stop with feeding, stay under turret and farm so you don&#039;t feed him more :) and i&#039;ll carry you&#039; as flame? And then ofcourse i get reported by all the premades. So, they go 1V5 as a support, go randomly turret dive at 100 health, stealing jungle camps, flaming me for not diving when i&#039;m out of mana etc.\r\n\r\nSo ofcourse, like always, the 4man trolls don&#039;t get a ban, but ofcourse the guy that does nothing gets banned. If you can&#039;t say things like stay under turret so you stop with feeding, or wtf, or why did you start baron without smite when they are close to you?\r\n\r\n14 day ban, next time that i &#039;flame&#039; i get perma banned. GG riot. Best service ever, \r\nWell like i can ask for an unban like most people, but it won&#039;t work for sure :p\r\nLet the hate in the comments begin","replies":[{"poster":"Athina","date":"2016-06-26T14:59:50.406+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I seriously doubt you were punished for \"nothing\".

Its as if they think we are all stupid (both the community and Riot) it just gets sad when you read post like this because people actually think like this.\n\nYou obviously dont understand how the report system works. If you truly did nothing wrong you wouldnt have gotten punish. If you were punished for toxic behavior then they give you a lot of evidence for you with the chatlogs. Something (if that is why you were punished) you refuse to show us which already puts a red flag for us because it seems like you are trying to hide something.\nHonestly i dont get why people always feel the need to lie. You wont get anywhere by lying, especially when dealing with a company who has a lot of resources to work against you. All in all just show us the truth. Give us the chatlogs (not tampered with) so we have a clear understanding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AraMoOse","date":"2016-06-26T17:20:53.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Since you're admitting that you have flamed, I don't know why you're assuming the games you were banned for were the ones you didn't flame in.\n2.

You told off a couple anons online that in all likelihood you'll never interact with again, and now can't play the game for 14 days, can't loot hextech for much longer than that, and can't step a toe out of line for fear of even greater punishment down the line. That's worth it to you? Flexing your e-peen to four strangers? Really?\n\nBe an adult next time.

Vice Versa. So you have no idea if they were punished or not, do to confidentially.\n2. Every Report is flag for Review. If you don't report, then riot can't do anything. \n3. Judging by this entire post, you deserve your punishment. You are clearly toxic. \n4. Dealing with toxic premades is so easy man. When you press tab, you have a nice pretty little mute button.
