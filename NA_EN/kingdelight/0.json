That's how it has always been. But yeah, I kind of agree. Add a black cleaver and that's 30% so 55% armor shred. They likely want to see people building crit on garen. His spin attack can crit and everybody just builds tank and exclusively tank. I haven't seen or on garen except for in one of my normals where someone went full ad garen. I used to build tri force if i got fed until they removed the crit chance. Now I build or if super fed. I do think that this paired with black cleaver would be stupid.  Also I don't see him as much as I used to.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-12-24T23:04:59.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dirtydan5678,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wBpH75kj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-24T06:32:30.002+0000)\n>\n> All you do is spin to win.

He is \"tanky\" but only with items. I think they gave the armor shred so he could afford to stop getting a BC every game and swap it for some crit, THE most unused stat in his kit. Also, Protobelt on him is disgusting. Not for the AP, but for the active alone. And it having a nice amount of health it gives, it does not hurt him too hard item wise if he gets it. Plus you get the much needed gap closer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZED G0D","date":"2016-12-24T06:33:11.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, I just played a garen, as teemo...Not gonna go into detail of his laning experience but he had 11 CS @ 15min in. he ended up ragequitting lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buzhidog","date":"2016-12-24T09:37:18.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually its only because of his new skin.\n\n{{champion:268}}  *cries*","replies":[]}]}
