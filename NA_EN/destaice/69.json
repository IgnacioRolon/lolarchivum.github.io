If I wanted to queue for more than one it wouldn&#039;t be a problem. If I don&#039;t then I&#039;m screwed. I want jungle. I don&#039;t want to mid lane, or bot lane, or top lane. I just want to jungle. It&#039;s what I feel I&#039;m best at.\n\nPicking fill/support as my secondary role is going to give me support as my role the majority of the time.\n\nPicking one of the more sought after lanes as my secondary puts me at risk of actually getting those lanes when I&#039;m not as good at them.\n\nWhy can&#039;t I just queue for jungle when I want to jungle? Then queue for both jungle and support when I&#039;m feeling like either. It just doesn&#039;t make any sense to force two roles to be picked.\n\nI&#039;m sure people who are mid and top lane mains feel the same way. Unless you queue for both mid/top you&#039;re going to get your secondary role the majority of the time as that tends to be less contested. And you probably didn&#039;t want that role as you wanted to be at your ideal carry lane.\n\nEither bring back team builder as an option or let us queue with only one role selected.  I don&#039;t really care if it means I have to wait longer I just want the role I&#039;m after.","replies":[]}
