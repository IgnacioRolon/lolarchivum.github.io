Pros and Cons.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note the following list is based off opinions. Feel free to disagree.\n\nPros;\nClass identity. Blizzard has put a lot of focus into what each class is and has made changes to make the feel of playing this class better and more unique.\n\nSpec identity. Focus into making each spec feel unique and strong in their own ways.\n\nDungeon changes. Dungeons will have infinite scaling via a new system to help keep them relevant throughout the entire expansion. As well as there being a plan for a super dungeon. (Like the ICC 5 mans).\n\nRaiding. There will be more than 3 raids the entire expansion.\n\nWorld Bosses/Rares. World bosses will be taking over the spot rares used to have. There will be a plethora of them scattered throughout the world that will require a team to take down.\n\nScaling leveling zones. Zones will scale to your level. Keeping the content within that zone relevant to your current level.\n\nProfessions. Professions are being updated to have mini factions as long as having stories with them. (I know right?).\n\nWorld invasions. Actually making previous content areas relevant to the game again.\n\nLess orcs.\n\nCons;\nSpecial Snowflakes. Everyone is the chosen one.\n\nYou get an artifact, you get an artifact. Everyone gets an artifact. 5 million doomhammers picked up by scrubs and somehow use it better than Thrall... what?\n\nDie, die, die. Making George R.R. Martin proud. Let&#039;s kill off as many characters as possible for no raisins. (yes i know i put raisins).\n\n4 level zones. If you ever get bored doing the same leveling zone multiple times. Well do I have news for you.\n\nIllidan&#039;s back. Maybe that&#039;s how we save the game. Pander to fanboys.\n\nWhat happened to the story? Azeroth is a giant titan egg. The Old Gods are void monsters. But wait... void monsters work with the Burning Legion. So the Burning Legion and the Old Gods were allies? So how come it says they are enemies.\n\nSeriously Khadgar? Upon hearing the &quot;azeroth is a giant titan egg&quot; story his response is &quot;that explains so much xD&quot; instead of questing that line of bullshit spewed out of the writer&#039;s ass.\n\nClass Order Halls. Garrisons but not as cancerous this time. Still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","replies":[]}
