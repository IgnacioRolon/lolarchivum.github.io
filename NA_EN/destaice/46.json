But why pick her?\n\nWhat does 5 uncoordinated realistically win against that you&#039;d actually expect the enemy team to pick?\n\nI know it&#039;s not all about winning but you basically doomed 4 other people to have an unfun game they had no chance of winning because 9 times out of 10 they get stomped hard.\n\nJust seems like a really selfish thing to do.\n\nIf you had a 5 man premade going in with an idea on lanes and builds then yeah this is fine but you should probably avoid picking something that would likely just lose.\n\nSincerely, the team of Brands that just massacred the Jannas.","replies":[]}
