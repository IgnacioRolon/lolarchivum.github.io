Direct deposit or a card.\r\n\r\nMy account was disabled at the time so I took the card and was going to wait till I got paid to reopen the account.\r\n\r\nI actually ended up liking the card until I started running into issues with it. So I got my account fixed and got direct deposit set up.\r\n\r\nI was supposed to get paid Friday morning and still haven&#039;t received pay on either my account or the pay card.\r\n\r\nCouldn&#039;t call the bank yesterday and the manager was off on weekends.\r\n\r\n\r\nAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH","replies":[]}
