She keeps you on your toes during fights.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t have ridiculous health percent damage.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t have stupid amounts of crowd control.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t have game breaking mobility.\r\n\r\nShe doesn&#039;t have some idiotic tank or heal or immunity mechanic.\r\n\r\nShe&#039;s just down right fun to play and for once in years, fun to play against. She&#039;s gonna walk up to the fight and start smashing skulls and layin out tentacles.\r\n\r\nWhen I get combo&#039;d by Illaoi it didn&#039;t feel like I was cheated with some BS mechanic.\r\n\r\nWhen I duel Illaoi it feels like a battle of skill rather than a battle of numbers.\r\n\r\nIt feels great to dance around dodging all her stuff to take no damage. But at the same time if you do get hit the reaction is &quot;dammit i messed up&quot; rather than &quot;dammit this shit has no counter play.&quot;\r\n\r\nJust really great overall design.","replies":[]}
