So why they didn't just use that, I can't tell.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is Bard's part in all of it. Instead of helping, he just grabs the stone and flies off into space with it leaving all the men, woman, and children to die. And yes all of them will die since Noxians intentionally left no survivors.\r\n\r\nI mean he could have used his ultimate to freeze everyone and stop them from killing each other instead of, idk, just grabbing the space laser stone and ditching them all.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem is context. We've been given no context on what's supposed to happen. What goal was trying to be met? What has occurred?\r\n\r\nIt all leads to this nice looking anime style cinematic with no story. Could have replaced the humans with pants and bard with a HD television and the cinematic would have made the exact same amount of sense, for there is none.","replies":[]}
