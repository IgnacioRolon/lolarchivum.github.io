More specifically the door to my room. He doesn&#039;t do it for other rooms. Yes it has a round door knob instead of a lever.\n\nIt has something to do with how the door to my room doesn&#039;t fit the frame right. But none of the other animals (1 other cat and 2 dogs) have opened the door.\n\nTell me your secrets kitty.","replies":[]}
