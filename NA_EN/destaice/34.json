Ahri will lose to zed if he plays right, Kalista can literally dodge all her abilites, and gnar can kite then go super tanky. J4 has very few moves to deal with a Zed, Kalista, and Gnar. Vi Is a close 4th i just thinks she gets outclassed Maybe she could enter the top 3. Janna and thresh are supports. Lee sin is strong be he is skill shot dependent and kalista and zed can dodge while gnar can dodge and become tanky. Azir damage is ridiculous but the top 3 can easily work around him.","replies":[{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-02-11T21:35:00.919+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Janna and Thresh are supports.\"\n{{champion:412}} \"Heard you been talking shit.\"\n{{item:3072}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-02-11T20:09:53.049+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, no.

She has high damage since the buffs, and she is extremely mobile.  They both hit six and Zed can't assassinate her because she is actually more mobile than him.  All she has to do is dash away, charm back at him, and blow him up, using the other two dashes to dodge away from him chasing or casting Q.\n\nAzir at level 18 with full build ABSOLUTELY makes the top 3.  NOBODY in the pool can even get close to him.  Despite having skillshots, Kalista can't take him on because his range with soldiers is greater than hers, and he'll literally two-shot her.  No one in the pool outranges him, and all the melees with gap-closers get destroyed by his ult.
