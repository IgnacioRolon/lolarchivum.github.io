And once down you become so vulnerable to offensive attacks.\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s the idea. At level 11 (similar to Garen) Miss Fortune&#039;s passive will gain a pretty hefty buff.\r\n\r\nAt level 11, minion and neutral monsters (excluding dragon and baron) will no longer trigger her passive. It would feel so much better if you weren&#039;t punished for farming a camp and getting attacked by random minion aggro.\r\n\r\nIt feels so horrible if you walk into lane to CS, attack a minion, get hit, and suddenly become massively vulnerable to offensive attacks.

Garen's passive is the way it is because it not only let's his passive be impactful all game long, but makes it so in the early game he can actually use it. \n\nSo there's two options as to why her passive is the way it is. \n\nThe first option is that, she's meant to be immobile in fights. They want her to be the roaming rotational adc, and in exchange for losing her passive in combat, she gains AOE and is meant to have solid damage numbers. \n\nThe second option is that, this limit on her passive is an artifact from a League where mobility creep wasn't as high. When MF was released, there weren't a ton of champions with dashes. The game was a lot less mobile, which leads me to think MF was meant to be a kiting ADC similar to Ashe. Rather than slows though she had high movespeed, and so to keep her in line with other champions they made her passive strong, but easy to break. \n\nRegardless of whether it's one or the other, or a mixture of both of those reasons, her passive definitely is from an older time and is in need of a tune up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2015-04-26T22:27:22.167+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a reasonable change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MeesterMoo","date":"2015-04-27T03:26:08.124+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So {{champion:45}} can no longer remove her slow past 11...

Miss Fortune due to her AA, Q, AA combo with her W granting her magic damage for each auto attack makes Miss Fortune the strongest laning champion, even against a Caitlyn I don't really find it difficult\n\nMiss Fortune's passive let's her quite easily roam with her other abilities, let's her get back into lane faster, and also let's her dodge skill shots and makes chasing easier, especially during the early game\n\nWhile I totally disagree with any buffs to her damage which would make her clearly broken, making her passive not cut off from camps or minions at a certain level would be really nice and make her passive better for chasing on top of roaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-04-27T00:19:31.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs some love +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"esmelar","date":"2015-04-26T21:57:33.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A very needed buff","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2015-04-27T03:40:04.845+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Miss fortune cannot keep her cool, Raptor dick is just too powerful.

Same with magic resist. It makes supports like Taric for example despite him being effective to counter ADCs with his high armor not be able to fully use it against Miss Fortune as he could against a champion like Ashe for example who almost exclusively does physical damage aside from her ultimate I believe.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-01T22:45:20.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes her stronger against another carry that doesn't have any MR, but most front liners have innate MR, usually sitting around 40% without actually building anything. Her damage can do decently well early on, allowing her to get an early lead due to high bases and huge mixed damage, but every champion that does a huge amount of mixed damage always ends up being a tank or Jax. Warwick is a good example. He does a lot of magic, but his physical damage with a BotRK can't be ignored either. AD Fizz was also an amazing example where he does almost purely magic prior to getting the TrinityPhreak and BotRK where he did a huge amount of mixed damage, plus he always went tank afterwards, much like Jax would. Another example would be Phoenix Udyr who has painful AA's and a huge burst of magic with those AA's. Can also look at Evelynn who's usually built with a damage item then going full tank afterwards....\n\nOverall, MF is suppose to be a front liner, but she does such a large amount of mixed damage, which is usually found on Bruisers that are meant to do mixed damage so they can't be ignored. MF though is a high priority target and with how her passive is, she can't escape at all. This lack of escape is only found on champions who have huge amounts of damage. After they made her kit do mixed, she's lost a lot of that damage and it falls off even harder late when the tanks pick up any kind of MR or a support grabs an Aegis. Aegis is like.. the bane of MF.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrSexyHobo","date":"2015-04-27T04:01:22.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Garen falls off after laning making his passive buff necessary to keep up. mf can delete an entire team late game with an aoe vel koz ult","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-04-27T14:49:30.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"garen actually one of the best scaling champs in the game. l2p.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSexyHobo","date":"2015-04-27T16:53:31.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KUNSTFEHLA,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7b2fY9LQ,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2015-04-27T14:49:30.226+0000)\n>\n> garen actually one of the best scaling champs in the game. l2p.\n\nive played a bunch of garen. he is useless if the enemy is good because he has no outplay potential. he turns into a meat sheild late game","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-04-27T18:13:56.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"every champ is useless if the enemy is better than you. try playing garen better then. his outplay potential in teamfights comes with flash Q","replies":[{"poster":"MrSexyHobo","date":"2015-04-27T22:11:29.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KUNSTFEHLA,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7b2fY9LQ,comment-id=000a000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-27T18:13:56.028+0000)\n>\n> every champ is useless if the enemy is better than you. try playing garen better then. his outplay potential in teamfights comes with flash Q\n\nyeah thats right. a bronze player can q flash just as well as a diamond player can. thats the point. then after you burn q flash you become meat sheild again and hope to got your team can start a fight bc you sure as hell arent doing it","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-04-28T07:41:48.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the diamond player just killed ahri while the bronze player didnt. you probably didnt either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GiveMeTalonPlz","date":"2015-04-27T15:43:02.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats interrupted by someone literally looking at her wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-04-27T18:49:02.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd take any buff for MF that makes her late game better, her scaling is awful.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-04-27T19:54:45.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Miss Fortune was a late game hypercarry like Vayne she would be broken.\n\nCurrently Miss Fortune has the strongest early game aka laning phase.\n\nHer Q does damage, can last hit people quite easily under turret but it resets her auto attacks.
