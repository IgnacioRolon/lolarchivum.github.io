We lose mastery 5% aa dmg from AA that will make last hitting harder\n2. {{item:2004}} deleted - yea i know, manaregen increase and base mana, but those buffs are meaningless, comparing to 100 mana for 35 gold on some champions, who really needs mana to not lose their lane. \n3. 6  flat ability power and 7 ability power overall losed\n4. no more 5% AP increase mastery \nLots of item costs increase: \n5. {{item:3089}}  cost increase from 3500 to 3800 gold \n6. {{item:3285}}  cost increase from 3000 to 3200 gold \n7. {{item:3135}}  cost increase from 2500 to 2650 gold \n8. {{item:3157}} AP decreased from 100 to 80, armor from 50 to 45. \n9. {{item:3165}} cost increased from 2300 to 2550 gold \n10. {{item:3151}} cost increased from 3000 to 3200 gold \n11. {{item:3174}}  cost increased from 2700 to 2800 gold \n12. {{item:3001}}  cost increased from 2370 to 2450 gold \n13. {{item:3003}}  cost increased from 3000 to 3100 gold \n14. {{item:3060}} cost increased from 2750 to 2900 gold \n15. {{item:3152}} cost increased from 2300 to 2500 gold \nAlso some of the mres items are getting a significant buff like: \n16. {{item:3102}} buffed, mres from 60 to 70, health from 450 to 500 \n17. {{item:3026}} mres buffed from 50 to 60 \n18. {{item:3156}} reworked so it gets extra mres and life steal \n19. {{item:3065}} buffed, Health increased from 400 to 500 and Magic resistance increased from 60 to 70. \n\n\nJust sum it up together, the total cost of a full build going to be higher by about 600 gold and more. This will cause a nice catastrophe that a lot of AP champions like {{champion:38}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:99}}{{champion:268}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:161}}  will be hit too hard, and some of them will not be playable anymore... \n\nLets get an example of her {{champion:34}}. \nPerfectly balanced, with potential and nice to play champion. According to the http://champion.gg/champion/Anivia site, people are mostly building on her rod, archangel, rabadon, void staff and zhonya when full build. \nThe amount of AP due to the 5% mastery and zhonya AP loss despite rod buff is going to be lower by about 30 - 35 AP, also the total build cost for the innocent bird is going to be 850 gold higher, facing enemies with better mres items and overbuffed ADC&#039;s. \n\nIm sad because it is a bad day for the game balance. I know, you are introducing the marksman rework and stuff like this, but you riot dont care about people LIKE ME who dont want to play them, and found myself better playing mages in your game. It is unfair, why people who are enjoying playing balanced champions going to have their enjoyment totally demolished for no fukin reason. \nIm sorry but i will give up playing this game in season 6, best regards your mages lover player. \n\nhttp://orig11.deviantart.net/bed3/f/2011/220/6/4/depressed_galio_by_uunimod-d45uxk8.png\n[](http://orig11.deviantart.net/bed3/f/2011/220/6/4/depressed_galio_by_uunimod-d45uxk8.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-11-02T01:21:32.415+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":17,"body":"Ambient Gold is going up","replies":[{"poster":"GG Noob Team","date":"2015-11-02T01:24:01.639+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crett,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QQ61j4KP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-02T01:21:32.415+0000)\n>\n> Ambient Gold is going up\n\nby 1.4 gold per 10 sec, that gives 168 gold in 20 minutes, woho...","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-11-02T04:51:33.180+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"Or 336 gold in 40 minutes which is around where you will get full build at earliest if you are not fed.
