I tried doing it a second time but searching through my computer for left over files thinking that was the problem, after i did that and reinstalled it, it still doesnt work. If anyone knows a way to fix this please tell me ASAP I need my daily league game!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T18:07:59.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is super common when a security setting is getting in the way and blocking you.
