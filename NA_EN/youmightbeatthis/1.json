I used to get at least 100-140 frames, but now I'm getting 30-50 frames. It will also drop to 15-20 sometimes. I've read a bit on this and it might be because Riot is always tweaking the graphics and stuff like that. My frames were really good during pre-season 8 but when season 8 actually hit was when my frames went down. If I seem bratty because of this then ok, I'm just not used to this low frames. I'd really love and appreciate some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T03:19:52.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With recent patches and Windows updates, there's a lot that could factor into why your fps dropped so much. We might need to adjust a couple things, but should be able to smooth things out for ya.\n\nFirst make sure the Windows DVR GameBar is still disabled. It tends to turn itself back on after updates and can definitely impact your gaming. Also, we've noticed a lot of issues with Discord Overlays messing things up and causing frame drops, so please be sure to disable any third party programs like Discord or Razr Synapse. \n\nAfter that, it'd be smart to go ahead and check for driver updates just in case something was missed. Never hurts to cover all your bases!","replies":[{"poster":"YouMightBeatThis","date":"2018-01-25T05:49:53.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't used discord during any of my play sessions, nor have I usd razyr synapse, so I don't think that's the problem. I also have windows game mode disabled. I will try to check how to check for driver updates, since I don't know how to.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T23:35:50.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[**This article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#wq1) should help with those driver updates if you still need!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
