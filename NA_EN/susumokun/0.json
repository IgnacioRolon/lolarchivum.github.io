Keep an eye out for the official patch notes with more information regarding this specific bug. Because of the unique nature of this bug, you may need to reinstall the game in order to receive the patch (and fix this issue).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ellyus","date":"2018-01-03T17:49:29.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"used Hextech Repair tool 4 times \nreinstalled it twice \n\nstill no way to launch the game .. !!\n\nany hints on how to get it back on tracks ? :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"VlRGIN","date":"2017-12-30T19:42:11.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can't even install the game anymore","replies":[]}]}
