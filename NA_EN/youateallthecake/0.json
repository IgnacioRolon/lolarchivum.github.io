Investing in a game and being serious about something that I enjoy, hoping that all other players I come across in summoners rift would feel the same way. Little known fact, it&#039;s not always like that. Whatever the case is, I had no issues when there use to be a tribunal but now that it has been pulled I have been running into issues of toxicity. I have worked on becoming better and a more caring player ever since I started running into these issues. But sometimes I still have bad days. I have been in and out of promotions for my old rank near 10 times, always getting afks or people who directly troll me because I am in promotions after I stress how important my promotional game is to me.\n\nI received a permanent ban over the course of three offenses. After receiving the ban, I reached out to Doublelift seeking advice. In which he provided me some pretty solid advice. Something player support seemed unable to do, because it doesn&#039;t seem like they really care if players reform. It seems like in the past it took more to receive a form of punishment, but as of lately just one bad game can lead to an offense. This isn&#039;t a bad system, but the fact that it isn&#039;t being explained to people that their investment (in a game they liked and spent tons of time on) can be stolen away from them (in my case) in an unfair manner is not at all acceptable.\n\nI am hoping that my account can be looked at because of the fact that according to the rules (as seen below), a permanent ban will be received upon your 4th offense. But I received a permanent ban on my 3rd offense. I don&#039;t feel as if I have been treated fairly, and the fact that I was not aware of the changes to the punishment system were never provided to me (being a casual player, I don&#039;t read much about the game) during any one of the two reports before receiving my permanent ban.\n\nPunishments will rapidly escalate for those who don&rsquo;t reform. Here&rsquo;s how it works:\nFirst offense: 10 game chat restriction\nSecond offense: 25 game chat restriction\nThird offense: 2 week ban\nFourth offense: Permanent ban\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions\n\nThis is basically my last and final all, Thanks for reading my post.\n\nReposted because my original post in Help &amp; Support has drawn little to no attention.","replies":[]}
