I tried deleting everything I have from league of Legends and download league again on my pc, did not help fixing it. Tried to disable iphelper (read on older post that this could solve the problem) did not work either. So im clueless what to do now..\n\nThe other problem I face is that in champ select I cant lock in, just before my turn to lock in the enemy's countdown is stuck at 0 because I got dc'ed and then after a 1-2 minuts I ''dodged'' the game and lose the LP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T17:28:00.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe this is a result of the recent patch, but a coincidence.
