I can understand that you can't rename it since the players base need to keep knowing who he is after the rework and because of the merchs but it would be nice if you utilize ''The Volibear'' more like a title or surname instead of a proper name (imo he needs to have a norse inspired thematic name in the way of Olaf, Ornn, Ivern, Gragas, Braum and Udyr !

For example, my [latest concept](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/plXbM055-champion-concept-fluvis-guru-of-geysers) was based primarily around his Q - I wanted to make a champion that used geysers. After looking into geysers, I came up with the revelation that geysers never react *exactly* the same way every time. Instead, their eruptions depend on the amount of generated pressure, with always fluctuates. So I then came up with his passive and changed his kit to have varying effects depending on the amount of damage he took between his spellcasts. I also came up with his ult as a way of both charging pressure, and unleashing pressure very suddenly, and changed his Q to realistically have varying degrees of strength. At this point, I realized I was essentially making him an AP-based tank/juggernaut, so I filled in my remaining blank by giving him pretty much a Gragas E for an engage/escape, and my buddy Nasu brought up that he was lacking a good defensive spell to cast, so I added the effect of a shield to his E to augment its usage. His name came last, from a \"mystic\" website that suggested fantasy names based around water. tbh...this concept is sort of a poor example for name-making, as I probably put the least amount of effort into it.\n\nIn your case it's a bit different, as it seems you want to simply start with the theme of an owl-person assassin and go from there. Since you want to make an owlman, you can always look into what owls associate with to some cultures. For example, in Egypt the owl represents death - specifically, protection of departed souls to the afterlife. So if you wanted to make an owlman assassin, you probably wouldn't want to try and fit the theme of a protector, and you can cross that off. But in Greece and Rome, owls end up referring to the goddess Minerva - the goddess of magic, weaving, commerce and well, you get it. In Gaelic, it focuses more on the pagan aspect of \"The Crone\", which essentially means a powerful, elderly witch. Most all of these though place them, of course, in the night. So when I do all those references, basically I'd come up with \"some sort of magic-damage based assassin who can also associate with the night in some manner.\" and then try to think of names or abilities that would fit that thematic.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to go about it, and not everything will fit. Fortunately, you have just as many ways of finding a name as you have chances of finding one that sounds fitting enough.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2019-06-01T17:09:25.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most champions are a pun on their base theme. {{champion:245}} for example.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2019-06-02T05:51:00.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"see my last comment.
