God it is annoying to deal with. If it delivered on more balanced games, I might be okay with it, but at the very least, it has resulted in no better levels of matchmaking then before. It subjectively feels terrible seeing your Bronze 1 Mid paired up against Gold 3 Mid, rank splashing feels terrible because it can demote your other ranks, so if you are training up other positions, you might screw over your main rank. It messes with strategy since you can't do lane swaps anymore without being warned and later dropped an entire rank for doing it too much. All this contributes to a system that FEELS absolutely terrible to play in, and the matchmaking isn't any better to make up for this. It doesn't help that it is a chore to micromanage 5 ranks. 1 was tough enough, but at least since it is only 1, you feel invested. Now I don't give a hoot about any of them, and have lost all drive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Body Pillow","date":"2019-02-07T16:20:13.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"100 percent agree with you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2019-02-07T02:17:25.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My understanding is every rank shifted up with the addition of iron tier.\n\nSo last years silver 5 is this years bronze 1.

It definitely could benefit newer players or certain elo players where like change in skill really matters. I phrased that werid... basically a decent amount of player population could potentially benefit from new system but I ultimately think more do not. Like for me.... I have played the game since season 1.  Yea (im low rank I know). But for me... this system adds nothing. I have ranked multiple accounts up to same rank using different roles. I have mained diferent roles, I am not a high enough elo (like  a majority of players) for it to really matter. So all this system does is make more grinding for me. Really for most vets who started playing back when you had to learn every role to potentially rank up. Or really just annoying who is same skill at multiple roles regardless of elo. Even for others it does suck cuz autofill or playing other roles don't go to your main rank if you win, but also don't get a loss if you lose.\n\nI think it really only benefits people who hardcore only play one role and like 1-2 champs well. Pretty much screws everyone else over. Obviously there some exceptions but it definitely more of a grind for no reason.  It can help newer players or people who are much better at 1 role than other roles. But I would argue that's not really great for the game. Because ultimately not enough people are going to play enough games to  get their \"actual\" rank in all roles so it really won't change mming that much. Maybe in like plat + it will.... but for like 90% of player population games going to feel just a shitty as normal, but with more of a grind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2019-02-07T20:38:23.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I like the new ranked system having separate mmr's for all the roles is a blessing","replies":[{"poster":"Chettar","date":"2019-02-08T07:36:37.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think having separate rankings isn't completely bad, but the way it is implemented in this new ranked system definitely is.
