Which is the reason I am making this thread.\nIf for some reason the hacker continues this behavior and it results in my account getting banned I don't want to end up like the many people on reddit who had their accounts hacked and then banned as a result of the hacker and then not able to have it reinstated.\n\nSo let this thread act as proof right now that I am not the one on my account.\nPlease upvote and do whatever you can to get this noticed\n\n(They also changed my icon, those jerks...)\n\nEdit: I already Sent in a ticket.

I have been playing with clearly a virgin since 2014 and I can guarantee any one of you guys that he isn't bullshitting any of you. There's also a couple of friends that are posting in this thread too just to prove that the actual owner of the account was truly hacked. Why do you think there are so many views, responses, and ups? We care about our friend and hope Riot helps him out. There are other pictures that he didn't post which includes his email being hacked as well as his passwords being changed. **He has no control and would like SOME assistance from any Rioter. ** It's so obvious that it's obviously not the original owner because the account's been logged in from other countries and have poor english. The origin of his account anyways is in one location and one location only in the US which is literally in the middle of no where. I assume that it can't be THAT hard to identify that the person that created this thread is the rightful owner. The last thing I want for him is to lose his account after years worth of money and getting good at the game (actually giving a f*** about having league in our daily lives).\n\n* _SO NO, he is not the hacker that created this thread.
