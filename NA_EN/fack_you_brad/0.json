Overuse of the word carries detrimental effects such as eye rolling, anger, nicememe etc. The word reads and sounds _unhealthy_. By reflexive property of mathemagics, unhealthy = unhealthy.\r\n\r\nFor people who use this word, they don&#039;t even consider healthier alternatives such as _injurious, deleterious, insalubrious, or malignant_.\r\nLiterally unplayable!\r\n\r\nI am actually glad that this word is just an unimaginative negation of the word healthy, or else it might just have a positive connotation.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-20T03:51:50.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, this meme is dead.
