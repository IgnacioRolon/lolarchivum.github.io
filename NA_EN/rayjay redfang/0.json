That is the most recent thing.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I have had internet problems and disconnected which gave me the leaverbuster.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is why did I receive the leaverbuster notification, and if it is true, why wasn't I placed in a waiting queue?\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-22T17:27:05.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look into this for you and was unable to find any notices about leaverbuster on the account.  Were you able to grab a screenshot by chance of what that notification said?  I'm guessing that, if anything, it's the notification that appears to say thanks for staying in game and returning to a good standing.  Everything looks okay to me, so I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2016-11-22T17:29:56.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to grab a screenshot, it faded away.
