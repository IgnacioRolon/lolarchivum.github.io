After finishing a game I was in the post game lobby. Suddenly the client crashed and this other window popped up.\r\n\r\nThis other window was like a Windows error window, the one that gives the option to send the error to someone or to not send the error to someone. This window also had the splash art of mad scientist ziggs on it.\r\n\r\nI had to restart my computer to get back into the client, and I had to log on twice. The first time I entered my name and password, it seemed to load normally, but it brought me back to the login screen and I had to enter in my credentials again.\r\n\r\nI just want to make sure that the extra error window popping up was normal and everything and to just report what happened. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T02:24:34.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you experienced was a *Bugsplat*, which normally occurs if there's a weird interaction between the Client and your computer. This is usually due to an outdated or malfunctioning driver or a more serious hardware problem.\n\nIf you see it again, be sure to let me know so we can troubleshoot the cause together!","replies":[]}]}
