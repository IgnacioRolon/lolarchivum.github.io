Essentially, you need to show consistent behavior improvement to be eligible for chests again, and any negativity can increase the duration of your reform period.

I don't know how to post on red tracker because I have forgotten many things after being gone for five months if not more.

I'm trying hard not to be sad or cry but the reply to my ticket was barely any help to me. The post I read by Riot said I could pay with Rp cards too.","replies":[{"poster":"LeagueOfJhin","date":"2017-05-17T17:29:16.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you have an email?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2017-05-16T13:33:12.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeagueOfJhin","date":"2017-05-16T02:52:57.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help can I ask is there anyway to report somebody out of the end of game lobby I came across the most toxic trolling person today?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T03:04:31.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We prefer that you use the report button in the after match lobby, but if you weren't able to do that you can shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for that report.
