I see 3 main problems with the current PBE implementation.\n\n1. There is basically no reason to fight over and contest early dragons. The first 2 buffs are pretty trivial and dont have much of a game impact. Why bother contesting a Dragon when you can take a turret instead to get global gold and map control which is substantially better than -8 damage from single target spells and attacks or whatever the number maybe be. I feel these changes will remove any incentives to fight over early game dragons.\nI know your answer will probably be something like ' you should contest early dragons to prevent the enemy team from getting to the later stages of the buffs'. But if you concentrate on snowballing your lead and take more important objectives rather than Dragon, whats to stop the opposing team from just closing out the game before the Dragon buff becomes relevant?\n\n2. It takes away the ability to use dragon to come back from a gold deficit. With the current implementation if you're losing a game its possible to sneak or take a dragon and potentially catch up to an enemy team with a gold advantage. With the proposed implementation, im not sure how the first 2 buffs will do much to help a team that is behind as both are pretty trivial.\n\n3. It basically requires the game to last for 40+ minutes to get any real benefit from these changes.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these points?\n\nAside from these points i hate the idea of non item permanent buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnowFall","date":"2014-11-05T21:30:19.899+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":4,"body":"Will you implement a system that detects 4v5 in ranked and gives \"Loss Forgiven\" to 4 man team?\n\nEdit: At least for the cases where a player is AFK from the start of the game till the end.","replies":[{"poster":"telkie","date":"2014-11-05T21:53:07.096+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems very game-able.

When is the next jungler going to come out? The last jungle we got was {{champion:154}}  which is least to say, easily forgettable when compared to a tank like {{champion:32}}  and either don't hold up as well as {{champion:254}}  or {{champion:64}} . \n\n2. Whats up with the jungle? The new changes seem really weird. To start with, the crabs. They give vision of what camp/monster they are in front of If I want vision I would much rather get a {{item:2043}}  or use {{item:3340}} and the speed shrine seems forgettable when there are so many ways to travel the map already. Also, every single camp giving a buff? Personally, I think this is pretty over excessive. The dragon buffs seem pretty much unnecessary as each game, there are about 2-3 dragons (Rough Guess) much really again, can be very forgettable? \n\nI'm interested to hear back to you guys, and share your thoughts. And I think I speak for almost all of us when I say, We're excited to see the new map and please keep up the good work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eotw","date":"2014-11-05T21:27:51.519+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the intention of the new baron buff (buffing minions) to encourage split pushing after acquiring it?","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-11-05T22:14:16.107+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"One of the frequent discussions I've heard and been a part of is how a team that is strong in one particular strategy can get a temporary source of a different strength to finish off the game. The baron buff in a broad sense is shifting to be more focused on sieging, whether that be split pushing or together. This is intentional, since taking Baron is typically a sign of strong teamfighting.\n\nThat being said, the health and mana regen on previous Baron buffs were very strong for sieging; we just wanted to make the strength much more focused and obvious.","replies":[]}]}]}
