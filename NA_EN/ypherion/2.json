Not necessarily the stats (LOVE being able to get it for tanky AP builds!), but the permanent Black Shield on the promoted minion? Kinda completely blocks out a lot of mages from being able to kill it at all.\n\nThis is the intent.  Wave-clear/stall is a strategy that players have shown us over and over again, and like many other strategies we looked for places where we could put levers that let us tune that strategy.  We don't want Banner to just remove wave-clear comps entirely (and can tune it if we have to), but it is there so that we have a place to put anti-stall power that teams can opt into when needed.  Also, I think it's too early to comment on the relative strength of a lot of things right now (though some are pretty clear *coughWarwickcough*).\n\n> Raptor Cloak/Ohmwrecker. Is it intended to work near dead turrets or not?\n\nThis is intended.  We'll keep evaluating whether this is the right direction, but it's not a bug in the standard sense.\n\n> Are there any plans to look at edge cases of lane-Smite like Skirmisher's Devourer Warwick top?\n\nI suspect this is more about WW than lane-Smite or the items in top lane.  We don't mind Smite on laners so long as it's not a must-have, dominant pick.  We'll be watching this, and see how things change once we've brought WW into line.\n\n> Towers feel really weak now. In general they seem to fall a lot faster than they used to (my last game I had a Cassi and Yi manage to take one down from full with a single minion wave at level 5), and the lasers on the base turrets seem... underwhelming. They start so low and take so long to heat up that it's usually pretty easy to dive under them and get out with taking even less damage than you would have before the change.\n\nWe've seen reports of towers feeling a bit flimsy and we're looking into exactly why this is the case.  We may make some changes here depending on what we find.  No concrete answers at the moment though.  Laser towers are in a similar place.  We might tune them up, but we need to be sure that they don't go crazy.  We've had pretty high variance internally depending on the tuning, so we'll have to find the right spot.  Watching play on live is helping out a lot there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Axes","date":"2014-11-24T23:07:19.348+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Gonna pick out some of the jungle questions:\n\n> What is the thought process behind the contradiction of your stated goal of making it more worthwhile to counter jungle (and recommending Poacher's Knife on so many champions), and the increased respawn timers making counter jungling nearly impossible because the camps are never actually up?\n\nIt's actually the other way - counterjungling can't be meaningful if respawn timers are short, even though it's 'easier'. If they respawn so soon after your opponent clears them that they're up when you go in, they'll very often have respawned after you clear them by the time your opponent is in position to try and steal them, and you haven't actually set them behind at all.\n\nCounterjungling requires a pretty comprehensive awareness of what your opponent is doing - opportunistically taking a camp here and there is one thing, but if you really want to try to shut someone's gold stream off, that's going to take a lot of doing. You're going to need to ward, you're going to need to pay attention to respawns, etc.\n\nLong story short: the shorter the respawn, the easier it is to counterjungle but the less it matters.\n\n> How exactly does making the jungle stronger \"diversify\" possible jungle picks, when even several of the previously viable junglers can no longer (or just barely) survive in the jungle long enough to actually jungle? (Evelyn, Kha'Zix, Amumu, Yasuo, Mordekaiser)\n\nLet's be clear about what kind of jungle diversity we're talking about here. We want champions in the jungle who are actually junglers - who have the kinds of power that can matter when played from that position. We're not trying to say every champ can clear. That's the Season 4 jungle and the result is that power against the jungle doesn't matter, only power against champions does matter and we see Lee Sin - Rengar - Kha'Zix - Evelynn - Elise - Jarvan IV over and over.\n\nWhat we are aiming for is a jungle where diverse kinds of actions are relevant - where being a ganker, a duelist, controlling objectives, stealing camps, counterganking can coexist as meaningful types of power, as well as one where tanks, fighters, assassins, even a few mages can be strong provided they have the right kind of strengths to matter as a jungler.\n\nFWIW: Amumu is still very, very powerful; Evelynn might need some love; not sure where Kha has landed; Amumu is still very strong (he's a bit weaker but I'd attribute that to direct changes in 4.20); Yasuo and Mordekaiser both can clear somewhat, I think the rune pages required have changed a bit though.\n\n> What happened to staggering the initial spawn times?\nCouple things. It wasn't actually increasing route diversity (actually, this version is more diverse, if only incrementally). It was killing off level 1 invades which had a lot of unintended consequences (laners hiding in lane brush to try for first blood, plus invades are just plain exciting when they happen sometimes). And it was making the jungle really hard to get started on learning - players could do the optimization that the jungle calls for once they had the confidence that they could more or less succeed, but players weren't really even getting started on that process when the spawn times were staggered.\n\n> You specifically called out Lee Sin as a champion that doesn't do so well in the new jungle. I disagree completely. His built in lifesteal/spell vamp lets him manage the jungle nearly as well as he could with the old one (possibly even better, with the Krug/Gromp buffs), without any hit to his ganking abilities.\n\nHe's one we're keeping a close eye on. Certainly if Lee Sin is just good at everything all at once the way he has been, that'd be a major problem for this jungle.\n\n> Are there any plans to look at edge cases of lane-Smite like Skirmisher's Devourer Warwick top?\n\nYes. That particular example will be taking a couple of hits in the near future.\n\nWe would be ok with lane smite in some cases - if it gets picked up because you want to help control the enemy jungle, and that's a valid but not totally dominant strat, we'd be pretty happy I think. But picking it because it's just the best way to dominate your lane opponent is something that we'll have to take action on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scottle Crab","date":"2014-11-25T02:36:03.712+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"My biggest problem with patch 4.20 is with the removal of {{item:3123}} .

Let's say you rebalance Darius and Shyvana - but leave some problematic bruisers - let's say, Mundo, Irelia and Renekton - as they are.

We'd solve this with increased gold on the jungle monsters, or just bonus gold from killing jungle monsters if you have smite or if you have machete (and its upgrades).\n\n2) I agree - Poacher's Knife is strongly overshadowed by Ranger's Trailblazer right now, and arguably by the other two items as well. We're certainly going to be adjusting these items as needed. The first thing will be getting items into a position where they're all roughly doing their jobs and we can adjust them on the balance side without changing them fundamentally, but we'll be balancing as well, wherever we can make things better.\n\nFor Poacher's specifically, we'll see what happens with Ranger's less dominant in the near future, and then if it needs more love, I think it does have the levers in place to give it that love. We can bump the gold, bump the speed boost, we can reduce the cooldown of Smite after Smiting in the enemy jungle more (what if it had a 15 second cooldown?), etc., so we do have options.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tastypork","date":"2014-11-24T21:53:08.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What upcoming tweaks or reevaluations will we be seeing regarding the preseason 5 jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-11-24T22:59:02.276+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot possible as we start to get data on the live game.

Are you fine with that, or can we have a bonus from smiting wolves in your own jungle?\n2. {{item:3711}} Poacher's Knife doesn't work on river monsters (Rift Scuttlers, Dragon, Baron). Couldn't it be the way to improve the item?\n3. {{item:3713}} Ranger's Trailblazer is useful even in the enemy jungle. Isn't cutting power from counterjungling the best way to nerf this item?\n\n#Items\n\n1. Is Negatron Cloak coming back to other items than {{item:3026}} Guardian Angel? (Abyssal Scepter, Moonflair Spellblade, Orb of Winter)\n2. Why isn't {{item:1031}} Chain Vest bulding into {{item:3082}} Warden's Mail? It would be really handy for some wannabe tanks to be able to choose their item after the game develops. As it is Chain Vest has no real theme behind it, unlike other Cloth Armor upgrades. Sunfire Cape, GA and Thornmail have nothing in common besides armor. *Not all three, but by pairs they have - Sunfire and Thornmail have magic damage, GA and Sunfire are anti-burst*. By having Chain Vest build into Warden's Mail, it's a clear design: heavy armor items build out of Chain Vest. Also, Thornmail could build out of two Chain Vests to help out in edge situations.\n3. Similarly, could we have more upgrades for {{item:3801}} Crystalline Bracer? It could build into Aegis, Banshee's Veil and Guardian's Horn.\n\n#Strategical items\n\n1. {{item:3060}} Banner of Command is a great option against AP waveclear from the likes of Ziggs and Xerath, but isn't it a little bit expensive for supports?\n2.
