Up front: we knew the preseason changes were going to make things significantly tougher, but it’s clear we’ve misstepped along the way in both communication and design. Not only have we not done a great job of sharing our thoughts (present and future), but our subsequent changes to the jungle from patch 5.1 to 5.4 have been nerfs to jungle diversity rather than continuing to deliver on our preseason goals. \r\n\r\nFirst, let’s see how we got here. From the beginning we knew that “strategic diversity” would basically become a meme for the 2015 season, but it’s still something we strongly believe in. A lot of players might associate champion diversity with strategic diversity, but it’s more about one feeding into the other. The former is only about what champions get played - even if they’re doing the same thing - while the latter emphasizes champions who can enable a variety of other strategies on a team (objective control, wombo, lane pressure, etc). With Jarvan IV, Vi, and Lee Sin all fulfilling identical roles (with priority given to whoever’s strongest), we know we’re not there.\r\n\r\nIn line with the above thought, our goal with 2015 was to support a rock-paper-scissors game of jungle styles: ganking, farming, and counter jungling. What we ended up discovering, however, was that counter jungling wasn’t actually a proper response on par with ganking and farming, so jungling went back to who could gank or farm the best (or both).\r\n\r\nIt’s clear that we’ll need to reconfigure what available playstyles there are for junglers out there, but for now our big focus is getting jungler diversity up before attempting to tackle the larger problem of strategic jungler playstyles (versus champion playstyles like playing Amumu vs. Vi).\r\n\r\nSo what do we want to do, and how can we get there? High-level we’re still pursuing strategic diversity in the jungle (and, well, all of League of Legends), but we also realize we need to get champion diversity up to support it. Finally, while we intentionally made clearing camps harder and riskier to better differentiate jungler strengths, this has also made the jungle position less satisfying and fun for junglers, so we’re investigating other ways to improve this.\r\n\r\nShort-term, here are some tactics:\r\n\r\nFirst, we’re going to be pushing our experimental jungler tank item to the PBE with this patch. We’ve actually been working on it for a little while behind the scenes, but - as we mentioned earlier - haven’t done a great job of communicating that. TL;DR: Juggernaut is being reworked into Cinderhulk, a new Sunfire-esque item build that gives both tankiness and extra clear speeds to the junglers in need.\r\n\r\nIn terms of auxiliary changes to help get tank junglers get their satisfaction back, we’re going to be looking at a bunch of tank junglers this patch to see if we can give any small buffs in the early game, along with buffs to Gromp’s Poison Armor Smite reward and some early monster damage nerfs. This does mean we’ll need to look at specific dominant champions who are standing (or pouncing) well above the pack, but we’ll have to tread a fine line of balance here. The goal is to get junglers feeling satisfied and empowered to play the position, but we need to be wary of a world where they’re doing so at the cost of everyone else.\r\n\r\nFinally, what’s in store for the future? We still believe in creating a compelling set of unique jungle actions beyond just ganking and farming, but haven’t firmly locked down additional paths to support. We have a few ideas we’re really excited about, but we’re definitely looking at making Poacher’s Knife and Skirmisher’s Sabre more robust and exciting items for the future. We’re also going to be examining the feeling of the jungler “potion tax” where junglers always need to be chugging away to stay healthy.\r\n\r\nOn the communications front, we failed to recognize the stacking pain we’ve been causing junglers through the patches, and that’s something we want to improve. We need to get better at engaging in a healthy dialogue with players while also highlighting our short and long-term goals for the future, and we will.\r\n\r\nWrapping it all up: if it wasn’t clear from our multiple revisions throughout the years, the jungle is a tough position to get right. The jungle needs to test multiple capabilities while also providing the space for a jungler to have impact on the game through different actions, even though right now it’s more focused on high-damage and ganking prowess (which sounds familiar, we know). That said, we’ve never been more confident in our long-term goals - as ambitious as they are - but we know it’s not fair for junglers to languish while we work toward that vision.\r\n\r\nWe’re definitely committed to opening up the jungle without just giving out power haphazardly, but we’re also hoping that by keeping these communication channels open you’ll help us guide the jungle to a more compelling, diverse, and healthy position in League. We really appreciate your feedback, and we’re excited to continue sharing more of our plans in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Wînter Fox","date":"2015-02-28T01:26:51.043+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I understand and appreciate the long-term goals.

I've loved Jungle Naut for a long time and like most tanks his clear is rough but you can get through it with his shield if you time it right. So I'm curious about the numbers adjustment. I can deal with the riptide changes though, because that was typically a zoning thing to me and occasionally used to speed up jungle clear.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-02-28T02:07:39.395+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is our challenge as well - what conclusion we did come to was that Cinderhulk leads to a stronger \"endgame fantasy\" (aw yiss season 2014), but you have to want to get to that world to start feeling satisfied.

There is still a risk that things change very quickly for us, but better to deal with that as we have to.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on letting us switch for free at a certain level as opposed to pay to purchase all game? If you made it much further into the game the Junglers who need to swap there smites situationally are not punished as hard. Say level 9 to 11. Most champions who have any sustain issues typically have them settled by that point anyway. The way it stands now Rangers is an early game utility purchase that dwindles somewhat as time goes on. at least in how i see it (I could be totally wrong)\n\nAlso what about the possibility of different sight stone upgrades or requirements? For example maybe a cloth and a ruby crystal? Those stats are equally important to both Supports and Junglers as well as the importance of cost effective vision control, while still holding a sweeping lens. And then maybe a branch upgrade from there for health or AP or mana or health regen but maintaining the same active? as it stands there is no real reason to finish a sight stone till much later in the game anyway. It could possibly help improve jungle diversity if you push jungling a little bit back towards a more supportive position. Kinda like when you support you accept your going to be slightly weaker then if you had went into a solo lane with that champion. Which is not a bad mentality mind you (I find myself enjoying support a lot more then other positions in the right circumstances) i just feel there is so much power in the jungle position that is not directly tied to its ability to team fight or gank.\n\nAlso i tried really hard to not come off as \"You should do X\" kinda guy or infer that this is the only way to fix the current state of the jungle.

My take on it, as someone who largely works on the framework for the jungle, is that I don't build the jungle around the junglers we have, but instead, the qualities we want to test. We want the jungle to challenge players differently for each champion, and we also want to create plenty of space in the jungle for champs that get changes, or new champions, etc. I leave it up to other designers much more in tune with each champion to determine if and how they want that champion to function as a jungler. \n\nAnother aspect is looking at what each sort of strength a jungler can have, and what that gets them. One of the things that lead to Cinderhulk was thinking about what AD got many junglers (increased combat power, clear speed (and therefore health and mana)) vs durability (larger possible farming uptime, significantly smaller increase in map presence). While this is a fair bit simplified, even this makes it obvious that the items, even at the component level were creating an imbalance. \n\nSo I can't really answer the big question, but I'm happy to share a little bit of how we've been getting to some of our changes recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-03-01T18:40:26.198+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's finally some (light) Vi nerfs on the PBE, after Jarvan got a nerf.\n\n10$ says you guys \"start focusing on long term goals\" now, since that means Lee Sin conveniently avoids a rework.

I'm the blue jungler.  The champ the red jungler picked can clear his whole jungle with just machete plus 2 pots and then potentially gank a lane.  He might not even need a leash.  My jungler can only clear one buff, with a leash, and then I have to back.  However if I back too soon, I'm screwed because I can't afford to upgrade my jungle item which won't help me to gank even if I get it.  So I'm kind of stuck in a bad position on my jungler.  \n\nThat's part of why I'm starting to hate the idea of jungle items and want riot to go to spirit stone->phil stone->miracle.  The problems with the jungle is some champs who do well in the early jungle can also gank well relying on base stats.  The people who do well in the jungle don't care what you do to those items and they only really need the upgrade for the gold it generates.\n\nThis is kind of why I'm asking about who should and shouldn't be a jungler.  If I can't gank until six, than the fact that the other guy who can gank at 3 is already challenging me and my team enough as it is.  That's because it's not setting just me behind but he can set any of my laners behind and get his laners ahead before he upgrades his item.  And that's before we consider the fact that I can only get one buff before backing and am vulnerable to having a buff stolen early (screwing me more).  \n\nThen there's the fact that he hit level 3 or 4 well before I did because he's clearing camps faster than I can.  So what happens when I can't clear as fast as I need to, which is as fast as the other guy is clearing?  I fall behind.  And what happens when I fall behind?  I can't gank and have to spend more time in the jungle while he's staying ahead in levels and ganking for his team.  That's the other big problem with the new jungle: so many junglers are also falling behind in time and in levels, esp compared to the laners.\n\nIf you want to raise the bar, that's fine, but we need to know where the bar is.  \n\n>I leave it up to other designers much more in tune with each champion to determine if and how they want that champion to function as a jungler. \n\nMaybe this \"I'm doing my thing you are doing your thing\" is the heart of the problem with the jungle right now.  I mean look at it from those guy's perspectives.  They not only have to balance a champ for a jungle, but also his laning (most junglers can lane as well), as well as his mid to late game when it really doesn't matter as much if you are a jungler or not just so long as you have that smite to get a dragon or baron.\n\nTo be frank, from everything I've heard and my own experiences jungling, it's the first two clears or so which are the real b----.  For the slower junglers who should be in the jungle it's like having the early game of a hypercarry but without that hypercarry potential.  Those finished items you guys at riot are worrying about?  By that time you get one the finished jungle item isn't an issue.  If it is, it's less because it's a finished item and more because he's got the finished item and a level on me while I'm still a clear or so short.\n\nHere's one thing I've noticed about who wins and loses more.  Winning teams, especially in shorter games, not only have a money advantage, but they also a level advantage.  To put this in perspective, before I can finish an item that has benefits outside of the jungle, levels are everything.  If you aren't a top tier jungler and are facing one, he's got levels and you don't.  He's even with laners and you aren't.  \n\nThat's the real challenger the not top tier junglers are facing: you, and quite possibly your entire team, are behind the 8 ball for the entire laning phase.  If your bot lane gets shut down in the early game, your team is screwed.  If your mid lane gets shut down in the early game, your team is screwed.  The other guy, he can help his team shut down your team but you can't.  So for a slower jungler, you are getting a multiplicative screwing.  Why?

Unless the respawn timers change or you make it so farming becomes unbelievably broken, it just will not be a smart idea. Quite frankly though, I'm glad it wont be possible. Remember the Feral Flare 4v4's until 20 minutes where the players emerged from the jungle and suddenly the game became a 6v6? People just do not want junglers who PvE.\n\nThe real 'problem' with the jungle is that everyone wants strong early/mid game ganking champs on their team. Those sorts of champs just fit into the jungle perfectly. They clear fast, they can snowball lanes and they can kill the enemy jungler and deny him farm. Unless the game gets changed beyond recognition, this will not change. You can nerf whoever the top tier champs are as much as you like, but until there are no champions left with early/mid game strength they will just get replaced by the next.\n\nChampions that require a lot of farm don't really belong in the jungle anyway, if you need farm you should be in a solo lane.

I feel like the problem with the current jungle is actually champion balance, not the jungle itself. \n\nSome of the most fun games I have ever played of League of Legends are this season in the jungle. Their is a lot of strategic depth that allows me to calculate my not-full health, and determine how safe a gank is, or even how safe my next camp is. I like the fact that I don't always come out of the jungle for a gank full hp, and that I can successfully counterjungle if i so choose. \n\nThe outliers in it( Lee Sin, Vi, J4, Nidalee and Rek'sai) just have literally everything a jungler could possibly want and crowd out other junglers for the most part. If these champions are each given actual weaknesses, as each farms well, has high hp in the jungle. and has very mobile and good ganks, then I believe diversity would be more popular in the jungle. \n\nI've played{{champion:254}}  a lot and she can easily counterjungle and duel other junglers because of her shield promoting good trading and her W's damage that aids her clear camps easily. I feel like her W needs to be toned down damagewise, as this is her greatest tool in the jungle, she can smash monsters and enemy junglers easily with it.\n\n{{champion:421}}  seems to have a lot in her kit as well, her sustain is top notch and really doesnt offer any counterplay in the jungle. I can't invade a full health reksai, nor can I duel her in my jungle if she decides to invade. I'd lower her sustain. \n\n{{champion:76}}  is an assassin that deals half of your hp with a spear, and the other half with takedown. This is really annoying, but fine if thats what the champion does. What is really frustrating and has never made sense to me in nidalee's kit is her heal. A strong Poke mage, with good dueling potential also having the games largest targeted heal? I can't understand how this is a good design decision. \n\n{{champion:59}}  and {{champion:64}}  I feel could see hits in their cooldowns for Q. I've played both champions a decent amount, and countless games against these champions and both seem to have a lot of mobility and damage tied to these skills, which leads them to have good dueling potential, but at the end of the duel these champions have their main damage and mobilty cooldowns off CD already and just Nope out of there with no consequence whatsoever. Lee Sin is a high skill champion, I don't believe he should get 3 chances to land his q during a gank. \n\nThere is a reason outside of Diamond and the occasional nunu these champions are the only champions seeing pro jungle play this season. Their kits have no weakness compared to nonmeta junglers.\n Compare Nautilus's weaknesses to Nidalee's\n{{champion:111}} \nImmobile                                          \nLow Damage\nLow Range(if nautilus misses his hook, he's screwed up the gank, Nid misses spear, she can still pounce in and burst)\nbad.... really bad?.... atrocious dueling\nbad 2v2\n\n{{champion:76}} :  No CC\n                                                              \nI play nautilus a lot in the current jungle and I opt to not take any jungle item, rather building ROA right off the bat after my trailblazer. RoA offers Damage, tankiness and sustain to junglers. I feel like tank itemization could and should look like an RoA, something decently efficient that scales to be pretty efficient and offers them everything they want. Mana/HP, damage.\n\n{{champion:121}}  is also pretty fun to play in  the new jungle. I have to max W to sustain and take trailblazer, but his ganks are great anyway, so an item that lets me gank at full hp is all i want. I can still go 21/9/0 with Kha'zix so I don't feel the jungle is too hard. \n\nITEMIZATION WILL FIX NOTHING WITH TANK JUNGLERS: The only problem I experience, or that i have seen any tank junglers experience is in levels 1-4. This is before the first back and the new jungle item really wouldn't help in that regard. Lee sin will still kill amumu at his red at level 2, a 1000 gold item will not change that.

In my view, it's to apply as much pressure and have as great an impact as possible in the areas of the map and stages of the game where you believe it will benefit your team the most. And what this in turn most often translates to in both competitive play and solo queue at present is having a good early game. Why? I believe that this is in large part because of the general nerfs to jungle gold and experience compared with S4. Getting both the jungler and a lane (or several lanes) ahead is now relatively more beneficial (compared to in the past) than power farming and trying to scale well into late game team fights, as even the best power farmers usually come out of the jungle with insufficient tools to carry a team that has fallen behind early. By seemingly attempting to shift junglers further toward the \"support plus\" role with less gold and experience for their time clearing, Riot has ironically made early, high-impact DPS junglers even more attractive vs. scalers such as devourer junglers and tanks. A difficult, unprofitable jungle actually lowers the opportunity cost for attempting early ganks.\n\nAs long as this is true, I believe that champions who can get their first clear done to fill out their kit and quickly move on to gank effectively will continue to dominate the pick and ban phase. The general weakness of jungle scaling means that sacrificing the early game for a better late game is simply less attractive than before.\n\nUnless jungle camps are made profitable again to the point where scalers can actually outscale the **impact** of early ganks (thus making counterjungling once more a worthwhile endeavor in the bargain), I think we will continue to see a lack of diversity. I understand that Riot does not want to see a static jungle farming competition take the place of a dynamic early game, but jungle diversity has always been a balance between the four categories roughly embodied by the very jungle items of S5: ganker, counterjungler, farmer/scaling DPS, and farmer/tank. With three of those roles highly dependent upon the jungle itself, is it really any wonder that the most powerful gankers are sitting pretty on top?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noticed","date":"2015-02-28T01:46:18.415+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like the jungle is the type of role to fill in for what the team needs.

While I understand the fact it needs to be a bit tougher so it's not just a place to farm for a bit then just dart to a lane for a gank.\n\nIt would be nice if the camps were just a tad easier to kill on the first couple levels or more rewarding, without having to go back with only, if I'm lucky, 400g. Granted I am new so I know full well I am not an amazing player at this point and most likely I am doing some things wrong but having a role, which is a very important role, in the jungle that is hard and some times pretty unforgiving can be really discouraging to get into.\n\nYou can't really learn to jungle VSing bots because there's no enemy jungler. So besides normals you can't really get the feel for the role without having a massive weight on your shoulders, and also kind of mentally stressful since everything is the jungler's fault it seems. I guess I'm just rambling at this point lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AuralVampire","date":"2015-02-28T15:35:41.087+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, \njust wanna step in and I'd love to know why no one tried to fix the whole experience thing. In my point of view it is one of the most dissatisfying moments in jungling when mid laners and top laners hit level 6 and you as jungler are level 4. A lot of junglers have good use of their ultimate for ganking but there is just no I'm-lvl-6-let's-get-sh*t-done-moment anymore since lanes are ahead of you. Also the ability to deal damage is crippled because of this experience disadvantage. Maokai loses 45 damage on his 6 second cd Q, Hecarim loses 35 damage on his 4 second cd Q because he hasn't got the level. Next is the overall stats. Being two levels down means not having 190 HP more (in comparison to level 6 Hecarim) and for maokai it would be 180 HP difference, that's more than a ruby crystal (!). To have or not to have. In the past I liked to tower dive and/or get the level 6 kill with utility ultimates like hecarims or damage ultimates like volibears 75 bonus magic damage on hit, now it feels dangerous to early gank as tank jungler without real tankiness and damage (and missing utility coming with ult?).\n\nYes there are the other problems already mentioned and pointed out in this thread as well, but I just felt everybody is talking about items and clearing speed and no one is talking about the level disadvantage which can be converted into a gold amount missing out. Again: Maokai at level 4  in comparison to level 6 is missing out on 6.6 AD, 180 HP, 8 armor and ability damage, accumulating to (237.6 gold+480.6 gold+160 gold=) 878.2 gold (all stat differnces and gold values taken from leagueoflegends.wikia.com)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Apollo817","date":"2015-02-28T07:46:42.690+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if it's too late or not to give my two cents, but I'll give it a shot. I've played Nautilus since Season 2 and I love the snot out of him, played more than a few games with him. From my own experience, I think the real struggle for tank junglers are the early clears. I'm talking extremely early, as in levels 1-3. Tank junglers, really don't have a problem clearing the jungle mid to late game, they actually do quite alright. The real problem is their early clears. I honestly don't feel like the recent additions to the PBE with the Cinderhulk is a step in the right direction. By the time they're able to purchase this item for more clearing power, they have enough clearing power on their own making Cinderhulk kind of redundant. In my eyes, at least. The real problem are the initial clears, the monsters have just gotten so strong over the years. The tanks really just need help right from the get-go.\n\nI'm interested to hear if any Rioters (or anyone else for that matter) agree or disagree with this train of thought. I'm probably too late since the thread was posted, but one can hope.\n\nAnd as a side note, please don't change the stats on the item. 10% CDR, tenacity, and a bunch of flat health is so crucial. My heart was broken the last time the health and tenacity were taken away from SotAG.","replies":[]}]}
