This doesn&#039;t mean I was trying to &quot;steal&quot; the kill, I was trying to save your life. Yes, I&#039;m looking at you 50 hp Vayne. Should I just have potentially let Lucian auto you once more so that you could die? No one complains about &quot;stolen kills&quot; in diamond elo unless they are Draven mains. \r\n\r\n**&quot;Oh My god, Trynd stop splitting&quot;:** Tryndamere&#039;s value comes from his ability to 1v1 and even 1v2 players. You have to understand that most of the time, a split pusher&#039;s value is diminished in a 5v5 team fight. If Tryndamere splits bottom while baron is up and he can 1v1 or 1v2 the enemies, then WAIT until they send two people to him. Emphasis on the wait. Don&#039;t fight a 4v5 and then say &quot;where is Tryndamere&quot;. Wait for 1 or 2 people to go for Tryndamere. This leave you with the opportunity to fight a 4 vs 3 in your favor or simply take the objective on the other side of the map.\r\n\t\r\n#**Laning**\r\n\r\n**Ward:** Don&#039;t forget to ward. Did your jungler start on the bottom side? He will most likely be topside around 2:50-3:30, please ward before he reaches your side of the map.\r\n\r\n**Control Wards:** Try to have a control ward on the map at all times. Buy one on your first or second back unless you can&#039;t due to an awkward amount of gold.\r\n\r\n**Giving up CS:** Some people think that you must try to get every single creep. This is not realistic, even in high elo. Sometimes, the harass that you will receive walking up for certain cs just isn&#039;t worth it. For example, if I&#039;m Singed vs Darius and have my eye on a caster minion that&#039;s about to die. I could walk up to get 1 cs, but I will probably lose half of my health for it. Was it worth it? Answer: No. It is not always worth going for every creep. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n#**Common Mistakes**\r\n\r\n**You&#039;re ahead but can&#039;t close out the game:** Have you ever been ahead, but can&#039;t close out the game? Maybe the enemies have an Anivia, Ziggs, or other really good wave clear champion. What you do is you ward their jungle and take all free objectives such as Baron and Dragon. This leaves your enemies with a choice, they can either let you keep getting free barons, dragons, and their entire jungle or they can leave the safety of their towers where you are free to engage and slay them. \r\n\r\n**It&#039;s late game and you show yourself in bot lane:** If the game is in the late stages past the 30 minute mark and you show yourself in bot lane, smart enemies will rush baron. Don&#039;t show yourself bot if you don&#039;t have tp to contest baron on the other side of the map. You will either give the enemies a free baron or your team might die trying to 4v5 them.\r\n\r\n**One of your teammates is never there:** We&#039;ve all had this happen to us. One team mate goes to a side lane to trim the wave or get it pushing towards the enemy. Meanwhile the 4 of you are in mid lane and you see the entire enemy team in mid lane too. DO NOT FIGHT! You should not engage a 4v5 or put yourself in such a risky position away from your tower that you get engaged upon; you are lacking a team member. The icing on the cake is when your team engages 4v5, loses, then blames the person splitting. Even if X player is making a mistake by splitting or being late to the party, it was your responsibility to try to mitigate the damages. Stay under the safety of your tower and either wait for the split pusher to draw some pressure or wait for them to group.\r\n\r\n**You just aced the enemy:** In low elo, many players ace the enemies and return to base. Wh...wh...what? Have you forgotten that the goal of the game is to explode the enemy nexus? If all of the enemies are dead, take baron, take dragons, take one or two towers, steal some of their jungle, for god&#039;s sake take something. Aceing the enemy is akin to doing hard work, taking the objectives afterwards is the equivalent of receiving your prize. SO GET YOUR GOSH DARN PRIZE.\r\n\r\n#**Junglers**\r\n\r\n**Ganking when there&#039;s a huge wave on my tower:** This is usually a bad idea. One thing you have to keep in mind is that if you gank me when there&#039;s a large wave on my tower, this means I haven&#039;t killed those creeps. I most likely have an xp deficit as a result. It also means that if you gank, we aren&#039;t fighting a 2 vs 1, we are fighting a 2 vs 1 + a huge wave of creeps. God forbid the enemy jungler shows up to counter gank you. If my enemy starts running away and I chase him while creeps are crashing on my tower, I could potentially lose the XP and gold from all of those creeps.\r\n\r\n**I&#039;m never ganking that lane again:** Hello? Keep your emotions aside. If you see an opportunity to gank, then by all means gank.\r\n\r\n**There is value in ganking, even if you don&#039;t get a kill:** In really hard matchups where your team mates are crying for help, you might be reluctant to gank if you don&#039;t see the possibility of a kill. However, you have to realize that there is still value in ganking. If I&#039;m playing top lane as Singed vs a ranged champion and I&#039;m losing, a gank is more than welcome. If my opponent loses his summoners or loses half of his hp during the gank, it allows me to farm more freely because my opponent can&#039;t play as aggressively without risking his death.\r\n\r\n**Reset the wave:** If you just ganked a lane and killed the enemy, shove the lane. There are two reasons you should do this; your team gains more total xp and you crash the wave on the enemy&#039;s tower. When the wave crashes on the enemy tower, they lose all of the minions (xp and gold). In addition, the wave will likely be pushing towards your team&#039;s side. This lets your laner control the wave and safely farm closer to his tower and it opens up the enemy to another gank. On the topic of gaining more total xp, most people don&#039;t know this fact. When two people are sharing xp (laner and jungler for example), each player gets 65% of the xp they would get if they were alone. What this means is that even though each individual player gets less xp (65%), the xp that you do receive has much more overall value because you and your jungler just received 130% of the xp for that wave that you just shoved.\r\n\r\n**Your laners are getting shoved into their towers:** Maybe their opponents have better wave clear or more pressure in lane. In any case, invading the enemy jungle or contesting scuttle is much harder when your team mates are shoved into their towers. Why? Because the enemy laners can respond much quicker. You hear the jungler complaining to his laners: &quot;why are you guys just sitting at your towers farming, HELP ME!&quot;. However, you have to look through the eyes of your laners. If your mid laner is shoved in and he roams to help you, he loses all the creeps that crash on his tower and he already has an xp deficit because his opponent already shoved his wave. Sometimes, its best to just not invade or to just run away if you get invaded if your team can&#039;t respond. \r\n\r\n#**General tips**\r\n\r\n- Sometimes, its better to **flash preemptively** . As in, before you get chunked for 75% of your hp. Good luck staying in lane after that one.\r\n\r\n- **Use attack move**. The default key is &#039;A&#039;, but I have mine set to something else. Seriously, it helps so much with kiting in team fights. Do not play adc if you don&#039;t know what attack move is.\r\n**Use stop key**, it helps with csing and freezing. The default key is &#039;S&#039;.\r\n\r\n- Don&#039;t buy **items** with **actives** if you aren&#039;t going to be using the actives. Actives aren&#039;t free, the cost is incorporated into the cost of the item.\r\n\r\n- Know why you are building items, builds change, everything is situational. Don&#039;t keep building the same thing because you saw it on a mobafire guide.\r\n\r\n- If the enemy team has a Vladimir, Swain, Soraka, Mundo, or Trundle, buy an gosh darn executioner or morello.\r\n\r\n- **Never give up**. &quot;B..b..but there&#039;s almost no chance of winning&quot;. I don&#039;t care if there&#039;s only a 5% chance of winning, if you give up that becomes 0% chance. I can&#039;t begin to tell you how many games I&#039;ve won where we had lost both nexus turrets but somehow managed to stall the game and win.\r\n\r\n- Are you playing Vayne, Zed, Yasuo, Riven, or Lee Sin in low elo? I understand that these champions appeal to many people, because they&#039;re &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;. However, these champions have a high skill cap. This means that more likely than not, you are not taking full advantage of their kits. Do yourself a favor and play a simpler champion.\r\n\r\n- On the topic of **champions**, you should main 2-3 champions max. Don&#039;t be the person that can play 50 champions at an average level, but can&#039;t play 1 single champion at a high level.\r\n\r\n- **Learn to dodge**: Are people arguing in champ select? Do you have a Teemo support or a first time Fiddlesticks ADC? Dodge. Its only -3lp and you don&#039;t lose MMR.\r\n\r\n- **Keep team morale high**: Don&#039;t say GG just because you lost lane. It isn&#039;t over until the nexus explodes. I have a rule that I never surrender if the enemies haven&#039;t taken any of our inhibitors. Learn to praise teammates; a simple &quot;gj&quot; can go a long way. Don&#039;t be sarcastic, passive aggressive, and please don&#039;t say &quot;why?&quot; when a teammate makes a mistake. If you make a mistake, own it and say &quot;mb&quot;. Control your emotions, you&#039;ll be more likely to play the game until the very end with a clear mind for better decision making.\r\n\r\n#TLDR: Git Gud.","replies":[]}
