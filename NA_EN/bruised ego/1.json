In the end, it just ends up matching me against low plats/diamond V&#039;s  with golds and plats on my team. If this is going to be the end-result 95% of the time, just match me with them immediately so that I don&#039;t have to waste 20 minutes in queue just to play a game that might be 20 minutes. It&#039;s normals for christ sakes, is there no way to stretch the mmr boundries so that more people get matched with each other?\n\nDon&#039;t even get me started on normal 3&#039;s queue times.\n\nI get a better quality match with a 5 minute queue time if I just go on my Diamond V smurf. The queue time is fast and everyone is around the same rank. Smh, and people wonder why smurfs exist. However, all I want is to play normals on my main where I have loads of skins, every champion, and 16 rune pages.","replies":[{"poster":"Alaric The Sic","date":"2016-11-04T10:42:13.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be a bro. queue as support and you will have 1 minute wait times.","replies":[{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-11-04T10:44:05.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False.

Like the system will pass up games that need a support for a short while just to see if it can get you another role before just instantly forcing you to support the first open game it finds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bhagswag","date":"2016-11-04T11:29:23.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What can they do?

That's insane.\n\nIt takes 10-20 minutes pretty often for me to get matched in high diamond and about 5 minutes to 10 minutes in low diamond.\n\nNormals tho, yah, you get your normal MMR to above 2000 and you just get fucked. Its gonna be a 20 minute wait or more. Part of the problem is just how many players stopped playing the game this season. Less players in all queues means longer wait times. Tends to happen when you make changes that no one liked, that we all bitched about, that destroyed competitive integrity, and costs the game 20% of its player base in a single season.","replies":[]}]}
