Who do you envision actually purchasing this item for the armor or the cooldown that they now have to pay for? In a match up against an AP champion, building glacial shroud feels awkward.\n\nLiterally the only reason I build righteous glory (Singed main) is for the active and you nerfed that as well. Why does the second activation now become automatically triggered upon touching one champion? Sometimes you want to run a bit further into the fray before the second activation so that you hit more people with the slow.\n\nRighteous glory is literally the only item keeping Singed relevant and its getting nerfed. Yes, I&#039;ve seen the Singed buffs on the PBE. The only useful buff is the increased AP ratio on Singed poison because it will help you have early pressure to shove creeps faster or proxy without losing too much health. I don&#039;t see my self having more than 75 AP at any point in the game though, so late game the change is irrelevant.\n\nSinged&#039;s biggest problem is mobility, which the Righteous glory solves. I will probably still be forced to build righteous glory to stay relevant only it will be a nerfed version.","replies":[]}
