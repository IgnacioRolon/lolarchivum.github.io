Jinx afk from the start.  \nThis is a prime example of what a loss prevent in Ranked shoiuld be.    No way to recover from a 4v5 especially w/o your adc.\n\nGame 5 of my promos.  (3-1 now) Olaf as support after i pick up cait (they asked me to play adc).  \nOlaf is not support esp against an annie  and I would have dodged but you still get a loss.  So what is the incentive if someone is just \nstupid.  You loose.   BTW:  He fed 0/11/5.  With no harrass he could not help me with farm so we got zoned and I fell behind ..  \n\nPlz Plz riot at least turn on or configure loss prevent when it is a 4v5 (I know you can detect this, in bots if lvr then only 4 bots come out to play)\n\nOne more game to add..  Rage quit top Swain and a feeder LeBlanc mid..  GG \n\nI know the leaver will get hit by the leaverbuster, but that does notyhing for the other 4 players...\n\n\nPlz Plz Plz  Loss Prevent if drop and never reconnects or does not connect at all.. Plz Plz Plz..\n","replies":[]}
