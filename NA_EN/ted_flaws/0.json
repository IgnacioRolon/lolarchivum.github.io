I mean it could be a lot easier for people to know if it is wondering to engage or not a teamfight. \n    It would be differents colors which means different status, orange if the ult is loading (just black before level 6) then green with a little animation or effect when the ultimate is ready, then if you&#039;re oom the circle would be blue and the form could be like a clock.\n    Even if it would be useless in party group but in SoloQ i mean YoloQ, you can&#039;t really both speak and play, it would be interesting to have information by ourselves than asking him just front of a teamfight.\n\nBtw I am sorry if my english is not so correct, I tried on the french forum, people approved but I need a larger people to agree in order to react Riot about my proposition.\n\nI did a screen of what it could looks like. (I did not add the color on my screen, the idea of color is assigned to the french community).\nThx for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyvkul","date":"2015-04-24T23:36:38.246+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the suggestion.
