I&#039;m certain a lot of us alt+tab out and browse around the internet waiting for our turn to Ban/Pick. Since dynamic queue however there is a real huge inconstancy with being Alt+tabbed back in when its your turn to do something, sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn&#039;t. The biggest problem for me however is that sometimes you get an audio cue countdown and sometimes you don&#039;t.\n\nIs there any reasoning for this? I can&#039;t tell how many queues I have accidentally dodged just because of the inconsistency .","replies":[]}
