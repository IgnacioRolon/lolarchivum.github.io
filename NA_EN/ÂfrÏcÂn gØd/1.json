I&#039;m not following the logic of how Riot will be losing any money.. If someone wants a new champ, they are going to buy that champ at any time they feel like it is merited and they can afford it. It is a healthier decision to disable newly released champions from ranked just to avoid toxicity period. No, every new champ does not fall under the conditions of needing to be auto-banned but that shouldn&#039;t be the point.\n\nIf Riot is concerned with any and all toxicity or the escalation or provocation of toxicity, I would like to think healthy decisions would be made so that these toxic habitats arent even able to be formed in the first place. If you are able and willing to reform an entire honor system which impacts rewards which indirectly has impacted toxicity, I would think implementing small changes like disabling new champs as to make Ranked a little more palatable and &quot;fair&quot; wouldnt even be such a huge issue. \n\nThere is literally no substantially viable evidence that supports disabling new champs from ranked will in anyway endanger anything going on at Riot as a company nor League of Legends as a game. Minimizing loss should be a critical dynamic of playing Ranked, if the desired affect is to create some type of competitive environment apart from normals. There is little to no difference between Normals and low-elo Ranked at this point and the incentive to climb anywhere past gold or plat is diminishing for some players.\n\n I really wish the requirements for Ranked were broader instead of &quot;hit level 30, welcome to Ranked&quot; because the truth is people are boosting exp, hitting 30 and jumping straight into ranked with little to no substantial game knowledge of mechanics and such. Not to mention Flex queue is basically taken as serious as Norms are and ranked is and will always be riddled with trolls, afks and majority garbage premades. *shrugs* all i can do at this point is stay out of League politics, read patch notes, get gold every season for rewards, and not take the game as seriously as I once did. By lowering my expectations of this game, I also lower my disappointments.","replies":[]}
