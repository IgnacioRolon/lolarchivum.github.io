Life steal counters it and for some reason noobs keep building it first item with no hp to even sustain the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Thewhitebrow","date":"2016-08-16T04:43:12.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Item is bad and doesn't really do anything anymore. You get these weird situations where even a Yasuo with PD doesn't really take much dmg from thormail because there is dmg reduction and his shield so he can just AA and crit you to death without lifesteal and he doesn't really lose much health. I'm trying to think if I even see this item in competitive anymore. Its just awful unless on that sonic wannabe turtle, Rammus.","replies":[{"poster":"ÂFRÏCÂN GØD","date":"2016-08-16T21:12:41.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right its 'GOOD' on less than 5 champs. Its best bought when majority is ad no question.. It lacks in comparison to other items with better benefits. All it does is put a target on your back saying either focus me last or not at all lol I've watched people buy it and throw themselves into a fight thinking the enemy is dumb enough to attack them lol Sometimes even in full build w boots sold I still sell it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-08-16T03:13:47.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its shit and nobody can deny it. riot themselves can't either and they don't respond to any of these threads.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-08-15T22:20:43.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Life steal counters it?

The more armor you have the more thornmail does damage.. Hence why it counters life steal.. the stacks do more damage cause you have more armor..

Stop trying to explain something if you dont understand the situation. This is not about stats. This is about I no longer die to tanks with thornmail as any ad. Sorry if you still do.

Look it up yourself. I'm not the only one who KNOWS this item needs to be looked at again.

I got to plat this season and decayed and working on climbing back up. I've played all champs. Point is with the change in items n adcs, and with the item paths of ad items that are good on almost any ad champ, thornmail is not what it used to be. It needs to be changed accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-08-15T22:44:56.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Congrats on your climb!  Cant say I'd have the patience to go that high.\n\nFrom my own experience Thornmail isn't an item to take lightly, when buying or otherwise.  That being said if you have a way to generate HP on a champion in a frequent and easy way then you can get a bit more value out of the item.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-08-15T22:30:12.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have enough of a lead iver an opponent it isn't a bad first buy at all.
