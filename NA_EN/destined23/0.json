But if I knew, I wouldn&#039;t be asking. I am not salty at all and I admit I suck and probably don&#039;t deserve the higher level. I just want to know some tips and trick that allow me to get out of this shitty elo. I am currently Gold III (I do not play in NA anymore, I play in asia, game engine Garena) and soon to be demoted. I am dealing with 11/0 olaf with super speed and just locks in on me cuz im adc, 8/0 garen, 10/3 midlaners etc. I don&#039;t think roaming is a good idea because I play adc the most. So, anyone can help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2017-01-22T19:46:13.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use {{champion:40}} .

I thought that support is a bad role when you are trying to climb because they cannot carry and you have to rely on your teammates.
