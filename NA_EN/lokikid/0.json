It's not fun, but there are ways you can avoid getting placed with all those bots. You can try queueing up for different game modes to see if you still run into so many bots, or hit up the [**Player Recruitment**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) boards to see if you can team up with anyone!\n\nAlso, make sure to report anyone you suspect of botting in the post game lobby. That will help flag their account so that we can investigate!","replies":[{"poster":"The KDA is a lie","date":"2017-07-25T15:32:05.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broporo, with all due respect reporting bots does not do anything. I used to report at the end of game but it just doesn't do anything. I even went ahead and wrote down a list of bot accounts (there was a good 40 of them) and sent it to the support. \n\nAnd several months after, I decided to manually check 10 of these reported accounts on op.gg. And guess what, they all were there, and most now had \"normal\" games. Aka they were already bought. \n\n\nAlso to answer the original post, there are very few bots in 5v5 draft/blind. And bots are everywhere in ARAM or coop vs IA, regardless of your MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T00:26:25.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh you might have been choosing the wrong route to report those suspected bots, or they might have not turned out to be bots at all. In the future, make sure you use the report button in post game to issue reports. Shooting us a list of 40 names doesn't do much, since we then can't investigate any actions they might have taken.","replies":[{"poster":"The KDA is a lie","date":"2017-08-28T00:26:30.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> make sure you use the report button in post game to issue reports\n\nWhich one ? As far as I know, there is no report for being a bot. \nAlso I do report, under \"script, etc.\" whatever the actual label is.\n\n> they might have not turned out to be bots at all\n\nYep. Nope. I'm talking about accounts that \n- don't do anything first 30s\n- at 30s they all buy boots, no potion\n- at 30s they head mid\n- they proceed to all pile up and glitch into each others at one specific spot behind the first turret. \n- then the whole game they push in a straight line to the nexus, getting executed many times by turrets, etc. And never leave mid, ofc.\nThis is not a human behavior at all, there is no way to mistake a human for a bot.\n\n> Shooting us a list of 40 names doesn't do much, since we then can't investigate any actions they might have taken\n\nDoes that imply that when these account are reported using the report function, they'd get banned with no investigation on your side ? Or that you don't / can't investigate on your side ? The latter doesn't seem convincing to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T04:16:43.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still report people for bots even if we don't have a predetermined button for it. You click report, and fill out the bottom portion where you get to write anything.\n\nAs for everything you listed, those could definitely be signs of a bot, which is why you should report those actions. \n\nSo let me explain this last point in full detail. Say you shoot us a list of names. What are we supposed to do with that list, auto-ban them in hopes that you were telling the truth and not just trying to get someone banned? A list of names doesn't hold much weight to it. On the other hand, hitting that report button logs the game that you just played with them and attaches it to the report. That way, we have a match to look at to see what happened. Having some actual context tied to a name would actually give us some kind of evidence of what you're reporting, as opposed to a list of summoner names that could be anyone under the sun.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-28T08:50:25.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> regardless of your MMR.\n\nNope.
