The victory button never came up to end the match so I was stuck on the exploded enemy nexus with everyone dancing around. I force quite the client and when I got back to PvP.net I didn't have the game in my history and I didn't get LP for the win.","replies":[{"poster":"Scarey","date":"2016-10-20T19:35:51.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was with Galio. I still haven't seen it on my history","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-20T20:45:33.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!  Looking into this, it looks like that game was marked as unfinished and doesn't have any game stats.  This can happen if the game ends before the client can send the end-of-game message to the servers, or some glitch in communication between the servers.  It's not a common circumstance, but it does seem to be the case here.  For this specific case, if the match wasn't able to update by now it's likely going to remain as if it didn't exist.  I hope that helps clear things up, and best of luck in your following games!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-20T18:34:11.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which champion was this with?  There may have just been a delay with the server picking up the match, so everything could be okay now.  Let me know just in case!","replies":[]}]}
