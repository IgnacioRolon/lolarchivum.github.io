If you're using one, I recommend scaling down to another monitor if possible.  You can try reducing the resolution of your in-game screen as well as your monitor to see if that can help.  If this is the case for you, I can't make any guarantees but it's worth trying.   Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"MrHighMaintenanc","date":"2016-09-28T23:58:15.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DUDE!

I believe it's a 21 or 22 inch. And I was just reading around and other people are having similar problems that I am. I have Windows 10 and it just automatically updated a few days ago. I have been playing League on this same monitor with no problems for years now. This just started happening this patch and when Windows 10 updated itself.\n\nAt first, I was getting non-stop bug splats when I had it on the right resolution. Every game I joined was a bug splat. I toyed around with settings for a bit and I think it's all coming down to a resolution problem. Now I can join games, but I have to switch to a lower resolution that is about half the size of my screen. And when I switch to the resolution that the game is SUPPOSE to be on, it either bug splats immedietely, or it will go full screen with game graphics all messed up and my mouse clicking far from where it's suppose to. I've been messing around with different resolution variables for days and and nothing is matching up. Hope this sheds more light on the problem and someone can help me.\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"MrHighMaintenanc","date":"2016-09-28T23:38:48.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ohh and I forgot to mention i'm running my screens resolution at 1600 x 900","replies":[]}]}]}]}
