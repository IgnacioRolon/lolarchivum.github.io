The downside is, we might have a tough time getting back into regular games on SR and it becomes a burden. Whenever I get to this point, I can&#039;t help but simply put league aside because at that point in time it couldn&#039;t be easier and I just hope for URF to come back.  I feel like this game has lost the flair that it once had. I understand that a game that is tied to eSports must be continuously changing otherwise the entertainment part of the game could dwindle. I totally understand that the game was meant to be for everybody and you know, promote competitive play between players, but there&#039;s something that Riot is missing in its view and it&#039;s the regular people who play the game. We aren&#039;t those same players who are trying to play competitively at a high tier. We simply aren&#039;t. Most of the time games are just adding to everyday stress by allowing games to be weighed down by players who simply don&#039;t care. There&#039;s a problem in the logic there. If you want players to play competitively, you can&#039;t allow players who don&#039;t care to play. And you can&#039;t screen someone out prior to playing a game because you just don&#039;t know if somebody is going to purposely feed or whatever. \r\n\r\nBy putting these &quot;borders&quot; around the player base. By saying that players shouldn&#039;t verbally abuse each other or by not allowing us to play URF all the time and only exposing us to it for brief periods of time, you increase the amount of unhappiness among players. And the unhappiness isn&#039;t something that is healthy. It&#039;s bound to affect ranked games for players of all tiers. Unhappiness among players doesn&#039;t exactly mean that the players will quit because that&#039;s part of what addiction is. \r\n\r\nI ask that you, Riot, bring back ARURF or any URF into League of Legends on a permanent basis. And if anything, bring back all the game modes. Many players are just too unhappy with the game and I feel that the players are being ignored. We aren&#039;t being asked the right questions in surveys. If you can&#039;t see what it is players want and all you do is focus on eSports, we&#039;re going to increasingly become unhappy.\r\n\r\nThe report system doesn&#039;t help and just gives us a reason to be mad at players.  \r\n\r\nPlease. Bring URF back permanently. Please. For the players who are just too unsatisfied with competitive playing and simply can&#039;t compete or can&#039;t deal with those stresses, please allow us to pick a different gamemode.\r\n\r\nAnd what&#039;s up with ARAM not being a real random? What is that nonsense?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-31T01:57:40.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF makes people burn out. It would need some big changes and maybe an automated balance system that adjusts the strength of the buff to stick around permanently.\n\nRiot has shown stats for playrate, it falls off sharply after a few games (per person) or a few days in general - people get tired of it, or more importantly of getting mortared by AP tryndamere.\n\n> And what's up with ARAM not being a real random? What is that nonsense?\n\nPeople hate actual randomness, such as getting urgot 4 times in a row after never having played him before (more likely than you would expect!)\n\nThe system seems to favor champions you play (among other things) instead of being truly random, and it also seems to organize team comp to some degree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P4ppino","date":"2018-05-31T06:49:45.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urf shouldn't be in the game permanently, the magic of it would be lost.
