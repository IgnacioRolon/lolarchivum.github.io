DIM RACK is the summoner name. I got nothing but flame coming from the mid laner and support. They threatened to report me multiple times because all 3 lanes were asking for help and I can not assist all 3 lanes at once. This was paired by them calling me a &quot;F**king idiot&quot; and telling me to learn how to jungle. This was in an unranked blind game. I did not respond negatively in any way I only gave them response to their poor behavior which did not even include me cursing them out like they did me.... I responded in oks and carried on with my game. I believe I handled myself rather well and in no way was toxic, let alone to warrant a 14 day ban. Being subject to the ban, I now realize how your ban system works. If 3 or more people report you it doesn&#039;t matter what you say or do, you&#039;re getting penalized no matter what. This is an unjust ban system as people who simply just want to play the game get penalized when something doesn&#039;t go another player&#039;s way. Again, I did not curse AT ALL or backlash at my teammates and STILL recieved a ban but they did not. This is crazy. I am asking Riot, that you review my chat logs for that game and PLEASE reconsider this ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-01-28T11:20:18.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking post due to its severe age.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact us on Discuss the Boards or the Boards Discord.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2018-06-29T22:49:51.233+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi DIM RACK,\n\nWe take false positives very seriously and don't want players unfairly penalized so I took a deeper look here.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that the logs posted here have been modified and aren't the complete logs provided in your reform card.

I know plenty of people and I can give out all the names that do that kind of thing and don`t get punished because it happens just now and then.\n\nYes, this not the account's first penalty and is basically their 3rd offense going through the normal escalation system, as described here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-\n\nThe system escalates the penalty in hopes that the player will understand a stronger signal (suspension) and change their approach, because the weaker signal (chat restriction) hasn't worked for them to encourage sufficient improvement based on the community and system's eyes (as they're still offending players and getting reports deemed valid). Certainly there are more extreme phrases and language that players may be used that that could accelerate the process and jump a few steps to an immediate ban for instance, things along the lines of hate speech or death threats, but that's not the path this case took.\n\n\nWhile the language in this particular chat log wouldn't have incurred an immediate ban, there are elements of negativity and harassment which could hurt other players and could be penalty-worthy offenses, especially if we're considering the implications of phrases. For example, calling for reports. Let's dive into that a bit.\n\nDespite the word phrasing sounding benign on the surface (\"report\" isn't a bad word on its own) when someone calls for another player to be reported, there's a few implications under the hood, which really result in an attack on the player:\n\n1. they're publicly expressing frustration towards another player\n2. they're associating the target player with someone who exemplifies behaviors that would be valid to report for\n3. they're asking for something negative to happen to the target player, like a chat restriction, ban, or worse.\n4. and if they're doing it in All chat especially, they're also asking everyone else in the game to join in and gang up to hurt this player, context or no context, and maybe even seeking validation from others on the negative feelings they have towards the target player\n\n...and the target player on the receiving end of this probably feels all these things in some shape or form. Unless you're friends, in a premade, or just happen to click with someone's personality, you'll risk the target player taking it negatively and feel attacked, hurt, and maybe even frustrated enough to submit a report at the end of game.\n\nBONUS: For those who are looking to learn and aren't sure how to assess how others may interpret what they're saying, here's my personal high level take, which is basically 3 questions I ask myself: (examples included for fun)\n\n1. Do i have good intentions behind my statements? (e.g., am i saying something because I'm angry and want to vent, or is there something genuine to be discussed here or something that needs to be clarified?)\n2. Is what I'm saying/doing good for me? (e.g., is the thing I'm about to say going to help me win my lane, take objectives, or lead to victory?)\n3. Is what i'm saying/doing good for others?  (e.g., is telling someone that they're bad or did something poorly a few minutes ago actually going to help them right now? is it going to teach them something, or help them perform better in game, or increase the team's odds of making better decisions and winning? is it going to make people laugh or have a more enjoyable time? Is it going to have negative consequences for others, make them feel worse, or perform worse? are my positive intentions getting blocked by my choice of words and coming across the wrong way?)\n\n...If I'm not getting a clear 'Yes' on all 3 questions, there's usually something I can improve, and an increased chance I'm going to come off offensive or unsportsmanlike in some way.\n\nBasically it comes down to this:\n1. Please don't call for reports. Just don't do it.\n2. Consider the implications of the things being said, because at the end of the day, people will remember the way you made them feel, but not necessarily the specific words you've used.\n3. Think about and be honest with the consequences of your words. If words didn't have power, we wouldn't be using them.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-07-03T02:26:12.456+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think an aspect of calling for reports that Riot really should tackle is the belief by many players that the more reports someone gets in a single game the more likely they are to get punished. This of course isn't true as you know, but a huge percentage of players believe that to be how it works. If no one believed this there would possibly be no one telling people to report others.\n\nI feel that Riot should do a worldwide PSA in client that tells everyone this. It still wouldn't convince everyone of course but it would let many know who currently don't and could significantly reduce the number of instances of this behavior. It might be worth while to repeat this PSA every 6 months or so to catch new and returning players.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-07-03T02:37:18.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BatmanSeries","date":"2018-07-03T04:23:02.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Despite the word phrasing sounding benign on the surface (&quot;report&quot; isn&#x27;t a bad word on its own) when someone calls for another player to be reported, there&#x27;s a few implications under the hood, which really result in an attack on the player:\n> \n> 1. they&#x27;re publicly expressing frustration towards another player\n> 2. they&#x27;re associating the target player with someone who exemplifies behaviors that would be valid to report for\n> 3. they&#x27;re asking for something negative to happen to the target player, like a chat restriction, ban, or worse.\n> 4. and if they&#x27;re doing it in All chat especially, they&#x27;re also asking everyone else in the game to join in and gang up to hurt this player, context or no context, and maybe even seeking validation from others on the negative feelings they have towards the target player\n> \n\nyou guys can make me talking a dump sound like i just committed genocide","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-06-30T01:31:15.970+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah there it is.\nGriefing, flaming, inflammatory, and harassment. \nThis is what you must have done consistently in order to get a 14-day ban.

Yes.\n\nDepending on how game went (because we don't know who the fault was for the feeding and bad team environment), this chat could not even be punishable material. \n\nI'm sorry, but the biggest problem of the current report system is that people do not report properly, as people do not really report as much as they should people behaving in a manner that damage your team (not talking about having bad games, I'm talking about having behaviour like not listening to call or advices or responding to them in a toxic manner), and it's enough to have a spike in reports in a pair of consecutive games because players decide to gang up on you to get a punshiment despite actually having toxic/feeders players causing the problems, but people will get annoyed at you for calling out these people, which in this case happened to be the third punishment, which is not a light punishment (14-day ban is a pretty heavy punishment)\n\nIt is not enough to say \"just mute\", because then this people will go unpunished for the reason above, and a lot of toxic players will go on and on ruining games, and it's enough that these players have some good games next, or games where people do not care to use the report feature properly, to have no further consequences going forward.\n\nAnd, as the premise, I'm not even saying he is not guilty, it really depends on how the game went, because it could be a case of the OP making false accusations and creating himself a bad environment picking on players that just tried but had bad games because he was bad on his jungling role and they were putting in trouble by his play  - after all, level 21 account with 3 punishment is a pretty big red flag on OP -, or it could be a case of people legit reporting him in an unfair manner, we just don't know, and games like those should be heavily analized by Rioters with their tools, which should include the complete game chats (as we see only a small part of them) and tools to analyze game actions through the logs\n\nIn a vacuum, though, there is no way you can say these are penalizable worthy material, because there is no way you can actually estabilish if he was in right in defending himself or he was an toxic a*shole making false accusations, only Rioters know","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-07-01T18:43:44.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Riot nor the board disputes who started what.\nIt's about what they continue to do.
