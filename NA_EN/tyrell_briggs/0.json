I got an A+. Is this not an S-quality game? Granted, it's ARAM, but isn't this worthy of at least an S-? I'm new to this game, so I don't know if I needed to have done better.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-03T20:14:17.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An A+ is a pretty solid score, but ARAM is pretty cutthroat.  Champions like Tristana can perform very well in ARAM, and a lot of players may have had even better games.  More info is also available in our [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide.  While it may not have been an S this time, don't discredit yourself from a really good performance!","replies":[]}]}
