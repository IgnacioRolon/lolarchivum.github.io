I going to guess that you may have just now updated to the new client? If this is your first time using it, you may have gotten a notification about receiving a gift/reward, but that notification is probably in reference to something you got awhile back. It's kind of weird, but using the new client for the first time has a chance of alerting you to gifts/icons you got in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Hook W Control","date":"2017-04-25T14:47:35.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm using the new client since it first came out but it's true about the fact that I did an update just before logging in","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Choi Young Jun","date":"2017-04-24T23:13:07.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"icon image?","replies":[{"poster":"Hook W Control","date":"2017-04-24T23:27:01.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like i said it's not","replies":[]}]}]}
