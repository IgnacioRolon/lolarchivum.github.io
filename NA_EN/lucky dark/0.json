Granted Shockblade zed (which I own) looks super sweet. I can't help but feel the fact that Vel'Koz a newer champ has received an awesome new skin is a bit unfair. Also, Braum a newer champ than Zed also just got a new skin. Now I understand there are massive reworks in the process for older champs but seeing newer champs than Zed get new skins is rather irksome. \n\nNow a few thoughts I have for a new Zed skin include: Full metal Zed, Blood moon Zed and Spec Ops Zed. I know there are other awesome Zed skin ideas and I'd like to hear them!","replies":[{"poster":"fwL7umeoQe","date":"2015-02-02T21:12:33.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think {{champion:238}} is an extremely broken champ and should just stay in the shadows for a while. (hehe)  No but really, he's too much of a forgiving champion, has stupid amounts of wave clear, and is overall OP. So I'd rather not waste a ban on him every game and just let him sink into the background. A new skin would cause a Zed every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zahz","date":"2015-02-02T21:08:27.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he got the skt1 zed skin to","replies":[]}]}
