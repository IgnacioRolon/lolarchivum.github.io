People are called &quot;muri%%%s&quot;, the usual stereotype of Americans being labeled as dumb, fat, and lazy, the list goes on.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not keen on following results from the LCS and so I have no information regarding the performance of the US teams. A question arises: is this NA bashing the result of teams like CLG or TSM performing poorly on tournaments or is it yet another case of impotent downies parading their hill-billy mentality by cursing at the US?\r\n\r\nPersonally I&#039;ve never experienced NA solo queue and have 0 interest in doing so. The stereotype, however, goes as follows: EU &gt; NA, NA is trash. On a personal level, I believe insulting a nation based on the performance in a children&#039;s game is the lowest form of idiocy and am more than convinced that such trash-talkers (even if they are 12-year-olds) are useless human waste, high-school dropouts, or just frustrated virgins whose acne count outnumbers their active brain cells.\r\n\r\nA following question arises: should those caught harassing NA (or any other region for that matter) be punished as if they were verbally harassing other players? Technically, saying &quot;X region is trash&quot; is basically saying all of the players there are trash and is actually verbal harassment on a global level. If this trend were to continue, I would personally hate to be associated with the EU region in any way, shape or form, seeing as how the European mentality in this game is that of a castrated chimpanzee with Down syndrome:\r\n**_getting sodomized by Korean teams - let&#039;s insult the country which gave us the free game in the first place._**","replies":[{"poster":"MinaZer0","date":"2017-05-16T22:09:12.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"mhm.. but let us delve deeper..\n\nNA won the first Worlds ever, in 1945, If that would have never happened this world would be a much different place with much different freedoms, NA will always be best (girl) region because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2017-05-16T22:14:17.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ILittle IMonster,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=d7EaZL8u,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-16T22:09:12.078+0000)\n>\n> mhm.. but let us delve deeper..\n> \n> NA won the first Worlds ever, in 1945, If that would have never happened this world would be a much different place with much different freedoms, NA will always be best (girl) region because of this.\n\nWhat?

But we thank them and appreciate whatever help they can provide nonetheless.

NA got a bad rap when, back in Season 3, teams didn't take practice as seriously and focused more on living the lifestyle that esports money afforded them.  Besides TSM, CLG, and C9, there weren't really any other teams on their level (you could still argue the same today but I think a case could be made for Immortals, Echo Fox, etc.), so there weren't any decent practice partners. NA always talks about \"winning worlds\" as the ultimate goal, and it's a good goal to have, but given the effort put into achieving that goal, it didn't seem to align with their actions. So other regions started calling NA \"lazy\" and the like.\n\nThe NA teams have certainly buckled down since then. If you compare the current TSM mindset/practice regime to season 3 TSM's, you'll see a stark difference. Seems like most LCS teams also now have a trainer to keep the players in top physical performance as well, which is super helpful to achieving a good mindset. But still, NA chokes on an international stage, regardless of the team. Locally, our teams always look solid, but it's sometimes like comparing a stock sports car to a NASCAR car. Sure, the stock car is decent, but the one specifically built for NASCAR would be way better. Then when on an international stage, it's like comparing the NA NASCAR to a Formula 1 car. Not even close.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R18","date":"2017-05-17T14:09:52.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA Soloq is really just a meme.
