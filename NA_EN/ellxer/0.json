I'm a player from Garena's PH LoL server but currently I'm in Japan for work. Thing is, I can't play my old account because of fking region block so I opted to play in the NA server because I still can't read full Kanji.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I don't have any means to purchase RPs. Our supervisors are overly strict about making credit cards, soooo, shit. So I tried every convenience stores, malls near in my location and not a single on of them are selling. So I'm out of options.\r\n\r\nReally hoping you guys (RIOT) would provide one. I have a fuck ton of money here ready to throw at you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T20:18:41.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it's been such a hassle to get RP.  :(  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in this case.
