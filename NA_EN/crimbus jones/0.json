{"poster":"Crimbus Jones","date":"2018-05-19T11:00:15.062+0000","title":"Riot, is this your idea of perma-bannable behavior in 2018?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Edit: here is a link the match history of said game <removed by moderation>\n\nTL;DR skip to comms that got me **PERMANENTLY BANNED**  Second and third paragraph explains context of comms:\n\nNever in my life have I been banned from a game until I played League of Legends.  Nonstop trolls, some days you mute them, some days you leave comms open in case you need to communicate something important but God forbid you annoy a troll whatsoever or tell them you will report them or you are BANNED.  \n\nI received a fourteen-day ban five months ago on my alternate account &quot;PraiseChrist&quot; (Username: Godisamazing1011) for telling off some trolls in an obnoxious and aggressive way.  I took my punishment in stride.  Decided to take a couple months break to cool off as my account was level 27, excited to have another fresh MMR'ed level 30, but I was in a place where I was going up against smurf after smurf + seemingly, people who got their alts banned on my team so they want to harass me for things like my name. \n\n Anyway, I got back from my hiatus, played like fifteen games over the course of three days when I entered a game where as ADC my Soraka support decided it be funny (for seemingly NO reason RIGHT from the start) to simply not heal me one time.  As in, stand there by the turret AFK with full health and mana whilst I try and adc.  Soon after that a duo of Taliyah and Ekko begin feeding and trolling and then starts trolling us in the surrender vote (myself and Vi, the only other serious player were trying to surrender and move on) telling us and others that I&#039;m voting no, so a lighthearted blame game of sort ensues.  So one hell of a troll match, as per usual but here are the comms that got me permanently banned:\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nPraiseChrist: heal me?\nPraiseChrist: wtf&gt;&gt;&gt;\nPraiseChrist: soraka im not playing passive you aren&#039;t even healing\nPraiseChrist: so i gotta mute you and solo this\nPraiseChrist: got your pings and everything muted\nPraiseChrist: gl lol\nPraiseChrist: guys make sure you report soraka\nPraiseChrist: didnt heal me once, she is trolling now roaming lol\nPraiseChrist: gj vi\nPraiseChrist: you&#039;re gonna want to camp bot since my support left\nPraiseChrist: although i shoudl be okay\nPraiseChrist: both ults?  Im flattered :)\nPraiseChrist: my soraka decided not to heal &lt;3\nPraiseChrist: was werid\nPraiseChrist: makes ure you report her for trolling :P\nPraiseChrist: just ff we got troleld\nPraiseChrist: nothing to do about it\nPraiseChrist: she may not be smurf it could just be ekko\nPraiseChrist: whaaaT?\nPraiseChrist: soraka and ekko LOL\nPraiseChrist: BULLSHIT\nPraiseChrist: i want out\nPraiseChrist: im literally 1 v 2ing\nPraiseChrist: why the fuck would iv ote no\nPraiseChrist: get your head on straight\nPraiseChrist: BRO just cause it aint ekko\nPraiseChrist: doesnt mean shit\nPraiseChrist: math\nPraiseChrist: taliyah since you are qued with him can you ask him why he is inting?\nPraiseChrist: aint no practice jsut cancer\nPraiseChrist: take your buddy through some bot games\nPraiseChrist: thank youf or finally telling your friend he is inting\nPraiseChrist: mb panth ulted me\nPraiseChrist: they gave up going top\nPraiseChrist: just voted yes\nPraiseChrist: who hasnt voted\nPraiseChrist: soraka vote yes\nPraiseChrist: how do we know it snot you?\nPraiseChrist: who was the one who said we were going to practice?\nPraiseChrist: cause thats who isnt voting\nPraiseChrist: oh\nPraiseChrist: damn irelia your feeding!\nPraiseChrist: now i knwo taliyah is lying cause i voted right after first one\nPraiseChrist: well then ekko then\nPraiseChrist: because id int read lol?\nPraiseChrist: nice excuse\nPraiseChrist: please dont report me vi i havent done anything wrong\nPraiseChrist: i didnt bring in an inter\nPraiseChrist: i got my lane trolled\nPraiseChrist: im literally doing nothing\nPraiseChrist: its over now :)\nPraiseChrist: i could have done better vi im sorry\nPost-Game\nPraiseChrist: honored vi\nPraiseChrist: i think sorak and ekko were in the same lobby\nPraiseChrist: with taliyah?\nPraiseChrist: i didnt report you soraka\nPraiseChrist: but the rest of the team did\nPraiseChrist: i didnt say roam map and troll buddy\nPraiseChrist: sorry\nPraiseChrist: i said work solo\nPraiseChrist: while i fight without her heals\nPraiseChrist: clueless\n\n\nNow it&#039;s worth mentioning that there were two other games listed in this PERMANENT SUSPENSION report from games I was ALREADY BANNED for months ago in which I was genuinely being a twat and just downright trolling chat.  (Wasn&#039;t being racist, homophobic, or saying anything really that BAD to people; was just being extremely immature and saying mostly dirty stuff.and I was rightfully banned for those games I suppose?)  But this was the only report I got after returning and apparently THIS was the straw that broke the camels back and justified a PERMANENT SUSPENSION of my hard earned account?  \n\nTell me something guys.  Why does Riot care more about how players use their comms in this game than how people play it?  Guarantee that Soraka troll is never going to be banned, but God forbid someone like me get on and decide to tell someone who is trolling me they are muted and GL standing around AFK while I solo it... now THAT&#039;S an example of the  00.1% toxic player base.\n\nI&#039;ll be submitting a ticket soon.

Hilariously enough, the player I supposedly \"harassed\" with abusive comms, by the end of the game I was just so tired of getting trolled by Ekko and his duo that I told Soraka I wasn't going to report her anymore.  I said this twice, once in game and once in post game.  Just goes to show what kinda person I am.  I took pity on her, figured maybe she just was at her breaking point was tired of assholes... whatever, yah know?  But what can you do man.

Great idea :)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GLhEpbX \n\nSo as you can see my friend, eventually as time went on she did do at least some healing; now whether this was just to herself or her ult or whatever I am not sure.  The only thing I am positive of is that for the first five minutes she refused to press W a single time despite her having full health and mana and be desperately needed it.  \n\nAs time went on she stopped flaming me and began to use ult and stuff despite still feeding and roaming to each lane to die.  I am not sure how her heals compare to the rest of ours as their enemy team has people who far surpassed her but it's best not to dwell on it as I ended up giving Soraka the benefit of the doubt and didn't report her.  Unfortunately, I am pretty sure she reported me because she was salty that I didn't like her early game trolling. \n\n Was really a lame move on her part considering she, strictly speaking, lost this game for us between her and Ekko.  Do notice though that I stopped \"harassing\" her very soon into the game and turned my attention to the fact that the Taliyah and Ekko duo were not surrendering and then blaming the \"no\" votes on myself and Vi.

Riot may be huge, but they are still just a company.  They have flaws.  They have bugs.  They make mistakes, and you know what?  There is a massive possibility that some of the systems they employ are wrong.   It's our responsibility as the games constituents not always swim downstream.  Sometimes we need to fight the current and draw the line in the stand.  \n\nMy opinion: this report system is massively flawed.  I run into toxicity every single day.  Trolls, toxic people, everything and anything that's cancer.  If this report system was good then why do I run into people with such nefarious purpose on the daily?  Surely they'd all be banned by now with a system this sensitive?  Maybe I just need to learn the kekywords that the bot scan picks up out of my vocab.  If anyone has the list to those, hmu!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/h2II3B7","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-05-19T12:54:04.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Punishable, yes.

I wasn't being toxic to anyone besides (arguably) Soraka who again, was literally not healing, there was no \"misscommunication\" as someone previously said. \n\n  If you could see the full comms you'd see me say \"wtf soraka heal\" and she flat out says, \"no\" then stands there.  Then she probably ended up reporting me and I got banned even though it was a five months ago that I even played and a solid year or so before 70% of those reports were made but I guess Riot doesn't give a fuck if you took a break or not, they are all about scanning with their bots to ban as many 0.001%'ers as possible.\n\n<removed by moderation>","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-05-19T15:08:00.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trigger words are zero-tolerance stuff like hate speech (homophobia and such) and invitation to self harm.
