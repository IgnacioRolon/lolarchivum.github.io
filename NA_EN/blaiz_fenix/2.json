I was thinking they might actually give Tibbers a voice.  It would only make sense to me that a child who was that magically talented would be able to make Tibbers capable of actual speech as well.  Most children who talk to their toys tend to imagine them talking back, after all.  I don't think there is anything wrong with Annie's actual lines currently, though if they wanted to add in a few other lines to make it a bit more in-line with the changes in Swain/Noxus in general, that would be understandable, but it would be considered a VO update to her to add in a voice for Tibbers.  \n\nI guess I just see it like... imagine if Kindred only had Lamb's voice.  Wouldn't you really want to have Wolf's too?
