In the past I've done other secret things, and then I moved onto another secret team (which closed down).\n\nSo mostly I do secret things, I guess.  In Worldbuilding I've worked on the Runeterra map (and thus the Medarda Heirloom), a timeline of all canon events, I keep track of open plot hooks, champ facts, player-facing-ness, and work on various world-building background info (population, distances, currencies, tech levels - that kind of stuff).  Things that help keep everything consistent and aligned, and generally provide feedback to the other worldbuilders, artists, and writers.\n\nMy title isn't especially illuminating any more, but what kind of a title do you have when you're doing that sort of stuff AND secret things you can't even talk about??  I'm open to suggestions :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-08T23:57:05.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"World designer?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-02-08T23:43:14.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=eEU9uH8X,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-02-08T23:24:48.733+0000)\n>\n> My title isn&#x27;t especially illuminating any more, but what kind of a title do you have when you&#x27;re doing that sort of stuff AND secret things you can&#x27;t even talk about??
