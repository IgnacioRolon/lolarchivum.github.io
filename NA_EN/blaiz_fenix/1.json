The flair will unlock for your next matchmade game.\n\n> My flair disappeared after one game, why?\n\n> They’re meant to show off that you’re coming off a great game, so they only last one game. Once you're level 3 or better, get an Honor from two premade teammates or one stranger to unlock flair in your next game.\n\n> Is there a cooldown on loading screen flairs?\n\n> Nope. If you keep earning honors, you'll keep your flair across each game you rock the Rift and earn honors.\n\n> Will I get a different loading screen flair per category?\n\n> Not today, but that's a damn good idea.\n\n> Do they get bigger like Champ Mastery?\n\n> They do!

They can even go to sleep, not play anything all night, wake up, and boom, honor level without doing anything.\n\nHappens with 3, 4, and 5.. and it seems like if you're behind your rate of honor gain increases to catch up with the rest of the crowd (I hit honor level 5 last season the same time as everybody else.. but my friend who never plays league when from honor 2 to 5 the same month on 3 games per week.)","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-02-07T04:26:42.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it has to refresh.
