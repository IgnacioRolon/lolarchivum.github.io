Should grievous wounds be a starter item quest?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I mostly play normals, but I believe that Morellonomicon is a staple of most midlane mages? It seems to me that it can take away from some mage builds, particularly ones which rely on certain other item combos (like Lich&#039;s Bane) which are always pushed to mid-late game because of the need to rush Morellonomicon. Is Grievous Wounds really that important? If it is, why not have it integrated into mage starter items?\n\nHere&#039;s an idea I&#039;ve come up with:\n\n{{item:1056}} **Doran&#039;s Ring**\n>Total 400 Gold\n+60 Health\n+15 Ability Power\n\n>**Passive:** Restores 3 Mana every 5 seconds.\n**UNIQUE Passive:** Restores 4 Mana upon killing a unit.\n\n>**QUEST:** Restore 600 mana using this item.\n**REWARD:** Gain **UNIQUE Active - Cursed Strike:** Magic damage dealt to champions inflicts them with Grievous Wounds for 3 seconds.\n\nMaybe even be able to upgrade it into an Oblivion Orb\n\n{{item:3916}} **Oblivion Orb**\n>{{item:1056}} (400) + {{item:1052}} (435) + 665 Gold\nTotal 1500 Gold\n\n>+40 Ability Power ~~+25~~\n+120 Health ~~+200~~\n\n>**Passive:** Restores 3 Mana every 5 seconds.\n**UNIQUE Passive:** Restores 4 Mana upon killing a unit.\n**UNIQUE Passive - Touch of Death:** +15 Magic Penetration\n\n>**QUEST:** Restore 600 mana using this item.\n**REWARD:** Gain **UNIQUE Active - Cursed Strike:** Magic damage dealt to champions inflicts them with Grievous Wounds for 3 seconds.\n\n{{item:3165}} **Morellonomicon**\n>{{item:3916}} (1500) + {{item:1026}} (850) + 650 Gold\nTotal 3000 Gold\n\n>+80 Ability Power\n+300 Health\n\n>**UNIQUE Passive - Touch of Death:** +15 Magic Penetration\n**UNIQUE Passive - Cursed Strike:** Magic damage dealt to champions inflicts them with Griecous Wounds for 3 seconds.\n\nThe quest becomes redundant once you acquire Morellonomicon, but you wouldn't have to wait that long if you're catching cs well. Basically, you can get grievous wounds without morellonomicon, and you can also get morellos anyway. But now we got a problem that building off of a Dorans item removes 400 gold from most mage builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-03-30T01:56:48.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 seconds is far too short.

So if your champion benefits from magic penetration, you can build {{item:3165}}, but with this version you'll never have to rush it.","replies":[]}]}]}
