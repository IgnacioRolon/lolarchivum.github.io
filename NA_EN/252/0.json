I'll queue for a game and go through pick and ban phase just fine.  The game loads and starts as normal and by the time minions have spawned and hit lane, my fps will have spikes about every 30 seconds   .  so every 30 seconds or so it drops to about 17-24 fps and stays there for 5-10 seconds then snaps back to 80 fps for another 30 seconds.  It's enough to royally mess me up csing/teamfighting and makes LoL unplayable for me.  I updated drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled, changed my BiOS settings and intel graphics settings AND firewall to give priority to the game, and nothing has worked, i've disabled all the vsync, predictive movement, and other settings that might cause lag in game, but nothing has fixed it.  The only thing that fixed my problem was buying and installing a new driver, but only LoL is giving me this issue and i am not going to spend money on a new driver just for LoL.  Other games like Overwath give me no trouble at all fps wise and ping wise.  Every other game my laptop can handle plays just fine, it is only League.  It has become very tilting because people have been telling me the game runs fine and to just play through these drops but it is literally unplayable in this condition for myself.  \r\n\r\nrant over. rito pls help i want to play but ur game is broken on my laptop.
