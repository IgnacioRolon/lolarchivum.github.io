Is there anything that I am missing / not understand?\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T21:37:52.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The inspiration rune tree should unlock at level 17 since it's got a few more nuanced choices in there. I don't think they wanted really new players getting confused with some of those more complicated options.","replies":[{"poster":"anarchyattack","date":"2017-12-15T22:17:56.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty! :) Lol wiki should get that info!
