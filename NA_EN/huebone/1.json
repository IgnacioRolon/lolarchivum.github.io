There was no sign of the game disconnecting or anything and when I finally connected I got the defeat sign. The game was remade, but I got leaverbuster for being afk. There were no signs of me being disconnected. I understand that I got leaverbuster because there are a few games where I have to leave due to outside circumstances, but this time I had no control over the situation, I was just waiting on the loading screen and it connected me AFTER the game was over.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-06T23:52:09.277+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It sounds like you may have taken quite a while to load into the match.

I've never had any unfortunate events of the client crashing on me during loading as of late. But there are times when I'm in loading screen and I'll get the 'client crashed need to restart'.. Then once I restart the client, all of a sudden theres 'no internet connection' for the client.. but I am so casually browsing and watching Twitch streams. The only solution to the 'no connection' thing to the client is completely restarting my computer.. I have 170mb down and 12mb up.","replies":[]}]}]}
