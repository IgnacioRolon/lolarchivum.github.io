I experienced a type of movement delay lag from the server.\n\n It started at red buff, after it died the model was still there and when I walked to the raptor camp the models did not appear, when I started using abilities and shift click, my health was going down and I was clearing, though the models did not appear and it seems as if there was a delay with my Q. \n\nMy end of the internet was completely fine, I reconnected my router, reconnected my pc to the internet, and both before and after I had normal connection to all websites. When I checked the Riot server status and Riot websites there were extreme delays in connections., though not on any other website. And when attempting to reconnect, the Client said something about having a problem with connecting to the login authentication.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add this, https://gyazo.com/428aa0cadbf6cad95af536201cea7b1c it has been loading like this since the delays, every other website is fine, except for Riot ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-09T19:01:31.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to alter game stats or points, though I do appreciate you looking out for your teammates.  It sounds like you had a connection issue like packet loss that caused a delay between the game server and yourself.
