They don't show the \"Dissapear on November 6\" message though.\r\n\r\nWould be fun if someone could confirm to me wether they will dissapear or not tommorow.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T02:33:58.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If an icon is **upgradeable** or can be crafted into something, it will show up in your loot. Since the Worlds Icon sitting in your loot is technically *craftable material*, it should be removed soon as part of our directive to remove worlds crafting materials from accounts now that worlds has passed by.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
