For example the 25-4 WW you played against today is Silver 3 with 400 games played. He is right where he belongs, not smurfing. Just because someone says they're a smurf or a higher level player does not make it true. You encountered someone who is stuck in silver just like you. You won't leave silver until you focus on yourself and your own improvement, not the play of people around you.\n\nAlso your build on Thresh in that specific game is pretty awful, use Probuilds.com or some similar site. Focus on making yourself the best player possible.","replies":[{"poster":"TankAlex","date":"2017-03-04T07:01:04.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"did you look at his match history i dont see many silver 3's going 20/5 roughly every game and when the guy says sorry guys this isnt my normal account this is a smurf after the game. i know my build wasnt the best but the game was decided by 10 mins when my 0/5 jungler kept trying to heman in to the 10/2 ww\n\ni get what your saying about differentiating tho\ni do what i can to try and focus on my play its just getting really frustrating to see ","replies":[{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2017-03-04T07:59:53.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TankAlex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0EZG8K8V,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-03-04T07:01:04.732+0000)\n>\n> did you look at his match history i dont see many silver 3&#x27;s going 20/5 roughly every game and when the guy says sorry guys this isnt my normal account this is a smurf after the game. i know my build wasnt the best but the game was decided by 10 mins when my 0/5 jungler kept trying to heman in to the 10/2 ww\n> \n> i get what your saying about differentiating tho\n> i do what i can to try and focus on my play its just getting really frustrating to see\n\nIf that's the case, they won't be Silver 3 for long.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Brain ErrÃ¶r 404","date":"2017-03-04T08:45:20.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you stop playing for awhile? Pretty odd you'd go from Gold S4>S5 Plat to Silver S6? If you're rusty, that's understandable. But if you've just been failing these seasons to enjoy your climb back to plat, I don't see why you're struggling in Silver. There's a pretty smaller amount of higher leveled smurfs than you'd think. Most times it's just silver people in silver that make new accs cause they aren't climbing on their regular account.\n\nOther than that, it'll be gold players smurfing in silver because they aren't moving anywhere. Rarely you'll run into a Diamond smurf or something in silver due to the fact that most diamond smurfs will be around Gold-Plat elo.","replies":[{"poster":"TankAlex","date":"2017-03-05T06:25:36.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't play most of season 6 because I didn't like the meta I actually lost gold an hour before ranked went down","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-04T06:44:01.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you know they're smurfing?
