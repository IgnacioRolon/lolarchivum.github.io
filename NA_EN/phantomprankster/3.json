League is a group based game with very little solo content that is actually fulfilling.\n\nIt doesn't get any better at the higher ranks, and I think it's kind of... false to attribute your experience as there not being new players.  The game is VERY good and recognizing new accounts for experienced players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2017-08-07T21:14:51.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you just describe children in online gaming in general","replies":[]},{"poster":"Isedelica","date":"2017-08-07T21:13:32.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have only been playing for what a year im considered new lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blutseuche","date":"2017-08-08T01:45:38.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crumbling soon?\n\nThis Season is the most enjoyable time i ever had in LoL. It has good visuals, Cool Champ Designs, a meaningful Honor System, good Punishment system (Except for Inting, that has a long way to go), it gets regular updates on old Champs, which modernizes them, without changing the price (hello Warwick Poppy and the upcoming Ryze Rework).\nWe get a \"Warded\"-Ping, we have SoloQ aswell as FlexQ and 3v3 Rankeds, the Dia V-Plat I is more or less fixed, i know a lot of people that started LoL not a long time ago, so it is still a fresh game that welcomes casuals extremly well, Riot is listening to our complains so often, killing our Memes. Runesystem gets reworked, so all the people i play with get their Ip refunded and can purchase Champs.\n\nLike, holy shit, LoL does has flaws, but heck, im spamming LoL so much right now and i enjoy it to the fullest atm. I think this Season is the best Season to start the game, with all the ressources of learning we have and the way the game is played. I cant imagine it dying out in the near future, as long as we dont have an Apocalypse or giant World War or anything like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-07T21:13:00.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea yea yea, League's dead is litterally what people have been saying last 3 years and yet it still tops.
