Vision is strong but the ADC would be forced to basically lane themselves while the support just wanders around the map clearing vision the entire game. Can't imagine it'd be that fun being the support either with nothing to defend yourself. And I don't want Twitch-like Ezreal, MF, etc. Then again, if a support could stealth an ally, this could help melee champions like Riven and such go bot lane....But I really don't know if I wanna see everyone get free stealth.

Stealth would be something new, but it still needs some sort of traditional support potential to be effective. If it didn't you'd end up with a champ that can't support as well as other champions like Thresh, Janna, Leona, or even Nautilus. The reason Nautilus and Leona are effective without a heal or shield for their team is because they have too much cc and tankiness to not pay attention to. If this champion doesn't have tankiness and cc then all you need to do is blow them up and the enemy adc is short a support and they don't have the stealth advantage anymore. If the champion has too much stealth and no heal or shield then they become an assassin without enough damage. If they have not enough stealth and a shield or heal then the stealth becomes a useless gimmick. \nDon't get me wrong it's a good idea and it can be done, but it needs to have the characteristic traits of a support as well, and they need to balance the stealth and heal/shield in order to be useful without being broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2018-01-08T07:26:35.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought you were gonna talk about a support that stealthily buffs their allies and that shit sounds bomb as fuck","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2018-01-09T20:35:37.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hello I am Bird,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fcE7w3nP,comment-id=0033,timestamp=2018-01-08T07:26:35.480+0000)\n>\n> I thought you were gonna talk about a support that stealthily buffs their allies and that shit sounds bomb as fuck\n\nThat would actually be lit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShiniXII","date":"2018-01-07T11:28:29.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GOD I LOVE STEALTH PLEASE ADD MORE STEALTH CHAMPIONS TO THIS FUCKING GAME ITS NOT AS IF ITS NOT A SHITHOLE FULL OF INVISIBLE CHAMPIONS THAT JUST KILL YOU WHEN THEY LEAVE STEALTH IN 0.75S BUT LETS ADD MORE TO FUCK UP THINGS, AND MAKE SURE THAT CONTROL WARD ONLY REVEALS THE WORTHLESS SILOUTTE OF THE CHARACTER SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COUNTERPLAY","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2018-01-09T20:26:30.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShiniXII,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fcE7w3nP,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2018-01-07T11:28:29.019+0000)\n>\n> GOD I LOVE STEALTH PLEASE ADD MORE STEALTH CHAMPIONS TO THIS FUCKING GAME ITS NOT AS IF ITS NOT A SHITHOLE FULL OF INVISIBLE CHAMPIONS THAT JUST KILL YOU WHEN THEY LEAVE STEALTH IN 0.75S BUT LETS ADD MORE TO FUCK UP THINGS, AND MAKE SURE THAT CONTROL WARD ONLY REVEALS THE WORTHLESS SILOUTTE OF THE CHARACTER SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COUNTERPLAY\n\nTeemo shaco eve rengar teemo twitch talon alkali in a game with nearly 200 characters possibly more I didn't count specifically\n\nYou're bitching that there are too many?
