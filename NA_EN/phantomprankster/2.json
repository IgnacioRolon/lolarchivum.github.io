I think his mana is where it needs to be. I play a lot of bot lane too, especially when he was hyper strong there. It's a strategy I found to be very useful. Just stand in the ranged minions, he walks up, W, you walk out, he just shoves the wave. It's even better if you stand near the W'd minions because he will almost always try to E to try and hit you, costing more mana and shoving even harder. Then, they push in, and you ping. Spam ping if need be. Type something. Yeah, solo queue junglers, especially low ELO, have very little awareness very often, which is why you need to take matters into your own hands and force their attention. We also can't use solo queue, low ELO behavior as a balancing point. We can't say Brand needs mana nerfs because junglers don't gank. His mana costs are decent, and in lane he is annoying, however there are easy ways to play around him. \n\nHe may harass you under tower, but your jungler should also be there when that happens. If not, it's not a champion problem but a player problem.  His passive would be a fine place to him him, but the mana costs seem to be where they need to be, especially since they recently tried to put him back mid by buffing his mana costs. It would be counter intuitive to nerf them, that would put him back more in the supp role than they intend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2018-03-21T19:04:59.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=flibitydoo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FXYzuX0t,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-03-21T17:00:43.014+0000)\n>\n> 1. depending on ganks in soloQ is extremely stupid.

You can't dodge them all, but your health bar is just another resource and sometimes you have to use it to win. You can dodge many, and I'm sure someone who one tricks Brand support could hit me more than I'm used to, but overall Brand is a mage support that supports pick because they don't really support and just want to do damage and carry. W forces movement, so move away from him and the W. The Q is rendered null, and then the E can either be dodged or eaten, but he doesn't max it first so it does minimal damage while shoving the wave extremely hard. I'm talking a typical middle of the lane scenario where the melee's clash, there's that gap, then ranged minions sit. If he wants to Q you, he needs to be in the bush, or above by the river. Whichever side he is on, you bait from the opposite side in the minions. I don't know if it was misinterpreted when I said stand in them like you want him to W the entire wave, no. It's mainly forcing him to W the ranged minions. If you can somehow get him to do the entire wave, fucking great. But usually it's just the back line but it's enough for a push. He will land a W here and there when you misstep or if he gets the jump on you, but overall it's obvious when he's looking to W and generally, it works. That's why Brand isn't seen too much anymore, his win rates are just barely positive, and overall isn't being looked at too much.\n\nAnyways, if they want to nerf him, they won't do it via mana. They want him mid more, not supp. He needs base damage reduction, increased scaling.
