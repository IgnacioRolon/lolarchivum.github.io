The fact that you are queuing up with them with so little wins means your MMR is roughly the same, so the system is working the way it is designed to match you up against players of a \"similar\" level, basing it off of your rating.  I mean, I'm beating people who have hundreds of wins in gold, but you don't see me complaining about it.  It just means I'm \"better\" then them since I was able to pull off a win.  If you want to play against people who have \"similar\" wins, the only time you will EVER be able to get this to happen, is most likely at the very beginning after the RESET of a season, as everyone will be at 0 games played.  \n\nAlso, this might be offensive to you, but I will say it anyways.  I feel in a lot of cases if you are able to easily get beaten by veterans of a certain tier/division and it happens repeatedly, you probably BELONG there.  If you actually ARE better then them, carry yourself out of your problem with your own power and stop complaining about it.  The fact that you're up against them despite having not even a fraction of their wins or total games played, means you have the potential to go up higher then them, since it took you LESS games to get to WHERE they are.  So just play and do your best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-09T06:37:49.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR and ranked wins aren't particularly related. The matchmaker decided to focus on MMR instead of ranked wins, because if they focused on ranked wins, you'd have bad games that take a while. And most people would rather have quicker games than perfectly even matchups all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2014-11-08T23:31:09.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1622776563/213342938\nI have 372 Ranked Wins,worked my ass off to climb from b5 a tier higher into silver,but im paired with..\n6\n11\n4\nand finally 36 ranked wins,\n\nPaired Against:\n204\n198\n428\n176\n212 wins.\n\nI think this is quite evident in their KDA's and their mentality when looking at the game time.

Just because a person HAS experience, doesn't mean it translates to game skill. Speaking personally, I have a LOT of ranked games under my belt, and I'm still in Silv I (climbing though!). There has been plenty of times when I've lost to people who haven't even hit 50 matches. Do I know more about League than them? Most likely. Does that make me better than them automatically? No.\nLook at it this way. Those people are in the same elo as you, after playing so many games.

Also to add to my point i just figured out that one of the players on my team was still in his provisional matches. and it was his second ranked game this season. how can he be matched against players who have 400+ ranked games played?","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-11-08T20:43:40.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Are you.. are you actually trying to cite one game as evidence for your whole theory?\nHell, I think even 6th graders know, one example means nothing.
