It has more lag depending on how many people are in the party (i.e. 200 ping for 1 person or 999+ for 5 people)\r\nThe game works fine whenever i solo queue so it only lags while in a party\r\nDoes anyone know whats happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T23:57:03.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network can't maintain a strong connection and causing you to have some input delays.
