It seems that as time goes on, more people are showing more discontent with the state of the game.  Unfortunately, some of those people feel that the only way to make their voices heard are to spew vile hatred at Riot.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate truth of the matter is that the player base for League is extremely large, and despite all of the slander that Riot faces, they continue to do their best to meet the needs of a community that is ever more divisive.\r\n\r\nIt is literally impossible to please everyone, and I know that the Rioters are doing what they can.  I know that if I had to get up every morning and go to a job where half of my customer base literally hated me, I would have a difficult time.  So kudos Riot.  I may not agree with every decision you make, but you&#039;re doing your best.\r\n\r\nKeep it up.","replies":[{"poster":"RobTheTank","date":"2016-06-27T22:00:20.249+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it would be interesting if Riot posted a counter of some kind.
