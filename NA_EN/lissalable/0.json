The Elo[a] rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.\n\nThe Elo system was originally invented as an improved chess rating system over the previously used Harkness system but is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of video games,[1] association football, American football, basketball,[2] Major League Baseball, table tennis, Scrabble, board games such as Diplomacy and other games.\n\nThe difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponents is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\n\nA player's Elo rating is represented by a number that may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the high-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the low-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\n\nAn Elo rating is a comparative rating only and is valid only within the rating pool where it was established.","replies":[{"poster":"Lissalable","date":"2020-01-28T00:05:57.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And explain to me then why it isn't working. \n\nYour response makes no sense.\n\nYes that is how it is supposed to work, but if I am consistently playing with players who have very very very low win rates, how am I expected to climb?  I lose the game because everyone feeds, and then my ELO is lowered? But I didn't deserve to be matched up with them to begin with, so how is that self correcting or fair?\n\nDo you not even realize you're literally spewing a bunch of bullshit? \n\nOk sure, it should work that way, but doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"NibblertheCat","date":"2020-01-28T01:20:34.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is too much to decipher from what you're saying above. I understand you're confused by how your mmr and matchmaking are inner-related but there is more to it than just being paired with what you believe is a lopsided team. Have I seen a lot of teams like this in the past, yes? But that should mean you would be able to carry them to victory if you're that much better than your other players and opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Lissalable","date":"2020-01-28T01:34:38.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me though? I want to main support and I should be allowed to do that, with the champion/s that I want to play. Unfortunately, that champion is Sona and I can't carry games on her if no one else is good enough to follow through. \n\nLast game I played Jinx though, and I couldn't control what happened to my team. My jungler wouldn't come bot side for drake no matter how much it was requested, he wouldn't gank either, and my Janna kept walking into the enemy and dying until they got too fed for me to do anything about it. How do I control other players? Oh, I can't. But I should be placed in a fair match.\n\nUnless I dodge until I get a decent team with a decent win rate, I am almost always placed with teams where everyone else is below 50% win rate. That isn't possible to climb as support. I can't control them.","replies":[{"poster":"NibblertheCat","date":"2020-01-28T02:13:32.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can easily main support and Sona is over the top great for tons of different reasons, I am assuming whatever rank you're playing you're either more knowledgable about how to play your champ than other players in Bronze/ S4. Looking at your game history you play a lot of ranked matches, nearly exclusively. Part of me always wonders when someone only plays ranked if they realize they are probably going to need to do a warm-up match or two and try entering into things once they're at least got their fingers ready for macros. One thing I noticed is you build nearly the same thing every time no matter what the team comp you're facing and perhaps some of the issues fall onto yourself. \n\nDo you find yourself overly using your sums and wishing you hadn't wasted them? Do you rewatch your replays and say ok, well that play where we got ganked by a 5 man did anyone ping? Where was your placement? Does your lane typically push too hard and you're open to ganks? Are you not making the right pings at the right calls? Some of these things are all about you... if you're never changing your approach than whatever MMR you have is never really going to get better because you're not getting better. Consider this, you've managed to stay between Silver and Bronze since s4 (mainly silver) where a majority of all players play. You're neither greater or worse than the teammates you're queued with, the biggest problem is some of the ways you play the game. You also have played for so long that your MMR has so much activity that it has been balanced to basically where you belong. Every season you're not really in the best position to play as you're always pulling yourself up from Bronze to get back to silver - even once you're gold you're going back to silver and need to pull yourself back up and yet you're in the same place you were a season ago. You're going to notice that no matter what level of gameplay you're at there will be different challenges and in silver, you're dealing with a majority of casual gamers who may want to play a bit competitively. \n\nOne thing I am guessing is you don't have a duo and that will hurt you in the long run. If you want to make those calls to a jungle who may not be that great with timing for drakes then you're going to find yourself needing to take charge in order to make the drake happen. This is a team game, talking about controlling your team you should be making pings and working on the minimap to identify risks for the team and make calls to help aid everyone when some is actually missing, in need of help, or whatever the ping is. Part of me assumes you focus a lot of other people and get tilted quickly and fall into a chat war with the team. That is all the advice you're getting from me. If you want to coach you're going to need to pay me to make you better because it won't just happen because of who you're paired with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lissalable","date":"2020-01-28T01:36:06.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, your statement, \"what you believe is a lopsided team\" ?

You're paired with a team for one reason or another if you're considerably better as you mentioned you'd easily carry or work with your team to suggest counter items or whatever it is that that a player is doing poorly. Idk what lane you play, I cannot say if you're top why aren't you asking for wards to be placed for TP ganks, calling the gank and then tping in after setting up. If you're mid are you roaming and helping that struggling bot lane? If you're jg are you focusing on the right time to gank and warding and setting the team up for a winning fight... there is too much missing to understand your rant. If you're talking ranked are you counter picking and using the best champion to work with the team or against your counter lane... there is just way too in LOL draft than you're higher win rate must mean you should be paired with a team whose members share an equally high success rate with whatever you're playing...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2020-01-28T00:14:15.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't work because Riot matchmaking doesn't make fair teams, it makes teams designed to force players to 50% winrate.\n\nNot to mention the math behind it is not even a proper Elo system.
