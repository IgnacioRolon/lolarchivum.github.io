Is there a setting somewhere so that my clips can come out at this resolution? Or is this the maximum that they can be?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T03:27:27.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Highlights should be saving in the resolution that you're actually playing the game in, so I'm not actually 100% sure what might be going on there. Double check what resolution settings you're currently using, and grab some screenshots showing what's going on if possible so I can see exactly what's happening.\n\n**EDIT**: I did get a bit more inside knowledge for this. It seems like all highlights inherently save in 720p, which is most likely due to the processing time.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2017-08-15T04:10:15.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So yeah, I did some more digging and found that same piece of info. From the replay FAQ it says that the quality can be changed in settings during the replay, so I'll look into that and hopefully I can get it sorted. Thanks for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T04:45:27.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP! I had reached out to my tech team for this information and this was what I was told, not even thinking to check that FAQ. Y'know, this poro has had a long week, and I'll thank you for excusing this mixup while I exit stage right to play some chill No Man Sky.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
