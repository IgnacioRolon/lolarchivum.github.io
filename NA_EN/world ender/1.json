Well, I decided to log in today, and it won't sync up with my actual account level (which would allow me to post, vote, etc). Now on the NA boards you can just post a discussion and delete it to sync up, but on PBE I'm not getting that option since it won't even allow me to post or comment anywhere. I get a message saying 'you must be level 1 to comment/post'. Even if I try to go to my profile, I get a 404. It's weird. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this is the incorrect place to post this, but I don't know where else would be appropriate. My summoner name on PBE is **Dont Lewd Zoe** . If it's possible to manually update my level, I'd really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T04:31:43.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be good to go now!
