It's starting to annoy me, and I don't even understand why it's happening. I sent several other people gifts, yet the popup only appears for one friend. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm just missing a simple fix, or if I'm going to have to do something more complicated.

Once opening the client, look for the bell in the upper-right near summoner name and status:  this should have a small circle overlapping it, which is the new client's way of saying, \"you have new notifications.\"  If you click the bell, you will see all these \"friend opened gift\" items.  Clicking the x on each item will remove it from your notification log and stop it from recurring at each boot.\n\n(you're welcome!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T00:44:29.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening in the Beta Client or Legacy Client?

Otherwise, I can't really think of what else to do, other than maybe trying out the legacy client next time you log in and see if it happens there too. Maybe by logging into the legacy client once, and then returning to the new client, it will finally recognize that your present has been opened and won't bug you about it anymore. \n\nHowever, if it doesn't seem to go away, I would recommend sending in a bug report through the client with the little bug button at the bottom right of the client window so that they know about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aaronald","date":"2016-12-23T23:23:40.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue, I only gifted one friend but it pops up every time I open the client.
