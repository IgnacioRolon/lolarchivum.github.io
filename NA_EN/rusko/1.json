For the longest time I had the basic package with xfinity. Which had like 25mbps or so. I got a steady 39ms which was nice. All of a sudden, one day my ping jumps up to 65ms. It never moves. It's always 65ms. So I even upgraded my connection to 100mpbs+ and I STILL get 65ms. Didn't move at all. What could be causing this? Playing on this ping feels like 150+ honestly. Very unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T16:52:09.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP or even upgrade may have changed how you're routing to the game server, maybe even taking a longer path to get here.
