Yes I'm using a wired connection. But I've even got a new modem from Xfinity. Nothing is changing. It all started about a month ago now. I had around 20-25mbps download and got 39ms and all of a sudden one day that just jumped up to 65ms. So I decided to upgrade my internet. I got around 75mbps and nothing changed. So I had a technician come out and check it out he said everything was good on my end and on their end so I have no idea what the problem could be. And then I upgraded after that which turned out to be cheaper anyway so now I get like 120mbps and I get even higher ping now. I'm sitting at a constant 75/80ms. I don't know what else to try. I want my old ping back :'[","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-21T19:12:17.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rusko, it's really a bummer that you're still going through this hassle.
