When casted, it only shows ~half the wall. The invisible half still has collision, so it can trick players into thinking they can squeeze through a spot and end up getting stuck on an invisible wall. It can also mess up the caster&#039;s idea of what&#039;s blocked and what&#039;s not. It can be hard to think about which side is the broken side in the midst of combat.\n\nIt&#039;s super easy to repro. Just cast the level 1 wall in fountain and try to pass through it on both sides. After testing it myself, it was the north side of the wall (if casted to the east of Anivia).\n\nC&#039;mon Riot. I&#039;ve posted this bug 3 times over the last year. Anivia has one good skin and it&#039;s been broken for years. I&#039;m really hoping this skin being played in Worlds will give it some much needed attention... Or maybe you&#039;ll just disable the skin and brush it under the rug -.-.\n\nBlackfrost Anivia Wall: https://i.gyazo.com/b7ad989b230085602dff685e7e0a180a.png\nNormal Anivia Wall: https://i.gyazo.com/fd3244dca8097da9daaca54d348686c5.png\n\nOriginal Post w/ Pictures: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/gsq6doEc-blackfrost-anivia-wall-length-is-much-smaller-than-other-skins","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-10-04T17:44:06.362+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me ping the issue again to get a pulse on it.","replies":[{"poster":"darknuke","date":"2016-10-04T18:23:22.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much thanks! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2016-10-03T17:03:57.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be wrong, but I think that's any Anivia skin. The thing is, even if there's space between the wall and the other terrain, if your champion isn't big enough they can't pass through.","replies":[{"poster":"darknuke","date":"2016-10-03T20:53:37.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at the source post (in the comments of it).
