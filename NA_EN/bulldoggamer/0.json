I have gone through every guide i could find on the support site and have also gone through every step on [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/qGY56UB4-comprehensive-troubleshooting-your-patching-issues) thread \r\n\r\nI have run the hextech repair tool multiple time to no avail. I can get any logs needed i just can't attach them on this thread. I know it has nothing to do with my internet connection, since i have attempted on 2 different networks both of which have worked before. Any help is much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-28T18:50:03.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting that error this early on suggests a security setting preventing the patching from reading your game files.

I'm concerned, though, because you should be on the updated client at this point.  Hopefully, those steps should get your updated to the latest version.

The issue can vary depending on when it's happening.  At what % are you getting the error?  Per the permissions guide, have you already tried a reinstall through the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367)?  You guys will want to get onto the updated client as soon as possible, so you don't run into any problems come retirement.

That far into the patching process, the patcher already finished scanning your game files so it's not a permissions issue.  Instead, the patcher is trying to download updates but is backtracking or disconnecting entirely.  You'll want to go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tighten up your network to the patching server and get up to date.
