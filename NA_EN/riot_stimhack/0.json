{"poster":"Riot Stimhack","date":"2019-06-25T16:05:51.983+0000","title":"[TFT] Top 500 Players from the Teamfight Tactics Beta on PBE","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, tacticians!\n\nThe past several days have been a whirlwind for us as we’ve watched everyone playing Teamfight Tactics during the beta. Heading into live this week, we want to take a minute to have a good time and recognize some of the top tacticians by MMR.\n\nA ton of you **also** braved long login queues over the weekend to play—needless to say, if many of you were able to play as much as you wanted to, this list might look **very** different.\n\nQuick disclaimer: This is just a for fun thing. We’re not planning to give any rewards or publish MMR on an ongoing basis, but we might do more like this in the future if you enjoy it! Oh—and one more thing: MMR in TFT is different from other League modes (e.g., 2400 MMR in TFT isn’t the same as 2400 MMR on Summoner’s Rift).\n\nAnyway, without further ado, our team humbly presents the top 500 Teamfight Tactics beta players. Enjoy the bragging rights, and we’ll see you in the arena!\n\n##Top 100:\n1. itshafu (2466 MMR)\n2. AgaitoShunma (2464 MMR)\n3. Delight (2438 MMR)\n4. allinKing (2435 MMR)\n5. Ekasit (2433 MMR)\n6.
