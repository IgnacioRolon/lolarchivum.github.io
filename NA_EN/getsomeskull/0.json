One of the things that frustrates me more than anything else is when I put in the time to earn a chest and never receive it. I've currently earned an S- rank and above (with chests available mind you) for Garen, Amumu, and Master Yi this season and have not been given a chest. I would love to know why this is the case so I can sleep well at night instead of wanting to start a boycott of the game altogether (especially with destiny 2 coming to pc in a few short weeks it may be the end of LOL for me. ~forever~) Besides that, my client glitches out all the time(I have reinstalled it before) and as of late it has been working just ok. I get incredibly frustrated with a piss poor matchmaking service which people dodge anytime I get a character they want. Which has slowly turned me into a hypocrite because I can't help but reciprocate in a piss poor mood when I get stuck playing with a character I'm horrible with. So before I rant some more about the issues and complaints I have about the game and so that I can retain a small amount of dignity, I would just like to know why it is that I haven't received a chest for the 3 aforementioned characters? Thank you Riot Games for ruining me as a dignified gamer. I can't wait to see the next AAA game your in the works to come out with since the developers have parted ways with LOL so that I can be disappointed all over again. Chances are I'll never play it and be happier for it. :)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nGet Some","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T03:35:52.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The S's you got on those 3 characters were before this season officially started which means that you wouldn't have gotten chests for them this season. After looking through your match history with those champs, you haven't gotten an S rank with any of them since this season started, which is why you haven't gotten a chest for them.","replies":[]}]}
