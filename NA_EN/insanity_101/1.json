You're spending most of your time trying to waveclear/farm or occasionally hit turrets while staying out of assassin dive range, except for 5-10 seconds tops of actual fighting, which is followed by multiple people dying or backing.

He's got a bow, and this cool cursed-with--awesome vibe, and he has some interesting theoretical AP or AS/hybrid build options, but in reality, his build option is \"why did you pick Varus?  Did you misclick Vayne at the last second?\"  He actually got a buff in the last patch, but we'll see whether or not the community at large cares.\n\nAnyway, whenever I play Varus, I go for a full-AD build (\"Legolas\" Varus) to take advantage of the bonkers damage on his Q, but his Q's cost gets up to 90 at rank 5.  Since I want to A. have more mana to fire arrows and B. have more CDR to fire arrows, I rush Essence Reaver.  It works pretty well.  Sure, it'd be nice to have the perks of BT, but the 300 gold is actually relevant at that point, and 10% lifesteal is enough.\n\nI don't know the ER itself should be buffed, but it should build out of something with mana vamp.  Of course, the problem with that is that a lot of champions would start the mana vamp component and ignore the rest: perhaps the mana vamp component builds out of Pickaxe and has terrible efficiency, but the combine cost is dirt-cheap for ER, to give an incentive to finish.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-03-14T19:06:52.124+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could simply have the mana vamp be mediocre on the base item and let it be much better on ER (so if you are fine with a little life steal or mana vamp you can just sit on the item ER builds out of or the vamp scepter as it is perfectly fine just sitting on a vamp scepter)","replies":[{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-03-14T21:22:14.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that attack damage scales a lot, and mana costs scale a little bit or not at all.

Reguardless of what item you swap for infinity edge, you are just going to do a stupidly higher amount of damage per second with it than without.  Thus, for lack of a better alternative or something even close, this item is irreplaceable.  It has gold efficiency akin to a fully stacked mejai's soulstealer as far as we are concerned.  That is how good it is.\n\nOur build starts with {{item:3031}} as an adc.  Because we have this, taking a phantom dancer or a statikk shiv has stupidly high value.  Just irreplaceably high value.  You kind of really want to / need to take one of them because that's how good they are with infinity edge already in your build.  Let's assume we go with Dancer because it's a better single target item.\n\nOur build now has {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} .  We now need to build {{item:3035}} at some point.  So that's 3 item spots already gone.  (For the love of heaven never play adc without building Last Whisper.  The sheer power coming from this item is irreplaceable).  Our boots are going to take a 4th spot, because that's just what boots do.  Finally, we want to take a 5th, more defensive item that will let us withstand single champ burst (Guardian's Angel, Banshee's Veil, Mercurial Scimitar, etc).\n\nSo by this point in time, we have ONE spot left in our build.  One spot left to compete for.  And the other competitors are {{item:3087}}  or {{item:3046}} (whichever you didn't get), {{item:3153}} , and {{item:3072}}.  Reguardless of what you pick, the health shred, double the lifesteal, or the sheer extra damage per second is going to be more useful on an adc.
