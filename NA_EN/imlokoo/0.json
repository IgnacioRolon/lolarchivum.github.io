I know it's a pretty rough ride, i'm actually Bronze 3 myself right now. It doesn't discourage me from jumping into Ranked games and trying to climb though. Trolls are pretty awful and create an awful experience, but reporting them allows us to track them down for review and reform.

It's really fun playing League as a team and more times than others you can create a strategy and game plans to take down the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"AbusiveEmu","date":"2017-08-10T23:28:47.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if that payment was my love? {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]}]}]}
