Around 30-40. Didn't bother me. But now, it's 40-50 sometimes reaches 60 at the beginning of a match, then it lowers down to 15-25 and has spikes that lead down to 10 and below. I've uninstalled programs, I've messed with the compatibility, Defragging, fixed anything wrong with the registry, repair client, and even uninstall and reinstall. I've updated my drivers and everything. I don't know whats going on. In case anyone is wondering my spec's are this.\r\n\r\nIntel Pentium N3540 Quad Core 2.16 gHz\r\n4GB RAM DDR3 \r\nIntel(R) HD Graphics Drive.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T16:20:19.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something sounds like it's degrading while you continue to play.  This could be your hardware or something else entirely.  I know you've tried out a few solid steps but there's still more to go over, like checking for any overheating so your rig can take on the demands of gaming.  Then go over the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide and each step to help tune tings up.

It detects how hot my CPU is running. When I've been playing league for about an hour or so it gets as hot as 150-160Â°F if that helps any. What exactly do you mean by degrading? Also, this laptop is only a year old. :/ \n\nEdit: I have looked at the FPS issues guide and have done every one of them that I was able to do but still nothing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2017-03-19T00:40:56.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an on going issue with 7.5 patch. A lot of people are having this issue, but Riot assumes it's on our end. If you don't believe me, google \"fps drop 5.7\" and read the first link. \n\nI am beyond pissed because I go from 235 fps in the beggining, slowly it will progress around 140ish and then it will not pass 80 fps and huge drops in team fights.","replies":[{"poster":"Actualhellrazer","date":"2017-03-21T13:19:47.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn dude.
