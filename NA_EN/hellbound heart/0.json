I keep up in damage with the rest of my team, I get off more healing any anybody else in the game providing more healing than some people do damage, and out of 6 games I won 4 with the other 2 both being pretty close games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-05T00:14:39.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it really that much love when they ask you to pay 30 bucks for it?  :P\n\nIt looks seriously amazing, but man I hate the idea of a skin that costs more than many entire games do.","replies":[]}]}
