Heal might feel weird here, and I totally get that, but it was the most fitting tool in our box.\n\nI already figured it was for the \"Grand Challenge\" you mentioned. I just don't get the AOE heal. It does not make that much THEMATIC SENSE. When someone duels, its **USUALLY 1v1** (Meaning **ITS NOT A TEAM EFFORT**). **A duel more of a SELFISH 1v1. You fight for honor, glory, pride, whatever, THE DUEL IS BETWEEN YOUR ONE TARGET AND YOURSELF.**\n\nBesides, if I play as Garen and focus that one enemy carry down and give them justice, my team is happy I did my job, but I don't see MY TEAM getting buffed because of this. If I play Darius and kill one of the enemies, my team is happy I did my job will be happier as i proceed with my multi-kill but I don't see my team getting buffed. Fighters fight, win, move on and Fiora is no different. As a duelist, I believe her fight is more personal than .... whatever gave the idea she should give off an AOE heal (I am assuming that you want to make Fiora's \"duel\" feel like an arena?)\n\nListen, give Fiora a reward for winning her duel because she deserves it, but THE REWARD SHOULD NOT BE AN AOE HEAL.

The current Fiora already gets kited to hell even with a huge move speed buff on E and her double Q. It's like RIOT doesn't even realize how hard melee AD champs have it in this mobility arms race.\n\nI would much rather exchange the healing zone on R for a CD reset if we are going to be forced to lose the untargetable ult.","replies":[]}]}
