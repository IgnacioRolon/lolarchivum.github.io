What benefits does it provide, and do those benefits outweigh the obvious negatives that come from flaming?\n\nFrankly, \"change my mind\" style posts have no place on PB. As far as I'm concerned, they already present themselves as non-discussions as you're simply putting forward an idea that you don't actually want to change your stance on, and simply wish to watch people ineffectually raise counterpoints to it. It's disingenuous posting, it's not conducive to actual discussion, and it serves no purpose.\n\nBut hey, I'll bite.\n\nFlaming should remain as a bannable offense because there's no legitimate benefit to allowing flaming, especially in comparison to the damage it does to team cohesion and group morale. You're playing a team game, and that means you're supposed to be _working with your teammates, **not** fighting them_, and that's all that flaming is. You're wasting your time fighting someone through text - so if it's flaming an enemy, it's utterly ineffectual and in breach of the rules of sportsmanship, and if you're flaming an ally, you're fighting your own teammates instead of working with them, so you're both breaking the rules of sportsmanship _and_ effectively trying to sabotage your team's chances of winning.\n\nAnd to what benefit? A little bit of short-lived pleasure that you got the last word in against someone who you should be working with instead of harassing and fighting against? A little relief from venting out your frustrations on a teammate, when a dozen different and _more effective_ methods of venting exist? Flaming accomplishes _nothing_ that outweighs the fact that you are, effectively, low-key throwing the game.\n\nAnd if that fact doesn't change your mind, then I pose the question: Did you even really come here to have your mind changed?","replies":[{"poster":"SeeMeNoMas","date":"2019-12-21T02:50:59.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"To be fair, getting the \"little relief\" from venting is pretty helpful to me.

Even in a monumentally clear, sweeping defeat, I believe that players should demonstrate their best behavior - or, failing that, at least play in close accordance to the rules.\n\n> What are the more effective methods of venting you propose though? I am just wondering for future games of League\n\nIt will vary from person to person, but what I find most effective are forms of physical exertion (I typically slam my fists on my desk, though punching pillows/squeezing stress balls work just as well without risking damage to your table.), and yelling my frustrations at the screen over typing them out; it airs the frustration quicker and more efficiently and just kinda helps to breathe.\n\n~~Hell, even Mythbusters has shown that shouting obscenities can help alleviate pain, so if it has that sort of sensory affect, surely to god it has merit to say it can help de-stress, too.~~\n\nOther than that, there are decompression tools/toys that are purpose-built for de-stressing (fidget spinners, stress balls, butterfly trainers, etc.), and even practicing breathing exercises can help cool things down and allow you to refocus in stressful situations. Breathe for four seconds inwards, seven seconds outwards.","replies":[{"poster":"SeeMeNoMas","date":"2019-12-21T03:15:09.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bashing desk, will not do (because of reasons you mentioned)\nHitting pillows, unfortunately are not near\nYelling at the scream (if in comms, I will tell my teammates my thoughts, but I won't yell)\nHonestly, I found that typing out all of my frustration does help A LOT.
