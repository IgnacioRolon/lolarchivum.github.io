At the moment there's no fix, so I recommend updating your item sets from another PC running League until a fix rolls out. Since Item sets are saved server-side, you should see any changes made to them from another PC show up on your Mac. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Midori","date":"2016-12-08T04:41:57.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is there a fix yet mate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trurl101","date":"2016-10-06T11:57:39.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same Problem here on different Macs.
