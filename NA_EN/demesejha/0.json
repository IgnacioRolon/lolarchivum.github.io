That is, a program waits for league's process to start and then checks for specific bits in the program that it then hijacks and overrides memory for, among other things. Preventing program startup if it detects hooked programs would solve the problem immediately. \r\n\r\nWhat injectors do is they see the function calls the program is being sent, to and from server by analyzing packets through the program itself. By doing this they can effectively \"see\" where everyone and everything is at all times, based on data sent to the player by the server, and can control inputs the same way in reverse.\r\n\r\nAccurately allowing a player to gain an upper hand by having visible advantages other players cannot have by reading information they normally can't access or taking control of a players move commands or spell inputs to hit skillshots and dodge more quickly or cleanly.\r\n\r\nI mean its not really rocket science. But it seems to be a continually untouched issue. And its getting worse.\r\n\r\n**_So, what do I do when I run into a scripter?_**\r\n\r\nFirst thing first is pretty simple. Make a note of it if you think a player is scripting. Check for specific tells.\r\n\r\n1: Visibility of enemy team members when there clearly is none available. This is especially common with traps that are invisible like teemo shrooms even though the enemy has no scanner or control wards.\r\n\r\n2: You can't \"script\" basic attacks or targeted abilities. Dodging only works if the ability is a skillshot, or trap. And its easy to tell if a layer is using a dodge script because of A: overtly circular movements (this is called orbwalking), B: inhuman reaction time (dodging a point blank morgana q for example?? trust me most plat players can't do that nevermind bronze-gold where most players are), C: Twitching/Stuttering. If a player suddenly stops moving to dodge a skillshot or takes a step backwards and stops, or \"stutters\" on the edge of a stun/skillshot as they try to move. They're using a dodge script.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you suspect someone is scripting, a great way to check also is to, if you have a champ who has weak skillshots or less valuable spells, to throw out the spell you dont care to hit with and immediately throw out the spell you do want to hit with. 9 times out of 10 a dodge script will dodge the first spell and walk right into the next one. \r\n\r\nAnd lastly if you suspect, save those replay files and send them over to riot via a ticket service. They can't ignore them forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do: Play it cool and don't lose your head. A scripter can't dodge autoattacks and targeted spells so protect your marksman and your old fashioned point click mages. Scripters also often script because either A: others are doing it and they feel they have no way to climb otherwise or B: they are mechanically poor/bad at the game in general and scripting is no substitute for game knowledge.\r\n\r\nTake advantage of their cockiness and percieved superiority. Split as a team, group up on the one player if you can when you catch them out. Or even just avoid them outright.\r\n\r\nBut above all else don't lose your cool.\r\n\r\nWhat riot needs to do:\r\n\r\nIt's really simple. Really really simple.\r\nIn korea most MMOrpgs with competitive modes have things like Xstopper for example. These are sub programs that run when you launch the client and log in, and check if any script applications are running. The easy thing to do is include a program that runs a check on launch of the ingame client during game loading, that kicks players who are running unauthorized hooked programs. Its really that simple to combat. And while I know coding something like that isn't that easy. Neither is the hook program used to script in the first place and people continue to update and work on those with every patch.\r\n\r\nAdding something that prevents hook based injectors outright, stops the problem in its tracks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T02:56:05.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh trust, we've got plenty of ways to stop scripters and botters.
