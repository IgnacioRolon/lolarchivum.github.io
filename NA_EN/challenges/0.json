I had recently promoted a few days prior, and was at a solid 20 lp in s1. i lost a game dropping to 2 lp, and then another putting me at 0 lp. Now Riot, here is my problem. I logged on today to find myself at 75 lp in silver 2. I checked match history to see no new games played. i never received notice saying i had been demoted, and specifically remember checking my lp before getting off the other day. I demand an answer from you because this is just straight BS. {{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T18:48:15.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm awake, though some more coffee couldn't hurt.  It sounds strange that you're down to 75 LP with a demotion, so I looked into this for you.  It looks like since your Silver 1 promotion on May 1st, you've had a long streak of losses.  :(  I see a few games yesterday playing as Annie, Lissandra, and Ezreal that ultimately resulted in a demotion.  If these matches were not played by you, I highly recommend going over our [account protection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) guide to secure your account from any unauthorized parties.  We can't change game stats, but I hope that helps clear things up.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
