Its call public transportation/walking. You can get to the event without having to use the venue parking. Most of the time Venue parking is taken care of when you show up (with a booth) or when you leave, so this shouldn't be any different than any other event of this nature. I have relatives in the area so walking probably is going to to be my mode of transportation (but this is besides the point).\n\nSecond, whenever you \"order\" tickets to an event; Concert, Movies, Anything at a venue you usually get an Order Fee. Its the cost for the organization setting the event up to register your ticket for the event. Blizzcon sees that as a $12 charge.  Mayweather fight is like $40ish (depending on seats) So $3 is pretty light.\n\nThat $9 Fee, is the cost to keep the venue. Also, since I will be there for all 4 days, that fee prices is standardized. It was $18 total (4 days) for mine for each ticket. \n\nI might as well ask, if the pricing format didn't break everything down and you just saw $49.25 to see MSI for one day and maybe get a chance at meeting a Tier 1 team, would you do it? Probably not if you are negotiating the prices so tightly, you just found something that for some reason makes the price unreasonable.\n\nAnd as mentioned by Jamaree, this price isn't even that bad. 300k for front row, 500 for noise bleeds and the ranges inbetween for the Mayweather fight. $75 a day for Blizzcon tickets (not including hotel, gas, food etc).","replies":[{"poster":"MilkFish","date":"2015-04-30T20:20:05.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I live 3 hours away so my only choice is to use venue parking, especially if I'm carting anyone along with me (I have a lot of whiny friends). Honestly I would've just liked to know the ticket price outright instead of being given this false hope of \"Oh it's only about $35, I can manage that!\" But then suddenly it's $37, and then shoots up to nearly $50 with all of the fees.\n\nWhen I'm going to a convention for 3 or 4 days, yes, I expect to spend $200-$400 (a very large majority of that is for hotel/valet parking/food). When I'm going to an event for _one day_, I really can't bring myself to spend over $80. It just doesn't seem right to me in any way. I think I'll just save $70, buy FNATIC Janna with RP, and watch the stream.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-30T20:26:41.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just boils down to what you think it is worth :3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-04-30T07:16:39.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You think that is bad, you should see the price of the Mayweather fight cheap seats.","replies":[]}]}
