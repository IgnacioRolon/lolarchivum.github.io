The system would work exactly the way it does now, and players would not get \"more\" IP, because if one were to log in at 11 and get FWoTD and then do so again after it resets at 12, they would earn the same ammount of IP as someone who decides to play a game at 5 P.M. each day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-02-24T22:57:43.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also make it first match of the day instead of win .
