Aside from his E, has pretty low base damages unless you stand there getting autoed to death with his W up. Q can be interrupted. E can be flashed. Ult's delay makes it easy to QSS, and its unlikely to hit more than 1 player if the enemy is paying attention. Core items got super expensive (Lich Bane and Zhonyas). While bursty when ahead, his W is designed for sustained damage - though it makes it harder to 1v1 him since he can chase you down, it takes him longer to reach his one-shot potential than other assassins. Pretty high cooldowns and mana costs, especially for a champ that isnt likely to rush athenes or morello. P\n\nHis strengths, though i assume you know them: slipperly. Has untargetability in kit.

Anyone that plays Fizz now always gets 30-45% CDR so it will always be 4-5 seconds. The mana cost on it becomes a nonissue after a few levels or if it basically always kills. So you basically have 4 seconds to kill him before he escapes or kills you, and this is often with him coming into you more often than not.
