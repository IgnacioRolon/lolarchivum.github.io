It is even more useful in the jungle as your ganking a combination of the two. \r\n\r\nOpinions?","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-06-09T23:49:18.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I, too, voted \"Fizz is dumb.\"\n\nAnyways, I think both work; I always liked the synergy with Stormraiders where if you hit a max range spear on a squishy you get the buff, though it may be a bit overkill given she already gets MS for the Hunt. Extra burst is always nice, which is why I think most go for TLD. Still, now that Nidalee got her W reset nerfed, Stormraiders might be really good since it gives her some of the in-combat mobility she lost.\n\nAlthough, I think a lot of players go Strength of the Ages, since it gives her good survivability, which is really good since she's pretty squishy for most of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-06-09T23:52:59.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good insight!

Though, I would probably still put points in the defense tree since she's really squishy. But I'm no nidalee main, lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-09T23:25:14.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I had to vote for \"Fizz is dumb\" :3\nAnyways, there is already a soft cap on movement speed, so you likely won't even be getting the full benefit from Storm Raider's.\nI think that Thunderlord's is just better for giving that extra bit of damage you need for those first couple kills that get you rolling.","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-06-09T23:26:25.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 other people agree wih you lmao.

Oh and if you do want more chase power on Nidalee, you can build a Rylai's.  It gives the full 40% slow for 1.5 seconds if you land a javelin.  I'm not sure if it's worth trading out other items for that though, just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-06-10T00:01:02.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive done it before.
