Here are some tips for anyone new to her!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/dlouap754c5.jpeg\r\n\r\nTip 1: Using your E (Shunpo) for trading.\r\n\r\n     Often times you are going to verse someone in lane with significantly strong skill shots (e.g. {{champion:157}}  tornado, {{champion:76}}  spear, {{champion:131}} crescent, etc.) It is important that you time your trades correctly so you can come out on top despite her weak laning phase. One thing I like to do as Kat is farm passively and safely until the enemy laner decides to trade. For example, If I am vs Nidalee, my main goal is to avoid her spear. If she throws one out at you, use your E to fly on top of them. This allows you to dodge her spear (Negating most of her damage) and also begin dealing some damage. Once you are on them you can finish up with a Q - W combo and use the movespeed to run away. I would be careful of using this when you are unaware of where their jungler is at it can set you up for a gank and not give you a way to escape.\r\n     Another way you can use her E is for poking safely. You are going to be poking with your Q (Bouncing blades) constantly, and most people will back up a bit to avoid you from activating the mark. Although you can use this as a zone technique, you can also use it to your advantage trade wise. After throwing your Q at an enemy, back up a bit. Most people will see you backing up and inch forward to avoid missing farm. If you try to move up to shunpo them, they will probably back up before you can do anything. A good way to activate your mark safely is to E on to a minion near them and then use your W. It is unexpected and effective. Use your movespeed to avoid skill shots and run away.\r\n\r\nTip 2: Teamfighting.\r\n\r\n     So many times I see new/inexperienced Katarina players team fight incorrectly. Timing is extremely important with kat as it is one of your only obstacles. The main problem I see with some Kat players is channeling their ult to long and missing out on a lot of free kills. As we all know, you can walk out of kats ult range and live if she used her E to engage. It is important to remember Kats ult is mainly used to get 1 kill and then finish the rest with your e - w combo. Don&#039;t keep channeling the whole fight, just enough to get them low so you can finish them off with your shunpo spin. Because there is a high chance of your ult getting canceled, it is crucial to remember this. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask questions below, I know enough about her to answer them (whether it be itemization or other game mechanics.)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/uopald75307.png","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-02-26T19:53:05.644+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the enemy Katarina is doing well: http://imgur.com/z8bDchi.gif[/img]\nWhen I'm doing well as Katarina: http://i.imgur.com/mKO8klk.gif[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-02-26T19:54:58.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-02-26T19:55:52.750+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how to links","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-02-26T19:56:17.321+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so ashamed I spent like 10 minutes trying to find the perfect gifs","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2016-02-26T22:54:46.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add\n\n> [/img]\n\nat the very end of the url; no space\n\nI've used these boards a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-02-26T23:51:47.904+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neat!!

There are 3 main routes you can use.\n\n**Route 1:**\n\n{{item:1001}} + {{item:2003}} x4\n\nThis start is good vs enemy champions with skill shots or if you plan on doing early roams. You get the movement speed to dodge abilities and also have a lot of sustain with your pots if you can dodge them all. I go this start when I am verse:\n\n{{champion:99}} to dodge skills\n{{champion:115}} to dodge skills\n{{champion:103}} to dodge skills\n{{champion:84}} early roaming \n{{champion:112}} dodging laser / roaming early\n{{champion:76}} dodging skills\n{{champion:30}} dodging skills\n{{champion:4}} dodging skills / roaming early\n{{champion:81}} dodging skills\n\n\n**Route 2:**\n\n{{item:1054}}  +{{item:2003}} x1\n\nThis start works wonders when you have to verse a hard counter that can harass a lot. It also allows you to get up close and cc a bit more then you normally would early on. I go this start when I am verse:\n\n{{champion:131}} Counter\n{{champion:1}} Counter / Harass \n{{champion:34}} Harass\n{{champion:74}} Counter / Harass\n{{champion:81}} Harass\n{{champion:7}} Harass\n{{champion:127}} Counter\n{{champion:90}} Counter \n{{champion:25}} Harass\n{{champion:8}} Harass\n{{champion:38}} Counter / Harass\n{{champion:105}} He's fizz.\n\n**Route 3:**\n\n{{item:1029}} + {{item:2003}} x4\n\nThis start helps vs AD Laners. It also gives you quite a few pots so you can play a bit more aggressive against them. I bring this against:\n\n{{champion:92}} \n{{champion:91}} \n{{champion:157}} \n{{champion:238}} \n\nEarly Game Itemization:\n\nKat has 3 Items that she rushes 99% of the time. They are {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}} and {{item:3001}} .  Ill run through the situations for you.\n\n{{item:3285}}: You rush this a lot. However its prime to get if you are ahead. If you see that you are pushing them into their tower and winning trades easily, Rush {{item:3285}}. If you see a lot of roaming opportunities, rush {{item:3285}}.\n\nRush {{item:3157}} If you are vs AD Laner. That's all you would normally get this for. Otherwise get it second.\n\nRush {{item:3001}} if you are struggling vs an AP Laner. It gives you some good AP and MR. Good vs people like Diana or annie.\n\n\nAfter your first item or so, her build stays the same. If you don't get Zhonya's first, get it second for fights. In the end, your build should looking something like this, in purchase order:\n\n{{item:3285}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} and {{item:3151}} , {{item:3116}} , {{item:3001}} , or {{item:3026}} \n\nIf you have anymore questions let me know :)","replies":[{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2016-02-28T01:21:17.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz isnt to bad since you can dodge his ult and all in abilities.

If your timing is on point there is literally no need for cdr. I see what you mean by how it would be nice to ability spam but you just don't need it if you can team fight/trade effectively.

Just q e w and  and your team should kill someone so then u can 1shot them team cuz they should use their cc on your teammates and u can easily kill their entire team. But if u feed as f*ck u can just q e w thunder lord their adc or mid and just ward jump away.\n\nThis can be a good tactic if you have no engage, it can throw the enmy off guard and lead your team to victory but is quite risky. 1 stun could be the end of you, and then that leaves a 5v4 and your team is down a carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Taco Kat","date":"2016-02-26T22:27:50.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin is overall a rough lane. Whenever you face a rough laner, try taking teleport. This provides more pressure on the map and you can get fed off of bot lane ganks much easier. You will have to adapt to no ignite, but the payoff is worth it in my opinion. A good way to trade Kassadin early on is by baiting him to use his Q on you, then once the shield is gone, Q him. It's not much damage, but it will be of use to you whilst trying to poke.\n\nYou could also try some flat magic resist glyphs versus those two, although I don't prefer it.","replies":[]}]}]}
