After reading his lore, I immediately loved his character/personality, and after a few games I could do pretty well with his kit.  Back then Viktor was considered a troll champion, and a few of my friends tried to convince me that he was 'useless' and said 'there are better champions, pick someone else.'  When the rework came, I was a bit nervous, but found more ways to experiment and have fun with his kit.  I love the variety and adaptability it offers.  I feel like I'm never stuck to a single build, and I like experimenting with different options, based on how each game goes.  Even after all the recent nerfs, I still greatly enjoy showing others what the Glorious Evolution is capable of.  \n\n{{champion:111}}:  Nautilus was the champion that I learned how to jungle with.  It's still my least favorite role, but as long as I've got Naut, I can do okay with it.  That said, I like playing Naut regardless of where I am or what role I'm in.  Since mid-late Season 3, I've been playing Naut in top, support, mid, and even a few custom/AI games as ADC Naut.  Note:  the last one is not very viable, but it's hilarious to watch.  I really like his audio lines, and his lore is really interesting.  I want to know more about the black substance that corrupted him in the first place, and I want to learn more about who/what he is.  Like Viktor, he's recently become a lot more popular, which is awesome, but it also means that he's getting nerfs.  I am biased, won't deny that, but I honestly don't think he needs nerfs.  He's popular because he counters FotM stuff.  When the meta changes, he'll be dropped again, and I don't think the nerfs will be reverted.  Even so, I'll still keep playing him and find new ways to fill the needs of my team.  Mobilis in Mobili.  \n\n{{champion:161}}:  Vel'Koz was a champion that I was excited for as soon as he was announced.  His personality is fantastic, and I love his (slightly twisted) curiosity about everything.  His kit is fun, and like Viktor, I never feel too confined in a specific build path.  I normally go mid with Vel, but I'm also good at playing him in a support position, if Nautilus isn't a good pick for the circumstances.  His ability for combos is great, and while he's one of my strongest picks, I don't think he's actually OP (despite what my opponents say).  I am nervous for his upcoming rework, but as long as his character remains the same, a few kit alterations probably won't stop me from gathering information about my opponents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurretHasAGlock","date":"2016-03-17T15:21:49.591+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That satisfying moment when you the 3rd proc hit kills with your boomerang {{champion:150}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2016-03-17T15:44:46.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:57}} \n\nHis Passive when I support with him.","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-03-17T15:46:23.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healing yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2016-03-17T15:53:08.293+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Dunk God,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ibgwU%%%,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2016-03-17T15:46:23.559+0000)\n>\n> Healing yourself?\n\nI'm not sure what your question is, but in the bot lane, he's gaining sap from 4 players, not 2, which dramatically increases his heal rate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lady Donatella","date":"2016-03-18T18:02:00.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:25}} I like it when they dont move ^.^","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2016-03-18T01:39:47.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Dunk God,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ibgwU%%%,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-17T15:20:09.502+0000)\n>\n> For Example, I Like Darius because ENDLESS DUNKS!!!\n\nI had a main once :( RIP {{champion:82}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkwind","date":"2016-03-18T01:24:02.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying \"Behold my darkest power...
