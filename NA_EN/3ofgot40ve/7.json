I go to his house often and we mess around in normals or just watch eachothers games. His mom, my aunt, wanted to make an account because she thought it would be fun if we could all play together. I helped her create an account and installed the Client on her laptop. Once she logged in, I informed her that she should try the Tutorial before playing a real game so she has a basic idea of the gameplay and objective. Once she loaded in and completed the first few tasks, I showed her how to recall. Once in base, I explained the Shop and the purpose of it before we hit a speed bump: Thornmail on Ashe. Our conversation went like this:\r\n\r\nMe: &quot;Ok so now that you have enough gold you can start buying items to make your champion stronger. This is telling you to build thornmail but your champion doesnt buy that item normally. On ashe you want to get a lot of damage, not armor. Buy the B.F Sword instead.&quot;\r\n\r\nMy Aunt: &quot;Wait, if im not supposed to build this why is it telling me to buy it?&quot;\r\n\r\nMe: &quot;...&quot;\r\n\r\nSeriously, if I wasnt there to tell her the right way to build, she would have thought Thornmail Ashe is completely normal, and would have gone into games getting flamed by the 5 million smurf accounts.

If, say, a new player was playing the game without a veteran's help, the armor would be good to show a fairly clear damage mitigation when you bought it. In fact, if I recall correctly, the Thornmail in that tutorial was *absurdly* more powerful than it is in real game. Save the specific stat attention for the more advanced (but still quite basic) tutorial.\n\nIf someone's learning the ropes, it's simply more helpful for you to do noticeably better defensively than offensively. If you end up chickening out when Trundle runs at you and running in circles screaming *toward the enemy tower* (I've seen it...), the game makes it more obvious that you have improved compared to your earlier self. However, if you can't focus him because you don't get that yet, you may hate this game before you get through the tutorial, which is the main thing they want to prevent...\n\nAnother thought that won't be popular. Some of the best monetary contributors end up being our more *casual* players. Sometimes, those types are just the ones who would give up after a horrific tutorial experience, particularly if someone's yelling behind them that they just fudged up the tutorial, and have huge mountains to climb.
