Good luck with that. No, you are going to try to either avoid the mundo, or help to burn him down. Or perhaps, the rest of your team will focus the mundo while you expend your mobility skills to get around him and attack higher priority targets. Either way, mundo has held the aggro of multiple players, therefore abilities that might've been used to damage or cc other members of his team are being expended on him to either burn him down or keep him off of the adc.

The zoning you described is a very underwhelming form of \"holding aggro\", and it stills does not let you control the flow of the fight. If an Assassin jumps on your carries, as Mundo (or Garen, or Nasus) you can't do anything about it. If a Malphite initiate on your carries, you can't do anything to stop their carries following up. If they sent one of them on a side lane to depush the lane and you are 5v4 mid, you can't do anything to engage and force the fight. You can't do anything that a true Tank should be able to do.

You continue to imply that tanks are required to be primary initiators, even though I have given specific examples of how this is not strictly true. Let's say you have a morgana or some other champ with ranged lockdown. No one would call morg a tank, but if she snares a priority target, a tank like mundo or garen can pop their speed boosts and charge in to follow up. They still serve as the damage sponge and zone out enemy damage dealers from the fight. It is true that some tanks do deal good damage (garen and nasus are good examples). Instead of the initiation and crowd control that you are requiring to be considered a tank, they have damage. It's not that they aren't tanks, they are just different kinds of tanks.\n\nAlso, and more importantly, you are digressing from the main point here. There is an inherent problem when a champion can build full \"tank\" and still 100 to 0 the enemy squishies with a single combo. It really doesn't matter what you want to call them, but \"tank assassins\" present an incredibly unhealthy playstyle. Don't get bogged down in the definitions when the real debate lies in the principle.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-30T18:29:39.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first, you're mixing it up with \"e.g.\", but that's not really important. It doesn't matter if \"taunt\" was just an example, it's still true that Nasus, Garen and Mundo have pretty much nothing  --neither taunt nor anything else-- to hold aggro.\n\nSecond, I'm not \"operating under my own assumptions\", and I never said that \"tanks are required to be primary initiators\". Even in the post just above, I also mentioned peeling against an Assassin and disrupting the enemy carries after THEIR initiation. What I **did** say was that Tanks are required to provide control over the flow of a fight, and that's not my own assumption, that's the definition used by Riot, **which is a very logical adaptation to a PvP game from the original definition coined for PvE RPG games**. Never have a Tank dealt large amount of damages, that was never their purpose, and what follows from that is that a champ who primarily provides damage is not a Tank at all, not \"a different kind of Tank\", even if it is a durable character.\n\nFinally, I'm not digressing from the point where I started participating in the conversation, which was already 6 comments down the tree. I obviously agree with the original topic about \"Tank Assassins\", and I just made a shot reply to correct a factual error. So yeah, you can say that I'm not participating in a debate, because I am not. There is nothing open to debate here, I'm not providing my own opinion, and it was never intended to turn into a debate.\n\n\nP.S.: regarding i.e. versus e.g. you can have a look here http://grammarist.com/usage/ie-eg/  or check another dictionary http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ie_1#ie_1__8\nEven in your own link, if you read the real definitions (the part in pink) it says the same thing.

The fact of the matter is assassins used to be balanced with a thing called Feast or Famine. They sucked at last hitting and if you pushed your wave against them, they would have to choose between losing gold or roaming with you. They snowball hard but again since hard to farm, you primarily gain gold by kills which coined the term \"Feast or famine.\" This was a legitimate strat to beating assassins. After all, assassin's don't really take that much skill to play especially champs like Fizz/Ekko/Yi/Akali and even Zed. Zed TBH is easy. Just because they can make cool, hard plays doesn't mean they are hard to play (like LeBlanc is fucking easy to play, tell me why you reward someone for point n clicking two buttons and allow them to burst down like 50% of hp? because you can juke with her clone?).\n\nChamps like Zed and Fizz, who are among the safest assassin's were the bane. Zed primarily. Think about it. Is playing champs like Talon really hard? No. Shit is so simple. There's barely any mechanical skill involved and learning the game knowledge behind the champ kit and match ups and builds is easy. But nah since 90% of the community is basically silver or below with horrid mechanics everyone believes they are hard to play. In pro games, it's about who makes the least amount of mistakes. Trust me... our games are NOWHERE the same even if it's the same exact champs/items/runes/masteries.\n\nSo why was it removed? F&F? When assassin's were already being balanced, why would they do this? Well Riot felt it was too one-dimensional way to counter assassins. IMO it wasn't. PLAYING assassins is one dimensional. I mean hell if you pick assassin every goddamn game with no regards to consequences, you shouldn't be rewarded simply for picking a champ. You still required mechanics and game knowledge to counter against assassins. It was still a skill lane. \n\nTLl;DR\n**Riot thought well if we lower scaling and increase base damage, they might snowball a lot softer and not as fast. And so assassin's should be balanced... but wait. Why are the assassins now building tanky? Oh wait wtf?

He is completely broken, if the enemy team is not organized or completely useless.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-06-29T12:30:53.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you stopped complaining and took a moment to realize that Khazix can't kill overextended carries of they're not 425 units away from a minion or ally, maybe you would be stomping him pas laning phase.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-06-28T16:30:54.241+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"its just the sheer excess of damage, its either you do enough to kill someone instantly, or you aren't picked. its just that when an assassin builds tanky, he still has enough damage to kill your ADC, and live.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MuyAstuto","date":"2016-06-29T02:25:46.985+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"What trash elo do you play in?\n\nfizz just got nerfed and it hurt him a lot.\nekko got nerfed and it hurt him a lot.\nyi is actual garbage right now.\nakali has always sucked and I bet you don't even buy pink wards.\n\nThe high damage tanks right now are hecarim skarner and voli.","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-06-29T02:33:35.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> What trash elo do you play in?\n\nCurrently in Silver, 1 division under you, with around 60% win rate.

I'm going to be honest, they aren't in every game, but I can recall at least 5/20 games in my current match history with either tank ekko, tank fizz, or tank yasuo.\n\n> I personally hope I see these champions in all my games because they are garbage tier compared to what is actually strong right now and it is freelo to play against them.

But that's besides the point, your games alone do not represent the entire playerbase, and neither do mine. Considering we are seeing opposite sides of the spectrum, Its hard to say for sure. But the fact that it is being built in the first place is an issue in my opinion.\n\n> ps. 77% winrate on my main champ and I'm in gold III.

You really think that's an accurate representation of your win rate? Ide say around 50+ games is understandable. Also, I know the difference between someone in gold and someone in challenger. Don't tell me I don't. I respect people in diamond+, or anyone in a higher division than me. I would have respected you to but your huge ego and immaturity isn't really a value I appreciate in someone.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"51653971DEL1","date":"2016-06-29T01:34:53.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Still not as bad as the juggernaut meta.","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-06-29T01:46:15.741+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://img.memecdn.com/darius-op_o_1024482.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}
