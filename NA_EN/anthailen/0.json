PLZ HELP ME","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I download the alpha client, I can install it but it says that there was a \"problem running the post-install step. Installation may not be complete correctly\". I click next and then it patches it and when I open it it works fine but when I close it again, it makes me install and patch it again which is a complete waste of my time. I would rather just play on the existing launch than alpha considering it takes about 8 min to do all that including patch. I am using a mac so would that make a difference? {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T05:14:48.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend uninstalling any current existing versions of the Alpha Client before [running a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq5) with the regular client, then trying to install the Alpha client again.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"anthailen","date":"2016-11-09T00:47:51.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still says that there is a problem with running the \"post install step\".

I'd recommend   grabbing out [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) in order to complete a **clean reinstallation of League**. After launching the app, check the boxes for *reinstall* and *clean uninstall*, then press START. After the process finishes, launch League to finish patching. After League has been patched completely, you can grab a standalone installer for the Alpha Client [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/download).\n\nI'm really hoping that this works for you. Since the Alpha Client is still relatively new, we're still getting a handle on how to resolve really unique issues like yours.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
