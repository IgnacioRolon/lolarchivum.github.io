Have you checked out the [Wrenchmen's Toolbox](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/peVhMJAo-the-wrenchmens-toolbox-common-solutions-to-your-problems-technical-issues) concerning FPS drops? It has a lot of valuable info that can help increase your FPS.\n\nAfter going through that, Deleting your Game.cfg file may help alleviate some of these bad drops. You can find it at:\n\n Your Install location (Usually your C: drive) > Riot Games > League of Legends > Config\n\nAfter deleting the file, start a custom game so that the file recreates itself with the proper settings!","replies":[]}]}
