I really like all of his skins now instead of almost liking them! I really like the Grey WW skin now, though I would like if you would change Hyena WW&#039;s W animation from the glowing red Eyes to some Engine fire things. Because that would be sick! Anyways this shows that you listen to what the comunity wants, so thank you riot (if you ever read this).\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\nI feel that most posts I see complains about something they want or something that should be better or that Yasuo is too op. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a post that is thanking riot for their good work and for creating the game that we love and play.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-01-21T00:12:51.861+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3","replies":[{"poster":"Wolf Queen","date":"2017-02-13T16:51:43.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how all you have to do is put a \"<3\" and you get more likes then the OP who wrote a paragraph.

Nearly all looks pretty damn well. But i am still bifid about feral-changes. but tundra, fire and now hyena and grey are topnotch!

Too bad many are dissapointed at feral though {{champion:32}}. I don't think it is a great loss because it is much better than the old feral ww skin. I mean that was just a chroma basicly. It would be cool to have a skin that is more of a beast and a original wherewolf but I think most people would use the other skins either way. Thats just my opinion though and I hope everyone find a skin for them and don't get too upset about Feral.","replies":[{"poster":"Slich Bissi","date":"2017-01-26T19:47:11.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old Feral Warwick was a big change when it was first released. It set a precedent for a totally different body type. The original Warwick was quite skinny and thin, but Feral Warwick looked like a hulking monster - totally unleashed. He was a madman unchained, his collar and the broken shackles on his wrist, plus the scars on his back and his huge muscles.\n\nThe new one is just more of the same except with \"insane asylum straightjacket stuff\" instead of \"ice stuff\" or \"Fire stuff\" or \"mad max car stuff\" \n\nIt doesn't stand out like it used to, it doesn't change his body type or add any new or different dimensions. Ironically, however, Tundra Hunter used to literally just be a white recolor, and is now very different. It adds scars, an ice arm, the ice spike on his back, armor and all kinds of goodies. \n\nI guess some people just want a bulky/muscular Warwick or something that's totally different like the original Feral was (at the time of release) compared to his \"normal stature\".","replies":[{"poster":"mr Boombastic787","date":"2017-02-13T16:49:31.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds really bad as.
