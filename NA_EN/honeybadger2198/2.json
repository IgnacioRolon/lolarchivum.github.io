And, when I think about it, he is the only champion that is actually affected by the QSS nerfs. I agree that being able to buy an item to remove a champion from the game isn&#039;t balanced, but now I feel like Zed is going to crowd out any of these brand new shiny midlaners. Left out of a solution? I have one.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not as well put together as I&#039;d like, but I just came up with the idea on the spot. _Rework Zed_. Specifically, his ultimate. The thematic and gameplay of Zed is fantastic, don&#039;t get me wrong. However, his ultimate is incredibly feast or famine. His playstyle overall is fairly feast or famine, with room to make plays which makes his famine less detrimental to a high-skill player. It&#039;s either --&gt; kill the carry and then sit in the backline for cooldowns, or die trying/fail to finish off the carry and sit in the backline doing nothing.\r\n\r\nNow, I don&#039;t have any ideas myself on what it should be changed to that would make it thematically and mechanically pleasing like his current ult, but I do feel like it definitely needs a change. Until then, Zed is permabanned at nearly all elos.","replies":[]}
