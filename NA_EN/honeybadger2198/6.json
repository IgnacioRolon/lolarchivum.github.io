This renders the client completely unusable. Restarting client does fix it, but I would prefer to not have to relog after every game.","replies":[{"poster":"JP79194","date":"2016-12-01T20:42:52.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annd this is one of the potential problems with the new client design.  Different elements of the client are basically run as separate programs and then stitched together (from what I understand).  Looks like one of the elements either closed (somehow) or was improperly rendered.\n\nDid this just start happening after the most recent patch, or has it been occurring since you got the beta client?\n\nEither way, you can try the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and repatch or reinstall from there.  May or may not fix your problem, but its worth a shot.\n\nHope this helped!\n - JP","replies":[]}]}
