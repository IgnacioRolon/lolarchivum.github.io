It provided sustain in lane while you farmed gold to get to finish the item, and it supplemented the low powerspike it gave by giving you more sustain. It was honestly really nice to have. And what did they replace it with? This stupid thing. Imagine: you spend HALF your mana pool, and you only get an odd 70 hp. Sure, this would be nice at LEVEL ONE, but you can&#039;t start this item. It literally makes me not want to build RoA on anyone no matter if they need it. People building RoA are NOT TANKS, so why do they create an incentive for you to TAKE DAMAGE?","replies":[]}
