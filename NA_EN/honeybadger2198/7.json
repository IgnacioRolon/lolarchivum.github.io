First they had Spirit of the Spectral Wraith for all those &quot;I want stats&quot; champions. Then they moved into a more specialized Runeglaive, which I thought was a step in the right direction. Now, however, they see some flaws with that item too and are replacing it with this new Runic Echoes as of 6.1. Clearly, they see issues with these items consistently and can&#039;t seem to settle on one idea.\n\nThe reason for this is simple. AP junglers are weird. They can&#039;t be like an AP midlaner because they have to be able to put out consistent damage and also be able to tank jungle monsters. No easy task for sure. However, champions all handle this problem differently. Fiddlesticks relies almost entirely on his drain, where champions like Nidalee rely on low cooldown abilities mixed with auto attacks. I use these two champions to demonstrate on purpose. One (Fiddlesticks) benefits greatly from Runic Echoes compared to Runeglaive, and the other (Nidalee) benefits very little from Runic Echoes, but Runeglaive synergizes immensely with her kit.\n\nSo here&#039;s what I propose. Why not have both? I fail to see any sort of downside to having both of them in the shop. &quot;Oh, but all the other champions only have one option so why should AP junglers be any different?&quot; Wrong, sir! Take Rek&#039;Sai, for instance. In nearly every game we saw of LCS, people build Cinderhulk with her. Howver, just last night she was built with Warrior in the Challenger series and got a Pentakill. &quot;But Devourer&#039;s are stuck in their build too!&quot; Again, wrong. Take Xin Zhao for example. Many people don&#039;t like to build Devourer on him because it makes him weaker early. Or, remember when Devourer was disabled? I played Warrior Master Yi and it worked perfectly fine. It&#039;s not just warrior that&#039;s versatile, either. Shyvana can build either Devourer or Cinderhulk, but doesn&#039;t even bat an eye at Warrior.\n\nSo here&#039;s what I propose. Bring back Runeglaive! there&#039;s no reason (that I can see at least) as to why we can&#039;t have both. If you guys have any reason why this would bring about the League-apocalypse, tell me! I&#039;d love to hear what you guys have to say. I know Riot already addressed this sorta but really their &quot;explanation&quot; did not dissuade me at all. To quote them in the 6.1 Patch Notes, they said &quot;We trade a lot of clarity in balance to keep two items that should functionally serve the same class.&quot; To me, it just seemed like they said &quot;We are afraid that we won&#039;t balance them correctly, so we aren&#039;t doing it.&quot; However, they were looking at Runeglaive as it was, and Runic Echoes as it is now. In truth, they would need to be more distinct from each other in order to serve the purpose of suiting specific needs.\n\nGood Luck, but more importantly, Have Fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Auturgist","date":"2016-01-15T02:32:47.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think Runeglaive was a far better item for AP junglers when it came to dueling because you could weave Sheen procs into your abilities against another champion when you skirmish, where Runic Echoes gives you one proc and then it's useless before they kill you if they are bursty.","replies":[{"poster":"Honeybadger2198","date":"2016-01-16T04:34:21.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree entirely Runeglaive fit the AP junglers much better since they had to auto constantly and gave them better clear. This item just feels weird and out of place in the jungle. It put Elise even farther down on the tier list, and it seems to me that it only actually brought Fiddlesticks up. Other than that it's mostly a sidegrade for champions UNTIL they balance it because it's new therefore broken. Once it's balanced, nearly every champion will get downgraded. Goodbye AP junglers..","replies":[]}]}]}
