What does that mean? Well, it resets turret aggro for him perfectly. It breaks all sorts of things (Malzahar&#039;s ultimate, to name one). It makes him extremely hard to finish a kill on. The list could go on and on, but he&#039;s new so I haven&#039;t yet experienced all the possible hells this could bring.\r\n\r\nOkay, now on to why I really made this post. Why, in the name of all that is holy and sacred in this world, does he heal **SO MUCH**. Just look at this. &quot;Kled restores 4 / 20 Courage on takedowns, and 5 / 15 Courage for dealing damage. At 100 Courage, Skaarl returns to the fight with 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% of his health.&quot; For simply doing damage, Kled will eventually heal _half to nearly all of his health_. Just. WHY?","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-08-19T03:19:05.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's list off every strength and conveniently forget every weakness.\nLike, no 30 second static cooldown.\nOr him losing 75% of his abilities.\nOr losing the majority of his movement speed (unless he's running towards someone which would be stupid to do by himself with that low health).","replies":[{"poster":"UmSwammy","date":"2016-08-19T09:26:55.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if he tower dives he gets the kill loses Skarll and then loses agro. Then can recall get all his health back and Skarll back. Also in team fights losing abilities doesn't matter to him he only needs his W to completely destroy people. While he is in a team fight (Without Skarll) his W gets Skarll back in like 3 hits witch also has increased attack speed and damage. Then once Skarll is back he is practically doesn't die with all the health. Especially when a teamfight goes on with him in it by the time he loses Skarll and she comes back the fight is over and Kled can chase down the survivors.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-08-19T13:43:13.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, well.\n\nYes, losing tower aggro is dumb.\n\nI mean you could say the same for anyone else that can tower dive and either lose a lot of health and/or have an invulnerability mechanic. (The recall after dive to get full health thing)\n\nUh, if Kled's health is that low and no one is hitting him in a teamfight, that's your fault. And if he doesn't have Skaarl, it is low.\n\nUh no. Each hit against a champion restores 15 courage. He needs 100 to get Skaarl back. So, that's more like 6-7 hits.\n\nIf he loses Skaarl in a teamfight and you guys don't kill him as punishment, that's partially your fault. Kled by himself is incredibly squishy and is basically a melee carry. So there's no reason to not just focus and kill him first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
