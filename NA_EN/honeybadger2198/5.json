The complaints about how it&#039;s &quot;not fair&quot; to solo players is mostly bull from what I see. I&#039;ve played completely solo this entire season and I&#039;ve climbed higher than I ever have before (peak Diamond 1 36 lp). So on that front, I think the poll data that was said is fairly accurate despite the vocal minority telling you otherwise. That isn&#039;t the problem for me.\n\nThe problem I find with DQ is that I&#039;m actually getting my role less than before. Last season, I averaged maybe 90% of my games on my main role (jungle). This season, the max streak I&#039;ve hit is 7 games of off-role in a row. And this auto-fill stuff just is going to make it worse. I want my role, and I do not care how long I have to wait. 20 minutes? Fine. Half an hour? As long as I get my role. There is nothing worse to me than loading up into the lobby and seeing that I&#039;m stuck mid.\n\nSo what&#039;s the all encompassing solution? Because some people disagree and just want to play, while other people dread not getting their role. There may seem to be no real answer. &quot;Can&#039;t please everyone,&quot; right? I&#039;ve got an idea. It may not be incredibly refined, but you guys can do that. Why not take the idea of picking roles one step farther, and add how much you want that role? If you want 1 role no matter how long it takes, 100%. If you don&#039;t care what role you get, you can have a fill. If there is a slight preference, you can sort out the percentages as you see fit. Example: 30% Mid, 20% Top, 20% Jungle, 20% ADC, 10% Support. Obviously, you&#039;d have to add up to 100%, but I believe that this is a task your playerbase is up to doing for the sake of flexibility, something you guys have been severely lacking lately.","replies":[]}
