I understand that the Jinx skin shouldn't be legacy because she only has 3 total, but both nidalee and katarina have a bunch of skins already so I don't get why their lunar revel skins won't go into the vault. Especially when riven's lunar revel skin is legacy and she has less skins than both nidalee and kat. Same thing with Leblanc and her new harrowing skin. Doesn't seem fair to me.","replies":[]}]}]}
