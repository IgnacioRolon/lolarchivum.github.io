Just recently played a game with a duo queue who had never played ranked before. They were mid and ADC and I was the jungler and I had over 100 cs more than them by the end of the game with a much higher kill participation too. Their lane opponents had triple their cs by the end of the game. They also didn't have any runes and their builds were questionable at best (our ziggs ADC built a triforce 2nd item.)\n\nI have no idea why Riot starts people out at Silver MMR.

It was to balanced the game out as the system probably indicated you to be a higher player rather than just Silver.\n\nI have my Silver account in Platinum games because the MMR was higher and in your case you are lower ranked BUT higher MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Kirius Dark","date":"2017-02-14T02:09:27.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have so few actual ranked games on this account, made late last year.

Pants are Dragon had a Gold/platinum game when he was Challenger with 400 LP or so. Crazy world.\n\nMy best guess is the MMR system that 'balances' the MMR rating as shown on na.op.gg took the platinum/diamond into the game to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Kirius Dark","date":"2017-02-14T16:52:45.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure my MMR is inflated.

I could _maybe_ with a long stretch understand if it were the plats and diamonds were still doing placements in season 7, but that's not the case when I have a current season 7 diamond and plat on my team to grossly inflate the MMRs. Was I the only jungler queuing at the time or what?

No matter what there has to be a starting place to go up or down with and that place is silver. Think of it like this silver is 0 mmr were people start bronze is negative and gold+ is positive. It's much better overall to have peoples first game in silver to see if they can hold there own or get crushed then to place them all in bronze because then smurfing would then become an actual problem where at the moment smurfing isn't really that big of a deal and the odds of getting someone who doesn't know what there doing in your silver game is really unlikely and with that one loss they are now considerably lower mmr.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2017-02-14T19:45:05.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking doesn't take into account of last seasons MMR, just current season.

The same can be said for gains.\n\nThat is why Tier(s) are not a good way to judge a player. \n\nHowever, I think your trying to suggest that \"time/experience\" is unfair in the MM and that is a potential problem because, no matter how high a person's MMR, if they are not adept to the meta, or the \"way the game is played\" that gives the other team an advantage.\n\nBut, by using time/experience as a factor in MM, then it would negatively impact other games too. Because the counter saying goes, just because you play more does not mean your good and vice versa (there could be geniuses).\n\nSo I think what you want is a balance between time/experience, MMR and League Tier to be placed into consideration when making matches, am I correct?","replies":[]}]}
