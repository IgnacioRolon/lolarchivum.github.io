I can see the cursor, move it, click and see the green arrows pointing to that spot, but my champ won't move. It only happens when I'm using an Ethernet cable, but I lag on wireless. It's not lag because everything else in game works like its supposed to. It only happens for a few seconds at the time, but its pretty inconvenient. Does anybody know how to fix it, and if so how? Any answer would be great, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T16:48:35.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At a glance, it sounds like your network might be suffering from packet loss.
