Since League patches only change files inside the League install directory, it's unlikely a patch caused this. While there are certainly a lot of potential causes for this issue, our [Bugsplat and Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) goes over some steps I recommend starting with. \n\nIf you still experience system freezes after working through that guide, get back to me.","replies":[]}]}
