I really wish there was something we could do, but unfortunately, because you're given two confirmations before you rent a skin, we cannot undo the rental.\n\nEach rental gets a final confirmation with this button:\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/o9NRR\n\nSo in the future, I recommend to double check the button before you press it.

I mean why would i waste an entire skin shard that was super valuable on a temporary trial? and why would that consume it? As a suggestion I would say that trialing a skin shard shouldnt destroy it . . . .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TSM Karino","date":"2016-08-09T21:09:45.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-08-09T22:52:42.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sadistic so it made me giggle, but overall #FeelsBad.","replies":[]}]}
