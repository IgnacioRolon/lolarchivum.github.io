Can you make this a regular thing if at all possible??\r\n\r\nIf need be I think the community (me included) can do most of the legwork in making it happen and I honestly believe we can make the boards a better place that we enjoy going to on a regular basis (enough of those f*ck you rito posts dominating the boards&#039; &quot;hot&quot; section every bloody day).\r\n\r\nFor us and for league can we have a writing hub that can be completely community based but started off by you so that we may do what we love but also share our passions with others which I think is the greatest gift you can give (not expendable rp). We can build our universe of league together, us the community in hand with riot","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2015-08-06T12:34:29.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had no idea about no contest.

Comments, critiques, accolades for things you worked on due to inspiration and driven by your imagination of how things could be is pretty much what a lot of writers strive for; that goes for both amateur and professional.\n\nWhile it might be more than you can summon up, I would say a small spotlight would work.  Maybe not as glorious as the Artist Spotlights we see every now and then, but just knowing that your work got even MORE light then what you originally threw it out for is nice.\n\n\nEDIT: I just noticed a bunch of grammatical errors.
