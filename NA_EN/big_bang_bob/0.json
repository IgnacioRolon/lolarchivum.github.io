Warp storms teleports random heroes from their franchises to strange arenas where they have to battle for nexus energies and hopefully a chance to return home. Best premise? Nah.

Since it's intermission, all the factions are available, and there are no declarations, so as long as you have 10 Summoners willing to play, you can run a match and send it in.
