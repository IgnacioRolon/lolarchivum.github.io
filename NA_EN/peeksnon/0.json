I then realized that the only time I would get freeze/lag was when I moved my mouse. Whether I was moving the camera with the mouse or just moving to click on a minion or something I would freeze, and the longer i had moved the mouse without stopping the longer the freeze. This caused me to lose my first ranked game and thus I tried to fix it. I changed my graphics settings, camera settings, and mouse settings to no avail. I repaired the game files and still nothing. Now whenever I am in game I get this freeze with the slightest mouse movement, but everything is fine out of a game. Anyone have any solutions? I cant for the life of me play with this irritating freeze.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-01-23T18:27:32.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Peeksnon,\n\nThis sometimes happens when you have a corruption in one of your game files.

I still don't understand why in-game is fine, and there is no lag or anything, but the second that I start moving my mouse it freezes until i let go of the mouse and stop moving it around. If i were to leave the mouse going in the right direction without touching it the camera pans with no freeze or issues, but if i were to make a sudden mouse movement up and then stop it will freeze for a second then it will move the camera (and actually it will overshoot the camera because of the freeze). I had just played the day before the patch was applied and everything was as it should be. I have restarted the computer, checked for windows/driver updates, but everything is fine until the second i get into game and start moving the mouse. Once I am out of the game everything is fine, even in the matchmaking lobby, etc.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sheton Mystics","date":"2015-12-30T04:41:48.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This fixed a problem for me; when I was in game, every 10 minutes or so, everyone would move around but no spell/cast/animations of any sort would show up.

On the 3rd match I just muted him but then he kept pinging me all game so I had to mute sounds as well and eventually won at last with 3 of our team annoyed at 9th for pinging so much just to try annoy me. I asked 2nd why his duo was being such an ahole but he just said don't ask me and the matches thereafter thankfully didn't have them. So the mouse freezing started and it only affected my movement with 1-5s delays and worsened to the point that I have to press hard on the corner of my right click with double to triple taps just to move. Another day has passed and I tried to play but I have full blown lag ingame now, I can't target people for auto attacks, 3-7s delays in movement, and 2 s casting delay. I already repaired it and checked my mouse and it's all normal until I start playing ingame. I'm not sure if it's the patch or another 2012 moment and I sometimes see more than 1 LoL running in my task manager :/ {{summoner:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2015-08-20T05:11:28.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.dailydot.com/esports/jason-shane-duffy-league-of-legends-hacks/ \"another 2012 moment\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chaosfox100","date":"2015-01-23T17:31:20.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having same think at most game lag freeze and cant move than cut you off am I right\nplay bot game getting freeze there as well ","replies":[{"poster":"Peeksnon","date":"2015-01-23T17:42:29.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no matter what map, game mode, or graphics setting whenever I move the mouse it freezes the game up until i stop moving it","replies":[{"poster":"TheMaddKing91","date":"2015-01-25T00:43:00.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening to me too =/ I'm not sure why but whenever I move the mouse the screen freezes.
