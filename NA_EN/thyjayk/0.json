Reason being I was playing a game in the mid lane as Ahri{{champion:103}} . I was going against a Galio{{champion:3}} . So you know him and his ult he will basically teleport around the map. I would kill the Galio and on his way back to lane he would use his ult before i could even see him. Sadly my team was mad at me for not calling MIA when he would ult. As if that would do anything. Anyways they continue to flame and get mad at me. the Mord{{champion:82}}  top laner (a gold player) thought this was my fault i thought maybe a gold player would be somewhat knowledgeable to the fact that this was not my fault. Next thing I know Galio is going bot lane with his ult  and my bot lane was already like 1-7 and 0-5-1 so they had no reason to say that  they were losing because of me also I had roamed down there too I got a double kill and the ADC (Gp){{champion:41}}  got a kill so there was nothing i was doing wrong also i was never flaming i was defending myself the whole game telling them to back off and not flame me for I was doing nothing to deserve that flame. If a rioter does see this I would like them to go back and look at the chat because my team would be the ones getting banned. sorry for that rant but I don&#039;t deserve a ban. Also I didn&#039;t bother to report them because I think its pointless and stupid because i&#039;m never going to have to see this person again and somebody else will report them for being toxic and I can&#039;t be the one to blame for their ban. thanks for reading this. Also if any of you have had this same experience please comment about it in the comment of this so we cant prove a point.","replies":[]}
