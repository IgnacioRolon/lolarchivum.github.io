Win or lose we are all amazing gamers so lets all play to win!\" \n- Dude that is one hell of a \"Gl-HF\" \n\n- Players on the opposite team  don't need the praise; you don't know them and most likely never will outside of League anyways.  Their GL-HF is (GL) You lose the game and hopefully they destroy you and your team and (HF) again their \"have fun\" is destroying you by winning the game.  \n\n- Just ignore them by muting them.  I honestly don't understand why people aren't just muting people 0.00.01 secs into the game before the fountain lets you leave.  League of Legends is a TOXIC GAME and always will be; not that Riot aren't trying to stop it but at the same time you can't 100% get rid of something. \n\n- Enemy team should be instant muted at the start of every game.  Unless you're trying to make it a personal fun time you have no reason not to.  They want to WIN and make you and your teammates tilt by being \"toxic\" so why not have them muted at the start anyways.  \n\n- If it upsets you and it's been going on for X amount of time, then STOP TALKING TO PEOPLE IN CHAT.  Play with friends and mute the X amount of random baboons.  If your friends are all jolly, cool and happy then you don't need anything else and you wouldn't have the \" I learn from others as they do for me\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-10-29T03:19:16.395+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, that's so hilariously positive that I'd probably assume you were trolling. \n\nBut hey, keep it up.
