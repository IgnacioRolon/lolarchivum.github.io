But all of a sudden starting yesterday going into today when i get on leauge (no update for league) its just so unplayable and my fps studders from 60-40's and 50's causing massive spikes ingame while my ping is 40ms all the time... I really want to continue playing this amazing game but idk what to do, i updated my drivers to the current one and if anything its even worse than before, idk if its windows 10 or what but i would hate to remove windows 10 because new games and software will be released to windows 10 only. All help is much appreciated and thank you guys so much! ALSO this is the only game/software this is effecting nothing else, so i believe its a driver issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-20T01:41:13.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you should try there FPS KB and give that a try. http://riot.com/1ImOOAy <--- That's the link.
