I quickly realized it was a scam and didn't go any further. I changed my password just to be sure but am I at risk just by going to the site and only entering my username and region? and would going to the link from the client affect the information they get at all? I was told that as long as i didn't enter any info in a survey I would be fine. I just want to know if my account is at risk just by visiting the site from the client and by entering only my username and region.
