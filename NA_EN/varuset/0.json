I managed to record stuff about 2/3 into the game but passed that, the replay will keep playing, but if I try to record anything it bugsplats consistently at the same time. I've never had issues with recording replays before and I'll admit I don't use it often, but I'm wondering if the bugsplat is something with the most recent patch or if there's something you can do to fix it.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T20:16:31.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be due to some corrupt game files that's failing to render the game while attempting to use the replay too.
