I especially put it very low  now because i started getting blue screens when in game. I recently did the updates for LoL so i don't if it's because of the updates maybe Riot has to do some more updates for it to be fixed i don't know. I know that everyone will start saying that something might be wrong with your computer but everything's fine and how i know well, i play gta and i have NEVER gotten a blue screen. So it might be a coincidence that i get it when i play LoL but i don't think so. My computer is not the best but its decent to run LoL on MEDIUM even though i put it on VERY LOW -_- SO i think it's Riot and hopefully they keep doing updates and fixing bugs because it must be them. If anyone thinks it might be something else I'd like to hear it :) Thanks...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T21:24:10.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your new card could be faulty or not installed properly, but it could also be as simple as your drivers not be up to date.
