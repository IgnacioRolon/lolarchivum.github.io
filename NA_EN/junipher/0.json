I just bought a bunch of RP in preparation so I could gift the skin to my friend who can't afford it. She has been so hyped for this skin and now we're fucked? Really Riot?  Also I heard something about this skin being on sale for today.  Is that true?  If so, WHY DOESN'T IT SAY THAT ON THE CLIENT!?!?!? I'm so fucking pissed. Her Christmas present is officially ruined.  Been playing this game for years, and I've never felt so betrayed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T00:48:18.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *The Easy Target* mentioned, gifting hasn't made it to the *Beta Client* yet, but you can always launch into the *Legacy Client* to gift your friend, you just can't gift a bundle (only the skin).
