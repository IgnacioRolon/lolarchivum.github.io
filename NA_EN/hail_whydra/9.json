Unless I was in a ranked team that is. If it was just the ability to choose two roles then I would probably still have a higher chance of wanting to try out ranked. And with the Normal Draft mode using Dynamic Queue its more seamless trying to get into a match due to how the Queuing works for Draft mode since it works with NCS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-06-01T19:08:50.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I enjoy DQ as well.

That's the reason Riot thinks we are fine with Dynamic Queue.\n\n---\n\nPicking two roles is CHAMPION SELECT.\n\nPlaying with or aganist up to 5 morons getting carried by Diamond smurfs is DYNAMIC QUEUE.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-06-01T19:14:43.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you at least not act condescending towards someone's opinion?
