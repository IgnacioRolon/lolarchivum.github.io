I realize that I should have cooperated better, and of course heeded the warnings I got, but honestly I had been much better after I came back from the first suspension. I really feel I did not deserve to be permanently banned from the result of this game. I know there were a few words there I should not have used, but other than that, it was only the one player that was actually insulting me and being rude towards me in game early on, and that&#039;s what started with the mute and me replying back. Then, when un mute him, he just keeps say things towards me. I wasn&#039;t being rude or anything towards the others. But everyone but one player ganged up on me with the warwick player. Honestly, I really feel riot could at least see the full chat to see what the other player was doing to antagonize me. Again, I said nothing wrong to the others but they continue to call me trolls and swear at me. If anything, the warwick player started it, and would not stop early on which really gets on peoples nerves. He was also toxic towards the top and adc player, when I was not. We ended up winning this game, as I realized I could not compromise with the players so I thought, just play and see what happens. If anything, If I had been toxic towards everyone and clearly shows, I totally get that I deserve it. Also, I really think the next ban should be as extreme as &#039;banned for a year&#039;. Permanently banned for a game like this because of one player scrutinizing me to start with, is really harsh in my opinion. And honestly, a year ban would really put things to perspective for a player and give him a good amount of time to fix mistakes and be a better person overall whether it be in life or in game. Another option I thought was to hand out a perma ban in ranked, assuming it happens in ranked, as I feel that is where these problems normally occur considering the competitiveness. \r\nLet me know what anyone thinks about this and I appreciate any advice and such. Thank you.\r\nMy chat is below from the most recent game where I had received the permanent ban. Really hoped to show the chat for the other players so to provide more proof on the matter.\r\n\r\nAlso, at the moment I am trying to contact and talk with Riot Support, unless I am to speak with somebody else, and discuss with them about this, and if it was even ever possible to receive a years&#039; ban instead. This is really important to me of course, and I would have no problem receiving a lengthy ban such as that and give myself that time to be better in every aspect. I spent a good amount of money to enjoy the game a bit more, as everyone does, so it hurts for all of it to be gone because of one game. And of course, I understand I received warnings, but honestly, I&#039;ve been reported for very minimal things in the past as well when I am equally the victim, and more or less ganged up on by the others, in which I would be reported for &#039;trolling&#039; because I did not want to help them in game after I received the verbal abuse.\r\n\r\nApologizes for the rant!\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nI Ronaldinho I: muted\r\nI Ronaldinho I: meanwhile\r\nI Ronaldinho I: ww not watching mid\r\nI Ronaldinho I: useless jg\r\nI Ronaldinho I: ahha\r\nI Ronaldinho I: called mia\r\nI Ronaldinho I: scrub\r\nI Ronaldinho I: reported for being a lier\r\nI Ronaldinho I: but okay\r\nI Ronaldinho I: thanks for taking blue when i wanted one at least\r\nI Ronaldinho I: im gonna farm and help when i want to\r\nI Ronaldinho I: yeah vayne, lier.\r\nI Ronaldinho I: i wasnt even toxic what so ever lmao\r\nI Ronaldinho I: it doesnt matter. you are looking at spelling when im trying to make a point\r\nI Ronaldinho I: thats how clueless you both are\r\nI Ronaldinho I: of course\r\nI Ronaldinho I: you are on the side of the one thats fed\r\nI Ronaldinho I: and carrying you\r\nI Ronaldinho I: as i said, im gonna farm and play my own game\r\nI Ronaldinho I: you were toxic all game\r\nI Ronaldinho I: i can report you easily\r\nI Ronaldinho I: you took blue and were never helping what so ever\r\nI Ronaldinho I: ww is fed he should be carrying us\r\nI Ronaldinho I: exactly\r\nI Ronaldinho I: thats why im a huge part\r\nI Ronaldinho I: of this team\r\nI Ronaldinho I: apparently not to ww\r\nI Ronaldinho I: but again\r\nI Ronaldinho I: he should be carrying anyway\r\nI Ronaldinho I: lmfa\r\nI Ronaldinho I: look at ww\r\nI Ronaldinho I: you guys are all backing his ass.\r\nI Ronaldinho I: when hes farming\r\nI Ronaldinho I: jg\r\nI Ronaldinho I: lmfao\r\nI Ronaldinho I: im done\r\nI Ronaldinho I: ive seen it all\r\nI Ronaldinho I: teams blame me when im being antagonized\r\nI Ronaldinho I: all game by him\r\nI Ronaldinho I: you should tell him\r\nI Ronaldinho I: see\r\nI Ronaldinho I: all you are doign\r\nI Ronaldinho I: is saying awful stuff\r\nI Ronaldinho I: to me\r\nI Ronaldinho I: and not ww\r\nI Ronaldinho I: cause hes doing the best\r\nI Ronaldinho I: on the team\r\nI Ronaldinho I: its obvious\r\nI Ronaldinho I: you guys are reported anyway\r\nI Ronaldinho I: thats just awful. how you guys treat others\r\nI Ronaldinho I: always ganging up on the one playe\r\nI Ronaldinho I: my team is so toxic towards me..\r\nI Ronaldinho I: doesnt matteer you are all reported\r\nI Ronaldinho I: for being rude to me all game\r\nI Ronaldinho I: this league community..\r\nI Ronaldinho I: lets win\r\nI Ronaldinho I: k lets win\r\nI Ronaldinho I: nice\r\nI Ronaldinho I: okay lets try\r\nI Ronaldinho I: wait for minions\r\nI Ronaldinho I: kat\r\nI Ronaldinho I: nice\r\nI Ronaldinho I: oh well\r\nI Ronaldinho I: nice guys\r\nI Ronaldinho I: naut\r\nI Ronaldinho I: nice utl\r\nI Ronaldinho I: gg wp","replies":[{"poster":"Siegfriedx2","date":"2017-03-10T21:49:28.880+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other people behavior on  an online environment are always just an invitation.

There are no actual rules. There are only loose guidelines which can be used to fit any situation. It protects nobody and applies to everybody. The beauty of rules is that they have enough detail to protect both parties in a mutually beneficial way. You know your rights and they know theirs. Riot's rules are a joke. You have no rights.
