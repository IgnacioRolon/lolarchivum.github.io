Or a loved one? \nWas it more about the tension between family and duty? Or the tension between principles and desperation? \nWas he defined more by having nothing left but vengeance, and his \"fall\" when being willingly transformed into an instrument of darker purpose? Or was it the deep emotional trauma (realized or threatened) that drove him choose a \"deal with the devil\" in the first place? \n\nThere's no right answer here. Players (and Rioters) saw (and still see) different parts of Varus' identity as the most primary. Some players absolutely hate what we changed because we changed the primary thing they loved - and you know what? We get it. We're not gonna try to tell you you're wrong, because you aren't. \n\nBut some players really love what we changed, because they think (as we thought) it reinforced and evolved the primary thing they loved about Varus. \n\nWe are reading through literally all of your comments, and we'll reply where we can, but I really want to stress this - you're all going to have different feelings about this, and we're ok with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-12-01T02:49:38.330+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":3,"body":"If we’re going to be this divisive over a champion, why change them at all?

You can't just take away defining characteristics and expect people to love the new version of that certain character. Varus is probably the worst offender but it has also happened to champions like Galio (always joking around, we never get serious characters anymore? Or at least no serious VO) and Lux where you removed the \"Spellthief\" part of her being able to copy spells from other mages. \n\nAlso want to mention Lux's new voice was a downgrade (yes there was more lines but quality>quantity) where they show very little of her struggle of being a mage in a society where they are not accepted and instead sounds like she is saying something Lulu or Zoe would say.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-12-01T07:07:59.468+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":18,"body":"> You can't just take away defining characteristics\n\nJust curious, how was Varus being a parent one of his defining characteristics? When I think of defining traits I think of really crucial elements that the character wouldn't be themselves without. So, for a character like Ana from Overwatch, I can totally see why being a parent is crucial to her character. It's written all over her backstory and dialogue. But In Varus' old story, his family was hardly mentioned -- we don't even know whether he had a wife or a husband, just that he had a child, who was brought up in passing. This just seems like a plot device that was used to drive Varus' story arc, not a defining characteristic.\n\nSo really, the core of what drove Varus to his lust for vengeance was not the loss of a particular wife or child, but the loss of _family_ -- which can mean different things to different people. Better yet, if what appealed to you about Varus' previous lore was the tragedy of his lost loved ones, this still exists in his new lore -- Val and Kai can't return to their families in Ionia until the Darkin within them is destroyed (there's a scene in the comic about this). One might say this is even more tragic than having Varus' family killed by Noxians because, if and when Val and Kai ever finally defeat the Darkin, their families might already be long dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Vier","date":"2017-12-01T08:29:25.196+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Perhaps he would not find his broken wife alongside his broken boy\"\n\n\"Showing Theshan where to hold the bow, how to draw, and how to remember his breath gave Varus a better understanding of these things himself.

Varus had to choose to protect the pit or protect his family and when they died he did what he was has been trying to prevent his life and went in to the corruption.
