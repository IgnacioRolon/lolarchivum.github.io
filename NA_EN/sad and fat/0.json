Even tho it's a while ago this post came up I still wanted to post a solution, Because I had some Issue myself, And I tried everything, I'm working as a IT professional, and this was a mess to figure out! Even tho I tried everything my screen kept freezing ingame for around 2second at the time every 20-5seconds, and as you guys might know this is a huge issue no matter what role you play! So\n\nWhat I did, I pressed [ Windows key + R ]\nType: cmd\nIn cmd type: ipconfig\nYour default gateway appears like 192.168.x.x\nSo type the default gateway in your browser and you will be directed to your localhost\nBy then I change my IP\nMy IP was sat to: HDCP (Automatic gaining IP Adresses from a DCHP server within sat range)\nI change my IP to a static IP (HDCP server aint giving me the next IP in line when the time runs out of the current IP)\nAfter you done the you open you cmd as before (Windows key + R) (type: cmd)\nWhen you are in cmd press: ipconfig /release when it's done loading type: ipconfig /renew\nNow you should see that your IP has changed and the issue should have been fixed\nIf my solution helped you please leave a comment so I know that I helped you guys out and might make a tutorial for you guys to make it easier to come around if it works for you, if any questions feel free to add me on discord for more support iMFrag#0292","replies":[{"poster":"AutomaticSemi","date":"2019-10-15T06:37:02.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey this may seem unrelated but my game also freezes.
