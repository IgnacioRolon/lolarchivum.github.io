I think I need a hug..","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"I know I did wrong and got carried away after stressfully reaching level 30 and my mastery 7 Nami in less than 1 month. Me and the staff member mama meep talked it over and had a long discussion about my words and actions in the game. I fixed these problems and haven't shown any thing of the sort on my account yet. I played a game. We lost. It was a fun and close game. I was getting my jungler kill after kill with my support. I socialized with the enemy in a friendly way and did not harass them or verbally assault them. If any thing my top laner was being a social pain for telling me I was being a bad support to my ADC who wasn't doing so great since it was his first time. But I didn't bother him about it. I just laughed it off and enjoyed the game with my frienemies.\r\n\r\nAfter the game ended I didn't even get to see the lobby with the score board and such. I literally logged in today and was perma banned. I have no reason to make any outbursts since I've been on break and I've gotten to do every thing I wanted with the account (other than get to play draft).\r\nMy mind was blown when the window appeared saying I was perm banned. No chat log. No email. No return.\r\n\r\nI submitted a ticket to support in hopes that this may have been some sort of mistake and that they realize I had already served a 14 day ban.\r\n\r\nLike, literally. Every one was chill. We all were having fun. I got to stretch my sea legs a bit and had a really good fight with some of the players who were pretty tough but that wasn't driving me to be toxic or any thing.\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/93a771b65b80bd505a48928fbd6cf465\r\n\r\nAfter finally calming down pondering over what it was I had done so wrong to be perma banned after being a good person. I re logged into my league account and low and behold. A chat log that was reported but not gone through that was made before my 14 day suspension. This confirms it. They're not doing their job or the computer/system thingy they have for it is flunked. When you get perma banned for something that you were already 14 day suspended for... Wtf.. I actually don't know if I wanna play any more. I'm kind of scared. \r\n\r\nMama Meep made me feel better. She even taught me that I can slide the chat off the screen if things got to hectic. I was ready to just be social with people and not trash talk. Just be combat friendly with them and not pick fights with them. Have a good time instead of going around calling yi every thing possible.\r\n\r\nBut now... Well I just feel really sad about being perma banned for something over 2 weeks ago when I was just now being a good person and finally relaxed after reaching my in game goals.","replies":[{"poster":"THE TlDECALLER","date":"2017-07-06T01:25:58.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"https://gyazo.com/130da45b26978446a90132a221c12d03\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/7224ea142f43783ab1eb9cde57502031\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/287f1629b51f2fd0b9eb3e5d5adbb61d\n\nAn update on the situation.
