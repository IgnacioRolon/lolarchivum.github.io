When fizz Es, he becomes UNTARGETABLE. Not invulnerable or immune to cc. The cc is already on him, so he will take it whether or not you e or vlad pool. However, fizz e can dodge something like zilean bomb with his e. This is because it is set to follow him, not guaranteed to land on him. It may seem finicky, but it feels correct the way it works. you'll have to get used to it if you want to play champions like that to know what you can and can't beat. For instance: fizz q actually will apply damage before irelia q.","replies":[]}]}
