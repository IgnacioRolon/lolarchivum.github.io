Zed and Shen are two of my favorite characters in League, so I got absolutely giddy when I got to the part where they met. I cannot WAIT to see more of this fleshed out and thank you guys so much for the hard work you have put in to make the characters feel so natural and complex. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1) With this, Zed seems to be the only character of the trio (Shen/Zed/Jhin) who does not have a larger color text. Are there any eventual plans to add one for him in which we can find out more about what really happened in the temple with Kusho (if that's still canon)? \n\n2) Seems like the text is inferring that Akali is significantly younger than Shen with this passage:\n\n> “No,” Shen said as he blocked her path.  “What makes you think I’m not ready?” Akali asked, annoyed.  “Because I wasn’t when I was your age.”\n\nHow old is Shen/Zed, compared to Jhin, compared to Akali (and even Kennen)? \n\n3) From the description of Jhin's gun, Ionia seems to heavily rely on magic for their weaponry. Does this also reflect the individual in that Ionian weaponry would function better with someone who can use magic vs. someone who can't? Is Jhin an individual who is magically gifted and his powers are amplified by the gun?\n\n4) Jhin's last Q&A asked about his martial art and I was wondering if you could give us some information about it now. It seems to work with swords--how many? What is the definition of chi in Runeterra--is it an internalized energy as is believed in our world, or is it something more..magical? \n\n5) I'm a little bit confused about the purpose of the red and white lanterns that Jhin requested early in the story. Why did he need white lanterns in the event that Zed appeared? Do they have some magical ability that nullifies Zed's shadows? \n\n\nOnce again, thank you so much for getting this out and making it so enjoyable. I really appreciate the work that the team is putting into each story.

Kennen is technically many many times older than the rest of them.\n\n3) Ionia is wealthy in magic.  Sometimes magic is put into weapons, sometimes it comes from or is channeled by the user, sometimes all three.  Jhin was impressed with hextech and he knows how to put magic in stuff has some limited channeling ability. \n\n4) He worked with blades -- not swords.  In my mind his father's school was devoted to the \"100 daggers style.\"   -but that's pure head-cannon and hasn't even been explored by me yet.  --so could change if something is more thematic.\n\n5)  Measuring distances before setting up a kill zone.

Now for some questions:\n\n1) Jhin's father ran a martial arts school, what kind did he teach? And did Jhin learn his techniques and baldework from him or did he learn elsewhere?\n\n2) On the topic of family, are Jhin's parents still alive? Does he have any siblings?\n\n3) Does he use the name Khada Jhin for everything? Since we know it's not his real name. Does he use it only for his work and gives another when he's trying to blend in? He was staying at an inn in the story, so would their staff know that the man in room whatever is named Khada Jhin?

War awoke the tranquil nation’s appetite for bloodshed. ...\n\nEssentially, Noxus invades Ionia, and demonstrates how much their peaceful ways really put them at a disadvantage. The specialist schools who practiced the martial arts certainly held their own - as highly trained specialists are wont to do - but the citizenry at large was essentially gunned down by the hundreds. It makes sense to me why the cultural shock of this might swing the Ionians to the opposite spectrum (peaceful isolationists to crusaders). It also makes sense to me, however, that this might strengthen Ionia's resolve to stay to its ways.\n\nThe martial schools already exist, they're just (seemingly) underpopulated. There would be an immense influx of people who want to protect their families, villages, and nation at large. To infer through subtext that a fundamental shift in Ionia would essentially put them closer to Noxus and Demacia strikes me as ... distasteful.\n\nI could be misreading the whole foreshadowing, though.

In the face of contrary evidence or apparent ineffectiveness, it should come as no surprise that many look for alternative philosophies, especially those that can grant a form of satisfying vengeance.\n\nAt the same time, there are those that remain steadfast in their ways, refusing to break under pressure and persevere no matter the cost. This can allow a greater conflict that is not limited to violence, the heart of Ionia's struggle is one of ideals: do the people change for their own benefit in a world that is also changing, or do they endure, displaying a remarkable strength of spirit.\n\nPersonally, the concept of a political divide between the population, without overt violence, is an interesting subject and provides avenues for character interaction that does not end with someone dead (mostly). Hence, I've always viewed Syndra and Zed as unintentional proponents of change that disgruntled members of the population choose to rally behind, while Karma, Irelia, and the Kinkou served as examples of adherents to the spirit of Ionia's ideals.\n\nI just think it's better than _another _ world-threatening disaster/terror.","replies":[]}]}]}
