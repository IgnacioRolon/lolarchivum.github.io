I read way too much of the lore, but i love well designed worlds like this, and ever since the map came out I've been going through trying to see how everything connects.\n\nNow your just teasing us.  I have never been more curious about something since Star Wars Episode 7 was annonunced!\n\nThank you for taking the time to answer all those questions! I'm supper interested to learn more about Feylordian culture and learn some of the finer details.  Like for warmothers/tribe heads, how common is Polyandry?  Do all tribes follow the trial by combat ritual to determine their leaders?  How influential are shamens in the culture?  (basically, is the story of Brand's mother or Ashe's friend the more stereotypical example of a shaman)?  I really hope to learn some of these things through the commics.  I remember learning about Heartlights in Ionia and how that played a role in their culture, especially how it tied to various champions.  Excited to see a form of that!  Thank you and anyone else who works on lore at riot for this amazing transformation and evolution of Runeterra.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Falrein","date":"2018-12-19T20:14:36.595+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A\nW\nE\nS\nO\nM\nE\n\nCan't wait to read the other issues.

It’s tough to get the right amount of balance for both (experienced that with a recent Star Wars side story I wrote from my roleplay group and my wife proofreading).
