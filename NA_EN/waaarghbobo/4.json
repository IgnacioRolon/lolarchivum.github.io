(Inspired by FauxSchizzle&#039;s posts)\r\n\r\nWhen I write, I tend to make playlists to keep myself in the mood.  More often than not this is different than the normal music I listen to and importantly I tend to avoid music with english lyrics or samples. (The lyrics interfere with writing dialog.)  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnywhoo, thought I would share the Playlist for Ashe: Warmother.  \r\n So if you wanna listen to something while you read it Weds ... here you go.    \r\n\r\n(This is not an endorsement of any of these bands. Also frankly I don&#039;t know what the lyrics mean in most of these videos, and I&#039;m not a fan of some of the visual direction in the videos.  BUT the sounds match the mood and there&#039;s a lot of unique stuff in here (at least for an american listener.))\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nOdin &quot;WAAARGHbobo&quot; Shafer\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJ9dQnnWnHMb3fLjyYMctCK7g_Vlocq","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-01-15T14:25:28.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Odin is there a connection between the Ornnkaal Rocks and the Forge God himself","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-01-15T16:19:36.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it’s volcanic, and a place were tribes come to build things (and hunt together) so yeah.  \n\nBut if your asking if he hangs out there, drinking cherry wine, no.

The comic strongly hints at a spiritual connection between Ashe and Anivia.   So personally I would retheme it around Anivia.     This would create a greater parity with Braum being an iceborn from a tribe with strong ties to Ornn  (and hence having his magic take the shape of the ram ).   Thus you can understand elemental magic as related to, but not synonymous with, the animal spirit gods of the Freljord.","replies":[{"poster":"TacoBrain","date":"2019-01-15T20:26:14.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd always figured Braum was a being akin to Janna myself, a folk hero spirit given life by the stories and oral tradition about his feats.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-01-16T17:45:15.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a world with trolls and dragons you better hope there's real heros!   \nYep he's a real guy... but also real famous and capable of doing some crazy level 18 hero stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-01-16T16:24:15.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things:\n\n1) It's probably not canon anymore, but in Ashe original lore, she was guided to the Ice Bow by a hawk, so I personally interpreted her E ability as a nod to that part of her lore.\n\n2) I agree with TacoBrain above about Braum nature.
