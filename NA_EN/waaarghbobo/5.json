Thank you so much for creating them.\n\nI kind of just wish there was more... I feel like maybe it would have benefited from having a couple more pages explicitly explore Ashe's mindset and conflicts, but with what pages you had I think you did an amazing job with. Ashe is one of my favorite characters in the game, if not my most favorite, and overall I really like this changes to her so far. She's still mostly the same character, but with much more depth.\n\nSo does Ashe believe in destiny or not? Or is she still unsure about it? Does she truly believe in pursuing a goal of a unified Freljord or is she more going along with the flow?\n\nAlso, will we get something for Sejuani as well? Or even more Ashe? There's so much to unpack from those two, I would really love to see more of them, or even the Freljord in general.\n\nSo, thank you so much for this amazing first series!

Personally would have liked to have spent more time (pages) on this story-- but comics normally have a pretty brisk pace compared to TV and manga.   So I tried to respect that.

Grena was mentioned to have taken ten Oathfathers for Ashe. However the comic only showed about five. So did some of Ashe's Oathfathers die previously?\n\n2. Sejuani mentioned that despite what Grena believed in, Ashe still grew up \"soft.\" Did something happen to Ashe for her to believe in mercy despite her mother's teachings? Or is it just in her own nature/personality?\n\n3. Not much as a question as it is a confirmation, but as far as I can tell, Ashe still loves her mother, even though she also thinks Grena was wrong? Similarly, Grena genuinely meant well for Ashe, but in a way, she also failed? Is that what happened?\n\n4. From the last issue, it seems like there is some prejudice from the Iceborn directed at the Hearthbound? Sejuani literally compared the Ebrataal tribe to the Grellfeen they killed. Is this a common viewpoint of the Freljord, that Hearthbound are of less value than Iceborn? And by rejecting that view, does this mean Ashe's views are non-traditional?\n\n5. Is the Ashe still directly descended from Avarosa herself like in the old lore, or is it no longer canon and Ashe is simply rumored to be her reincarnation? If it's non-canon, how did Ashe's tribe take the name Avarosans?\n\n6. Did anyone at all from Ashe's tribe, such as Helnr, or Ashe's mentioned cousin, survive the attack? Would they show up again in the future? Or is Ashe truly the only survivor?\n\n7. Does Ashe believe the bow belonged to Avarosa? Or is she just as clueless as the rest of us, and simply uses it to build the myths around her? Does it require a lot of strength for Ashe to be able to use a bow made entirely out of True Ice? Does it affect her in any way other than pain?\n\n8. Can you give us any information about the bow and where it came from at all? Please?\n\n9. If not, will the mysteries surrounding the bow be explored in the future, or even be a big plot point? Can you at least tell us that?\n\n10. If Ashe is openly known as the reincarnation of Avarosa, does it also mean Sejuani is believed as the reincarnation of Serylda? Or is it just no one's but Lissandra's suspicions? If so, it would make sense why the frost priests were plotting to get rid of Sejuani.\n\n11. Is Ashe very reluctant on being a leader, but pushes through with it anyways? What would she have wanted if she were given the choice? Like, what could have been her ideal future?\n\n12. It says that she needed to lie, kill, and sacrifice in order to be a leader. I can see how she lied about being Avarosa's reincarnation, but did she kill or sacrifice anything? Does she regret doing so? Is this why she doesn't like being a leader?\n\n13. Does Ashe genuinely believe in a united, peaceful Freljord? Is that why she takes on the position of warmother even if she doesn't want to? I'm assuming yes, since she says \"The strong must try the impossible.\" Is that now a part of her ideology? To try and unite the Freljord despite all the obstacles? Or does she feel she's managed to get stuck in a bad situation with no way out?\n\n14. What is her hopes for the future and her homeland? Is mercy, compassion, and all those general traits part of those goals? Is she seen as a good leader by her people? What about her enemies?\n \n15. Is Ashe reluctant to fight Sejuani since she sees her as her battlesister, even though Sejuani doesn't feel the same way anymore? Would she still ty to reason with Sejuani?\n\n16. Her biography and the comic have a couple of disconnects, such as the bio not mentioning Ashe's time with the Winter's Claw before going south. Is that intentional? Is the biography written from the POV of an average Freljordian with only a bit more insight, and the comic is what truly happened?\n\nAnd if you don't mind, a couple of questions that aren't about Ashe:\n\n1. Do you think there are any other art forms that could really touch on the emotional side of characters other than comics? What are you hoping could come next in the lore in general if the comics get a solid start?\n\n2. Can you say whether there will be major confrontations between nations on Runeterra in the future? For example, a showdown between Demacia, Noxus, and Freljord? I am genuinely so interested to see how those three nations would react to each other, especially in a future lore event. Do you know if there's plans for that or is it probably way farther in the future?\n\nOkay.... That's a lot of questions.\n\nI really hope you don't mind this amount of questions - in fact, feel free to skip a few if you want to.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm just really intrigued and excited about this new approach to the lore, and when it concerns one of my favorite characters... I just can't help myself. I need to know more!\n\nThank you so much!

Ultimately Ashe saw how her mom was venerated by the freljord and that culture... and because she could see her mom's flaws, she also saw the injustice in her mom's worldview. \n\n3.  Yeah this was important for me.  Ashe loves her mother. Grena truly loves Ashe, and wants what she believes is best for her.   But Ashe is rejecting a lot of the value system that her mother and Sejuani believe in. \n\n4.  Yeah so this is the big revolution of united Avarosian tribe Ashe creates.  Treating hearthbound as more than chattel and serfs (notice how Grena treats the hearthbound)  In the south this is less overt --(yeoman)  But the freljord is a sort of feudal society.   Iceborn and other magically gifted folks have more rights, freedoms etc..  because effectively they are the \"noble\" class. \n\n5. No spoilers.  But I will say it is not an obvious and will have a twist.\n\n6 thru 10.  Sorry.   No spoilers. \n\n11.  I don't think she really knew.  She's only about 16 or so in this story-- but the responsibility fell on her. \n\n12)  She has killed, and sent people to die.  But this is more about the future.  To save those people and build the world she wants she did/will have to sacrifice. \n\n13)  She thinks if she can unite the freljord she can end the cycle of tribal violence and make a more just, fair, and safe society.  She is willing to do some extreme things for that end.  And I would not certain this heroic drive would be applied to Demacians and Noxians.  \n\n14)  See above.   She is viewed as an messiah figure by her supporters.    Her enemies worry about her. And worry about what a unified Freljord would mean. \n\n15)  That is the implication.  I don't even think Sejuani relishes killing Ashe-- but in a way Sejuani's being a \"realist\" soonier.    They are on different, opposing paths.   They both are willing to do whatever it takes to pursue what they believe is right.  \n\n16)  Yeah the bio was written knowing the comic would expand that part of the bio.  But also the bio is more about how she got to where she is.\n\n\n\n1)  yeah obviously.   Lux is next.  Then maybe the Zed thing I wrote.  (I'm not sure if that is going forward at this point)    I can't speak for the Lux comic, but the Zed lets the reader take a deep dive into who he is-- but also what Ionia is like. \n\n2)  No spoilers.  (but yeah, almost certainly)  We do have some level setting still to do.  With the Ashe comic, Udyr story and Ant Reynolds story.  I feel players probably have a pretty good idea of what the Freljord feels like.   What about Noxus, Piltover, Ionia?  etc...\n \n3.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2019-03-22T02:00:32.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I’m trying not to be snarky about this, but I’m skeptical of the view Riot has regarding morality.

What you probably intended as morally grey acts or flaws, comes across as evil to us. Tyranny, bigotry, and fanaticism aren’t endearing qualities for me at least. It turns someone like Sylas, who is meant to be a sympathetic villain, into an anti-hero for fighting against a system that oppresses its own people.\n\nWhen we complained about this, we learn that the reason is a writer mindset that good and evil don’t exist in this setting. That it’s subjective. That got even more backlash, with concerns that heroic characters will do evil things to appear flawed, while villainous characters are downplayed as being misunderstood. I’m fine with it on some level, but I’m not sure Riot has been showing it well.\n\nI understand that Ashe is intended to be flawed, but she comes across as a well meaning person compared to Ezreal or Jayce, whose new attitudes have put players off.\n\n I also don’t think Sejuani and her relationship in the old lore was one of hero and villain. I always saw it as two opposing views where players could support either side. But with the new lore, Sejuani is wiping tribes she sees as weak, children included. It’s Darwinism that I see as worse than Noxus.\n\nI understand you’re trying to write these characters as real people, but if your attempt is to make everyone grey, who justify their actions, I’m afraid it’s going to turn off people like me who consider a lot of what humans do in real life as evil.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2019-03-22T08:24:30.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the key here is that good and evil aren't subjective for the writers, but rather for the characters. A good character needs an understandable motivation to do what he does: if a villain does evil stuff for the sake of being evil it's a bad written character. This doesn't mean that a character should never do evil or good things, but they should have a reason to.\nThink Thanos from Infinity War: most would agree he *is* evil, but what makes him such a compelling character is that he doesn't do what he does just because he's evil, but because he honestly thinks it is the best thing to do to save the universe. \nSejuani is clearly doing evil stuff, but she has a reason to, and that makes her a better character than if she just killed innocent people for the sake of killing them. I'm not sure it's the best motivation she could have, or the best execution on a character with that specific motivation, I haven't completely made up my mind on this part of the story yet - but I can nonetheless see where the author was going with Sejuani in order to make her a character with depth.\nOn the other hand Ashe is \"doing good for the sake of doing good\", on that front I think the comic doesn't show much of her depth yet. In that regart I liked Ashe's short story better, where you can see her internal struggle and the compromise she makes to achieve her goal. She does want to unite the Freljord and protect the weaker population, but she's not perfect, it's something that requires her an effort and puts her on test.\n\nMy two cents ^^","replies":[{"poster":"SiewcaBawełny","date":"2019-03-25T14:53:26.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think Thanos is good example.

You have over 140 champions to pick from, developing them all would be a gargantuan task. Do you have a criteria for the champions you choose to focus on, or is it just a case by case basis?

I also have a few questions regarding the comic:\n\n1. Sejuani, Grena and Yrael believed in and emphasized on destiny or fate a lot. The priests in issue 4 also mentioned that the \"accident\" will be the fate of Sejuani. Is this a culture in Freljord, or is this a belief that Lissandra tried to infuse into the people to strengthen her rule?\n\n2. Did Ashe meet her siblings? (The other two siblings did not survive to Spring, but if Ashe was the elder sister, she would have seen them; if not, she may not have seen them)\n\n3. Continuing the last question, why did they die so easily? Weren't they iceborn? And Grena should have a lot of resources to raise kids compared to other common people (like she took 10 bloodsworn for Ashe).\n\n4. In the script of issue 3, it is written that Ashe and Sejuani were of the same age, but I still would like to know who is the older one.\n\n5. Kalkia chased after and cared about Udyr when the Winter's Claw abandoned him because of his abnormal behaviors. When she knew Winter's Claw was in danger because of her mother's unrealistic ambition, she came back to lead the tribe even when she didn't want to. She also allied with a weak and poor tribe to protect and feed them (even though she may be forced by the priests to do so). It seems that she is more sympathetic and kind-hearted than Hejian and Sejuani. Would you say Kalkia's personality and vision were more similar to those of Ashe?\n\n6. When exactly did Kalkia come back to Winter's Claw (like at what age Sejuani was?)\n\n7. Was Urkath one of the bloodsworns of Sejuani who appeared in Silence for the Damned?\n\n8. What was the cause of the scar on Sejuani's face?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-03-22T18:31:24.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. \"Fate\" is one of the main themes of this comic, and Imho the freljord as a faction.  Because the faction's earliest narrative depiction was of 3 sisters destined to fight each other.   So I wove it more directly into the worldbuilding here.  This is a warrior society that believes in fate and oracles etc...    What is fate?  Is your destiny your own?  Or are we all cursed to follow some predetermined path?  This is a theme hopefully all of the freljordian characters will express in different ways.   \n\n\n2.  They died as babies.  \n\n\n3.  I've basically assumed having magically gifted children is difficult-- in a society that probably already suffers from high infant mortality.   But it hasn't been fully fleshed out at this time. \n\n\n4. Honestly, I don't think about age in numbers.   They are teens.  They were tweens. Previously they were kids.   They would be in the same grade.    Exact numbers only create problems for other writers conforming to a specific timeline.  So I prefer to leave wiggle room. \n\n\n5.  Hopefully all of the characters here are at least in some ways likeable and sympathetic.  I tend to view \"evil\" as weakness and as a blindspot to your own selfishness.   \n  \n  So no, I think Kalkia is very different from Ashe.  She lacks Ashe's capacity for hope and as a visionary.  Ashe's strongest moment for me in this comic is where she fights Sejuani-- but then reveals her deep empathy and understanding of her rival.  That, in my opinion, is why she is worthy leader and hero.  She cares about people. She understands feelings.  But she doesn't let those feelings cloud her own moral choices.     Back to: Kalkia.   Ultimately, as a father, I'm not sure if I can forgive Kalkia for abandoning Sejuani to a situation she knew would be bad-- but I understand she was deeply unhappy, felt trapped, and has ultimately done the best she was capable of.  She is not meant to be good or bad.... unfortunately she is tragic. \n\n\n6.  see 4\n\n\n7. no spoilers.  \n\n\n8. Sejuani gets into a lot of fights.  With the people in her tribe, with the Frost Priests, with her mom, and with her grandma.   She's troubled.  I viewed the scar as indicator of that part of her personality.  Perhaps somewhere we'll examine the exact incident-- but at this point its not needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hozenb","date":"2019-03-22T20:40:42.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your detailed answers, especially the part explaining the difference between Kalkia and Ashe. Kalkia did not treat Sejuani well, and I can see that she also suffered a lot from her relationship with her mom, and was hurt just as Sejuani did.\n\nI have some more question though (sorry for asking so many! I understand that you may not be able to answer them all).\n\n1. Sejuani was abandoned by her mother, mistreated by her grandma, and this unfortunate childhood should be part of the reasons for her \"realist\" and somewhat cruel views. But Udyr seems to be the one that she has sought for in her whole life - the one that loved her, cared about her, and stood beside her.  Did Sejuani feel less lonely with Udyr coming back to the Winter's Claw? \n\n2. In the short story of Sejuani and Udyr, Sej did not seem to have a very strong bond with her bloodsworns (which may be my misinterpretation), and she was kind of \"cold\" to them. Would you say that she would be likely to avoid going into an intimate relationship given the tragedy of her family and the \"betrayal\" of Ashe?\n\n3. In Sej's childhood, Grena and Ashe seem to be a motivation for her to live on in those very hard days.  Now, after the incident illustrated in the final issue, she on the outside ranted on Ashe's betrayal. But how did she really feel about Ashe on the inside? Would she still hope that Ashe one day will stand with her?\n\nThank you again for taking the time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-03-23T01:45:31.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.  Well the working title of the next book is \"Oathfather\"  so seeing the details of that relationship will be part of it.\n\n2. Yeah. But also Sejuani is fulfilling the traditional role expected of her as a leader.  Grena was pretty cool with her bloodsworn too.  More than anything else she is expected to be the leader and mother of war for this tribe.   She's not expected to be nice.  She's expected to have a plan and have the grit to see it through.     \n But more importantly her coolness to them is supposed to hint at her closeness to Udyr.  She values him ABOVE her bloodsworn.  No one is closer or more dear to her in the Winter's Claw than Udyr. (maybe not even Bristle).    Hopefully we will get to see how he has earned this trust in later stories. \n\n3.  Sejuani's rant, I think touched on how she felt pretty overtly.  She loves Ashe like a sister, but she also resents and envies her.  She resents that Ashe had an easy life (compared to her) and a mother that loved and protected her.   \n     When I think of the cruelty that Sejuani is capable of it comes from that pain-- that hole in her heart.  She grew up tough, hungry, and mistreated.  She's seen her tribe, really her extended family,  _literally_ starving, beaten down, and dying. \n \nWhat if you were forced to live your whole life in that sort of desolation? And then you strolled into a beautiful valley in Demacia and saw an easy, comfortable, safe, bucolic life. Wouldn't you feel like you had been cheated?  That your family had been cheated?  And this is where Sejuani's heart hardens. She's gonna take that valley and then, in spite, want to punish those Demacian villagers. Because she's angry and hurt inside, Sejuani wants them to know the desolation and fear that she and her people had to survive.","replies":[{"poster":"Hozenb","date":"2019-03-23T02:48:25.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the answer.\n\nI can say Sejuani's experience is very relatable to real life to the point that it hurts me when I see her suffering.
