For example, you could know from the script what exactly the emotion of the character was in a certain frame, instead of simply guessing from her facial expression.\n\nAlso, you will get the glossary. I think that adds some extra information about the setting and the cultural context of Frejlord.

Your wonderful story-telling just adds so much depth into their characters and relationship. Thank you for all of these stories.\n\nBy reading the third issue of the comic, I noticed something. On page 13, Sejuani pulled the sled with all her effort (in the script, it mentioned that she was almost clawing in all fours) but Ashe did not attempt to give her a helping hand; on page 14, Sejuani was the one pulling on the oar. On page 16, Sejuani shared her blanket with Ashe. Also, Sejuani was the one coming up with the plan of what Ashe should do when they arrived the Winter's Claw. \n\nI am wondering whether these were just a coincidence, or whether these were trying to illustrate that Sejuani was the one who was more used to taking care of people. As far as I can tell from the girls' background, Ashe was protected and loved by her mother and fathers in most of her childhood. In contrast, Sejuani was a child who failed to get her mother's love and tried her best to seek love from her grandmother. So, Sejuani tended to be more independent, proactive and caring in her relationship with Ashe and Ashe tended to be the one who was protected and being taken care of.\n\nDid I overthink?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-02-22T20:04:38.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was intentional.  \nMy thought was partially that in this part of the story (and possibly when they were kids) Sejuani was taking care of Ashe. \nYour insight was correct, I am showing Sej as the tougher and more experienced of the two girls.  \nAnd this was a clear way to indicated that she cared about Ashe-- but was dealing with the situation.\n\nJust from my own life I noticed the person with the rougher background/experiences tends to take charge when the situation gets f-up...\n\n(Also I think Ashe is in grief and is weak from hunger and well... everything-- and this let us see her \"recovering\" because of these friendship)","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2019-02-24T13:20:11.343+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Your insight was correct\n\nThat! that is why i love Sejauni! the way you portrait her! i already liked her from before but now much more! i can't wait for the 4th issue then i will make a bigass post about everything i noticed and loved in the comics/stories of Freljord to thank you personally!\n\ni was really afraid about how Freljord is going to turn out. if i will be disappointed or sad but so far, none of that!
