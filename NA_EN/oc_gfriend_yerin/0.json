I am buying a new keyboard in order to match the ~~gaming~~ schoolwork I will have for the upcoming year. Right now I am buying a Razer Huntsman Elite, but I am looking for something loud. As far as I know, the Huntsman is quite loud already. I will be bringing the keyboard with me along with my laptop, and I would often play league in the library.\r\n\r\nBefore you start calling me with words that would be represented by \"****\", I would like to provide some background about my action. I always go ~~game~~ study in the library, but the librarian is not a friendly person to deal with in terms of noise. You literally can't talk for longer than a minute until she comes and tells you \"You are in a library!\", regardless of how quiet you speak. You may think that's normal, but sometimes a conversation is necessary for work, and the absurd part is that we sit in the section of the library that has those round meeting tables that are designed for group conversations. \r\n\r\nBut, whenever I am alone ~~studying~~ gaming, the laptop fan can literally be so loud that everyone in the room can hear it, not to mention I also have a laptop cooler for the rather insulating desk surface in the library. The librarian is so annoyed by me but she can't do anything, because I am not violating any code of conducts. I decided to increase the intensity of my rather abusive actions by bringing my own mechanical keyboard to the library. Although I do have a gaming laptop, it is not one of those super expensive ones that have a built-in Cherry MX mechanical keyboard *cough* MSI and Predator *Cough*.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what's the loudest keyboard $300 can buy that you guys know? Preferably Razer or Corsair.","replies":[]}
