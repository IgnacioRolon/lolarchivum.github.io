Enemies can walk out of W before it hits the 3rd tic to proc Thunderlords. R requires her to be in extremely close proximity to enemies in order to activate, and even then, half the damage is tied to whether or not they didn't run away from you.\n\nNidalee, meanwhile, can chuck spears at you, but also rush in on you and turn into a cat and eat your face. Nidalee had so many more avenues to deal damage than Morgana does and plus she has heals and escapes on top of that.
