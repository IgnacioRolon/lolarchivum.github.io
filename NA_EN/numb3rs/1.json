I don't really know why riot won't just fix the e bug so Darius can actually be buffed or something but... whatever. I guess being able to pull people who have flashed/dashed/doneboth right back to you is part of his champion identity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tavish","date":"2015-02-22T18:03:58.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus ulti is pretty annoying.

There are plenty of OP skills in the game but the most OP will always be \"No Resource\" and nowadays its being thrown on every new champ. It promotes less thought in Build Paths and Item Order. It promotes less skill/counterplay. And most of all its not as if these are weak champs with weaker output to balance their infinite harass, mobility, free saves on mistakes, sustain. To be honest most of the time these Manaless champs are not going to have to worry about keeping their resources up early game, they usually will outsustain you either naturally or with a first item sustain. And also most of the time they will also have lower cooldowns and be among the highest damage outputers in the game.\n\nThese are all amongst the top tier damage output champs (When built Damage) with relatively low cooldowns and relatively high mobility. Some of which can also be tanky as well. Not all OP but all need to come with an explanation as to why they can be given an additional or replacement bar of mana with low costs to balance their rage bars.\n{{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:92}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-02-22T10:02:57.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kalista passive.\nPoppy passive.\nAnyone with resets.  \nNidalee.
