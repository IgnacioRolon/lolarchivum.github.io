I found it in \"Hextech Crafting\" bookmark.\r\n The description is IMO is misleading\r\n---> https://imgur.com/a/3sYSZ\r\n \r\nI actually was not sure what this will be, because when I found that in client was zero information about that whole \"EU Beta Tournament\". But the description said, that this is something for Hextech Crafting.\r\n \r\nAfter purchase  I didn't get anything to craft ఠ_ఠ\r\n \r\nI don't need that tickets. Better for me is to use that ~2k BE for gifting 2 Christmas icons, or something else...\r\n\r\n1) Can you take that tickets from by account &amp; give me back my 1950 BE?\r\n2) Can you change that description to something like \"Everything you need to join EU Beta Tournament\", or something similar?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-14T17:16:46.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, we don't have a lot of info on Clash while it's still being tested in regions we don't have a lot of visibility on.
