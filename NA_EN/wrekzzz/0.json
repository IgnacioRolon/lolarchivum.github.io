Did typical scaling practices, like with an AP ratio on Q prove to be toxic in practice, or was this deemed a necessary trade-off for Braum’s strengths? Additionally, why even put a meager health ratio on Winter’s Bite, when the incentive to build health would already be there, and the damage gained from the ratio would be near-negligible anyway?\n\n**Development - Braum's Ultimate**\n\nWhat iterations of Braum’s ult were there? How did you land on the current Glacial Fissure? It seems like PQWE are pretty cohesive, but his ult kind of stands out (not necessarily in a bad way - it just seems a bit different in scope from the rest of his kit).\n\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Wrekzzz","date":"2014-05-06T18:44:10.433+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damage:\nRegarding damage, our goal from the beginning was to make a true defender. As a result, we wanted him to have reasonable/competitive damage to have an active laning phase but then not be a damage threat during mid/late-game. He has extremely strong defensive and utility scaling through the amount of tankiness and CC he has. If he also did substantial amounts of damage then he would have quickly become a one-man dive machine. I didn't want to create incentives for the player to build AP because I feel it is necessary to build defensive items for him to be effective, so it felt natural to put a somewhat small health ratio on his Q because it gives his damage a bit of a boost over the course of the game. Finally, it makes people feel good for building tanky items!\n\nDevelopment:\nBraum went through a lot of ultimates, primarily focused on disengage and making him better at peeling. One that stuck for a while was kind of a delayed chain knocback/knockup. They ended up not working on the character for a number of reasons, but the primary reason is that due to his primary CC ability being delayed (passive) having an ultimate that lacked versatility was quite punishing. Glacial Fissure came from wanting something that was a thematic fit for the character that also had substantial gameplay and versatility. I feel like Braum's ultimate is something that has a lot of play, a number of ways for you to optimize its use, and overall feels like a really great physical action!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Don Terapin","date":"2014-05-06T18:21:04.684+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"His shield blocks projectiles and put them on him, but what will happen if there's something like Sona ulti?
