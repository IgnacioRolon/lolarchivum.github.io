Welcome to another Runes Corner! In the past we&rsquo;ve talked about new runes with new gameplay effects you haven&rsquo;t seen before. However, on top of building new content we are also looking for opportunities to bring back some of the keystones you love and see if we can make them even better.\r\n\r\nToday, we will be discussing how we&rsquo;ve built off of Thunderlord&rsquo;s Decree and Stormraider&rsquo;s Surge to create two new keystone Runes, Stormlord&rsquo;s Mandate and Spellslinger&rsquo;s Surge. Those names are temporary and will almost certainly change. We&rsquo;ll cover Stormlord&rsquo;s Mandate first.\r\n\r\nStormlord&rsquo;s Mandate:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GB9W0oT.jpg\r\n\r\nHitting a champion with 3 unique attacks or abilities within 2 seconds deals bonus magic damage.\r\nDamage: 40-220(+25% Bonus AD)(+20% Ability Power)\r\nCooldown: 50 seconds\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vqxDyUF.gif\r\n\r\nWe mentioned a while ago that we&rsquo;ve been testing a Thunderlord&rsquo;s replacement and this is it! Stormlord&rsquo;s Mandate takes Thunderlord&rsquo;s and increases its power and cooldown in order to focus it more on all-ins.The keyword unique is key to binding this to all-in plays. At face value, Thunderlords seems like it encourages you to commit to dangerous all-ins and rewards you with burst damage for doing so. On live, however, we have to balance Thunderlord&rsquo;s damage around champions that can trivially activate Thunderlord&rsquo;s on cooldown with a single ability. By changing the trigger to require unique spells or abilities we can re-focus this on providing greater burst damage in actual all-in situations.\r\n\r\nSo, how does unique work?\r\nEach spell, ability, or individual attack counts once towards triggering this. Sounds pretty simple. Let&rsquo;s look a some examples. Start with an easy one: Mystic Shot. You fire it and it hits your opponent. That&rsquo;s one. Attacks work the same way. The biggest change is how it works with damage over time effects. For example, Miss Fortune&rsquo;s Make it Rain. When you cast that on an enemy it deals damage rapidly for 2 seconds but it still only counts as one spell. With the &ldquo;unique&rdquo; flag Stormlord&rsquo;s Mandate won&rsquo;t be instantly triggered by Make it Rain the way Thunderlord&rsquo;s was. If you would like to actually play and experiment with the unique keyword, check out Maokai&rsquo;s passive for a better idea.  Overall, the unique keyword allows these keystones to bind more to all-ins and intense fighting rather than specific champion abilities.\r\n\r\nSpellslinger&rsquo;s Surge:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FCuaxSz.png\r\n\r\nHitting a champion with 3 unique attacks or abilities within 2 seconds grants 30%-60% movement speed for 3 seconds. Additionally, Melee champions gain 75% slow resistance while active.\r\nCooldown: 15 seconds\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hojeKu7.gif\r\n\r\nSpellslinger&rsquo;s Surge is a modification we&rsquo;ve been testing to the Stormraider&rsquo;s Surge keystone mastery. Many players find the movement speed granted by Stormraider&rsquo;s exciting. However it was hard to predict when you would do enough damage to trigger it. We saw an opportunity to use the &ldquo;unique&rdquo; keyword to provide that same effect in a more understandable way while also creating a parallel rune to Stormlord&rsquo;s. Spellslinger&rsquo;s Surge lets you get a reliable burst of movement speed in the middle of your all-in, allowing you to decide whether to disengage or continue chasing down that enemy.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for reading. We&rsquo;re really thrilled to be bringing back some of the fan favorite keystones. Let us know what you think of the changes down below, we will also be around to answer questions and discuss with you.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\nYou can check the previous Runes Corner posts here:\r\nRunes Corner: [Runes Content Development Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/MZd3jemX-runes-corner-runes-content-development-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Meteor Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/nVHz5tjE-runes-corner-meteor-sneak-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Hunt of the Bloodmoon Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/hFIemE4p-runes-corner-hunt-of-the-blood-moon-sneak-peek)\r\nRunes Corner: [Domination Major Slot Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/9ls3OEo8-runes-corner-domination-major-slot-sneak-peek)","replies":[{"poster":"GradeADegenerate","date":"2017-08-02T19:48:52.592+0000","up_votes":96,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me or do these names sound like the Walmart brand versions of Stormraider's surge and Thunderlord's decree?","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-08-02T19:55:15.901+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Spice POWAH","date":"2017-08-02T20:43:54.821+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"For real though, I liked how the cunning tree's keystones all had to do with a storm theme.

I know he's not the most popular champion, but the majority of Veigars run Stormraiders at the moment due to its ability to offer him more safety (which is something he otherwise lacks in his kit). Mobility is something very good on him, yet hard to build for, so stormraiders makes up for that, it's also very easy to procc with him at the moment thanks to his enormous damage numbers.\n\nSpellslinger requiring 3 spells to procc it (3 unique spells), means you'll never procc it unless you land your entire combo, so your mobility will be entirely bound to your stun (which is a huge change from the current Stormraiders). No longer can you procc it while kiting, and you'll be entirely bound to your stun cooldown to make use of your rune. You will also have a much harder time escaping ganks since Q>Ring the opponent to procc stormraiders and running away won't be an option anymore.\n\nIt seems you want Spellslingers to be a melee assassin rune, but please know that some immobile mages will miss Stormraiders greatly.\n\nThank you for your attention.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King of Demons","date":"2017-08-02T18:15:15.141+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you EVER take this version of Thunderlord's when the Spellslinger is straight up better at all times? 50 second cooldown makes this almost useless, while Spellslingers will get you out of trouble at all times essentially","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-08-02T18:20:11.811+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want to get more damage in your burst window instead of move speed?
