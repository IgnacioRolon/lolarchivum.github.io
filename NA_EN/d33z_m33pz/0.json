Which is wrong because I've been entering the right information for my account. Did I get banned and not get told? Did my password change? That's not possible since I used the password I normally use to get onto the boards, so I don't know what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-14T18:58:23.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you'd get a different message for a ban.  Double check your region on your login screen to make sure it's on NA and try a [password reset](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751734-Recovering-Your-Password).
