I didn't see it. The windup animation of his arm going back happened but the cleaver itself never showed. I asked in chat and the top laner said the same thing, that all game the cleavers had been invisible. This is a pretty bad bug to not be able to see his cleavers as laning against him would be horrible. I'm thinking the skin should be disabled or something.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-23T21:39:03.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This appears to be some kind of graphics issue, as it's not happening on all computers.
