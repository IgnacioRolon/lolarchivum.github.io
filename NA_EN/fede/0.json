During this year's Harrowing, they will be living in a nightmare. Twisted Fate, Cassiopeia, Xerath, Hecarim, Leblanc, Zed, Lissandra; these 7 individuals hail from different places in Runeterra but they have all commit an unfogiveable sin. They thought that their past would fade into oblivion; but no, the Dark Mist will never forget, the Dark Mist will make them pay for their sins. The Dark Mist will soon spread to the Field of Justice. Title:  The mysterious Dark Mist of the Harrowingï»¿.\n\nAny thoughts ?

I still doubt Kalista has anything to do with the alter woman though, since she looks like a soldier-esque woman who has a back full of spears, not the woman from the puppet show. Don't even start with any sort of \"well, after they die they can change entirely into something else\" business, because that only accounts for minor changes to appearance, such as Thresh changing from a jailer into a ghoulish jailer. She bears absolutely ***no*** resemblance to the woman in the puppet show aside from being a woman (those two puppet people *do* seem likely for the two spirits in the altars though).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Othello the Cat","date":"2014-11-05T19:48:53.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...

(He also predicted yasuo, urf and gnar, now his account got deleted after leaving the comment about Kalista on reddit). OCE lol facebook (and no other league of legends facebook account) leaves a video showing a flag with 3 spears/ghosts. The 2nd icon, which you get from TT hexakill when you win 3 games, is the same flag but now with ghosts around it. On reddit i found this picture: QK8Vc0B.png. The last picture (The black/white one) was shown on some lol flags on a event. Also seven champions has been marked with the same mist as the flag video on OCE page: https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=450651545076274. The seven champions: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Black_Mist.
