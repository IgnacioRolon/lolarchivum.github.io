Is there a known reason as why there&#039;s 7 instead of 8?\r\n\r\nThanks for any response :).","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-13T16:12:14.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! We don't have a set number for each chroma pack - we come up with various color combinations and pick the strongest. If we only feel there are 7 strong options for a particular chroma pack, we'll just go with those 7 and not try to fill up another slot with a mediocre color scheme just to make 8.","replies":[{"poster":"Targon","date":"2016-09-13T17:22:57.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response!
