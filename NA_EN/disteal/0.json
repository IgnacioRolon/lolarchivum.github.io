I'd want something really striking and different for her next skin after the Thief skin. Beyond thematic concerns, her animation rig and model are really old and quite limiting when it comes to making skins which is always a consideration. However without a rework on the horizon I certainly hope we make another skin for her soon >:D","replies":[{"poster":"Disteal","date":"2015-10-08T08:31:11.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so glad you like it!\nI think Eve is definitely a champion that needs a bit of a cleanup, maybe ill join the hundreds whove tried and have a stab redesigning her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-10-07T20:48:16.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe make it legendary in that case? Last time I checked, Infernal Nasus was used to help update Nasus himself and SG Rumble helped some of the animations for Rumble.

The girl doesn't even have anything close to a decent 975, the best we have are recolors and like one pretty minor re-model with no new effects. Nothing that makes her look anything close to modern.\n\nIt hurts.

She's an *ancient* champion, and she's never once received a half-decent 975-level skin that makes her look modern, by today's standards.

A light-themed skin like this one would be really neat on Evelynn, and I imagine this concept really makes her animations and abilities fit a light-theme. It's an especially great idea to mimic the shape of the original's strands with a short cloak, which gives it a new but recognizable silhouette.","replies":[{"poster":"Disteal","date":"2015-10-06T03:30:44.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you noticed the cloak!
