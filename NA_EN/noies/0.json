I'll just do that from now on. thank you\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T21:45:10.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend troubleshooting that router or replacing it before it becomes a bigger problem for you.

At this point I'm relatively certain the problem lies with my isp and their servers. I live in the middle of nowhere and their pretty much the only isp available to me. The disconnects are pretty rare anyway no more than a couple times a week. 42ms pretty consistently, which I find to be good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T00:09:27.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A traceroute log may reveal where the issues are happening in your network route and could prove useful in resolving this issue if provided to your ISP.
