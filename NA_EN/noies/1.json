It was the all consuming fixture of the old lore, and even though it was retconned long ago it remains one of the most well known and iconic parts of leagues lore. Its something a lot of people remember. It could just be as \" a shifty background organization\" or some other form, but the name \"Institute of War\" should be in the lore somewhere. I think it would help bridge the gap for the people who read the old lore.\n\nI also think that the core identity of champions who are well established already should not be changed because they didn't fit this or that characteristic of the place they resided in.  Janna for example was changed to being a wind spirit \"because it didn't make any sense for some random wind mage to be in zaun, she didn't fit their theme of being 'Highly industrious'\". You can't revert the stuff you change, but you could at least not change the core identity of an old, established character just so that it conforms to what you would expect a region/ city to have.\n\nAnd maybe if things stopped getting changed and reworked in the lore.... we might get some kind of \"Story progression EVENT\" instead of just static lore updates. like instead of riven versus yasuo, and garen vs darius being a \"skin event\" where they don't really reference any lore even though these four characters have beef with each other, we could get something with the lore a bit more at the forefront.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-11T04:40:05.429+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think folks are misreading your reply.

So, instead of it being an international peace-keeping force of super powerful mages, it could be a secret society - or at the very worst case, a notorious fight club/bar somewhere :)\n\nDo you feel that having the name (which, as you say, has a lot of recognition for the old guard) back in the lore BUT NOT MEAN THE SAME THING would be a good thing that would be a nice nod to the past, or would it be a point of confusion that felt like disrespecting the attachment players had to the old, retconned, lore?\n\nI fear that it could go either way, and that seems like a big risk.

It doesn't feel like there's a grander vision or goal here, and when writing a story, you need that goal. The lore has to be treated somewhat like a giant novel - all the pieces have to work cohesively to create a story.\n\nFor instance, one of my hot button points this year was how the Darkin were treated. I adored the idea of them being some foreign invading species, because it explained a lot about things while simultaneously leaving them a bit mysterious. Them being such an _unknown_ species explained why the residents of Runeterra couldn't defeat them and why they had to resort to trapping them - and then their _unknown_ nature led to another surprise the people didn't expect - the Darkin could possess people if they came in contact with them after they were entrapped. So just not knowing what they were allowed for them to break reality as the people of the world know it, and created some great story telling elements that didn't have to rely on the established understanding of the world. It also explained their new and \"forbidden\" magic, the blood magic, as clearly this magic was something that the people of the world hadn't experienced before and it's understandable that it'd be taught to them by outsiders. It also made infinitely more sense WHY the Darkin would be royally pissed and alone when they were trapped and shut off from their home world forever, and it also was interesting in that them being outside invaders gave the world more enemies to deal with who weren't Void related, yet still a massive threat.\nThat whole story, and the untold stories that could have been built around it, got retconned away less than a year later, and replaced with something that I felt was far more inferior and trite, and committed a pretty bad narrative fallacy of looping everything in on itself and tying up neat little bows by over explaining things, and also making everyone \"once upon a human being.\" Making the Darkin fallen ascended, while also trying to explain why they operated in the way they do as being former humans, and explaining their blood magic just felt contrived and forced, like they had all these concepts they had to make work within the new scope.\n\nThen there's the more recent Lissandra bio with Nunu's release. It was a HOT HOT mess, and confusing as hell, and it left huge, key elements of her personality out of her own bio. It was not nearly as understandable or concise as her former bio and also erased her motives and plans, which pretty much defined her as a character. This felt incredibly rushed, and while I understand there is more lore coming, the fact that the lore we got was chaotic and incomplete, when it's supposed to be a concise bio of a character, is inexcusable. Bios shouldn't be half completed synopses. They're supposed to be bite size explanations of characters to give us a quick idea of them, not deliberately left with gaping plot holes so you can fill them later with something sensational. You can do that kind of thing with stories and lore events in game, but not with character bios.\n\nAnd then there's Karma. Her original bio update around Irelia's era was a disaster. It wasn't Karma. I'm not going to pretend to know why the decision was made to rewrite her entirely like that when it didn't coincide AT ALL with the character. It got updated with Akali, and came more in line with who she was originally, but in my eyes, the Irelia-era lore update shouldn't have happened at all. In this scenario, and similarly the Lissandra bio update, it really feels like the lore team doesn't know the characters they're writing for. It feels like they've never played them, they've never read their old bios and lore information, it feels like they don't know how they interact with other characters in the game. This is a problem when you're trying to refine an existing character to fit in the new world. It's entirely possible to update these characters to fit without dramatically overhauling with something insane and sensational - and to an extent, I feel like this is probably the meat of the issue. There's a lot of sensationalizing going on to make characters FLASH and PIZAZZ when updating their bios - but oftentimes, simplest is best. Not all updates need be reinvented with insane new elements - did Karma really need to be the gestalt spirit soup of Ionian Nirvana? The answer is no, she didn't, that element that was added to her didn't add much of anything to her character and originally detracted so hard from her character that it turned her into someone else. If they had merely folded Karma as we have known her for years into the new lore, that would have been that. Everyone would have been content, because we still get to have the Karma we love. \nThis can be equated to bringing a book to the silver screen. Let's use Harry Potter as an example. We loved the books and the characters therein, so when they came to the movies, we were stoked. But rather than reinvent Harry to now be something like the mystical godchild borne to the most powerful witch in existence and the most powerful wizard in the world in efforts to make him more of the \"chosen one,\" Rowling stuck to her story - his parents are plain people who simply loved him. She adapted this story effortlessly to the movie screen, and because of her faithful adaptation of her books to equally good movies, they were a resounding success. League champions _DESPERATELY NEED_ to be treated in the same way when their lore is being adapted to the new world. They need to be who they always are, just expanded. We don't need to reinvent them entirely all the time and/or add dramatic elements to their story (don't get me started on the way they murdered Zac's parents in his lore update), we just need to have the characters we love built to be functional in the grander scope of the world.\n\nOn a similar vein, there's Pyke and Nautilus. I cannot recall if it was Scathelocke or Waargabobo who said this around Pyke's release, but they had hardcore planned to _rewrite Nautilus entirely._ This was so they could cannibalize his story for Pyke. This is a SEVERE NO-NO, and again reinforces the point that there doesn't seem to be a grander vision in mind for the lore, that it's all made up at will. Under no circumstance should you ever even bat an eyelash in consideration of erasing one champion's lore and story so that you can make a new champion who tells that story better. Make it work, however you can with the two coinciding - you did this with Pyke once you saw how against Nautilus' lore replacement the community was, but at the expense of losing potentially cool VOs for Pyke. Because Nautilus was in a lore limbo he shouldn't have been in to start with, there were no lines in Pyke's VO towards him, since you were unsure of where Nautilus was going. This is bad, considering how interesting their interactions could have been. Instead, we get chatter with people like Ashe? So no, please do not consider this kind of thing again for the future. Rewriting existing characters should ever and always be a hard, decisive NO.\n\nAnd then we come to my last major problem with the lore, that I only briefly touched on above - it's the over-interconnectivity of everything.  It's fine having the Watchers be Void related, we'd suspected as much since Lissandra's release. However, it's becoming a HUGE problem in the lore lately how every villainous force in the world is now being tied to the Void, and it's equally becoming a problem how all the god beings of the world are the bastard children of the Targonian Aspects. This is homogenizing the world, and it's creating a dullness. When you know everything in a story, there are no surprises. When there are no unknown elements to this new character, what's the point of investing interest in them? Once this starts to lock in the story, the story starts to fall apart, because the compelling elements are all gone. There's no mysticism, no unknowns, no newness to everything - and this is further expanded by the fact that pretty much all the higher beings are now former humans, again, making things dull. This over-explanation of the world is detrimental to story telling, and it's a bad habit that the team appears to be falling into.\n\nThere's a caveat, of course. I give exception to VGUs, as these are special cases of reinventing the champion and their kits. My main drive about this post is expressly regarding already existing champions who haven't had VGUs.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-11T15:52:35.140+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whew.  First I'd like to thank you for your response, Oleandervine.  Very eloquently put and I appreciate that. \n\nI feel like a butcher boiling what you wrote done to just two points, but for the sake of me being able to respond in a timely manner, I'll do that.\n\n1. Perceived disrespect for, or misunderstanding of, what makes a champion _that_ champion, and\n2. Too much simplification of origin for our big bads, and our sources of power.\n\nI'll take on point 2, first.\nI agree.  I think that there was a push to try to get the underpinnings of Runeterra to make a bit more sense, to have a structure and an order behind them so that folks would be able to grok the universe more quickly, and with knowable rulesets, be able to better hypothesize and theorycraft about connections and implications.  Not a terrible impulse by any measure, but I think that it went too far.  \n\nSome loreheads like myself want there to be _many_ vectors of power and mystery - the real world is a hella complex puzzle and having something almost too complex to wrap your head 'round (or simply too mysterious) gives it that sense of verisimilitude that we want.\n\nPart of me suspects that this is coming across as being too far reaching and coarse, because this urge to simplify and make more accessible is being done more publicly than you would normally see.  If this were a novel, the author might well go through this as an iteration of their world building (after their editor returned some feedback) but the author would work through that in private.  The version we'd eventually read from the author might well have simplified the sources of power, but would have also had time to explore and show the many, and natural, exceptions to the rules.\n\nThis is, however, just my opinion.  I think that the drive to unify _some_ of the elements of the universe isn't a terrible idea - but that it's possible that we're seeing the pendulum swung too far; an overreaction of sorts or at the very least, an unrepresentative swathe that focuses mostly on those things.  Everything in League has to be done in bits and pieces - and the order of those bits and pieces, can be as important as the content of those bits and pieces.  (Like when Jayce's color story came out before Viktor's.  That was a rough week.)\n\nIn short, I agree that the world is starting to feel a bit too neat and simple in its big bads and power origins.  I think it's been an overreaction.  I think we'll start to see more diversity in those things in the future (at least, I hope so).\n\nAs to point 1, well thankfully I can be a bit shorter on that one.  Scathlocke has decided to be the champion for this issue, and I am very happy about that.  You'll often see him commenting about the goal being to update, not erase, a character.  Scathlocke also has the visibility and power to be well positioned to keep an eye on that (more than I do, certainly).  \n\nI suspect there might still be a few slip ups - usually because of a deadline that cannot be pushed - but I think it's going to keep improving.  Internal processes are being created to make really knowing a champ very easy to do; even if you're a new hire who's only recently started playing League.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-09-11T16:12:06.037+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to respond and listen to my points. It's very good to hear that people on Riot's end are noticing how simplified the world is becoming, and I'm hoping there will be paths taken to correct it.

Like if the Shadow Isles and the Blessed Waters somehow become related to the Aspects of Targon, I think I'll be really pissed.\n\nI'll look forward to seeing how Scathelocke will be moving forward with keeping the consistencies of characters intact. I'm not terribly reassured considering how poorly the Lissandra bio turned out, but I'll not lose hope.\nIn that vein, regarding the slip ups, I would rather there be _no release at all if a deadline is being pushed and there's not quality work_ rather than poor quality work be released just to satiate a deadline. In terms of lore, there will always be some other time to release it, so I just want to emphasize that I would prefer quality, even it takes longer, than quantity.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-11T17:52:21.550+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">I would rather there be no release at all if a deadline is being pushed and there's not quality work rather than poor quality work be released just to satiate a deadline.\n\nQFE.  I would be super interested to know if we have more data on whether yours is a common sentiment on this.  I mean, it's hard to say I suppose, because quality and expediency are both analogue and their importance varies with every player.  Is \"pretty good\" + \"now\" good enough?  What if the next window was 6 months from now?  Does that make \"pretty good\" + \"now\" good enough??  Horrible questions to ask and I don't know what the answer is.  \n\nIdeally all content would be the best it possibly can be before releasing - and I don't know if it's like this for writers (I am a game designer by trade) but I know that eventually you reach diminishing returns and just have to ship.

It made sense that Garen could solo kill Aurelion Sol in that context. The current lore has divorced the lore from the game. That was a mistake. I understand *why* it was done, but it also killed something really unique about League. The game and the lore made sense as a unit. We don't have that now.\n\nThe old lore wasn't perfect, by any stretch, but what it *did* do well was pull in players who wanted a game that was fresh and different. The old Journal of Justice allowed for evolving storylines that involved the characters in the game interacting with each other. The IoW took an active role in \"game balance.\" The summoners were meta-players and the IoW leadership were meta-devs. Patches were the Institute tweaking the combatants, which they did *in lore*, too! That's why Jax has a brass lantern!\n\nBut let's expand on that point; back then, if I wanted to explain to a new player why Jax had a brass lantern, the answer made him badass. He was *so good* with a real weapon that the IoW had to restrict him. That's cool. Now, he's just an idiot that brought a lamp-post to a fight with a cosmic space dragon. And he brags about how he would fight better with a real weapon... *so why not bring a real weapon, dumbass?* Now, he's just a stupid guy fighting a being millions of times his size with a lamp-post. \n\nThis is at the heart of why League grew. It used to be different. Now we have over-the-top characters like A.Sol, just like any other MOBA. Now, we have loot boxes and keys, just like any other MOBA. And growth slowed. Because League became homogenized.\n\nIf you want to fix it, go back to your roots. Make me believe that Jax and A.Sol are on equal footing within the confines of SR. The rift isn't your meta-device, because it doesn't exist is Runeterra. So fix that. Make a new meta-device that explains SR *in Runeterra.* We, the players, used to exist in Runeterra as summoners. \"You,\" (at least the balance team) used to exist in Runeterra as... more powerful summoners (heh, fix that, too). There's no place for *us* in the lore now. And that's why it's unpopular. Your game and your lore need to get back together, get re-married, and have beautiful profit babies.\n\nEDIT: I realized on re-reading this got rambly. Let me summarize how I viewed this all when I wrote it:\n- Champs used to be \"realistically\" be pitted against each other\n- Players used to be part of the lore\n- New lore ruined some champs, haven't fixed them\n\nAll of this falls under the umbrella of \"the lore and game got separated.\" The retcon focused on one goal. It wanted to fit awesome lore into the game. But a large chunk of your players loved that we had *an awesome game that fit into the lore.* We lost that, and I don't think I'll be thrilled with the direction until that changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-11T17:44:47.479+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">If you want to fix it, go back to your roots.

The question then becomes - how _much_ of an impact did/does it have, and if the impact _is_ big enough, how do we go about solving that problem without breaking more than we fix.\n\nI mean, heck, how many days go by between another player turning up on this Board, usually replying to a Rioter, telling us that \"No-one cares about the stupid lore - fix your game\"?  _We_ know that's not true, but it's what they believe.\n\nI think, if we decided to try to solve the pain that you're feeling, we'd need to better identify the roots of the problem; the bullet points that you called out in your edit.  Would you say that, at the core, you feel that the game suffers now from a lack of _meaning_?  I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, I swear - just trying to get to the core of it so we can better come up with solutions.

Good points, good questions. You may be right that I'm overstating it's significance. It's easy, as a player, to fall into the classic \"passion trap.\" \n\nI think it's less about \"meaning\" and more about \"context\" for me. The game was happening within the story in a way that made that transition so smooth and interesting. I mean, not *every game* was literally part of a larger narrative, but the *structure* of the game was. I could rationalize, based on what I knew about the actual League of Legends and Runeterra, a reason why Dr. Mundo and Rek'Sai would be ganking this Renekton in the top lane. Maybe it was silly, maybe it felt contrived to the writers, but it was *unique.*\n\nLosing that might be a trade-off that I have to live with; it's not like I abandoned the game, after all. But it costs so much in terms of champion interaction. I mean, Aatrox has all these cool taunts for other champs. In the old lore, you could imagine him using those! Now, it's a long shot that Aatrox would even *meet* those champions in the canon. If Garen and Darius, for instance, *actually* met in the lore, one of them is likely to die. That makes it hard to write compelling stories about them.\n\n*But*, if they met on the Fields of Justice, they could debate politics and military strategy while tearing each other's limbs off. And after one of them dies, they just come back and continue the argument! That's badass!\n\nSo yeah, the old League of Legends was a bit contrived. But the new lore is restrictive in a whole new way by limiting interaction between champions! Where will Garen and Kata get to play out their romance? How many times can Lucian realistically expect to fight Thresh before one of them actually wins that fight for good? When is Zilean supposed to comment on how ridiculous Volibear looks? All these questions don't have good answers now, because the champions are spread out across the world. Like yeah, Ryze can meet all them because he travels (and that cinematic was *killer*), but it's a poor substitute for the IoW so far. \n\nI want our arena of champions back. They can still interact off the Fields of Justice, too, and have cool story arcs. I *love* the improvements to story telling that Riot made. But, I don't understand why we can't have that *and* put SR in the context of Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-11T19:58:23.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to sound like a broken record, but I think there are still multiple angles here :)\n\nYou start out saying that it's about context - and I get that.  You want to be able to rationalize that Dr. Mundo and Rek'Sai are fighting on the same side, and that it _could_ have greater meaning.\n\nThen, however, you talk about wanting the champ interactions to be 'real' - that Thresh has near infinite opportunities to taunt Lucian about the fate of Senna, because they really are meeting each other's real selves in a game.  This one seems like there may be more to unpack.\n\nI could, for example, totally get it if the underlying desire was to see champs interacting more often.  I'd totally get that.  Our champs in the 'canon' lore haven't done as much interacting as I'd like to see - not by a long shot.  So if the urge is that seeing them interacting through the medium of the game gives almost endless opportunities to explore the personality clashes and conflicts, then I'd get that.  I'm not sure it is the right way to solve that urge, but I'd get it.  \n\nMy worry would be that, after the eleventybillionth time Thresh has taunted Lucian about his wife, it might get a bit old.  Of course, that could get mitigated if we argued that, in 'real canon' lore, there are only a handful of matches of Runeterra League that are ever actually played - then we could do some exploration that doesn't outstay its welcome. The game then, would be \"not a real match\" but a \"what if\" match.  Your match would still 'not matter', but it would look similar to a match that did matter.  A bit like wargamers playing out the Battle of Waterloo, or Custers Last Stand, on their big diorama tables.  It's not the real Battle of Waterloo - it may even have a different outcome - but it's a re-enactment of a real thing.  Is that the sort of way you imagine it?\n\nThe questions about 'how many times can Lucian realistically expect to fight Thresh before one of them actually wins that fight for good?' is a fine question - but the opposite is also true.  How many times are Lucian and Thresh realistically supposed to face off in enforced, never-ending, battle, before one or the other loses his mind or just shuts down?  That's why I think there would need to be more (but different) constraints on what the game would have to be, if it became 'real' in Runeterra.  Then, it's a question of - does this toothless version still satisfy the needs that we're identifying, or does it do so more poorly than other solutions might be able to.\n\nTo be clear, after all my rambling - I am in no way discounting the player pain that's being felt.  I'm trying to separate the needs from the solution, to ensure that it's the best solution, and not just the most familiar one.

It may not be something you can actually do, but this would fully satisfy my desire to canonize SR. I can make my peace with actual summoners not being canon :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TBSkyen","date":"2018-09-12T00:15:00.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=2FHdjGUr,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-09-11T04:03:07.029+0000)\n>\n> I watched this video this morning - pretty grim viewing :/  Folks here (and the OP, Noies) seem to be be the kind of players who have thought about this deeply - what do you all suggest for the future?\n> \n> Of course, we cannot change the past, and flip-flopping back would likely be the worst of all possible worlds.
