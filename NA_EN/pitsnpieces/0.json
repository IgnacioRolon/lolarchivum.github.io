Took a break from uploading stuff as I was on holiday (and also playing tons of Bard in LoL).\r\n\r\n**Previous Concepts**: \r\nArecibo: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/NEcocLV6-my-first-champ-concept-arbo-the-visitor?comment=0003\r\nPyrina: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/cpUOxyvE-champion-concept-pyrina-piltovers-core\r\n\r\n\r\n**Preface (and Basic Lore)**: For this champion, I wanted to create a character thats basically a friend/ally to Rammus ... ok. Like the Armadillo, Pilus was affected by the magic light thingy (in his old lore) to give him his abilities , has his own armour and speaks in simple english. Pilus travel all through Valoran, with an enhanced tongue that contains it&#039;s own 5 senses to allow Pilus to observe the world through the different flavours that everything has. \r\n\r\n**Naming**: Pilus \r\n1) Play on words to sound like &#039;Pile us&#039; - like Rammus &#039;Ram us&#039;\r\n2) Pilus comes from the word Pilosa - The species group for the anteater\r\n\r\nRole: Plays like Rammus, a tank that can return significant damage back and disrupt enemy teamfights\r\n\r\n**Quotes: \r\nChampion Select: **\r\n\r\n(Could use a something better with your input guys)\r\n\r\n**Joke**: \r\nAnimation: Tongue becomes hand and flips Pilus on his underbelly or backside like a spatula\r\n\r\nThe joke is important for a skill I will explain later and the animation comes in 2 variants: backside to belly and vice versa\r\n\r\n**Taunt**: \r\nAnimation: His Tongue becomes a hand and does the finger taunt\r\n\r\n**Movement**:\r\n1) &quot;Sweet&quot;\r\n2) &quot;Spicy&quot;\r\n3) &quot;Mmmmm&quot;\r\n4) &quot;Delicious&quot;\r\n\r\n(Still requires more ideas)\r\n\r\n**Special Quotes**:\r\n1) Buying Thornmail - &quot;Yeouch&quot; \r\n2) Buying IceBorn Gauntlet - &quot;Chilly&quot;\r\n3) Attacking Enemy Zac for first time - &quot;Plain&quot; or &quot;Jelly&quot;\r\n4) Attacking Enemy Lulu for first time - &quot;Purple?&quot; - you know the reference\r\n5) Attacking Enemy Gangplank for first time - &quot;Sour&quot; referencing the Oranges Gangplank has\r\n6) Attacking Enemy Sona for first time - &quot;Milky&quot; if you get my drift\r\n7) Attacking Enemy Diana for first time - &quot;Cheesy&quot; like the moon is made of cheese - also ironic cause Diana&#039;s joke are not cheesy\r\n8) Attacking any Enemy champion with Poision abilities for first time - &quot;Blegh!&quot;\r\n9) Attacking Enemy Nami for first time - &quot;Sushi&quot;\r\n10) Attacking a Taunting Enemy - &quot;Salty&quot;\r\n\r\n(More Quotes await your input guys)\r\n\r\n**Recall:** his tongue becomes a hand and starts searching the ground, then starts scratching his head with the tongue hand\r\n\r\n**Dance**: Nothing yet (need your feedback)\r\n\r\n**Details**:\r\nAttack Power:------■■■■■□□□□□\r\nDefense Power:--■■■■■■■■■□\r\nAbility Power:------■■■□□□□□□□\r\nDifficulty:--------------■■■■■□□□□□\r\n\r\nUses HP and Mana\r\n\r\n**Attributes**: Primary: Tank ; Secondary: Fighter\r\n\r\n**Stats**: I&#039;m not a supreme numbers man so I avoid applying numbers to damage, ranges and stats. You can decide them if you guys want to.\r\n\r\n**Abilities**:\r\n\r\n**Passive Ability - Armour Lick**\r\n- Autoattacks reduce armour for a % amount after 3 hits\r\n- Further autoattacks reduce movement speed by %\r\n\r\n**Active abilities**\r\n\r\n**Q - Tongue Sling**\r\n- comes in 2 parts\r\n- Part 1 fires a hook skillshot that grabs the first enemy in line and keeps them there for around 0.5 seconds\r\n- need to press Q again to activate Part 2\r\n- Part 2 Involves moving the enemy to another location where your cursor is when you press Q\r\n- Like a Syndra Force of Will and a blitzcrank hook\r\n- Downside is that Pilus has to remain still during both parts\r\n\r\n**W - Sloth (like being lazy, not the animal)**\r\n- Skill depends on the side flipped over to in the Joke animation\r\n- If flipped to the tummy showing - Taunt CC for around 1 second\r\n- If flipped to the backside showing - Heals % health for around 2 second\r\n- Pilus again remains motionless throughout skill duration\r\n\r\n**E - Scaled Fur**\r\n- tufts of fur tighten to become scale - changes the model texture to look like a pangolin\r\n- Less damage taken to auto attacks and skills hitting his body\r\n- Attacks that are facing or on his tail have % damage returned to enemy (so tail gets its own hitbox for the skill duration)\r\n\r\n**R - Essence Absorb**\r\n- Grabs and Suppresses enemies in a cone AoE with one big hand-tonuge swipe (see picture)\r\n- This suppression however doesn&#039;t let teammates attack the enemies - only Pilus does damage to them \r\n- after duration, enemies are thrown a distance away giving them the knockup cc\r\n- Lifesteal HP with % depending on how many enemies grabbed\r\n- Like Rammus, it can be used on a tower with a different effect and animation\r\n- Against Tower, Pilus grabs the tower with his Tongue-hand and grabs it tightly, crushing it with damage over time and reducing the tower&#039;s armour and magic resis - no lifesteal\r\n-if enemies are near tower and pilus ults, enemies are first priority\r\n- and yet again, Pilus remains motionless during entire skill duration\r\n\r\n**Good against and Counters**\r\n- I don&#039;t know yet\r\n\r\n**Skins**\r\n-I don&#039;t know yet\r\n\r\n\r\nSo guys, what do you think.

As a direct ally to Rammus, I don't think it's too bad that their kits and appearances are somewhat similar.  Kha'zix and Rengar have somewhat similar kits and there was a lot of backlash about that when they were released so close together, but now nobody even seems to notice or care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jacodaify","date":"2015-06-05T17:25:17.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This champion is FAR too much like rammus, in the fact that they both only way one word for their replies, the face that he is a anteater vs armadillo and his E is basically just a reused rammus W","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-06-05T17:20:41.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the tattoos and geometric markings.","replies":[]}]}
