For all you know, they could've done both. So, now what? They muted you, and they also reported you, so they don't need to \"learn\" anything new.\n\n> Chat restrictions are dumb...\n\nWell, if you don't want to be chat restricted (and potentially, eventually banned), you should consider following the [rules you agreed to](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#code-conduct) at account creation and whenever a new patch drops.\n\nIf you don't break the rules, you won't get punished.

Basically; performing one function (muting a player) does not prevent you from performing the other function (reporting a player) as well. Meaning that a player could mute you, and then after the match, report you, because muting doesn't block them from reporting.\n\n> 1 youve muted the person they cant do anything to you chat wise if you disagree on something...\n\nAgain; muting doesn't preclude reporting. Even if Player B can no longer affect Player A through chat after being muted, Player B can still be reported for the behavior that affected Player A enough to have to mute them as well as any behavior that Player A did not see due to the mute.\n\nIf someone _has_ to mute you, then you're doing something wrong.\n\n> ...and 2 its just league.\n\n1) That doesn't suffice as an argument, much less explain how you believe muting and reporting are mutually exclusive.\n\n2) League has rules, and if you break those rules, you can be punished.\n\n> Riots rules are being followed nothing offensive.\n\nClearly not if you got chat restricted. If you want your behavior peer reviewed so that you can see exactly where you crossed the line and how, you'll want to submit the chat logs associated with your punishment.\n\nOtherwise, do bear in mind that _you_ do not get to decide whether or not you breached the rules; Riot does. Their IFS deemed your behavior as in breach of the rules, and you were consequently punished.\n\n> Stating someone is playing bad is fact not prejudice.\n\nNo, but it can still be inflammatory and harassing behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-24T00:13:34.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Stating facts can be inflammatory but isnt something to be at fault for.\nPlayer A could have offended Player B or they could have not.

For starters, people don't react positively to negative stimuli. As in, if you insult someone and tell them they're bad at the game, they're not going to react well - and that negative reaction to a negative stimulus typically involves playing _worse_, whether intentionally or not. Tilt is a thing, after all.\n\nBeyond that, though, simply telling someone that they're bad isn't constructive criticism, so it functionally has _zero_ chance of getting them to improve. All they get out of it is that _one person_ thinks that they're bad. They aren't told how, they aren't told what to improve on, so they _can't_ improve, and consequently, will not care to try.\n\nAs for question 2, the answer to that one is virtually certain as well; if you got punished, then the odds are _extremely frickin' high_ that you gave your opinion to someone who didn't ask. And an unwanted opinion, particularly a negative one, is a negative stimulus. And as above, people do not react positively to negative stimuli.\n\nIf you want someone to improve, calling them bad is the worst way to do it. It's entirely counterintuitive, and also plainly inflammatory.","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-24T00:55:32.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"The answer is No only if you endit at \"you are bad\" which even if it was the case it is that players responsability to care and ask how to improve/ take the subsequent advice.\n\nSo telling them they are good when they arent is helpful how?

All you're doing is telling them that they're bad. They're not going to want to listen to you, because, again, as I've stated twice before; **_they're not going to respond well to negative stimuli, and they didn't ask for your opinion in the first place._**\n\nThey're not obligated to ask, no more than you're obligated to give.\n\n> So telling them they are good when they arent is helpful how?\n\nNowhere did I suggest telling someone that they're good when they aren't performing well.\n\n> Or not telling them anything?\n\nAs the old saying goes, \"If you can't say anything nice, then don't say anything at all\". Though in this case; if you can't communicate with others constructively, then keep your opinions and advice to yourself.\n\n> If you are going to be silently infuriated by their actions isnt that plainly inflamatory aswell?\n\nIf you're not harassing/insulting them, then no, staying silent would not be inflammatory.\n\n> Worse the lack of action might as well be you surrendering. Either call them out on their bullshit, lie to them and or let them lose your game with 0 action taken by anyone else on the team to correct them.\n\nAlternatively, you could simply focus on your own performance instead of trying to excuse your want to flame someone.\n\nAt any rate, I can't see much more room for productive discussion here. If you're going to keep harassing players by calling them bad and giving them unwanted opinions of their performance, you're going to continue to get punished - and those punishments _can_ and _will_ reach the point where you get banned.\n\nI'll be bowing out now, so have a good day.","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-24T01:21:09.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"If they dont want to listen thats their problem.

If they wouldn't answer you the first two or three times you asked then chances are they won't the next 10 times you do. Likewise calling someone bad 10+ times throughout the game isn't solving anything and is only making you look bad. At that point it's better to focus on your own game rather than on others.\n\n>Muting someone is one and done. You're not one to judge if someone else gets bothered.\n\nIf that's the case then why are there people who use chat to intentionally try to provoke and get a rise out of others? They could be using chat for tracking cooldowns, enemy champ/ward locations, things of that nature, but instead they're using it to try to tick others off while using the excuse \"well if you don't like it mute me\" to try to justify their behavior. Yes people should mute when need be but it's not a get out of jail free card and is meant to be a band-aid solution at most.\n\n>The chat restriction system doesnt really do anything.

It's not meant to be pleasant, it's meant to convey the consequences of chat misuse by limiting the amount of messages they can send at a time &amp; hopefully encourage them to be more mindful of what they choose to convey through it. Again it's not about being offended, it's meant to get the person in question to use chat more responsibly and not to abuse/harass others or get into game-long arguments with other players.","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-24T00:30:55.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Them refusing to communicate isnt making anyone else look bad.\n\nIf they are seeking stimuli outside of the game mechanics thats a riot problem.
