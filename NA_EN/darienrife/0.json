Imagine being killed once by a mistake by the bot lane and then again by a good gank? You're already kind of annoyed. Now add the midlaner saying, after these two deaths, \"Are you actually fucking retarded? Boosted AF.\"\n\nNow, you're agitated. Yeah, you're not doing that great, but I don't need you being a dick on top of it. Even if it's slight, that players attitude and decision making is now a bit tilted.\n\nFor two; It's distracting.\nYeah, yeah. The mute button is there. Blah, blah. But if you're someone like me who likes A LOT of communication with the jungler/engager/support, it's annoying to have to mute someone that you need in a fight or a good follow up. When someone is blowing up the chat, whether you respond or someone else, you are distracting people. \n\nLastly, you don't have to rage to let someone know they're doing poorly.\n\n\"Hey, man, the decisions you're making are not the best. Play safe/don't engage/stick by me/_tell them what to do and improve on in a short way._ \"it's all good. We got this.

Calling them \"trash\" does not serve to help them get better, and it sure as shit ain't respectful, so instead of calling people trash, consider falling back on the old adage; \"_If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all_.\"\n\nAs for your question in the Title of the post...\n\n> **Why is being \"toxic\"/Angry in a game were you have to rely on your teammates a bad thing?**\n\nThis is gonna be broken down into two parts. Being angry, and being toxic (in other words, channeling that anger at other players).\n\nIn terms of being angry - anger is not necessarily a bad thing. Anger is just a part of the human condition, but not handling your anger _well_ can be detrimental. Letting it run rampant, or even trying to smother it, can both lead to awful negative outcomes. You have to learn how to appropriately handle your anger without letting it spill out and be a detriment to others.\n\nAnd being toxic is pretty much the definition of failure in that regard. Taking your anger out on your teammates does a number of things that ultimately add up to increasing the chances of losing that match. For one, it causes people to dislike you because you're just being a toxic jerk, which then ruins team cohesion - making people less likely to team up with you and work towards the win, solely to spite you for calling them \"trash\".\n\nAnd if people aren't playing to spite you, they're still likely going to play worse than they did _before_ you harassed them - because being insulted lowers team morale, making people play worse. And even if they weren't specifically subject to your insults and attacks, they still have to deal with it, because they had the misfortune of being put in the same team as you. Nobody likes a toxic jerk.\n\nAnd lastly, the biggest detriment of toxicity is that _you're focusing more on the person you're railing against than the game itself, **making YOU play worse as a consequence.**_ The more you choose to flame and call people trash, the less you're actually committing to doing what _you_ can do to improve your odds of winning.\n\nThere is ultimately _some_ merit to toxicity as a means of venting anger, but the drawbacks so heavily outweigh it, and there are so many other means to venting anger and frustration, that you really have to ask yourself;\n\n\"Is it really worth it to flame someone if it means we're more likely to lose?\"\n\n> ...in the real world if you fuck up people are going to point it out and not nicely so people need to stop being such little bitches.\n\nThis is so far from accurate that it's funny.\n\nBut, hey - look at it this way; if you flame and call someone trash and be toxic in general, that is (to use your example here) you \"fucking up\". And when you get reported and punished, that's Riot pointing it out, and not nicely. So why complain when Riot points out when you fucked up?\n\n> ...i think being \"toxic\"/angry is vital part of the game...\n\nBeing toxic is not an intrinsic part of the game. It's not even an intrinsic part of competition in general - you cannot possibly make a valid point depicting toxicity and detrimental vitriol as being an inherent part of League of Legends - or any other competition or game, for that matter - because it's _just not true._\n\nGames are meant for having fun, not wasting your time to rail against people for no good reason.\n\n> And people should be flamed if there bad in ranked.\n\nIf that's the case, then people who flame should just be outright banned. That's a good compromise to make, right? One outrageous thing for another.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpleYukari","date":"2018-09-21T20:04:13.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If people want to know how good they are, why would it be a good idea to rely on the opinion of a stranger on the internet who is acting tilted?","replies":[{"poster":"DarienRife","date":"2018-09-21T20:14:14.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"because a person you don't know will give you and unbiased opinion of your game play if your doing bad they'll tell you.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-09-21T20:51:23.322+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact, your teammates are likely to be more biased than your friends.
