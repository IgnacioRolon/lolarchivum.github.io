This is not directed at you per se as it is not your fault at all, but Yorick is the worst handled moba character since the Gambler. He is permabanned from the free week rotation, he is constantly the culprit behind spaghetti code breaking the game (unlimited deaths in a game, dropping games every other patch, etc.), no skins released, perma \"on the remake to do list.\"\n Lets be completely frank here, why has he not been #1 on the redo list? Why has Gangplank now received 2 visual updates while Yorick, who is not in a sorry visual state in my opinion, will not get a skin because he is \"on the VU list?\n\n>  -Nazzdan","replies":[{"poster":"The Y2J Problem","date":"2015-07-18T02:04:54.811+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"This guy gets it.\n\nAs someone who loves Yorick (I know it's weird, but I like his kit, despite the fact that it is just a sloppy mess), he REALLY needs an overhaul. While I can understand that some characters also need a complete reworking (eg. Poppy, Fiora, and a myriad of others), Yorick has been one of, if not, the biggest issue in the game. Being **permabanned from the Free Rotation** almost seems like a joke, or something that you tell newer or ignorant players just to see their reaction as they discover that it's true.\n\nAnd really, the quote brings up a good point, GP went through 2 reworks - Granted, his first rework was a visual change, and goddamn did he need it, stupid banana sword - while Yorick just hangs out, skinless as well (Ha! Zombie joke!).\n\nHere's hoping that he gets looked at soon, but everything I've seen points to Poppy, Taric and Fiora getting their upgrades first. And that really is the great irony of the whole situation, isn't it?

He by no means is the most dated character visually, he still looks fine.  \nThe problem is entirely how his kit is coded, because for some reason every patch seems to have an issue where a new AP item is released and somehow that makes Yorick's ult drop games.  Or a new game mode is released, and for some reason that makes Yoricks rez as soon as they die only to die again over and over.  A new champion is released, but when Yorick ults them the game just ends and everyone that was in it is suddenly catapulted to challenger.\nThe fact that he is never on free-week is ridiculous.  At this point he should just be given away for free from some stupid promotion like Alistar, Garen and Tristana.  That way we could at least say \"well, hes not on free week because he is free!  yay!\"\nI would be perfectly content if they just re-released him with the exact same kit, maybe polished his looks a bit, and made it so he doesn't break the game every 2 weeks.\nIt's been said in this thread already but he had a Rioter working on him that was VERY transparent with the community, bouncing ideas off of people in the threads.

He was heavily interacting with the community, he proposed multiple kits and had fans vote on which one they liked better, and he asked the important questions like \"Why do you play Yorick\" and \"What parts of his kit are fun, and which are boring?\". Unfortunately, this back and forth process between Rioter and players took so long that when a kit was finally decided on the Rioter got called off the project to work on the season 4 pre-season changes, and the rework got shelved.\n\nHowever, Riot hasn't forgotten about the rework, or at least knows of it's existence. I know this because one of the newer items is {{item:3512}}, which functions very similarly to the proposed reworked Yorick ult that put down a gravestone on the map and had ghouls constantly spawn from it to attack/siege things.\n\nYorick is probably going to require a {{champion:14}} level rework; new kit, new voice, new look, new splash, the whole nine yards. It's basically making a new champion. That takes time, but when a champion is such a problem to the game as Yorick is, it would be worth the expenditure. If they started now they _might_ have something just in time for the Harrowing.\n\nPersonally, I hope he stays a minion master type of champion and also a tanky one as well.

We could probably come up with hundreds of iterations of Yorick in 3 years. Other people already HAVE posted their iterations of a Yorick re-work.\n\nTelling me to \"suggest ideas\" to a 3-year concept-stage sounds stupid on its own. [This guy already gave his skit in a greatly detailed rework idea](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/opeQPN8s-necromancer-summoner-yorick-kit-rework), and it's probably one of the better rework concepts covering Necromancy that's been around.\n\nOr is sitting around for 3 years coming up with ideas sound productive to you?","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-07-19T01:16:32.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You are really desperate to rush this, if they don't think a concept is good enough they aren't going to do it, and that is fine.\n\nI rather they didn't half ass a rework on a concept they don't like just because some people are being impatient.\n\nYou also make the assumption they have spent 3 years working on his rework, no one ever said they started 3 years ago, priorities change and Yorick wasn't seen as a huge project back in 2012 like he is now. \n\nYorick isn't the only outdated useless champion, just wait your turn.","replies":[{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2015-07-19T01:35:53.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are willfully missing the point of my post that the OP quoted.\nAnd to reference your \"he only has a 0.81% pick rate\" gee, could that be because he is banned in competitive due to numerous known and unknown bugs so esports fans never see him, or perhaps it's because he is permabanned from the freeweek rotation so the only way to play him is to just buy him on a whim?\nNo one here cares about his kit or his visuals, this thread is about how he won't get skins because he's in queue for a rework practically since his release, and how he is so horribly bugged he breaks the game every other patch.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-07-18T19:13:10.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"most players complain that her gameplay update is actually a nerf as it does nerf most of her stats in the end and the only thing she \"gained\" was a slightly stronger early game\n\nfor instance, the Q which already does 120% or so to a bounced target now does 150% of that damage if the first target died\n\nit's interesting, but it's hardly anything noteworthy\n\nher W no longer applies grievous wounds, something that will likely become essential in this jungler Sated Devourer off-meta\n\nher E now slows less and does less damage overall\n\n***\n\ngangplank didn't even get an update...he got a demotion to pirate stereotype 101 and now he has a barrel to blow up that doesn't even stack with itself and lasts less time than a teemo mushroom","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-07-18T20:38:01.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ms Fortune got buffs. \n\nE is a better slow early on when it matters.

Overall it's a buff.\n\nGangplank got an update. I don't know how he is any more of a stereotype then before when he had more pirate talk currently then his rework has.\n\nHis update is meant to give him a less boring playstyle, because honestly once you learned Gangplank that was it, he was to simple and straight forward.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-07-18T23:45:41.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wish simple and straight forward was all it took to get an update\n\nthen karthus, garen, chogath, etc could all get reworks","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-07-19T00:01:31.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3TWarrior,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fraJT3AA,comment-id=0004000100000000,timestamp=2015-07-18T23:45:41.334+0000)\n>\n> I wish simple and straight forward was all it took to get an update\n> \n> then karthus, garen, chogath, etc could all get reworks\n\nDon't touch Karthus","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-07-18T23:50:47.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said simple and straight forward was all it took, nor did I imply that.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-07-19T06:03:25.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, but simple and straight forward seems to be the basis for riot changing a lot of champs\n\nannie will probably make the list eventually because of it, but she's the starter mage other than ryze(for those who are complaining about her)\n\nI think a bigger problem is that they don't have enough people on their rework staff","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
