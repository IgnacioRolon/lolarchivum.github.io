I have a question??","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, recently, I just opened a Hextech Box and got an Ultimate Skin Shard aka Pulsefire Ezreal skin.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to know is, once I upgrade this to a skin permanent, do I get its theme features as well? Or only just the skin itself?\r\n\r\nBuying it with RP will unlock the PF Ez skin and its theme features, but does it also work from upgrading it in a hextech box?? I&#039;m so confused. Can someone here clear this up for me? Because I would like to get the whole thing. I have been waiting to get this skin for ages, since it&#039;s so expensive to buy it. ;n;","replies":[]}
