Im silver and you notice when someone is out of the ordinary and this guy was. He hit almost every skill shot and freeze lane at his tower at all times and rarely miss a minions even with his auto atacks. I began to suspect him when the game ended and i saw his match history and he has 8 wins and 1 loss with brand.\r\n\r\nI think this guys account is being boosted because how can you start playing with brand in ranked and win 8 out of 9 games with him just like that starting to play him 2 days ago. And if he is a smurf i think is not fair especialy when season is almost over and people want to win, and then comes a smurf and literaly auto wins the game for his team.\r\n\r\nWhere can I report.","replies":[{"poster":"Bubonica","date":"2016-11-04T04:29:20.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfing is not bannable. A lot of high elo players smurf because there are long queue times or they do not want to mess up their main. They also have to climb the ladder too, they can't just start in Diamond. Boosting is reportable though.","replies":[{"poster":"ShaolinToilet","date":"2016-11-04T07:39:29.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfing is a dick move though.","replies":[{"poster":"Bubonica","date":"2016-11-04T14:55:57.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

I had someone on my friends list (not sure why he was on it) who was boosted to diamond. I sent a ticket and he was banned. I usually wouldn't bother with that kind of stuff but after seeing him stream in diamond elo telling everyone to kill themselves I figured it was justice. The way I found out was simply looking at his match history and seeing a 20 wins 0 loss volibear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-11-04T06:55:07.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair it's hard to judge just by your account. For all you know it could be a smurf which isn't against the rules. It's looked down upon but considering this is a free game nothing can be done about people making an account.\n\nWith that said you cannot just think someone is boosted and report them. You need evidence,or else by that logic everyone would report someone who is better than them. And then we will have so much false reports! \n\nI mean it's suck that people like this (smurfs) can basically stomp on people trying to get a higher than,but again what can be done to stop it? They cannot make it so only one person has one account because that cannot be traced that one person only has one account. Especially when you got people playing at schools/Internet cafes. Even in the household families play together or roommates play. It's one of the reasons why they don't IP ban people because it would cause more harm than good!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-11-04T04:21:26.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't there a \"3rd party application\" tickbox at the post game report?","replies":[{"poster":"18 NAKED COWB0YS","date":"2016-11-04T04:24:41.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure thats scripting .\n\ni think cheating would be good for all those tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yooba","date":"2016-11-04T04:24:22.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone is playing on that guy's account but I doubt it's a booster.
