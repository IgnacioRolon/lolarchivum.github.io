You don't see silver 3-4 players in a gold game, I've been silver for many seasons and I can safely say I have never been placed with gold players, you never go to a gold game where there's one silver 4 or 3 player with a bunch of gold 1-2 players because that would be unbalanced especially when on the other team there's no silver player.\r\n\r\nHeres how my last game (wich was horrible) got matched\r\n\r\nMY TEAM:\r\nTop (me) silver 4\r\nJungler bronze 3\r\nMid silver 3\r\nADC bronze 2\r\nSupport silver 2\r\n\r\nENEMY TEAM:\r\nTOP silver 4\r\nJungle silver 4\r\nMid silver 4\r\nADC silver 4\r\nSupport silver 3\r\n\r\nYou see how the enemy team has NO bronze players all of them are silver, yes four of them are silver 4 but do I have to mention the difference between a bronze 3-2 and a silver 4 player? well believe it or not it's a huge difference. And more than having bronze players in my team what bothers me the most is that the matching system doesn't place bronze players in the other team also. \r\n\r\nAnd I would really love to see somebody at Riot explain to me how this game in particular is in any way balanced matchmaking because if you had to bet let's say 5000 dollars on a team I'm sure most of you would of placed your money on the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2019-07-29T04:32:33.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rank is not your mmr, and ranked and norms have seperate mmrs.\nThese silvers and bronzes have the same mmr values.\nThe game believes they are the same skill level.","replies":[{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2019-07-29T06:55:51.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teh Song,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vfEGGm5T,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-07-29T04:32:33.530+0000)\n>\n> Rank is not your mmr, and ranked and norms have seperate mmrs.\n> These silvers and bronzes have the same mmr values.\n> The game believes they are the same skill level.\n\nLets be honest, we dont know their mmr, we dont know how exactly or if matchmaking works we only hope it work as it should be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Err 503","date":"2019-07-29T08:52:58.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is a stupid system in first place, nor does it work properly. The fact that you get better enemys when your MMR is high, and worse teammates, forces you to play like a platin player to survive promos from Silver to Gold e.g. at LEAST like a platin player. It just makes no sense to play competitively in this game anymore other than LCS/LEC/LCK. \n\nEspecially also because, when you just play enough, and have been tilted enough by promos, you will simply get into higher division just by passing the lp barrier..\n\nThat plus the forced 50%ish Winrates, make the game completely uncompetitive. You will climb. If you play enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2019-07-29T15:28:00.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You missed the point.\nAll that stuff you just said doesn't happen.\nWhen your mmr goes up you get better enemies and better teammates.\nAll 10 people in the match have matching or similar mmr values.\n50% win rates never have and never will be forced in any game you ever play.\nIt's just the natural result of trying to match you with equally skilled players.\nThose bad players you complain about are in the enemy team just as often as they are on yours, you just don't notice. And more to the point, they have the same mmr as you. The same skill level as you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-07-29T06:58:12.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're all close enough that I wouldn't be surprised if their ranked/normal MMRs are similar anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-07-29T06:57:25.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man you haven't seen the games where they're an entire tier apart or more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-29T02:47:41.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rank has nothing to do with MMR and is effectively meaningless now.","replies":[]}]}
