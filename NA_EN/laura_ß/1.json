Im talking about {{champion:122}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:14}} this champions take little skill to play, just their sheer overloaded numbers make them powerfull, they literaly can just stand in lane and farm with absolutely no fear and absolutely no drawback other than being ganked, wich a smart player will ward and control the wave to avoid and depending on a gank just to kill them or go back to lane in a soloQ environment is just...pathetic balance.\r\n\r\nYou can&#039;t fight them, your cant out push them and they not only tank all your damage but also deal more damage then you with their defensive+damage items like {{item:3068}} {{item:3742}} they are so pathetically balanced and overpowered just try to play {{champion:122}} vs{{champion:6}} and the lane becomes just a farm game with no one ever dying, but play them VS any other melee champion and they just auto win the lane or at the worst case get even with the enemy, but lose lane hell no.\r\n\r\nIn team fights {{champion:122}} can just be in the center and not only tank and deal damage but even HEAL, fucking HEAL damage just for hitting a very wide AOE ability and execute champions with hes R and get resets.\r\n\r\nAnd {{champion:6}} tanks even more damage and slows and pulls back enemies for hes team to kill and also has an execute ability thats long range &#039;&#039;&#039;skill shot&#039;&#039;.\r\n\r\nThis champions don&#039;t lose lane, this champions dont lose a melee 1v1 AND they have ways to avoid getting kitted by the ADC {{item:3022}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3075}} they are just packed with stats and just ruin the balance of the game and are unfun auto win pieces of shit champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-11-19T23:58:09.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s not our fault you don’t know how to counter pick and counter play against them lol.\n\nAll of those three can be melted with CC and stuff like Conq and Bork.

It just encourages homogenization, as it makes more sense to balance champions to be vulnerable to entire classes rather than particular unique quarks of any number of champions. \nWhich in tern means that when the next cycle roles around to nerf the homogenized champion, they have the option to just buff/homogenize his intended counters to be better against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-11-20T04:15:29.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I did also say counter play. Like general counter play tips to use against a champ that all of the other champs can use. Like staying back when Irelia has fully stacked her passive and letting the wave push to you.
