A first offense is a loss of 3 LP and short lower priority queue.  Consistent leaves will cause much higher LP loss and higher wait time.\n\nIt's really important to fix this up and resolve whatever is causing this freezing you describe.  I don't have a lot of information, but you might have a connection problem causing you to lose sync in champion select and leaving you behind.  My suggestion is to go over each of the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve this.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
