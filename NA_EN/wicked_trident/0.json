Thanks for the new TFT changes!","subforum":"Teamfight Tactics","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"This new TFT is SO f'ing horrible and I thank you, Riot, for that! :D It's like, you had a great game, nice and succinct, with great play and diversity, and you were just like, \"F--k it! Let's ruin it and make it terrible!\" I mean, I only play TFT a few times a week, got to Gold then stopped playing ranked. But the matches do still take up more time than I'd like, but us gamers, hard to stop playing, ya know? And I was considering moving on, and then the utter dilution of the pool and sets, just really nailed it home! Woohoo! My woman will be happy, now I can go spend more time on the couch with her after work playing Gears 5. Cheers and peace out! :D","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-11-07T07:45:22.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it just feels like we did a 180\n\nWe went from Dragons dominating the game to nothing keeping magic damage in check.  Mystics are borderline mandatory but unit pools are reduced.  So if you can't pick up Mystics and don't have magic damage, you're pretty screwed.\n\nHell, the only synergy with a durability buff is Wardens and its armor only.  Granted, its a lot of armor and thats still a little helpful since mages need to auto for mana.  But realistically that isn't doing shit against the Inferno Summoners or a doublecast Veigar.  Even then they seem fair compared to a Light based comp that actually gets completed, makes the Noble meta look weak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-07T06:34:57.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"We understand nobody likes RNG, so we made it worse and made early game RNG more impactful\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"sirpounce","date":"2019-11-08T11:36:12.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with you. The synergies feel horrible and the element locations force you to place in odd positions on the board.\nThere is also minimal interaction with champion abilities, where are the cho and gnar style ultimates? it all feels so bland as champs just stand there. \n\nThis set is extremely boring, frustrating and the synergies with champs feel out of place and lack appeal. I hope they fix this else ill be doing the same and leaving TFT until Set 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Åšhunpo","date":"2019-11-07T09:00:12.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I don't get is why they made a set where Spatula items are almost mandatory in order to win.....and then they reduced the drop rate of Spatulas...\n\nOn the PBE it felt quite nice as Spatulas dropped more frequently, but that one tiny change they made to TFT Set 2 before it hit live servers ruined the gamemode imo (they lowered the drop rate of Spatulas as it was apparently bugged).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-11-07T07:07:05.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i stopped giving a fuck about tft after they refused to adress the item drop rng for 4 patches straight. it just ruined it for me.\nobviously i still see the news and from what i heard... they still only made it worse and worse.\nriot :D","replies":[]}]}
