So i disable the xbox thing, load into a custom with bots i can actually play, but now  i cant alt-tab out of game without it crashing, thats fine for me i guess. Since custom worked i load into an aram everything goes fine, since that aram worked,  i load into a ranked and then.......it strikes again, my team loses i get slapped with a 5 game 20 min q...we need compensation or at least an actual fix...","replies":[{"poster":"Floaturboat777","date":"2016-09-24T07:24:58.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how to fix it, I wrote a discussion on it, its on my profile{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:09:29.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't sound like you're actually experiencing the same issue that the Xbox Game Bar is causing. Not being able to *Alt+Tab* out of a match is an indication that there may be issues interacting with your Graphics card, or there could be hardware issues going on. I recommend working through the steps in our [Bugsplat & Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to take a crack at the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"im tilt","date":"2016-09-18T23:25:53.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you think the update also messed with the graphics card? Also as i stated i did disable the game bar and i was able to play a custom and aram but it crashed me in a ranked, i had to uninstall the update entirely for it to work again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T15:20:23.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible the update included a graphics driver, but you'd have to check the update history or details to see. If uninstalling the Windows 10 anniversary update entirely resolved this, there very well may be something inside that update that's causing the issue. There were a number of other things the update changed, but I'm not aware of any changes outside of the Xbox Game Bar that would directly affect League. You may want to hold off on that update for now until a new set of updates are available.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"im tilt","date":"2016-09-19T21:33:33.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay something is really screwed up here, i disabld game bar and removed part of the update and i had gotten a 5 game 20 min queue from the before mentioned ranked game, so i start playing arams to work it off, one goes by fine, and the next one, same exact bug problem...do you guys have a permanent fix? or some compensation?","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-20T16:30:13.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did u try the compatibility test?","replies":[{"poster":"im tilt","date":"2016-09-20T21:03:55.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't work, i had to uninstall the security part of the update as well for it to start working","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T16:03:04.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't offer compensation, but we can dive deeper into this if you run a set of logs using our Hextech Repair Tool and attach them to a [support ticket request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-19T18:36:36.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey C9 Nasif\n\nRight Click League app\n\nSelect Test Compatability\n\nTeam Liquid\n\nRun Diagnostic\n\nRun custom game to test\n\nCLose league and save settings\n\nHope it works","replies":[]}]}
