I had uninstalled the update and continued playing, but windows kept bugging me to install updates, until today when it force installed them. I was scared so i started league and ran a custom game, same problem. Is there any permanent fix for this? the xbox game dvr thing is off, or any way to prevent them from updating my windows 10?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T21:09:17.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know we've tried to help out in the past, and it's a bummer that there's still issues.
