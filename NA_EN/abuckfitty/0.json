Now my game runs smoothly with no problems and my video card never gets the that crazy high fan speed.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps anyone who experienced my problem. It was a 3 day hastle that almost had me return the comp.\r\n\r\n{{champion:23}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:23}} dream team &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T00:54:13.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeiiiiiird, it sounds like your pc was trying to run way harder than it needed to anytime League games started.
