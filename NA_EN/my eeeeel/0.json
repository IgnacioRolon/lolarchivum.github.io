The change was done to fix pre-existing problems with dragons giving global gold and make the game more interesting. I believe it indeed produced some positive effects, but I also feel the change has some drawbacks could have been done in different way.\r\n\r\n>Before suggesting an alternative dragon reward, let’s see what Riot is intending with the dragon change.\r\n1. **Introduce strategic diversity through making objectives incomparable.**\r\n Previously, the way to snowball was essentially unique: farm up more gold and experience than the opponent and use gold lead to win the team fight. \r\nTaking tower, farming up minions and jungle, killing enemy champions, and taking dragon were indistinguishable as they all give gold and experience; one could easily evenly trade the top tower for a dragon after avoiding a team fight.\r\n2. **Slow down the snowball from early gold advantage.**\r\n\tThe team which takes the first dragon without any trade-off had won the game very easily. The global gold advantage from the dragon meant stronger team fight and the next dragon could had been taken even more easily, making the losing team little chance to come back.\r\nThe dragon no longer gives gold and all buffs except for the first and fifth one doesn’t help in team fight. The dragon itself is also stronger and tougher to kill with dragon buff stacks, making it easier to contest.\r\n3.\t**Encourage the vision control and team fight around the dragon**\r\nRecall the push meta when a team could just push the turret fast, ramp up the global gold, keep poking/rotating/split pushing and win without any serious team fight. The inner and inhibitor turret change made such strategy weaker and winning the team fight around the dragon is now the new way to snowball.\r\nThe river scuttle and stronger dragon with better graphics made dragon team fight more interesting.\r\n4.\t**Rewards the team which has been consistently taking the dragon.**\r\nIn contrary to the push Meta, there was also stall Meta. When champions like {{champion:34}}  and {{champion:115}}  were strong, a team could just give up all the objectives other than inhibitor turret and focus on clearing the minion wave to until 40 minute where global gold matters little because the carries already have full items. Those games lacking team fight and strategy were really boring to watch.\r\nStacked dragon buff with baron buff is extremely strong for defenders. It immediately ends the stalemate and forces defenders to contest dragons and team fight. \r\n\r\nIt seems Riot has done quite a good work changing the meta and make the game more oriented towards team fights. Nonetheless, there are many things I feel current change negatively influenced upon.\r\n>1.\t**The buffs are not visible and passive.**\r\nWhile dragon slayer buffs are ‘visible’ by red aura trailing the champion, one can’t really feel the buff except for the third stack, where champions moves a lot after sudden, and fifth stack. While one can think “Yes, I can now be stronger since I can get my trinity force, infinite edge, or deathcap”, one rarely think “I’m stronger now because I have 6% increased ap, deal more damage to turret and minion!” \r\nBuffs are all passive. One can’t really choose the advantage to take with the buff as one might had done with extra gold from dragon. (More vision? More item?), which makes reward less interactive.\r\n2.\t**Buffs reward some champions more than the other.**\r\nThe first buff benefits AD {{champion:238}}  and hybrid champions {{champion:84}}  more than mana-based {{champion:13}} , penetration-based {{champion:143}} , and tanky champions {{champion:14}} least.\r\n The second buff benefits champions focused on sieging and split pushing rather than team fighting. {{champion:51}}  poking turret and {{champion:11}}  split pushing would make good use of the additional damage to turret, while {{champion:32}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:30}}  would take essentially no good use out of it.\r\n3.\t**Buffs are not really incomparable**\r\nWhile they are different from just giving additional gold, their values can be estimated and thus trade-offs can still take place. The first buff is comparable to half longsword (early game), the second buff worth very little and the third buff is comparable to alacrity enchantment.  \r\n\r\nThus, for the reasons above, I want to suggest new buffs that would be more unique, active, noticeable, fair, and still achieve the original intent of dragon reward change. This is suggestion and my rationale:\r\n>1.\t***Dragon’s scale*: Reduce damage taken from minions and non-epic monsters by 20%**\r\nIn the preseason jungle, sustain was essential for a champion to be an effective jungler. Junglers with no sustain ability performed poorly and couldn’t take advantage of the new cool smite features because it is very hard for them to jungle without smite. While this still gives sustain junglers early edge over nonsustain junglers, it would allow junglers to more actively use {{summoner:11}}  strategically midgame.\r\nPart of the reason why melee autoattackers {{champion:266}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:77}} are not so popular in top lane is the minion agros. This change can indirectly bring more diversity to the top lane champion pool.\r\nSeason 5 is all about minions. They are stronger and there are buffs {{item:3060}} (Nasher) strengthens them as well. Although it is indeed interesting, I think the only counter-play to that is to melt them down through aoe spells because they are too powerful for even tanks to tank them. -no more adc/support get raped by minions and get frustrated.\r\n2.\t***Dragon’s heart*: Increase the duration of potions, elixirs, and stealth ward by 20% and improves the effect of potions by 20%.**\r\nAfter the lane phase, there is no meaningful choice of leaving an item slot for {{item:2003}} {{item:2004}} , as vision control and additional item is way more important and potion heals only fixed amounts, making them cost inefficient. After taking this buff, the players would have additional meaningful choice of buying consumable for sustain even after the lane phase.\r\nReworked elixirs are not being used frequently as they used to be, unless its ad casters {{item:2140}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} or ap champs that can poke {{item:2139}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:268}} . The part of the reason is that they are too expensive for the effect. This buff would increase the cost efficiency of elixirs to make choice of using gold for elixir more meaningful and encourage even rarely used ones {{item:2138}} {{item:2137}}  to be more safely used.\r\nAfter the introduction of {{item:3340}}  and {{item:2049}} , very few players are actually buying {{item:2044}}  to actively participate in vision game. Even players do buy wards usually opt for {{item:2043}} . This buff would encourage even players relying on trinket and support for vision to take more part on vision game and increase the strategic value of {{item:2044}} .\r\n3.\t***Dragon’s vision*: Increase the line of sight of champions, towers, minions, and wards by 20%**\r\nThis buff would encourage more strategic positioning of champions as players can spread out more to get more visions of the map. Also, tower control and minion wave management would be more crucial and vision game more important.\r\nThe current 5% MS bonus is not healthy, because even if a player misposition himself and put him in danger of being surrounded, he could get away easily with faster movement speed and make chasers who did good strategic positioning by leading him to such trap frustrate. Also, one team in overall faster than the other discourage slower (and generally losing) team from expanding and aggressively warding because it is easier for them to get caught, even if they do not overextend, because of the movement speed difference.\r\n4.\t***Dragon’s wisdom*: Reduce the cooldown on active items by 20% (this includes {{item:3341}} {{item:3340}} {{item:3342}} )**\r\nThere are a lot of new fun active items in this new season but except for some {{item:3157}} {{item:3153}}{{item:3143}}  {{item:3190}} {{item:3222}} , they has been uncommon, because they are usually cost inefficient due to active. This buff would encourage players to get more of such item and enjoy cool actives. {{item:3060}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3023}} {{item:3800}}{{item:3512}} \r\nThe way to deny enemy vision is usually by {{item:3341}} . As vision war intensify, players would find more use for the trinkets.\r\n5.\t***Aspect of the Dragon*: Grant 10% cooldown reduction, 10% movement speed and temporary double all other bonuses and attacks burns enemies for 2 seconds dealing 20 true damage per second. **\r\nThe fifth buff are the game closer and ought to be really strong. Yet, it could be not only strong but also can grant even more utility.\r\nAD and AP buff overlaps with baron buff making dragon buff less unique. Let’s grant something different from the baron one. \r\nThe raw strength is a bit lowered to give defenders more chance in fight and make attackers rely on massive utility boost to close the game. (more thinking, less crushing)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buffs above are not just trait boosts but buffs that **leads to other meaningful choices**, which is the goal Riot is intending for the new season. They do not also make the team who gets it first to snowball hard and necessarily get the next dragon because while buffs give noticeable utilities that can lead to various advantages, themselves **do not help in team fight** when dragon is contested. A player still can use elixirs and active items without the dragon buff and do vision control. Because a lot of buffs are focused on vision control and strategic movements, it would be more fun to watch how competitive teams use such advantage cleverly instead of having just more raw strength to crush in the team fight without leaving them hope. The buffs are very **unique and incomparable**. In exchange of tower gold and dragon buff, there is meaningful trade-off between utility and strength from better items. They are **cumulative**; the more stacks a team have, the greater reward next dragon provides. They all provoke players to take more actions like using more actives and consuming more elixirs which all champions can equally take advantages of. Lastly, they are more **fair**, as this kind of buff can be beneficial to all kinds of champions: carries, tanks, supports, junglers, compared to the current one which helps only damage dealers.\r\n\r\nAlong with the change, I suggest new buff timers: red and blue 4 minutes, dragon 5 minutes, and baron 6 minutes. Because the duration of the buffs are lowered, junglers are having more trouble influencing the lane with those buff, so they can have it more often. Also, the game gets a little boring when defending teams just sit under inner turret and there is no buffs or dragons to contest. Because the dragon timer is so long, it is extremely difficult to see stacked dragon buff which take at least 30 mins. I believe reducing dragon timer would allow players to enjoy new cool dragon buffs and boast ultimate 5 dragon buff stacks more often. \r\nAlso, I feel like Ancient Grudge debuff (grants the Dragon 20% increased damage against and 7% damage reduction against champions with Dragon buff/ per stack) needs to be strengthen. Many times, losing team gets into situation where they know enemy is doing dragon and they are too strong to contest, but they can't really take any action against it except for throwing a jungler for a steal, because the enemy can still take the dragon very quickly without much health loss. In order to give the losing side more opportunity to take other forms of advantage to catch up, slow down the snowballing, and increase the chance for an epic steal, the damage reduction should be also increased to 20%. \r\nFurthermore, it should be allowed to take multiple elixirs at the same time. When a player has full build, he feels like wasting additional gold which is annoying. There should be an outlet to exhaust such extra gold to allow players to make use of extra gold in late game. (1.6k gold every 3 minutes is sufficient even for the late game)\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Strident","date":"2015-02-10T07:19:54.124+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'll agree with you that it's saddening that the first two dragon buffs don't feel very meaningful on tanks, but I do think that the 3rd and 4th (and of course, the 5th) dragon buff can be felt. In addition, I'd make the case that the 5th dragon buff is actually even more meaningful on tanks, because tanks often have several AoE abilities that don't do much damage, but now apply true damage.\n\nOf course, we can't expect this always be taken by the winning team, so some sort of additional reward would be nice. I'd make the case that the first dragon buff is fine because tanks still experience relatively the same impact early, but the second is definitely unrewarding. It would be nice if it had, for example, 25% bonus health regeneration tagged to it.\n\nAs for your proposed reworks, I'd honestly make the case that those sound really useless. The first one is mostly useful for junglers early on; for the laners, it is really, really conditional and honestly feels like a piece of shit. The only other time this is useful is when you have all 3 inhibitors down, and at that point you've lost anyway.\n\nAs for your second, this is also way too conditionally useful. People buy potions even outside of the laning phase if they are intelligent and have an extra item slot, and its easy to see why. What you are proposing here is not improving the game health, and if you wanted to encourage elixir usage, tagging it to the second dragon buff makes no sense.\n\nStealth wards are actually really really good for laners, and the current trinket balance works out for it. These are meant to be bought before you hit level 9 and can purchase the trinket options, because the goal is for players to still be able to play the vision game even after they run out of slots for wards.\n\nYour third dragon buff is rather okay, but linking the vision game to permanent dragon buffs seems improper, whereas the game provides us a good example of a neutral mechanic which operates in the vision game in the form of the scuttle crab, so your proposal in lieu of that seems rather crude.\n\nYour fourth idea is only effective if this game was DotA and had more activatable items whose cooldowns are crucial to a champion's success, rather than the few currently that are always up for the next teamfight and you can forget to activate even then. \n\nThe 5th dragon buff is crazy right now, but it's supposed to be crazy and you are in fact supposed to win the game off of it, so it's something up for discussion.\n\nBasically, I'm saying your changes make dragon a somewhat weak objective, as you could probably just give up 3 dragons and its nbd because... nothing is happening. ","replies":[{"poster":"My eeeeel","date":"2015-02-11T02:44:28.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I do agree third and fifth buff are quite noticable. But still, they only stand out because they are OP. The team who takes third dragon is usually the winning team and because the third buff gives team-wide ms boost, the losing team can no longer contest objectives or try their strategic movement to cut them off one by one because the dragon slayers are simply too fast to catch up and can choose fights easily if losing team position themselves far from their base. For the fourth buff, I don't feel much usefulness in this because usually the fourth buff is earned very late game and by the time any team got the fourth buff, pretty much any carries can clear the wave in few seconds that extra damage doesn't really matter, unless it is baron-empowered one - which I suggest an alternative to deal with the empowered minions with the first dragon buff which not only allow carries but tanks to deals with the massive minion waves.\n\nThe thing I don't like much about the fifth dragon buff is that it is just too strong that the defenders have no chance fighting against it and not fun to watch a team slaughtering the other by just brute strength. I still want it to remain a game-closer with overwhelming advantage, but not by just brute strength but clever outmaneuver using tons of utility it provides.\n\nI intentionally made so that the first and second dragon buffs are not much strong to minimize snowballing issue. Still, the first would be useful against late game when opposing team gets a baron buff and the second buff is small, but still noticeable to give the buff holders some advantage. You agreed there are people buying pots and stealth wards outside the laning phase and this can reward and encourage such \"intelligent\" behavior further.\n\nThe third dragon buff currently is just too OP. I get the Riot's intention to give the dragon slayers some advantage in terms of strategic movement by making a team faster than another but I feel it is healthier to give such advantage by other means, rather than movement because it can be frustrating for the losing team who cleverly out-position the winning team and make some chance to catch up, but fails because the out-positioned guy just escapes easily with faster movement speed.\n\nThe fourth buff gives nice CDR on active item, but my intention was more focused around the trinkets. Usually, you would only use those active items during the teamfights, so CDR doesn't matter much unless teamfight occurs frequently. Yet, often you find need to use red trinket and yellow trinket, especially high up in ELO. (At least in D4 elo and still I find more and more need to use red trinkets frequently.) I gave teams more vision through previous baron buffs. This would be the time to control and reduce such vision.\n\nCurrently the dragon is too much a strong objective without meaningful trade-offs could be done, which is forcing top laners to mandatory get teleport in competitive scene. Whoever gets the third stack pretty much wins the game. There has been no exception to this so far in LCS or LCK. I feel like it would be more fun to watch and play if dragon buff was an objective which is focused towards utility which could be done trade-off between extra global golds and vision from turrets. In the preseason patch, Riot explained their purpose in the dragon change by making dragon buff distinguishable from global gold. In order to achieve such goal, in my opinion, this would be the better way to make dragon stand out from the strength a team get from global gold.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My eeeeel","date":"2015-02-11T03:25:15.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note I didn't intend this alternative to be perfect.

If one team is stronger than the other after just getting the first buff, it is likely the team who gets the first dragon buff can win rest of the teamfight easily and snowball to win.\nRiot's intention to remove global gold reward on dragon was to remove such snowball, as the team with higher global gold is likely stronger in teamfight than the other. I think it would be better to give the early dragon slayer utility buff that could be very useful in early game, while being meaningful in lategame also.

Tbh, if I could see more then my opponent, I could by this logic attack them from fog of war and they cant even target me because they wouldn't be able to see me.

(The 5% MS is way more powerful than the other buffs except for the fifth). \nThe MS bonus increases frustrating situations. Say you're playing {{champion:53}} and you see opponents separate while your team grouped so you decided it is good time to initiate. Normally, you would be able to initiate easily but because of the movement speed buff, it is not easy to catch up with enemy and end up not being able to initiate quickly and your team get countered by bad positioned opponents who groups quickly with extra movement speed.\nOn the other hand, extra vision can reduce such situations. One case is when you're fighting against long lane pokers like {{champion:101}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:126}}{{champion:76}}  . If you see enemy champion using a spell, you would be less frustrated even if you fail to dodge because at least you had some chance to react. Yet, because these champions can just poke enemy down from outside the vision range, it is very frustrating for the opponents because they don't even get a chance to react if they haven't placed ward deep previously or there is a minion nearby to block (which doesn't even work against xerath or azir). Increased vision range would provide more chance against these poke champs to play dodge-or-land spell game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-02-10T21:21:04.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great post, noble goal, thorough discussion and good suggestions. +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-10T15:26:51.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first I thought Stacona made a new account to post dragon ideas on, but these are much better.
