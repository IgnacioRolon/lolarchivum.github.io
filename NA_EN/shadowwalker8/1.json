I rarely type in chat because I type really slowly and when i do say something it&#039;s rarely ever toxic or mean. It was just a day so I didn&#039;t care much however just today I was play Xerath and doing rather s**ty. I got stomped by a Syndra and was 0/5 at 10 minuets in, in the end I ended up coming back playing a lot more safe and we won. My score went from 0/5 to 6/5 and i was pretty happy about how the game turned out in the end. As the nexus was blowing up i guess i was &quot;BM&quot; for typing /d at the end to make my champion dance, and after i got out of game i was notified that i was banned for a week. #Triggered","replies":[]}
