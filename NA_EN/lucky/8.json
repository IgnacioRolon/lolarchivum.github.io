It had been in the middle of the bush the whole time, but was somehow not revealed by the pink ward my team put down.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-06-08T15:07:38.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love when I ward a bush, walk into it and find a pink ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wickedfates","date":"2015-06-08T14:23:53.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya it annoys me to no end as well....mouse arrow says its in bush, but its not.... haha! \n\nwasted ward","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-06-08T14:20:50.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a mastery point in the first line of utility tree that would like to meet you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lxst","date":"2015-06-08T06:39:39.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that ward used to be possible but now because of the SR update it's impossible UNLESS you use your trinket and have the mastery \"Scout\"","replies":[{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-06-08T09:42:17.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"doesnt work even with scout tried it doesnt work anymore the ward is in the bush but still novision in the bush i think its intended to kill the scarra ward.","replies":[{"poster":"Lxst","date":"2015-06-09T06:41:37.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are wrong... with the scout mastery you don't even have to try to get it in there the range of your trinket ward IS LITERALLY big enough to reach the bush","replies":[{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-06-09T22:19:30.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tried it doesnt work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2015-06-08T11:36:54.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But...
