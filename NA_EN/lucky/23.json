A lot of people are falling into the \"riot doesn't care\" mentality out here, which is just as poisonous as it is untrue.\n\nI want to highlight just how bad it is that there is a boards feedback megathread without red responses. For a while mods were actively closing even constructive posts to send them to post in it.  Seriously bad PR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hav0kwashere","date":"2014-10-10T02:55:15.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"> Yah\n\nActually, no you guys don't.
