They also kill minions REALLY fast and force the wave HEAVILY in your favor. The only time promoting a cannon is bad is if it takes too much minion aggro before it gets to a turret, cause if you got a ton of things blasting your cannon, then its still gonna die anyway while only killing 1 or 2 minions. Best way to avoid this is by upgrading them before they get into fights with the enemy wave.\n\nSource? I build it when I support now.

They can kill 1 tower at most before the enemy team puts them down. The super caster *might* live longer, but he pushes the wave slower, kill the tower slower and as said, once the enemy team noticed the super, they'll take them down, if they haven't reach the tower by then, 100% useless. The cannon may die faster, but he WILL reach the tower faster and higher chance to do some real damages before getting caught.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-07-11T16:28:00.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the cannon has around the same damage as the caster and same tankyness as the meele only slightly more and because it pushes faster it wount survive a tower unless the tower  was already under half hp  because it will be the only cannon minion around and be the garenteed second target after the first meele minion that walks into tower range","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-07-11T05:19:57.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turrets ALWAYS prioritize promoted minions.
