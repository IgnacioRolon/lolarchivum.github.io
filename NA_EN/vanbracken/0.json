When you join a game and you&#039;re picking your queue (I only play ARAM), you get the art for the main ARAM screen.  This is the only time you see it.  Then you click on Howling Abyss and you get different art.  \r\n\r\nI just wanted to say that I think about that piece of art, and I know someone spent a long time making it, and it&#039;s cool, and we never really look at it and the interface has us just click past it.  Well, Mr. Mystery Artist Who Painted It, I wanted to throw out a message from the void saying we saw it, and it&#039;s cool.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the creativity :) carry on","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-06-27T00:23:51.143+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really do love when they add these bits of art. I've always thought the best way to help people understand what a world is like is to show some of the scenery. Take the recent Shurima one for instance:\n \n https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/shurima-2016/en_US/c9086fcc7c767c891424c11682e31d1a7635f569/assets/img/shurima/novela-backdrop.jpg\n\nThis tells you much more about what the main city of Shurima is like more than what words could do with something like \"a giant city emerging from the dessert with a giant sun disc floating over the main palace, People flocking to the city in droves\".","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2016-06-27T18:42:09.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm... tasty sweet sand, I always have a bowl of sand from the **Desert** for **Dessert**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot iZac","date":"2016-06-27T06:31:10.527+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always loved that piece. If you haven't already I'd recommend checking out our League Screensaver app. It has a bunch of awesome illustrations in there that you don't see in your day to day league. I love the runeterra section.","replies":[]}]}
