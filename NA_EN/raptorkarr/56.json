Literally the first 3 where just the begining of the story in the grand scheme of things. either way its understandable the animation style seems off at first, i was that way, but it gets its own charm the more you watch it, as well as gets a lot more refined as it goes on and even changes a ton in volume 4.\n\neither way, alot of it is interesting and likable characters.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-12-25T20:58:37.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Screw plot! where's the part with the explosions!?**","replies":[{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-12-25T21:50:24.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about plot... **AND EXPLOSIONS**","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-12-26T00:19:41.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**As long as it's got plenty of explosions and guns, I'M HAPPY!!!**","replies":[{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-12-26T02:42:21.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a saying about RWBY that rings true about 90 percent of things...\n\n\"Its also a Gun\"","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-12-26T05:20:55.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...\n\nWhere do I sign up?","replies":[{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-12-26T07:53:42.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, You could watch it at Roosterteeth's site, its also on thier youtube channel (but a week behind) and I think its now on Crunchyroll...

Also the way they talk to each other... Watching the first episode I think and the yellow girl attack the dude in the club, after beating up the guys he comes back with a rocket launcher and says, \"I'm going to make you pay.\" and the fires. It just feel too, generic? I don't know the right word to describe it. Listening to them is like listening to one of those old 80s fighting game where the two guys will exchange some dumb lines then fight. I'm sure it is really good, but I am too used to anime to be able to watch it.
