He was before together with his man. Could have maybe be done with Lbs tricks. But could have be done by a skilled assassin to. And the principle of strength \"guile\" could be also the part of a skilled assassin. That Katarinas story is no not related to the others while the others are related, yea that katas story jsut ends so rush, is kinda suspicious.\n\nNot gonna say the faceless is Kata, still high chance that Lb it is.\nWhat is definetly sure is that LB is a rival to Swain and wants him dead, but it is not sure if the faceless is this character. Cause Katarina as the Faceless with her abilitys to assinate could probably easy kill swain (or not, depends on the might of the demon adn if kata nows that swain has this power). But yea, the faceless hasn't shown attempts to overthrow Swain. Just that a pale woman (leblanc) exists whow ants that.So there is a little chance that the faceless isn't Leblanc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-02-05T20:10:12.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Shantzilla,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=pJaKURhH,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-02-05T19:51:09.624+0000)\n>\n> Hey man, going to copy my response from the main Noxus thread:\n> \n> &quot;We&#x27;re actually going to have more time with Noxus throughout the year as we do more faction updates moving forward.
