When implementing that new system someone forgot that Shyvana's dragon form needed to be flagged as melee separately from her human form, hence this bug.","replies":[{"poster":"RaptorKarr","date":"2015-11-12T06:09:03.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, makes sense, so what does that mean for Champions like Elise who is Melee when in Spider form?

Looking through the files it looks like Gnar, Elise, Jayce, Kayle all got flagged as having the appropriate attack type depending on their form. I'm guessing whoever did the update just forgot Shyvana needed to be tagged as melee in both forms, not just human.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-11-12T06:49:04.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean that by default she was tagged as ranged or that she could use both Runaan's and Hydra?","replies":[{"poster":"Yamidamian","date":"2015-11-12T21:44:34.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the problem she was tagged as neither (at least in part). Presumably, the same bug would have occurred for Runaan's, because the game can't find which version of the item (the melee or range) to give her when she buys it. That simply wasn't the the reported one because not many people buy a hurrican for shyv.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raiku Kawisa","date":"2015-11-12T21:07:06.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like it should be a simple fix, how long will it take to get her back up and running?
