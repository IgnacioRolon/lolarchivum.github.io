He doesn’t want to eke out a last minute victory. Timmy wants to smash his opponents. He likes his cards to be impressive, and he enjoys playing big creatures and big spells.\n\n>Timmy likes to win big. He doesn’t want to eke out a last minute victory. Timmy wants to smash his opponents. He likes his cards to be impressive, and he enjoys playing big creatures and big spells.\n\n>Timmy cares more about the quality of his win than the quantity of his wins. For example, Timmy sits down and plays ten games. He only wins three games out of ten but the three he wins, he dominates his opponent. Timmy had fun. Timmy walks away happy.\n\nA Johnny Player:\n>Johnny is the creative gamer to whom Magic is a form of self-expression. Johnny likes to win, but he wants to win with style. It’s very important to Johnny that he win on his own terms. As such, it’s important to Johnny that he’s using his own deck. Playing Magic is an opportunity for Johnny to show off his creativity.\n\n>Johnny likes a challenge. Johnny enjoys winning with cards that no one else wants to use. He likes making decks that win in innovative ways. What sets Johnny apart from the other profiles is that Johnny enjoys deckbuilding as much as (or more than) he enjoys playing. Johnny loves the cool interactions of the cards. He loves combo decks. Johnny is happiest when he’s exploring uncharted territory.\n\n>Like Timmy, Johnny cares more about the quality of his wins than the quantity. For example, let's say Johnny builds a new deck that has a neat but difficult way to win. He plays ten games and manages to get his deck to do its thing… once. Johnny walks away happy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zerana","date":"2015-11-21T17:32:19.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=5U8fz96t,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-21T08:36:06.007+0000)\n>\n> Only unfun scum play control decks.\n> \n> Remove blue.\n\nLOL I'm making a standard land destruction deck with pyromancers goggles in the mix.\n\nWeep","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2015-11-21T22:35:14.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir are the most hated type of MTG player...
