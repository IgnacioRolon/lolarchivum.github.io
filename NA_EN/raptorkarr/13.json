I mentioned she based after a trade, and I pinged MIA.... \"THEN YOU SHOULD BE FOLLOWING HER\" .... follow her back to base?  Unwarded bot lane dies... suddenly mids fault.  She proceeded to do this every time either myself or her was out of lane, she like a good laner would shove, or I would shove and then aid other lanes... at the end of the game our bot lane support \"Report Zed feeder\"... Apparently my laner roaming and me not guessing which way they are going to go meant I was \"feeding\".","replies":[{"poster":"Epic Murph","date":"2016-01-08T23:33:05.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I made a habit of putting my cursor on top of my teammates whenever I ping.
