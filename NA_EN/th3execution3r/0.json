Your best bet is to keep waiting and allowing the patcher to finish.  Closing it can restart the process over again.  If you receive an error after 33%, go through our [connection issues ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)guide to establish a connection and finish up the download.
