Instant gibing a juggernaut/fighter isn't something a ADC should be good at. Udyr is very bad it certain aspects of the game like teamfighting which Vayne is very strong at. It's about balance and trade offs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"100 Girlfriends","date":"2019-03-05T07:32:18.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, with only 2 items (Rageblade+Blade of Ruined King) and that crazy 1-2 seconds cd on Q, Vayne right now (current patch: 9.4) is broken in mid-game team fight (around 20 minutes into the game). No matter how she falls behind in laning phase, she comes back fed either by continuing farming after 14 mins or by winning one single team fight. I couldn't agree more with \"the semi-permanent stealth doesn't provide enough window to attack her\" and sometimes she went into stealth right before you can land any AA or abilities.\n\nIn the strongest possible terms, I sincerely urge Riot to reconsider and to nerf Vayne ASAP. Otherwise, I will have to ban her every single game. Plus, the firecracker skin has been out for long enough, it is time to do some reasonable balance fix.","replies":[]}]}
