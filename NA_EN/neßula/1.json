I one tricked her to masters (0LP) recently so I do have at least SOME credibility. So, I want to suggest two things (one small one big) that can make her more balanced.\r\n\r\nThe first, smaller change, I wanted to suggest is maybe tacking up her R cooldown by around 1 to 2.5 seconds late game. She can spam her damage too much and it's too safe, and too often. I think this, instead of gutting her damage, is a good alternative.\r\n\r\nHowever, the big change I want to do is with her W minion drops (I will refer to these as balloons.) I think that the fact that her minion RNG can make or break a lane for you is very unhealthy for the game. I wanted to suggest maybe having her W's only spawn on cannon waves (maybe cannon minions only), but having them spawn on every cannon wave. So basically, whenever a cannon comes into your lane you can get a drop every time. This doesn't actually change her drop rate that much. Every 3 waves, which is every time a cannon wave spawns, is not unreasonable to ask for. A lot of the time this happens anyways, but sometimes she gets none for a long time, which is unfair to the Zoe player to be dictated by RNG, and sometimes she gets a ton early game, which is unfair to the opponent. Doing this will make her a lot less RNG reliant in lane, and make sure that neither she nor her opponent feels cheated in some way. It makes her much more consistent. I also suggest that maybe you should be able to see what drop you are going to get from the balloon before you kill it, and your opponent should be able to see it, too. That way, neither of you are surprised and you can plan out how you are going to counter this drop as the opponent, while Zoe can plan out how she is going to use it well before it actually happens. Lastly, her balloon drops could also be nerfed to where they last not quite as long, and so she is forced to either use or lose them quicker. This gives her less of a window to use the item or spell, and her opponent a lot more counterplay, and making waiting it out a viable option. However, this change should not nerf her spells and items from champion duration. I believe that her W RNG is the only thing that needs change, and because the minion drops are RNG, they should last not as long, but champion drops, because they aren't RNG, should stay the same.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post but I thought it could be cool to share some of my thoughts and go in depth as to what could happen to her and why. I think this would make her less frustrating to fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-04-24T18:29:33.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The canon 'balloon\" balloon drop would help the RNG early game but would be a huge buff late game since Canons spawn in every wave after... was it 15 minutes now?

I thought it was 2 later, then 1 around 30. I may be wrong, I would have to check that. However, usually at late game they're spawning close to every wave anyways, the spawn rate increases a lot the later the game goes. I do agree it would be a buff late game, so maybe there could be a weird twist with that after cannon waves start to spawn every wave, change the spawn rates back to how it is now. Thanks for pointing that out.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-04-24T19:07:32.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-For the first 20 minutes, 1 Siege minion is spawned every three minion waves between the melee and ranged minions. After 20 minutes, Siege minions spawn once every 2 waves and from the 35th minute onward, Siege minions spawn every wave to accelerate the game pace by making pushing easier.\n\nI was a bit off. \nI knew it was upgraded around 20 (idk what made me think 15 tbh just felt that way I guess) and 35 is SUPER late game for the every wave thing... hmn \n\nThat kinda complicates things a little but I like the direction if it gets more refined (not like i have the power to influence change one way or the other anyway)","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2019-04-24T19:12:15.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think that if at 35 minutes once every wave, I think that's perfectly fine... 35 is kinda late. Might be up for debate tho. I think once per 2 waves for the first 35 minutes, if anything is a downgrade, which either way is fine with me. She's too strong, she needs some sort of downgrade. I think that this is a good step to go towards.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-04-24T19:46:28.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well most games end at 28 minutes.\nWas 26 before the crit item changes, so 35 minutes is SUPER late game.\nLate game is pretty  much 22 minutes now and most games end around 3 items... \n\nBut that's kind of another discussion lol.\n\nTbh I preferred his dmg being more focused around W (forcing her to use her spell and item, and more windows of opportunity to play against)\n\nI DONT like the super short E CD and sets up the super short CD Q nuke, personally.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-04-24T18:05:10.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The W change seems totally reasonable. Cannons are supposed to be mini-objectives in lane that you and your opponent are trying to keep from each other. You're already doing that, and a cannon is way easier to defend than the random mage minion that Zoe can blow up from a mile away. \n\nI would even go as far as to alter her spell drop tables based on W rank, so early on, she doesn't get any spells that can win lane for her, like Redemption or Ignite. She'd only get defensive ones like Cleanse, Barrier, etc., and then later she'd get the more aggressive, playmaking ones. \n\nEither that, or make it so that minions don't drop full summoners at all, and instead drop their own, smaller versions of spells, kinda like Kleptomancy and its mini-potions. A mini-Heal, mini-Clarity, mini-Ignite, maybe even a free ward or something. The fact that she gets fully-fledged summoner spells for free off a minion feels unfair to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2019-04-24T18:08:10.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only problem with that is that she wants to max W last. I will say that redemption healing is not of an actual redemption, but I do agree it's probably the best drop she can get next to protobelt. I think making the drops more telegraphed and consistent is a fair way to balance it, as well as make her not able to hold them as long, so her opponent can shove out the wave and reset. By the time that happens it will be gone (or almost), with what I'm suggesting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hi lm Zoe","date":"2019-04-25T06:16:37.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are a traitor.","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2019-04-26T15:19:46.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Literal IRL Tree","date":"2019-04-24T20:18:02.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just remove her Q range bonus while moving forward and ulting ;)","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2019-04-24T20:21:02.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems fair.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VolatileAkali","date":"2019-04-24T17:58:31.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely hate that she gets barrier. heal and I can't fight her for a long time.
