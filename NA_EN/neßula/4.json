But today when playing Zed, it did not say \"unseen\" or \"spotted\" when pinging it. I hate it when they don't give context why they do things or even say that they do.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2020-02-17T19:51:53.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"They removed it when Duskblade no longer shows wards.... You know, during preseason? When they put that passive on an entire new item?{{item:3179}} The umbral glaive?\n\nI hate it when people don't actually research things and just say \"WAHHH THEY CHANGED SOMETHING AND I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION AND SO NOW I'M BLAMING THEM WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GAVE CONTEXT\"","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2020-02-17T19:54:54.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am almost positive that it did still have that feature after umbral glaive. You are just flat out wrong. The item still shows if you are on vision or not, it just can't reveal the wards. Thus there is no reason for it to have been removed. It still did its function. I am almost 100% sure that it still was able to be pinged after the revealing wards passive got removed. So yeah, suck my dick.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2020-02-17T20:07:00.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that feature got removed with the making of umbral glaive, and lost the capability to ping as well, as they don't want an item that can show where wards are without actually revealing them AS THEY STATED WHEN THEY REMOVED IT.","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2020-02-17T20:47:31.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It literally shows if you're spotted. I played a lot of Zed, building duskblade, and it definitely was there during patch 10.1, which umbral glaive was a PART OF. I know for a fact that you COULD PING IT. It doesn't matter if you can't sweep the wards. It still is an item that lets you know if you're spotted or not, so the fact that the ability to ping it was removed makes no sense. And again, I know that during season 10 it was there, at least for a little bit. If old duskblades' passive was down, then you still could ping it. That's just how it works. Think of current duskblade like old duskblade with passive down. You still should be able to ping it, because you can see them anyways. You simply just have to type it out. Either way, even if I am wrong, which I am almost certain I'm not, it still doesn't make sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Degnisyllort","date":"2020-02-17T20:12:37.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A long time ago?
