Sometimes when people grief me or type shit to me I can't control myself and type back. And that is 100% deserved. I get that. But, how in the hell is typing so much more punishable than griefing? It makes no sense to me. You can just mute me and my typing, but I can't mute you and ruining my game. The same goes to AFKing. If you go 0/3 and then AFK, that's not lag, that is ragequitting. And you should be punished. Or if you specifically type something saying you are not trying, going to AFK, etc., then that should be a RED FLAG AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED. But no. If I flame a griefer, I am 100 times more likely to get punished than they are. And obviously flaming is bad. I'm not playing the victim here. But it needs to be looked further into, these things. People literally just admit they aren't trying and it does not matter. Almost always, nothing happens to them.\n\nEdit: I also want to add that everybody knows that this is how it works. If you ever ask a streamer, they will 100% agree with you if you said that if you don't type, you can do anything you want and not get banned. This is a widely known thing that people abuse and it's ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-12-28T21:13:34.354+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"INT = to running it down mid\n\nnot having a bad game there is a big difference but people seem to think they are one in the same","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-28T21:15:16.134+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"People use the term int even if you miss cs or your ult.

He then got a bugsplat and couldn’t reconnect to the game at all even though he kept trying until it ended.\n\nYes, I know this is the fact because I was sitting right next to him (well, same room different desk) playing on my laptop while he was on his desktop. But you’re saying the fact he dc after going 0/4 instantly means he deserves a severe punishment for rage quitting?\n\nPoint being is that very rarely is this so cut and dry. Sure, in many cases someone disconnecting after going 0/4 is going to be a rage quit.... but how do you confirm that and avoid punishing innocent players like my friend?\n\nPlayers who ragequit multiple games and show a pattern of it that proves beyond reasonable doubt that they are intentionally AFKing do get punished.

Again, not to knock them or you, because I didn't say it outright, but high elo knows about this as a whole. It's the same thing with wintraders, which was a MASSIVE problem at the end of the season for people trying to get challenger in the last few days, or whatever you wanted. As long as you don't type nothing will happen. This would not be experienced in the elo that these players you linked me are in.\n\nEdit: For the last one, I also looked at the EUW player who literally ran it down- that is not what I'm talking about. Not everything is that obvious. I am talking about soft inting. Not running it down. Obviously people know that if you literally run it down with the trademark \"inting\" (Ghost cleanse nunu with mobis) then you are going to get banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yukata","date":"2019-12-29T21:30:26.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It won’t ever be because riot just wants to create a toxic community","replies":[]},{"poster":"Greenlightx","date":"2019-12-28T21:26:11.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I played 3 games yesterday on this account, lost 2 because both had an afk, the cati and tris, I think leaving the game without a legitimate reason \"like internet problems or lights go out or pc failure\" should get a ban, especially if repeated many times","replies":[]}]}
