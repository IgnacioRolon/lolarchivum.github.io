All fine and dandy. I lost 8 in a row, dropping around 100-150 LP, and then... the MMR gods have shunned me. I started gaining 15 and 14, losing 16. For 2 and a half months. I have maintained 300LP GM for awhile, and I am going on a winstreak now (won 8 out of my last 10 games)... And now I am gaining 13? Riot please just have mercy on me and let me climb.","replies":[]}
