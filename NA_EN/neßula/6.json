How is it fair that I play 3 games today, and the enemy team in total has had 0 autofills, while my teams on average have had 2? How is that at all balanced? I lose 3 games in a row because of autofilled players. I literally just played a game that had 3 fucking players off role while the enemy team has had 0. And it doesn't even make sense half the time. A lot of the time it fills players for NO REASON! Like one of my games, we have a top lane main and 2 adc mains, but it autofilled one of our adc's to top and our top player to jungle???? Fix this bullshit for season 10 PLEASE","replies":[{"poster":"Tedbear","date":"2019-11-06T01:44:34.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those could've been the laner's secondary roles","replies":[{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2019-11-06T02:14:23.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if they were, why is it fair that 5 people get their primary roles vs 3 people not?

Almost any challenger player would rather have 20 minute queue times than unfair autofill. It should NOT be 3 autofills to 0.  Not to flex my rank or anything but literally it is just pathetic to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Madorbaul","date":"2019-11-06T01:33:47.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to the Rito gods you have to suck it up and get good. xD","replies":[]}]}
