I will have my normal ping, standard, around 40ms. Then at some random time in the game, most recently around 12 pings, it just randomly spikes to 250. It consistently stays around 250, fluctuating between 200-300, for the rest of the game. I tried reconnecting twice and it didn't work. As soon as the games end, the ping goes back to normal if I test it in a custom, back to around 40. I tested my internet speed, and it was completely normal throughout these ping rises. It does stay for the entire game until the very end, starting at a random time. It has happened 3 times.","replies":[{"poster":"Styx","date":"2020-01-14T00:47:37.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi NEBULA, \n\nThat's incredibly frustrating, but I'll do what I can to help. \n\nWould you please upload your network logs [here](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and get back to me with your results?
