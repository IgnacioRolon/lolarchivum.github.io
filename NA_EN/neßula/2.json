Here's what I would personally define them as:\r\n\r\nThe flame would be a short burst, like if someone was super tilted and just bursted out something like \"BETTER PLAYER WINS XDDDD GET CANCER DIE\", or something really bad like that, but is quiet the rest of the game.\r\n\r\nThe harassment would be over the  course of the game, constantly doing medium level bm'ing in all chat like \"gj\" when you die, \"you're so shit\" in all chat, \"d4 negative wr\", literally just harassing this person the entire game.\r\n\r\nWhich is worse in your eyes?","replies":[{"poster":"Ahrimans Sin","date":"2019-09-02T01:19:35.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would never notice the diffrence.

((I did accept both to confirm they were both him still)) In the end I just ended up blocking those profiles and went about my day. Tbh I tend to think it's not worth my time to report those guys in detail because it seems they're never dealt with properly. :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jonesybones","date":"2019-09-01T20:49:35.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Neither.
