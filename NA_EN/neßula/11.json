The only comments I got on my post were things saying oh yeah that sounds decent, reasonable, but it got 3 downvotes with no context. Thus, this idea was created. Because in order to get on top of that board, you simply have to complain. This is why that this post is also getting downvoted lol. I'm not just complaining about things everyone hates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NEßULA","date":"2019-04-28T20:38:48.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes I used powerpoint shut up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-04-28T21:02:50.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I've given a solution - make the CD on Vayne's Q higher, and take the bonus CDR off her ult.
