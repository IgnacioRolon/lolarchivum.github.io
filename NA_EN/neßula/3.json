Every source, from mobafire to gamepedia to lolwiki all say 600, but it isn't. I was playing Zoe, and her auto range is 550. Ignite showed that it was slightly smaller than her auto range, making me think 525 or 500. I actually missed a kill from it, because I tried to walk up to someone, auto ignite them, then run, and it didn't proc because it is too short. It's really weird that nowhere I've searched is correct, lol.","replies":[]}
