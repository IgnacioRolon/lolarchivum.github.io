Our amumu connected, took one step out of the fountain and dced the rest of the game. Problem is we weren't allowed to remake because he took a step out of the fountain and the game counted him as here. That is not fair to us Riot and you owe me and my team with the exception of amumu LP back. This is fucking stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T22:20:08.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The /Remake system only triggers if a player is marked as *inactive* for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. If this didn't happen, a remake would not be available.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot edit or modify your LP in any way. The system is designed this way to prevent abuse of the system. I encourage you to check out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for complete details on the system.

It said he dced and he stayed dced until the 6 minute mark. came back for 1 minute and then was gone the rest of the time. That is a fucking remake if I've ever seen one. You should give my team back it's LP because that's not fair that your system doesn't recognize a guy that's dc for more than 90 seconds as you put it.","replies":[]}]}]}
