It is an attempt to foster legitimate discussion and juxtaposition between two champions. \r\n\r\nI recently introduced a new friend into league, and he took an instant liking to the look and feel of Talon (He&#039;s new to LoL, not the MOBA genre as a whole). As someone who enjoys the champion, I encouraged him to play a few games, but he never quite seemed to click with Talon mechanically. He asked if there were any other champs who &quot;did the same thing, but different?&quot; As I&#039;m sure many of you would in the same situation, I immediately thought of Zed. After I explained Zed&#039;s abilities and play-style, and of course showed him some of Faker&#039;s sheer insanity on the champion, he posed an interesting question to me. \r\n\r\nWhy pick Talon?\r\n\r\nAt first I was a bit taken aback. Sure, the two rogue/ninja-esque characters were similar, but they have a multitude of differences. I tried to defend Talon out of general positive regard for our favorite cloak-and-dagger hero, but found myself quickly losing justifiable arguments. \r\n\r\nMobility? Zed outshines Talon in everything but a straight out sprint, and while his non-ultimate gap closer is not targeted, it does allow him to jump walls and have a handy escape, while Talon&#039;s mobility is only able to engage. Obviously Zed seems to be the more effective in-and-out Assassin, offering a significantly higher survival opportunity than Talon.\r\n\r\nDamage? Zed boasts the highest realistic AD in the game (leaving out infinite farm Atma&#039;s Sion and temporary AD boost Malphite), has a built-in high damage passive, and a kit that scales extremely well with damage. This isn&#039;t to say that Talon&#039;s kit is weak, simply that in a pure numbers game, Zed outshines Talon. This is offset by the reliability of Talon&#039;s damage somewhat. To really fill Zed&#039;s potential requires the use of both a clone (or two) and the ability to land skill-shots, while Talon has a much simpler &quot;face-roll&quot; type combo which can be used effectively at melee range. Even this is subject to a caveat though when Zed&#039;s ult is considered, allowing an all but Garen-teed kill on any target with less than 250 (arbitrarily picked high-value number)armor. Talon does offer &quot;more&quot; AOE damage in a team fight. I say &quot;more&quot; because in my experience, when late game rolls around, shuriken flying about from three clones off of a 400 AD base tend to rip teams apart regardless. \r\n\r\nZed also edges out Talon in the lane, sporting energy instead of mana, which Talon has historically struggled with, and utilizing his passive to secure some of the easiest last hitting in the game. \r\n\r\nThere are of course other considerations to these champions, but seeing as they both fill the assassin role I thought these to be the most relevant. Zed seems to be a more reliable champion to fill the assassin role than Talon in almost every way, with stronger mobility, damage, and lane presence.  Now I&#039;ll be the first to admit that I do not play Zed as often as I probably should to justify this post, and I&#039;ve not even glanced at win/pick/ban rates for the two, because that&#039;s not what I&#039;m really asking. What I want to know is;\r\n**\r\nWhy pick Talon? **","replies":[{"poster":"ImFlutterShy","date":"2015-03-31T14:49:04.053+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because talon does a lot more AoE damage?","replies":[{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-03-31T15:02:29.934+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":13,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImFlutterShy,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=opTGZIhX,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-31T14:49:04.053+0000)\n>\n> Because talon does a lot more AoE damage?\n\nnot really see zed q and his e","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-03-31T16:18:55.203+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Neither of those really have the AoE potential of Talon's W and R.

Basically Talon is to Zed what Diana is to Katarina. His damage is not tied to anything that has a split-second delay. \n\n2) Slightly less predictable escape. Zeds shadows gives you a way to predict where he might go, the stealth is a little more free-form in where you can go especially combined with cutthroat or flash, etc. \n\n3) AOEs.

Heavy AD teams, especially AOE focused ones (Hello Wukong) are probably a better fit for Talon than Zed. Not sure I agree with the roam.

His spells are either targeted or have a pretty huge AoE that makes them difficult to miss.\n\nZed isn't really that reliable, there are a lot more things that can (and will; even Faker messes up on Zed) go wrong when going in on a target as Zed (Real talk: there is literally a glowing red \"X\" on the screen where Zed is going to end up after he ults). Zed has more flexibility in his kit, but at his core he's still an assassin, and an assassin that can't kill their target is basically useless. Killing people as Talon is much more reliable.\n\nIf your friend is having trouble with Talon's mechanics, the last champion I'd suggest they try out is Zed, honestly (I agree with you that they're similar, at least in feel/character, but Zed is far more mechanically demanding to play at even a remotely competent level). Maybe let them try out Master Yi, Wukong, Xin Zhao, or Pantheon; they're also pretty straightforward, albeit they typically don't do the same amount of single target damage (especially if you're building them more bruiser).","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodofMountainDew","date":"2015-03-31T17:26:40.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest thing that sets them apart is that Talon is far deadlier when his ult is down.

Essentially, does Talon have qualities or attributes that make him an attractive alternative choice to Zed, or does he need to be changed either mechanically (reworked), or numerically (buffed)?
