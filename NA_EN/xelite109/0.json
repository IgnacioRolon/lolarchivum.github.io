For this example think of a  champion who relies heavily on dash based abilities such as kayn or riven. when fighting champions like singe or cass who have these exceedingly long grounding abilities, you&#039;ll find yourself unable to ever gap close and finish them off. If placed in a scenario where you&#039;ve shaved them down low enough to kill and want to go in to punish them for over extending,  even though they are low should have been punished for going into your range a well placed miasma or adhesive easily locks up your entire kit making you unable to flash in or away from the enemy  and because the slow on these abilities is so strong it gives them time to get so much free damage and a potential kill on you for what should have been you punishing them for over extending but even more difficult is the movement speed buff they gain during this which makes catching them by default extremely challenging and allows them to snow ball the game in their favor (in singes case what makes him so strong is his ability to just run with the late game no matter how well you dealt with him early.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam fights:\r\n\r\n In team fights who ever can pick out an enemy with as little casualties as possible wins the game and both do a exceedingly good job at that. If your team is  hit by a miasma it is basically a massive suppress on a your team which means the enemy team will be able to unload their kits on your team and because your all locked out from vital sums and abilities your chances of fighting back become close to impossible. If each person on your team loses 1 ability and sum that means that their team not only gains 5 extra abilities on you but your team loses more then 4k-9k worth of damage that could have been used on the enemy and because most characters only last for a second in late game team fights its basically gg.\r\n\r\nThoughts?:\r\nSo anyone got an opinion on this matter cause I personally feel this portion of their kits is simply too strong with very little counterplay and given their high play rates and wins might need to be tweaked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ka√¨ju","date":"2018-03-19T23:25:09.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low pick rate for Singed means only Singed players use him. Because of the low pick rate enemies don't know how to beat him and due to this he has an inflated win rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I may afk","date":"2018-03-19T22:44:51.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cassiopeia has had grounding for a long time and just sat at a 43% winrate for months during preseason. There are literally so many ways to outplay Miasma like the fact that it has a minimum cast range. \n\n\nHer winrate isn't 55% it's like 50-51% and she is finally decent for the first time in over a year. Miasma is literally her only defense outside of her ultimate which is also telegraphed and easily outplayed. Cassiopeia has also never had a high playrate this has to be a shit post.

I just feel that as a burst mage she should do a shit ton of damage  but shouldn't have such a hard lockdown spell so instead of riot dealing with her numbers they may need to work on what miasma could shut down. the ability severally limits a lot of counterplay when hit and having a range of 800 for makes it rather safe and very punishing .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nut on my Butt","date":"2018-03-19T23:09:51.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of Cass, {{item:3040}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-19T22:40:00.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was expecting a meme. this is OK.","replies":[]}]}
