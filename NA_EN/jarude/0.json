A reinstall won't really resolve this if the issue is with your network and not game files.  You should go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve anything that might block access to our service as well as  any degradation that may fail to transition you from one service to another.
