If you're on an AMD, we have a sticky post regarding an issue where recent drivers are causing this crash.  Rolling back to a [previous driver ](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064)has been known to fix this.  We've found that turning on [AMD GPU Scaling ](http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/UnableToSetGPUScaling.aspx)can act as a workaround for some players in the meantime.  Let me know if that's the case for you.","replies":[]}]}
