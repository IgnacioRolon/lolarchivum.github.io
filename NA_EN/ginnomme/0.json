I enjoy adcs but they start out so slow, so I like taking a bonus of 15+ attack speed with me in my runes","replies":[{"poster":"Muz√©t","date":"2017-09-27T17:19:52.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact if you pick the Precision Tree as MT you'll have +12%/ 18% AS according to what tree you pick as secondary.","replies":[]}]}]}
