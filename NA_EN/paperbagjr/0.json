Chest opening.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","embed":{"description":"Opening some dank chests for some dank loot","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdjUpEWyCU","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HVdjUpEWyCU/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey guys, since the hextech chests have released I have opened ~40 chests, and I was wondering if anyone else though that the gemstone drop rate was a bit low? I opened these 40 chests trying to get some gemstones for the new Annie skin and I have only gotten 1 gemstone out of the 40. I was thinking that this rate was a pretty low. I know that my sample size isnt the biggest to jump to conclusions, but if the drop rate is really 1/40 (or even lower) then that would take a ridiculous amount of time for someone to obtain this new skin. Lets do some math.\r\n\r\nWithout spending any money on chests, you can get 1 chest per week, or 4 per month. it would take 10 months to get the same amount of chests that I have opened, assuming that you play every week to get your chest. so it would take 10 months per gemstone, and it takes 10 gemstones to craft this skin. So, going off of my math and luck, it would take 100 months, or a little over 8 years, to get the amount of chests needed for the hextech annie skin, without spending any money. \r\n\r\nnow lets say that you wanted to dump your wallet into these chests until you got this skin. for $20 you can get about 30 chests/keys. if it takes 400 chests to get the skin, then you would need to pay $266 to purchase the chests needed for the skin. now you would have alot of other skins to add to your collection along the way, but this seems a little ridiculous for a single skin. That would make this the second most expensive skin, right under Pax TF.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else think that riot should make these gemstones more common?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Taric the Gay","date":"2016-03-18T10:39:01.508+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gems are truly outrageous.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/pdolua802d6.png","replies":[{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2016-07-07T22:02:23.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Taric the Gay,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=8dI3ExxW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-18T10:39:01.508+0000)\n>\n> Gems are truly outrageous.\n\nI love how this is the very first comment to the thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-08-07T19:34:33.946+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, here's the thing.\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nHow would making Gems more common give Riot more money?","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-06-10T18:23:59.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if they made them more common, it might tempt more people to spend money on chests. So the argument goes.\n\nI have no doubt that they have talked at length, internally, about that drop rate. And I'm sure there is a lot of marketing research for \"free-to-play\" game economies regarding how to most optimally monetize these things.\n\nI think Riot has a lot of respect for its players. I think they want to give us content that we are happy to purchase. BUT, they also know the realities of the free-to-play market, and they can't keep making this game if they give away too much for free. Players always want more free stuff, but we have to be willing to pay for things if we want Riot to keep making money. That's a big issue here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niceger","date":"2016-04-29T07:17:15.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do believe they need to be more common.

Most of the Legacy skins come out of the vault every once in a while so they arent too rare. I think that hextech annie is a good addition. The skin is truely rare and still obtainable.\n\n{{champion:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Crazy guy","date":"2017-02-05T20:14:54.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got a gemstone from a free hex tech box lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Materisna","date":"2016-07-07T21:55:11.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes now in a few years you will litterally have 20 of these \"gemstone skins\"\nSo i think they should make them more common if they are gonna make new skins for them\n\nP.S.
