We would likely start seeing tactics where a person who is already behind start mindlessly pushing with the knowledge that even if someone comes to kill them the enemy would gain very little. Making pushing always the best option.\n\nThe issue is, no matter what sort of preventive measure you try to make it's going to be something that's easy to bypass by someone who is trying to bypass it. It will succeed mostly in just making things worse for players that legitimately have a poor game or just change the game balance.","replies":[]}]}
