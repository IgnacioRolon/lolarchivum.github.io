Originally, we erred on the side of caution with the pattern because Braum was a new champ and there were concerns that a different design could cause confusion during gameplay. Now that he’s been around for a while, we’re confident that adding this in won’t cause any problems.\r\n\r\nPlus, it looks cool as hell.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the feedback on this!","replies":[{"poster":"The Storm Dragon","date":"2014-12-10T19:55:13.231+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for adding it back in.
