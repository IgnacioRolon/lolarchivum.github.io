Do i need to have dawnbringer riven for the emote or can it work on other champs? I saw a thread saying that it should work with any champion but the emote isnt showing when I press ctrl + 6. All that shows up is the mastery emote. I also tried a champion that I didnt have a mastery with and it still didnt show up. Any ideas? {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-30T16:27:56.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What game mode are you trying to use the emote?
