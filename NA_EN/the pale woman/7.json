The &#039;Original&#039; preview for Chroma Packs looks a lot smoother and nicer then what we actually get in game. If you need confirmation that the preview is different than the live version look at the pant leg: the preview only has 3 swirls while the current model has many more, the gloves also have an strap in the preview and none in game, the new one has no buttons while the current has buttons on the sleeves and the breasts look less... flat.\n\nThis is false advertising! The textures are a lot smoother, more visually appealing and obviously already made so why are they not applied to the in-game model?\n\nPlease update the model with the actual textures, I don&#039;t know if someone forgot to or if it was intentional - but I don&#039;t like being lied to and I don&#039;t think the community does either.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-22T17:22:53.790+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey The Pale Woman,\n\nWould you be able to point me in the direction of where you found the first image? \n\nThe [official chromas launch page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/chromas) showed this image when the chromas first went live, which isn't the same image you're providing. These screenshots are what should be used to showcase the chromas/base skin, as it's what you'll get in game.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/kf3dX7v\n\nLOL King isn't something that Riot owns or operates, but they do pull the models from the game, and in this case, is what our preview on the chroma page displays.  \n\nI'm more curious as to where the first image came from, since you're correct in that it doesn't align 1:1 with what you're seeing in game. \n\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"pretty hurts","date":"2017-05-22T18:36:12.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First image is a preview from skin selection in champion select (_normal_ skin color) \nhttp://imgur.com/a/eP8CQ\n\nYou can clearly see, that her textures are much smoother. On live her skin is purplish on base Prestigious LB skin but all chromas have _normal_, non-purple skin tone (like the one seen on the preview). Mistletoe LeBlanc skin has simillar _normal_ skin tone aswell. \n\nHere is Base Prestigious LB (purple skin)\nhttps://imgur.com/a/pJ5Bt\n\nWicked LB (purple skin) \nhttps://imgur.com/a/4gKko \n\nClassic LB (purple skin) \nhttp://imgur.com/a/LEdrT\n\nThey may not be the best quality screenshots but if you look closely you can see the difference. All of them were taken by me in game.\nI'm wondering why wasn't the base Prestigious LeBlanc updated to match the quality of chromas? Any chance it could be fixed? Also is there ANY chance for updating Classic, and Wicked LB skin tone to match that of her Prestigious' Chromas?\n{{champion:7}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-22T18:53:30.465+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, okay, gotcha! Sorry, I'm not totally familiar with the more recent chromas, since another pod has been tackling them, so thanks for the screenshot! \n\nI'll have to follow up on how the happened. My guess is an older iteration may have been captured, as opposed to what went live. I looked through her texture files that are in the game, and this texture doesn't exist, nor did it. So, this leads me to believe this store asset was created from a file that lives outside the game itself. \n\nRegarding the base skin itself, I'll need to sync up with the pod, since I don't have these answers off hand. I'll update this comment as soon as I have them.\n\nUpdating the skin tones on classic and Wicked LeBlanc aren't something we'd prioritize at this time, as they aren't terribly egregious compared to other issues that we're working on in our backlog. , but it's something we could consider in the future.\n\n**EDIT**: Sorry, I meant to answer your question surrounding the smoothness - the images in the preview are likely from the model outside of the game in a program such as Maya. Once in game, they're rendered, which causes the difference in the look/overall smoothness, but it shouldn't be insanely drastic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Pale Woman","date":"2017-05-28T22:12:51.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is in the Champion Select Screen when you are selecting chroma colors, it is the /'d out first chroma preview.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-25T15:52:46.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again, \n\nI wanted to pop in and give you an update of where we're at with this. I caught up with the chromas pod, and they stated that the texture update *was completed*, however, was improperly checked in, making it so it didn't properly show up in game. This is why the store asset (which is created using an out of game model) was correct, and the in-game model was not updated. \n\nThey've gone ahead and properly checked in the file (and I've verified that it's in game now), and should look like this: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/ElEXYQR\n\nUnfortunately, this didn't make it in time for the 7.11 build, but will go out with 7.12.

Which one is the \"original\" and which is the \"preview\"...... Because they look fairly similar to me.\n\nThe things you pointed out I do not even see...... Tbh the top one I can slightly see an issue with her breasts, but thats just because it looks like they are attached all the way up to her shoulders...... And that took a while trying to figure out your commentary just to find that one.\n\nAre you sure you are not just trying to see how many will try staring at her chest trying to figure out what you are even talking about?","replies":[{"poster":"The Pale Woman","date":"2017-05-15T10:00:07.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Exactly, they are S-I-M-I-L-A-R but not the SAME! So why are they putting different pictures up when they obviously have a high-res texture for her already made just not implemented?\n\nBottom one is her current model, the textures are more ridgid and rough as opposed to the top one, the pant leg has 3 swirls instead of  many, the gloves have a slit in them and overall the top one looks a LOT nicer then what we actually get in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2017-05-15T13:35:02.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The rendering of the model + skin is machine dependent. If you have the highest settings, and a powerful graphics card, then you will get a better rendering. From the image, it looks like you have mid-range graphics settings set. \n\nThat aside, the pre-rendered compositions of a skin will ALWAYS be better than the one rendered on your machine.\n\nEven further, the pre-render you got was from lolking, which is not the official site for...anything in lol. They may have obtained the rendering either via pre-rendering using the lol data or took a better screen shot that you, with higher graphics settings (likely the former).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2017-05-15T14:43:54.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The top one has the \"ous\" of prestigious covering most of the swirls..... But it looks like the swirls look about the same. If not, in my opinion, better done in the bottom than the top.\n\nHer gloved hand is turned so you can not see the entire back of the glove, and same as in real life it can easily be missed depending on the angle.... But it does look like it was taken off perhaps. Ill give you that one, but it does not make that much of a difference, especially in game where you are barely going to be looking that close to her hand.\n\nPersonally the bottom one looks better apart from the color of her skin looks like she is a grape that used some of that shiney glitter spray.... Which in game it does not look like that.\n\nIt also does not look like it is the actual image from in game, unlike the top one. You might try taking a picture from in game and comparing it to the top one, because the LoLking one easily could be that they drew that prestigious leblanc and missed the details you are pointing out now...... Therefore your worries and dissatisfaction with the skins in game models easily could be put to rest just by comparing the current in game model to the top picture. An in game model from actually in the game that is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2017-05-15T10:39:10.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you ever been to McDonalds?","replies":[]},{"poster":"korppi tuoni","date":"2017-05-16T01:38:27.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The bottom picture is from lolking, not Riot, how is it false advertising for previews from 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WEBSITES to be different?","replies":[{"poster":"The Pale Woman","date":"2017-05-17T05:13:59.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOLKING uses the ingame model.
