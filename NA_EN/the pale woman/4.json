It really, **REALLY** is noticeable, its not some small clip, it is an animation error and I am not sure why it wasn&#039;t fixed before the skin was released? \r\n\r\nCould someone at Riot please check the status if this is a known bug and if it will be fixed soon? When the new Leblanc skin comes out, it would be cool to get a bug fix for Ravenborn as well! :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-29T21:32:15.794+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CRYSTAL MAlDEN - \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nI took a look at the issue, and it appears to be trivial, as compared to other bugs on our plate at the moment - especially those for skins releasing next patch. That said, I did log the issue in the database, and it will be prioritized and resolved - just not immediately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Pale Woman","date":"2016-02-28T20:34:12.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump? I don't know if you can bump here but it's basically fallen to the third page!\n\nI don't know why I am so bothered by this clip, its just REALLY REALLY bad as you can see from the photos.","replies":[]}]}
