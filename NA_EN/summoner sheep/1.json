I quit for about two months and came back to my account being Plat 5. Instead of me wanting to hop back into ranked, it makes me want to stop playing ranked all together. I already proved that I can climb out of plat, and I&#039;m not looking to do it again. I&#039;m looking for some kind of explanation for why accounts degrade. For those of you who are going to respond to just climb again... I cba to do this because in my eyes I&#039;ve already accomplished this goal, and I shouldn&#039;t be &quot;punished&quot; for taking a break. Please only respond about why you think rank degrades.","replies":[]}
