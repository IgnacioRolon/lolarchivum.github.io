But it seems that only Liss, Velkoz and Gnar lores were updated. Unless, its still to early to assume there is none. I hope some rioter can clarify this.\n\n\nWanna see aniv, ash and sej's new lore so badly.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-31T00:50:08.342+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you guys are all paying attention! I'd hate for us to update something and for it not to be noticed... ;-)\n\nWe are not automatically updating ALL the lore around a region with each new champion. Where something NEEDS updating in order to understand a new piece of lore, or where clarity is required, we prioritise that. The total average we can manage per month is about 10,000 words, give or take.\n\nAshe and Sejuani do not give much insight into Nunu & Willump, so we did not update them yet. Anivia could have been updated to tie in with Nunu and the Notai, but we decided to wait for a better opportunity.\n\nA final note - we're not updating lore in places other than Universe or the Runeterra map. Old stuff, while it may still be viewable online, is not necessarily still canon, if it's not on one of the newer site locations.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-08-31T01:21:17.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"waitin on volibear ehhhh?\n\npersonally, and I know this isn't exactly your department, but it would be cool if anivia got a VO update at the same time as volibear gets a vgu, whenever that happens, just  so that all those champions have cool interactions with each other (including ornn too), and are all holistically up to date with each other ","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-31T02:08:14.601+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely, it would be awesome if we could update champion VO and interactions more often.","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2018-08-31T02:59:43.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think if we (The community) ask enough you guys will start doing them.

I appreciate your response but at least give something new to the freljord page have it featured in the universe front page. like giving descriptions to the vision of freljord pictures, give a freljord story even if its just 5 minutes, give new freljord pics of their culture or at least update the description of freljord(if its not canon).\n\nBtw, trundle is in the featured champs in the front page but his bio didn't got an update. why is that? is it because he was featured in the ryze cinematic? is so, why is sona not in the front page also?\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-08-31T15:56:47.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will you be fixing Lissandra's new bio?
