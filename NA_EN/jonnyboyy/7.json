Last year Kayn was still in the PBE and walla we see an Urgot&#039;s teaser. This is just an example of a back to back reveal patch and we all know that Riot doesn&#039;t have a clear schedule/pattern in releasing these stuff. They even release Shen VGU and Jhin together in the past so its not impossible.\r\n\r\nMaybe Aatrox is just an appetizer and Akali is the main dish. Not to mention that Aatrox was just a huge GU in the past until they promote him into a VGU. \r\n\r\nBTW, Xin Zhao&#039;s GU was an anticipated GU too (but not heavy) and was a back to back patch with evelynn last year :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nᴹᵃʸᵇᵉ ᴬᵏᵃᶫᶦ&#039;ˢ ⱽᴳᵁ ᶦˢ ᴿᴵᴼᵀˢ ᵍᵃᵗᵉ ᵃʷᵃʸ ᵗᵒ ᵃᶫᶫ ᵗʰᵒˢᵉ ᴬᵃᵗʳᵒˣ ʰᵃᵗᵉ ᵃᶰᵈ ᶦᶠ ᵗʰᵉʸ ʳᵉᶫᵉᵃˢᵉ ʰᵉʳ ᵃᶠᵗᵉʳ ᵃᵃᵗʳᵒˣ&#039;ˢ ᵖᵃᵗᶜʰ, ᶦᵗˢ ᶫᶦᵏᵉ ᶰᵒᵗʰᶦᶰᵍ ᵉᵛᵉᶰ ʰᵃᵖᵖᵉᶰ&sdot; ᴶᵒᵏᵉ","replies":[{"poster":"dimolish","date":"2018-06-20T12:02:56.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think that we will get a new champion first and then {{champion:84}} \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"JonnyBoyy","date":"2018-06-20T12:05:38.287+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope buddy, Akali is next baby! says riot reav3 ;)\n\n\nFUN FACT: After Akali is Nunu's turn then next is a new champ followed by a VGU","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2018-06-20T23:10:52.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sure?
