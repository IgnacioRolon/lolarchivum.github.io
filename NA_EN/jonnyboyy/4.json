Why am I seeing almost 4 to 5 new champions in one year and hardly any VGU? I mean just this year alone we are going to be getting two new champions. Isn't it time to just stop creating champions and make your existing champion pool better? A lot of what needs to be worked on needs a Ezreal level MVGU. I really do not understand your work ethic and thought process. Why is there an excuse to give this special treatment to Ezreal when you know almost half of your champion pool needs the same type of work?\n\nThe majority of the VGU you have been doing lately have been a roaring success. Why are we focusing so much on new champions and adding the number of hours and excuses to never work on existing champions? It's to the point that I just don't think you guys care or know what you are doing anymore. We will have 150 plus champion by the middle of next year. Stop with new champions already and actually work on problems you created, you are blatantly ignoring, and that you know what the community wants worked on.\n\nI really just don't get you guys. You told us you would be doing more VGU and you even said you wanted to see how the Ezreal MVGU turns out and you might do a lot more of those. Here you are talking about new champions and Developers working on new champion. Unless you hired more workers, I see almost 4 to 5 new champions coming out next year on top of the two coming out this year.

A lot of the Champions we currently have to do VGUs on have A LOT of skins, where as in the past many of them only had like 3-4 skins. \n\nVGU's also have a cost, where not matter how awesome the VGU and how well it is received there will be people that quite the game because they lost something they love, even if it's better after the VGU. We think this cost is worth it to keep our game holistically feeling fresh and modern, so we don't plan on stopping VGUs anytime soon, but it is a cost for sure.
