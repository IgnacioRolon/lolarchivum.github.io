and make anyone that relies on clicking useless (even under tower), also deals good damage with insane mobility when she hits her abilities.\n\n{{champion:412}} can easily get a kill on any squishy or

with plants when an adc goes to cs, also capable of dealing super high damage all game.\n\n{{champion:142}} lands a bubble through a wall and you can count yourself dead if you don't have qss available, (bubble is up much more often) can also deal massive damage with a long ranged q onto anyone, has an ult that can get her in range for a long q and then get her back to safety.\n\nI could
