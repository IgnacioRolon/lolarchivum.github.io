Like other champions ahd reall passives and she got -  a free spell? Like as any midlaner with a bluebuff or lategame with a manaitem and a manarune runs out of mana.\n\nAnd what is wrong about passives don't doing much for the laning phase? Like old Katarinas passive was also just a passive giving cd back after someone dies. New one added the spindmg on getting a dagger and reducing e cd, but that basicly moved from her old w as her new w also is no dmg at it's own anymore.\n\nShyvanna also got turned to mostly jungling as her passive only favors fighting dragons and getting resistances on killed dragons, no reall laningphase rune. \n\njinx, also a killpassive. Yes it activates on towers and inhibs but you know how they lenghten the laningphase preseason by adding plates to the tower and giving it 5k health?\n\n\nLissandra is allready a REALLY strong champion in the current meta without having a real passive. She is a cc champion. SHe does not need thousands of interactions with every ability and her new passive.

Thats not the case. Most teamfights take like 15-45s. For this you can use the lissandra passive on a few targets. Fights don't move much on the Baronpit, dragonpit or nexus so teams can't as easily back off. Also it is not like this passive was tested over months from players of diffrent mmrs how useful it would be. For this the first iteration of standing statues allready got changed and if the rioter says the new passive looks promising then it says it gets proced kinda quite often.\n\nMeddler allready tried really many, many diffrent passives. Many just playing around mana. But as leagues manaitems and runes work you really don't need much playroom there.\n\n No one says the passive is the big deal.

Karthus' passive works because you can cast abilities during its duration. To top it off it has synergy. Fast casting Q coupled with a massive AOE slow and spell. Sion gets a speed boost on top of life steal as well damage. Kog gets increased movement speed to ensure he gets his passive off on top of it being AOE true damage. Liss' statues?

You clearly don't seem to be understanding anything. Last reply. Your problem is that as long as it's not the mana passive you're fine with it. It's pretty much like saying a white paper bag is better than a brown paper bag. Your paper bags keep breaking. Then when someone hands you a bag made of better material you go, \"WTF is this? This is worse! I don't want this!\"\n\nLiss' suggested passives may seem good, but it's bad. Like, super fucking bad. It's a passive that doesn't do anything. It may seem good because you get aoe slows and aoe bursts, but it's not good. As I've stated already when you get the passive off you've already won. When you win it does nothing. You have to kill people in super opportune positions to get the full effectiveness. I feel as though this is the part that you don't understand and are unwilling to understand.\n\nYou can't compare Liss' suggested passives to Kog/Sion/Karth. While yes, they are trigger effects they're all different in their own rights as I've stated. Each one works to the advantage of the champion. Liss' suggested passives just doesn't do any of that. Even if you get a root or a slow what does that do? Pretty much nothing. Even with the newer suggested one it's still doesn't help much. Unless the passive last for longer than 4 seconds. If it does then it's not as bad. If they only move through say whatever Liss' AA's then that just makes it even worse because you'll have to put yourself in a bad position to get the passive off. If they randomly run around and blowup wherever they choose then that also makes it bad.\n\nMy suggested changes are to more align Riot's suggested passive to be more ideal towards what Riot is trying to achieve. What they're trying to achieve is to push her past her current play style. Her current play style is E in, R someone, press Zhonya's, and then E out. With my suggested changes you drastically change her play style to increase skill expression while at the same time changing her play style as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-11-08T20:18:13.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Your problem is that as long as it's not the mana passive you're fine with it.\n\nThis is not my problem.
