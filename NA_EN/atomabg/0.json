Instead of charging me 675 RP, I was charged 1350 and on my purchase history, it even shows up as two 675 RP purchases on Battlecast Kog'Maw. I understand this is probably a bug but still, I was charged twice the amount it's supposed to charge me. Can somebody please help? I already tried restarting my client.
