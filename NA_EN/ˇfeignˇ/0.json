I do not get it... \r\n\r\nDudes name was LordDreamshark ign and for the record I did not afk or flame but our mid did and I honestly do not get what is wrong with that I get how the mid feels I wanted to and it was my lane... like why is trolling such an ambiguous unfleshed out offense?\r\n\r\nEverything is automated I just want to understand why it is wrong to not want to play that kind of game out or if it is?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T23:02:19.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying to talk with your teammates and work out a better strategy definitely isn't toxic. When you start making demands or making fun of someone for poor play is when it becomes toxic. Just because you might know better gameplay strats doesn't mean you're allowed to talk down to others.\n\nI didn't look over your chat logs for anything specific, so these comments aren't directed at you perse. Just a few things that came to mind when thinking about \"what exactly is toxic\". If you have any specific examples you wanted to talk about feel free to hit me back up or reach out to our player behavior team in a ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"ˇFeignˇ","date":"2017-09-29T21:30:33.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enough but when people state they are inting and ask you to beg for an ff and you cannot do anything but wait it out cause if you say anything you will get reprimanded I think there is a problem with your system, and sadly in my experiences yesterday inting and trolling was a common thing. Not sure how the \"low level games\" excuse is adequate. If trolling is acceptable at any point it facilitates a player base that is worse.\n\nIt gets hard game to game to remain in a good mood when two games in a row junglers try to counter red die and flame you for not backing them up at level 2 and proceed to int... Then you get a game where someone genuinely just messes up and they are fine, but it is already so old from the trolling.\n\nI get you do not want toxicity but a no tolerance or intent to know context is not the way, a playerbase of people who type /mute all for fear they will lose the account as they wait to lose a hopeless game and waste 25 mins of their time having no fun which is what games are for should not be okay from a devs perspective. At the end of the day no matter how amazing a game is made in multiplayer players make the game so there needs to be more facilitation of learning among players without it immediately leading to a brand of toxic because then your players will do half the job for you make the game more fun and competitive. \n\nThe people who proceed to curse or int or whine when they are told what they did wrong should be reprimanded not the ones \"talking down\". Because saying \"please do not counter jg vs yasuo I will have to be shoved in early\" or something along those lines is not toxic and if they proceed to try to counter and are collapsed on and curses me out I will not say it but that person is just an idiot, so I simply mute the player and proceed to have a less fun game as someone ruins it...\n\nI am not an outlier to that experience. Just my thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"ˇFeignˇ","date":"2017-10-08T22:22:40.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo Broporo you tell me why every game that people are 0/10 and running in inting and flaming I am about over this game it is not fun to play when your bot is 0/14 at 15 mins and flaming EVERY GAME like come on every single game I play is toxic like that how does matching work that you get with players who are awful and blame their team when they are 0/10 and the enemy gets a quality game? you tell me............. it is hard to not be toxic with that BS on the team.... like honestly what is that???? Or you just ignore responses if they are a valid point... that is garbage","replies":[]}]}]}]}
