I just notice that Sona's speed right away was 325 instead of 330, as the patch announced. Yesterday Sona's speed was 330, but it seems the patch has been reversed on Sona and didn't read an announcement about it. So a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-14T18:33:36.253+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, \n\nPer the patch notes, we had accidentally reverted her stats to pre-champion update. This was a bug,  and not intentional. \n\nThis issue has been resolved, and her stats have been changed back to where they should be, post update. (If you look at the patch notes, the numbers that are red and crossed out, those are the values that should be on live.)\n\nHope this clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-02-15T19:59:49.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't those numbers be in black and not crossed out? It's sort of confusing. Or maybe cross the red, the black and add the red numbers again in another colour.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iLUVcoconutpie","date":"2015-02-14T20:11:34.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also noticed the same thing last night. After the patch her speed was 330, but then last night I was playing her again, and I noticed her stats had reverted back to pre 5.3. Have not played today so not sure if it's been fixed.","replies":[]}]}
