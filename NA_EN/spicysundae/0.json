I haven't had a problem with League since it came out in 2012 for Mac until this new client. \n\nIt takes forever for me to load into game after champ select. :(  It was working fine more than 24 hours ago. So I don't understand why all of a sudden there's problems.\n\nI cleaned out my laptop, updated everything on my laptop, deleted league and reinstalled it, repaired the league client, and tried out anything said in forums. I still have the same problem with the loading screen. :/","replies":[]}]}
