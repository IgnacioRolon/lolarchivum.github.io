She doesn't need it. Her heal is strong enough without an additional buff on top of it, it doesn't mesh with the rest of her kit at all. It's literally just there to be there, and I'm really curious as to why it wasn't removed when she was reworked?","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T03:59:23.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause it allows her to push towers faster.

Keeping the ADC healed and giving them a significant attack speed steroid is an underestimated aspect of her teamfight. I wouldn't say no to the AS buff only applying if it healed someone else, but thematically it works. Her primal surge leads to her feeling stronger and attacking faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndMann","date":"2015-02-19T12:30:57.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't need help pushing towers or supporting or dueling though. Riot's always talking about champions having defined strengths and weaknesses, but the buff on Nidalee's heal seems to go completely against that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-02-19T04:11:31.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody who has a role as a solo lane has a plain heal, and they couldn't give her an MS buff since she's already mobile enough.
