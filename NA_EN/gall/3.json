{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-09-07T06:45:07.703+0000","title":"Is the comment: \"Take your own advice\" punishable? ","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Question: If one were to state the titled sentence in a game, would that warrant a chat restriction, suspension, or ban? \n\nI ask because most of us can assume what the title may or may not be referring to, but the statement has no context whatsoever. In-game penalties typically don&#039;t take context into consideration as per the zero tolerance policy, but it might be a double edged sword since by reporting this statement alone one may not receive any penalty despite having the same harmful intent. (Even if they did not instigate it, we all know that responding to the offender is equally as bad). \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? \n\nI personally think that saying something like the title in a game wouldn&#039;t result in any consequences unless manually reviewed since context has to be taken into consideration. Without context it could just be responding to someone who said &quot;Hey guys, please buy some pinks&quot;, or it could be something much harsher. \n\nAnd if such context has to be taken into consideration for something such as this, then it would, in a way, nullify the ideology sometimes seen throughout the boards who mock the offender for saying &quot;I did X only because Y said Z&quot; to which a common retort is &quot;Context doesn&#039;t matter, you said what you said&quot;. This is a totally valid response, but is it applicable for all situations? Context should matter to some extent. Perhaps too many people are receiving punishments when trapped into saying something negative when given a toxic comment that they&#039;re mentally/ emotionally not prepared to deal with. \n\nIn conclusion, it&#039;s too easy for smart offenders to get away with toxicity by beating the system, and no context punishments that result in permanent bans should be reconsidered. \n\nThe statements and questions above are nothing more than my thoughts and observations. I am not writing this out of response to a punishment I&#039;ve received nor have my recent games had a toxic player in them.","replies":[{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-09-07T06:48:09.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edited my title because I was immediately downvoted instead of getting a good discussion going.","replies":[{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2018-09-07T06:58:28.046+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"i'm a simple man\n\ni see someone complaining about downvotes, i procede to downvote\n\n*post downvoted*\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Trubbs","date":"2018-09-07T06:49:56.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get downvoted on this board it's a good thing","replies":[{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-09-07T06:51:08.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vanilla Trubbs,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HarbIU1b,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-09-07T06:49:56.922+0000)\n>\n> If you get downvoted on this board it&#x27;s a good thing\n\nThis board doesn't have much discussion going other than that one particular topic :/.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Trubbs","date":"2018-09-07T07:00:23.459+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"All you're gonna get here are the same few talking points repeated by the same few people.
