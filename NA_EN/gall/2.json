{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-12-27T19:19:25.373+0000","title":"Moving Brand from Support to the Midlane.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Gameplay+","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello gameplay +! I&#039;m a Brand support main that hovers between DIV-DII, and I absolutely love to play Brand! Many people are frustrated playing against him though and for good reason. The most common argument is that people would rather see a champion designed for mid lane with mid lane-like damage to remain in that role, and I personally wouldn&#039;t mind going Brand mid at all. However, it&#039;s simply not as satisfying, nor as good. \r\nHere are the reasons why I believe Brand currently doesn&#039;t sit well in mid as oppose to support ~ \r\n\r\n1. Has to be too close to harass, and it&#039;s very difficult to land all three spells twice in a row just to evenly trade a lane opponent who just has to dodge one of those six spells to win a trade. If I go mid and don&#039;t miss a single spell, then yeah I&#039;ll win the lane. But if I&#039;m off just a little then I&#039;ll probably lose, whereas my opponent just has to land maybe one skillshot to get the same results. \r\n2. Very gankable but not with the range that xerath, velk, and lux has to play safe. \r\n3. You either use spells on minions to go even in lane dominance or you harass, whereas someone like TF just has to Q the wave, maybe throw a red card. Brands are always out cs&#039;d mid (BRAND HAS THE SECOND LOWEST CS NUMBERS OF ALL MIDS, despite not being a roam/ assassin champion like LB who has the actual lowest) or Brand has to have the wave pushing towards them (unless W+E is used on the wave a ton, which causes mana problems and Brand is one of the most gankable mages so having those spells on cooldown is not viable). \r\n4. Brand&#039;s best rune is DH because of how easy it is to proc on him. In mid you&#039;ll proc it half as much (or worse depending on match up) whereas in bot a Brand will get the most DH stacks of anyone in the game. \r\n5. AP doesn&#039;t scale well on Brand, putting a lot of his power into his passive which doesn&#039;t need massive item spikes to do damage, and is amplified a ton with the easy to buy magic pen items and rylia&#039;s + liandry&#039;s. Going mid for extra farm to get those extra cs numbers (43/44 for all mid champions in terms of cs though) isn&#039;t worth the extra menial ap item. \r\n6. The only reason Brand has a 50% WR mid is because of his amazing teamfight potential. He probably has the best damage potential of any champ for grouped team fights. That being said, his teamfight potential isn&#039;t greatly increased by going mid rather than support. In fact, it&#039;s probably better to have a mid for the enemy team to focus on so that a Brand can actually get his combos off in a teamfight, or if he&#039;s focused hard, then the mid won&#039;t be focused then can do the massive damage instead. \r\n\r\nMy proposed changes includes nerfs to his damage, buffs to his CS and better AP scaling: \r\n\r\n1. Brand&#039;s passive does extra damage against minions to assist in CS. \r\n3. His autoattack burns minions (only minions) for a small increased amount of damage as well. \r\n2. His **base damages are all decreased at every level** but has much better AP scaling (making him weaker at every minute of the game until around 2 magic items, in which he becomes stronger than previously). &lt;- this alone would lower support Brand&#039;s winrate by a considerable amount, but alone would trash all of Brand&#039;s early game making him the weakest around, so the other proposed changes are needed to assist in lane harass/ CS. \r\n3. He has slightly longer range on E. \r\n4. Similar to Ryze, it would be great to give Brand some mobility like an MS boost or shield on landing an ability, or even just a small base MS increase. Brand is the only champ that requires two spells to land a small stun to avoid ganks, but if either of those abilities are ever used to help with CS then you&#039;re screwed. So it&#039;s either always have wards up everywhere, try to go even in CS, or lose CS but be prepared for a gank. I would love to have a simple gold card to throw out or a long range single spell stun (Xerath) to help against ganks, but his mechanics are so much different than the average mid laner for survival.  \r\n5. Ignoring only #4 but keeping the only 3, perhaps reworking his kit interaction to make him more viable to play midlane would be an option. This is a more difficult change though and not just a small number push-around. \r\n\r\nWell, that&#039;s all from me! Thanks for the reading my short thoughts on Brand :).","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-12-30T19:26:28.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2019-01-02T12:11:51.948+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra outclasses brand in 10 different aspects\n\n\nThe only place where Brand can parry Syndra is in aoe damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gilgayu","date":"2018-12-31T14:27:01.281+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lack of mobility is really the reason why brand has been, and must be, staying bot lane.\n\nHe has frustrating damage for how easy it is to land them in a 2v2 matchup (because again, many supports lack mobility).

I've tried him mid before, and tbh, he sucks. He can't land a single w unless the enemy is slowed due to how many dashes mid-laners  have these days. He can only gain kill pressure if his enemy jungle decides to gank, yes, being ganked will make him stronger. \n\nHe is just one of the mages that are better at bigger scales of fighting (2v2 instead of 1v1).","replies":[{"poster":"Elf0491","date":"2019-01-16T03:31:38.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I...know?

That means that his only reliable harass is also his only form of wave clear. With a 8 second CD and 100 mana cost at rank 5 that makes it pretty much impossible to keep up any lane pressure. He can't spam it without going oom and he's extremely vulnerable to all-ins or bad trades when it's on CD. \n\nThe only way to make Brand viable mid would be to actually change the way his kit functions.

You nerf his base damage, and increase his scaling, making him more item/gold dependent in order to do his job. Here is something I  think needs considering though if you want to make changes:\n\nBrand, as you have stated, has HUGE teamfight potential... in the form of damage. EVERYTHING in Brand's kit does damage... his passive doubley so since it has a burn effect and a potential EXPLOSION! if you land 3 abilities on someone.\n\nGiving someone like brand more saftey would simply just not be fair without substantial changes to his kit. Same thing with cc. TF gold card is VERY telegraphed. Xerath stun is slow moving and easy to see/dodge. Brand gets stun after one of his other abilities hits, but getting stunned by brand is WAY worse than getting stunned by TF or Xerath (assuming everyone is equal in gold) His stun means you were already hit by 2 abilities, and the 3rd one is now free. Passive proc away!\n\nBrand doesn't have to be able to harass/fight other ranged mages in mid lane. They would probably be his strongest counter. He doesn't need to be great at roaming either, because all Brand needs to do, and this should be the niche you are picking him into (assuming competitive mindset here), is group up with his team post 6 and lay down the hell fire that wins team fights.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean all his lane matchups will be bad. Everything changes against other short range mages, and the occassional melee matchup.\n\nGanks are something everyone has to worry about, especially right now since damage is so high in the game. Even somewhat safe positioning wont matter if Hecarim charges at you with Predator active and knocks you even just a little further away from your tower. If you are any of the myriad of immobile squishies that frequent midlane, you probably gonna die if you didnt see the gank coming.\n\nPersonally, I would love to see more changes like this happen though, so that supports can be a more utility focused position again. Now, to clarify, I think people can and should be able to play whoever they want in whatever role they want, but I think for game health, and competitive, I think it makes the game more interesting when its not a giant damage fest.

Not a huge fan of Brand, but he has some VERY clear strengths, and those strengths are why he is not more than just a niche pick in mid. You can still pick him mid.

Enchanter a class of champions in this game aswell as tanks are too, so they should be allowed to. fulfill their role, at least if they play decent. So pls explain me why this two classes (if u play a tank support vs a mid mage its a freelose tbh)  arent allowed to have any influence, or to be useful overall? Why is a midlane mage allowed to oneshot me as enchanter at  level 4, leaving no counterplay, because i can shield 300 of a 1500 burst.\nAdc should exaclty do that if i play correctly and the adc does too, why wouldnt he be able to do that during the lategame, its the target of his role. Especially considsring redemption, ardent, mikaels, and maybe ga? A fed assasine can 1 v 5. A fed irelia can 1 v 5. Yet you conplain about enchanters, because there once was a time, where they actually were able to fulfill their role??? \n\nTbh you are rlly biased, if you say that ardent meta was worse, because you forget that enchanters always were oneshots, aka were providing counterplay. Look at Akali, look at A fed Assasine, look at irelia, or look at a velkoz or brand support. What happend to the counterplay?\nRiot kinda understood that mages are no healthy supports, thats why brand, and a few more, will be nerfed in 9.2. That says a lot. And we can only hope, that they gut all affected mages.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pianoasis","date":"2019-02-04T07:29:18.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this meta I actually think he is a better jungler than anything else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2019-02-02T13:34:18.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another possibility is to do something similar to how his W works right now - increase all his mana costs but give a mana refund if they kill a minion or champion. Maybe up the damage on his WRQ to compensate.\n\nSo if Brand only pokes and doesn't CS he goes OOM very fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KicktheDoor","date":"2019-01-14T05:21:38.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's too much power in his passive and not enough in his abilities. Even if miss your abilities or fall behind you can  still dish out damage off your passive  which is what makes him a strong support. I'm in favor of gutting Brand's passive and giving him better AP ratios so he's not railroaded into support roles and forced to itemize DoT. Being able to use yourself as a conduit for your abilities or increased movement speed off landing spells would do wonders.","replies":[]}]}
