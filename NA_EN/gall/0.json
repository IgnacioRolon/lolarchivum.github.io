I see a lot of threads talking about its power but none that go into detail about just how insane it might be... on a support. I&#039;d like to take a look at the past few games of mine with you :). \r\n\r\n* On 11/02/2018 I had a nearly completed build, was 7 kills and had 8 assists, and the rune arcane comet (which was the most common Brand rune along with Aery) helped deal **1367** damage. This game lasted **39:29**. Sadly, I lost, so let&#039;s look at a win. \r\n* On 11/15/2018 I had a **FULLY** completed build, was 12 kills and had 15 assists, and the rune arcane comet helped deal **2142** damage. This game lasted **41:09** minutes. \r\n* Today, on 11/26/2018, I had two items and a blasting wand, was 10 kills and 10 assists, and the rune dark harvest helped deal **2685** damage. This game only lasted **26:39**. \r\n\r\nDamage - Time:\r\n1367 - 39:29\r\n2142 - 41:09\r\n2685 - 26:39\r\n\r\nOn average, I am doubling my previous damage with dark harvest which allows me to snowball harder and deal even more damage as a support that already dealt nearly the most damage every game. \r\nBrand has gone up from a good 50-51% winrate to a staggering 53.12% winrate. \r\nBrand almost always gets close to the most if not the most dark harvest stacks. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not going to lie and say I&#039;m not loving this, but I think the people I face off against might feel another way. \r\nSo, it hurts me to say this, but I believe my beloved main champion is _too_ strong, and some more balancing needs to be done. \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t _flame_ me for playing Brand btw {{champion:63}}","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-11-26T15:16:22.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they're gonna mess with Brand I hope they improve his mid laning and nerf his support power.","replies":[{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-11-26T19:52:50.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khristophoros,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lsAnx6Kn,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-11-26T15:16:22.862+0000)\n>\n> If they&#x27;re gonna mess with Brand I hope they improve his mid laning and nerf his support power.\n\nMid mages have either great roaming potential, waveclear, or range. Brand lacks in most of these sadly. I still play Brand mid, but I always feel like I'm a slight disadvantage (until teamfight situations, which is his strongsuit). Also, Dark Harvest procs less in solo lanes as opposed to botlane. :-/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DM For Rat Facts","date":"2018-11-26T09:08:32.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand is ok right now tbh.

The idea of Brand being viable in the support position having become widespread is the worst thing that ever happened in this game.\n\nI actually only have a positive K/D ratio in about 50% of my games because I strive for assists more and helping my AD as much as I can. \nThe goal of mine is to zone out the enemy botlane so my AD can get free farm while also having a good outplay potential for the AD to rack up kills (or sometimes assists). That's why Brand's support winrate is so good; he's good at what he does.\n\nEdit: At the same time, if after helping my AD as much as I can (i.e. winning lane, allowing him to cs, etc.) but we're still losing the game and the AD isn't doing that great, Brand still has the ability to step up and act as a mage carry. So I can either support my AD exceedingly well, or I can step up and become the carry. In lower elos you may see Brand supports always try to hypercarry, but that isn't his job usually and to know how to play according to the game is what separates Brand mains. I'm still learning which is why I'm only between D4-D5, but I feel D3 and even D2 coming along soon. \n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2018-11-26T10:51:58.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Auto downvoted for Brand maining.","replies":[{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-11-26T19:42:22.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Bad Touch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lsAnx6Kn,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-26T10:51:58.427+0000)\n>\n> Auto downvoted for Brand maining.\n\n:(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-11-26T11:45:32.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand doing damage.
