I'm sure this question is going to get asked a lot / upvoted a ton, so I thought I'd tackle it first.\n\n\nTL;DR: Aurelion's passive is visible in brush so that it's clear and understandable to his opponents, but also because I'm interested in finding out just what happens when a character bends the rules around vision.\n\n**First off, to be totally clear** (for other readers) - **if Aurelion is in brush, his character model is invisible like anybody else.** Can't be targeted or basic-attacked. Only his stars will loop out of the brush, giving the enemy a very good idea of where exactly he is. \n\nThat said:\n\nAurelion's stars do a lot of damage - enough that getting hit by an invisible one out of a brush would be a pretty big deal. This presents us with a choice - we can make the spell both strong and invisible, which is _unfair_ (we don't like unfair very much), we can make the spell weaker and invisible, which is _lame_ (we wanted Aurelion's stars to be a big deal), or we can make the spell strong but visible, which is _inconvenient_ (Aurelion can't hide in bushes). That's an oversimplification, but it's the sort of spectrum of choices that we have.\n\nGiven that, I decided to lean hard into the \"strong but visible\" camp. Present the counterplay clearly to the opponent at all times, and if they fail, or Aurelion succeeds, then Aurelion gets to _win_.\n\nThe second part to the decision has to do with a desire to test the limits of the rules of the game. Given that Aurelion was shaping up to be a big, boisterous, magnificent spectacle of a character, it made me think that maybe this was the first character in League to _not be sneaky_. A star dragon does not crouch in a bush waiting to pounce, he soars above his enemies and rains down the heavens upon them. \n\nI'll admit that this is (perhaps) my curiosity as a game designer getting the better of me. But I believe that providing new and different gameplay experiences is one of the jobs of a champion designer, and that we should always challenge assumptions. \n\nSo what happens to the game when a character can't hide? What kinds of things can their kit do instead to compensate? What happens to their playstyle when I tell the player that standing still, ever, is a bad idea? What gameplay comes out of being out of vision (so, not targetable) but having your position given away? I'm excited to find out :)\n\nAll that said - I stand by my decision as it is, but I'm also aware that **I might just be _wrong_**. \n\nIf Aurelion comes out and he just isn't finding success because his stars give away too much information,  then I'm absolutely open to re-evaluating. League is great in part because we get the chance to take risks and adjust if they don't work out. But players are clever - I'm pretty sure once Aurelion is out there, you guys will figure out how to work around his vision game pretty darn quickly.\n\nFinally, just so you guys know, if I were to change it later on I would probably go with \"Passive stars are visible only when Aurelion is visible. Toggling on W makes them visible on their own, like missiles\". This is in part because \"in brush\" and \"out of vision in fog\" are so similar to the opponent's view.\n\nThanks for reading this far - I went with a long post because I know this is a big topic with a lot of players across the world :)","replies":[{"poster":"Stellafreyja","date":"2016-03-17T18:53:08.296+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":4,"body":"Having Aurelion's stars visible isn't really the issue to me. It's the fact that their visibility is inconsistent with other skills in the game, i.e. Nunu's ult and Sion's Q (there may be others, but I'm not aware of them). Both of these skills can be channeled in the bush and unleashed when you can't see them. So, if you want Aurelion's stars to be visible, great, but BE CONSISTENT.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabid Llama","date":"2016-03-17T19:07:44.594+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree that it's inconsistent, which is unfortunate. I feel pretty strongly that skills should telegraph clearly, and if it were up to me Nunu and Sion would work differently - I was actually surprised when I found out after release that Sion's Q indicator didn't draw out of brush. \n\nIt's difficult to change characters once they're out. There's a lot of \"grandfathering\" in, since their players come to depend on those quirks. That's why we're starting with stars visible - we can try this out, and it's much easier to change them back in line with Nunu/Sion than it would be to do it the other way around.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2016-03-17T18:45:55.764+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Heres an idea, you can still see them from a bush, but you gain vision of them only when within 100 units of his orb range.

That's why I prefer the all-or-nothing approach a little more, if we were to go with hiding stars - sweeper-ing a brush and then standing in it, you should be 100% sure the enemy cannot see you or your stars.\n\nGetting the player to understand what the _enemy_ can see is really difficult in League since there's no good way to do direct feedback on it. It's why we frequently fall back to the red exclamation mark particle, which is too noisy for all but the most major of visibility mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OzzyOzrock","date":"2016-03-17T18:51:30.364+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems reasonable, actually.

Lemmie explain.\n\nTL:DR; We wanted to focus power on the P/W, so the R had to either be (relatively) weak or complicated. Went with an ult that's mechanically really helpful for the character, but thematically pretty lame.\n\n-\n\nFor this kit, we wanted to focus as much on the Stars of his Passive and W as we could. We found that we had a lot of fun, novel gameplay in a simple mechanic, but that it needed to hit pretty hard to be satisfying. So, when it came time to pick an ult, we didn't have a lot of power left to spare.\n\nNow, a Star Dragon should probably do something really, really flashy with his ultimate. Like, biggest-thing-in-the-game flashy. And we tried a half dozen different things trying to find it. The trick is, something big and flashy has to have a big impact to feel right, which means _more power_. \n\nA straightforward powerful ult (Ziggs, Lux) spends a lot of a character's power budget in one place - not a good fit, since we already had a lot of Aurelion's power earmarked for his W.\n\nThe alternative is something like Nunu ult - powerful but _conditional_. You have to jump through hoops to make it work, which lowers its effective power without lowering its potential impact. Great! Let's do that!\n\nThat's when _complexity budget_ (the cousin of power budget) comes in. In playtest, we found that Aurelion was really hard to play well. His damage depended on his positioning game, and for a champion with no in-combat mobility, that game took a lot of thought. Trying to also do crazy channeled ults or weird strategic things while managing that got really difficult fast. It also made him very feast-or-famine - either he was on point with W and whatever crazy Ult, or he wasn't able to pull off either and we useless.\n\nAfter much gnashing of teeth (muuuch gnashing of teeth), I settled on the current ultimate more for _game design_ reasons than for _character design_ reasons - it had the mechanics the character wanted. Burst damage, check. Long-range damage, check. Added safety (so you can screw up that positioning game a little and not instantly die), check. \n\nThere's a little bit of character design in there, though. We're hitting the \"breath weapon\" trope in a way that's a little bit different - that's where the name comes from. It's not \"**Breath **of **Fire**\", it's \"**Voice**\" - a much more refined thing than breath - \"of **Light**\" - a substance with much more purity than mere _fire_. \n\nIn my headcanon, Aurelion holds the very fires of creation, the light that ignites suns, inside himself, and with a single spoken word can spark creation. Very \"let there be light\".\n\nSo yeah, this ult exists to round out the character, to let him adapt to more situations and provide utility for his team even when struggling or behind. Mechanically, I'm pretty happy with it. Thematically, I'm sad I couldn't figure out how to make something more epic work out. \n\nHope that answers your question, because I wrote a whole lot of words by accident >_>","replies":[{"poster":"Sate my Devourer","date":"2016-03-17T19:07:46.773+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel so privileged to have the LLama respond to both of my top questions <3\n\nYea, I understand it better now, the ult is rather cool tho dont get me wrong, just like Jihn's W is cool but isnt unique.

It was a loooong process (over a year!) and in interest of answering more questions I'll be brief about it. Pretty much the entire team that worked on the storm dragon concept had moved on to other projects within Riot. Sometime last year, our DNA pod (Design-Narrative-Art) was asked if we felt comfortable picking up the dragon. Since most of the original vision holders had moved on, we decided to start with a brand new thematic and basically start from scratch. We wanted to find something new, something uniquely league. So we iterated. A lot. During the course of our natural brainstorming time, we hit on the idea of a cosmic star-forging dragon with the personality of a rock star. We had loads of support from our colleagues (other designers, artists, and senior narrative folk) who helped us craft Aurelion Sol.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabid Llama","date":"2016-03-17T19:38:06.154+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to that, we looked at other spins on dragon - stone dragons, smoke dragons, faerie dragons - but space seemed to capture the right feeling of vastness and power and wonder that a dragon like this deserves.
