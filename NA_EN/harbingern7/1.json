Of course, that means the damage output would have to go up...of course, in conjunction with the growth due to stacks, you can't give it too much. Maybe instead of 8% AS, 3 AD, and 4 AP (64% AS, 24 AD, 32 AP)...you could have it be 7.5% AS, 4 AD, and 5 AP for (75% AS, 40 AD, and 50 AP)?

AP Master Yi used to be the thing and I know that AP Xin Zhao is a monster to fight. If a champion is designed to outright murder other champions then you should already know they will build into some sort of tank damage dealing build. A prime example of a Non Tank jungler (even though he can be played as a jungle champion) is {{champion:122}}. His build path is straight up juggernaut kick your teeth in. Master Yi and Xin Zhao can both also be played as a juggernaut that rely on AS and crits to kick your teeth in.They are meant to kill other champions as quickly as possible and by nature are squishy so it forces players to take the safe path which is to go full tank with Rageblade Sated.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-02-20T22:06:15.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I don't appreciate the negative tone of the post and its bluntness, I agree that {{item:3124}} is too strong.
