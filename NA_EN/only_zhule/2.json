I would just like to address the fact that her kit is for all intents and purposes designed to function at 50%+ CDR..... Or with a metric ton of AP.   Honestly play her in like 3 games and tell me she doesn&#039;t feel clunky and useless till you meet one of those two requirements.  Yeah i get it everyone needs some built in weakness, that they can over come via whatever, but that weakness should not be fucking max CDR and/or 2 full built AP items on a support.\r\n\r\nAnd what really gets me is i&#039;m sure that Riot knows she needs to be updated to fit what the game has become, but &quot;fixing&quot; her is such a low priority.  She feels like the metaphorical squeaky door hinge that you were going to deal with till the basement flooded, then the stove broke, then you had to deal with a insect infestation, etc...  You want to fix the issue, but there is just so much more important stuff to deal with, and it&#039;s not like a squeaky door hinge is going to ruin your day.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would also like to point out that her offensive support (non ultimate) &quot;thing&quot; is probably the least meaningful one in the game.

The major problem a lot of people face when playing her is trying to play her like any other support, when she has clear weaknesses that make her not able to be played like any other support. People assume that just because she has a pokey Q like Nami's W or Lulu's Q that she needs to move as far up as them to get poke, but the difference is both Nami's W and Lulu's Q are long range and both Nami and Lulu have a way to prevent taking damage when poking. People assume that just because she has a strong heal/shield like Soraka/Thresh that they need to spam it to protect the ADC. People assume that just because she has a movement speed increase like Nami/Rakan that it has to be used every time the player engages. \n\nFactually, using these abilities wrong can cause the player to end up wasting her small mana pool. Learning when to use each ability is crucial to a Sona's gameplay. Spamming Q can result in taking significant amounts of damage for very little result and drain her mana quick, especially if they're getting in auto attack range to use the power chord. Spamming W, for obvious reasons, will just drain Sona's mana. The ADC shouldn't be taking so much damage that the Sona feels the need to spam W. That's a fault in the ADC but an even bigger fault in the Sona for wasting the mana when not needed. Using E to engage can result in Sona being trapped when a disengage needed, or it being on cooldown when the power chord is needed. Her E can be used as a form of kiting for the ADC to safely get in more damage.\n\nAnd the most common error players make is not using the proper power chord in each given situation. They think the damage one is going to be the best in every situation because yay damage! Realistically, the slow power chord is the strongest as, aforementioned, it empowers the ADC's ability to kite/poke safely. The armor shred one can be stronger than the damage one in the sense that Sona can use it and back off safely to avoid the Sona from taking too much damage or potentially dying.\n\nA lot of Sona also has to do with positioning. As squishy as she is, she shouldn't be playing nearly as aggressive as the ADC. And lastly, her ult is a long duration AoE stun, so it should be an ultimate rather than a Q, etc. It's really all about using the right abilities at the right time and positioning properly, like any champion. Sona is unique. Her kit isn't like any other support.

But let me pose this differently.  What is Sona suppose to do during lane phase?  does she do that job well?  If no, then at what point does she start doing her job well?\n\nMy issue remains that she doesn't really do much of anything during the lane phase against the vast majority of champions.  If she is suppose to be a enhancer support through the entire game, then she needs to have actual enhancer abilities that you can use through out the entire game, not just post 25 mins.\n\nAlso i'm not arguing that she needs {{champion:63}} level of damage output, i'm arguing that i really shouldn't be losing a trade with {{champion:40}} or {{champion:17}}  .  I'm arguing that a champion who's kit is based around casting a lot of low impact spells, instead of 1-2 big ones, should be able to cast a lot of spells without needing 40%+ CDR to keep pace.\n\nThe last big change they made to her was to add the passive to her ultimate.  They did this specifically because they noted that she wasn't able to keep up given that her abilities are rather weak individually.  I'm simply suggesting maybe take the passive away and just reduce her base cooldowns by 25% (at least on her Q and W).  She keeps the high risk high reward aspect of her kit, gains the means to maintain pressure / Keep her teammate alive during lane phase, and no longer has a late game where she is running around with a possible 67% CDR.\n\nOr if you want her to be more of an enhancer type character maybe give her some half decent freaking enhancement abilities.  Split the difference between her old version and this new one.  Give her the ability to give actual buffs but have them only last for like 4 seconds if you are within a fairly close range to her.  Maybe Q gives flat bonus AD/AP, or lethality while the aura is active.  You know something that might actually help your ally win the lane, instead of a tiny boost of bonus damage that doesn't work on buildings but can still be wasted on a minion.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalikko","date":"2018-11-28T05:24:05.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=only zhule,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W7zH4d1F,comment-id=0003000100000000,timestamp=2018-11-28T04:42:46.007+0000)\n>\n> So we clearly disagree on Sona.

Janna's ultimate is not a buff for her team, {{champion:44}} has buffing but it sure isn't his freaking heal.

Assuming you focused on damage your Q is now doing 160 base damage at rank 5 with a base cooldown of 7.2 seconds.  Your heal is doing a base 50 points with a base cooldown of 9 seconds.  These are REALLY bad numbers both in amount and how long their cooldown is.  If we assume you focused on healing, your numbers are Q= 70 magic damage, and you are healing for 110.

Maybe you are going to argue that i need to account for item CDR and AP, sure what do you think is a fair number at that point in the game?   I'm going to say 35% CDR and 75 AP, no bonus healing from items.  Your numbers are now 205 damage on a 4.68 second cooldown, and a heal of 69 on a 5.85 second cooldown if you went offensive, and 115 damage and 129 healing if you went supportive.  These remain very bad numbers considering that Sona doesn't have a second offensive spell, and doesn't have a stun outside of her ult (that would have a 91 second cooldown).\n\nThe issue is simply that Sona is based around casting a lot of small impact spells, compared to most other champions who are based around landing one big impact thing ({{champion:89}} being a good example of a champ that needs to usually use 2 abilities for the one big impact thing).

The point where you are most likely tagging a single ally.  \n\nHell let's imagine the smallest of small changes to Sona, her Q bonus damage lasts 3 seconds (would prefer 4-5) and CAN NOT be used against minions.
