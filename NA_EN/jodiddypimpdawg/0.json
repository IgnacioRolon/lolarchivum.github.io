Potentially hacked?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, asking for a friend.\n\nSo she was logging in to league today and noticed a message stating: \"Your account has transferred to another region. Please try logging in to the appropriate region.\"\nShe did not request this transfer and assumed it was because of a potential hacker? She changed her password but she can't login to the main website because it says invalid user password region combination. She just changed her password recently too so this whole situation is sketchy.\n\nWhat can she do? She didn't want to be placed in a different region. She doesnt even know what region shes placed in currently.\n\n\nEDIT: Yeah.. definitely hacked. The account was charged for a large amount.
