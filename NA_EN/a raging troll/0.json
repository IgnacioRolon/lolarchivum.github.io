In the case of an assault, it could have been an ongoing case of harassment which demoralized the assailant to the point of fearing to speak to authorities which finally led to a point where enough was enough and a physical blow incurred in an attempt to curb the harassment and strike fear into the harasser in order to stop the abuse. This can be applied in this situation as well where Lucian may have been continually harassing Tahm and because of previous 'reports' that have gone unheard and the flawed reporting system in itself Tahm was forced to take swift action to curb the abuse and change the tides of the interaction to save himself.\n\nThat's all a load of shit of course, but my point is that the instigator is often overlooked as the root cause of the interaction after one party attempts to solve the problem in the moment because of outside factors that may have led them to believe that is the only course of action. Punishing the person for turning around and punching the harasser in the face does not solve future occurrences of this happening, it only reinforces the harassers behaviour to create another similar situation in the future without penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2017-08-26T21:53:40.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't argue with that reasoning.
