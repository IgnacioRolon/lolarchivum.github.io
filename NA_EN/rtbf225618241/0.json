We&#x27;re pushing out fixes\n\nHey Rubinio! I know this might just be the English Major in me, but in Renekton's lore, there's a sentence that goes \"word arrived that a magical being of fire had escaped the magical sarcophagus that bound it in its underground prison.\" I know this sounds tedious, but the double use of \"magical\" sounds kind of repetitive. Just a nitpick though.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyperi√∂n","date":"2016-05-10T20:37:34.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change Magical Sarcophagus, to Enchanted Sarcophagus. That takes away the repetitiveness and gives a more vibrant tone than plain old 'Magical'","replies":[]}]}]}]}
