They typically mix and edit various studio-recorded sound effects to get what they want. The bird calls might just be an edited existing sound bite, while the magical noises would be made using some combination of real world stuff in a studio.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-05-05T06:28:12.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends.

There's all sorts of extra background noise to contend with, and the birds don't really comply with your recording equipment and call at your command, so real nature doesn't necessarily sound like the cleaned-up version in the client. :P","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-05-05T17:07:28.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well fair point but exceptions do occur in some places. I doubt it's all just white noise. Maybe they simply filtered out large parts of the actual recording to make it sound smoother.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
