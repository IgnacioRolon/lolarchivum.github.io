Fuck Yasuo and Riven and all those goddamn broken shit champs that have ruined the game! Reeee!!! Fuck balance team, i&#039;m out! *keeps playing*&quot;\n\nNo. It&#039;s more about how League has impacted my life in general. Right now, i am about to buy components to build a new computer. I&#039;m continuing high school and working at the same time. You&#039;d think &quot;Well, League seems like a nice way to pass the time inbetween, no?&quot;\n\nWell...it used to, but it&#039;s not anymore. Let me explain.\n\nThe idea i had when i first found this game was &quot;Wew, a strategy game that i can understand and actually doesn&#039;t require me to control 68 individual units separately at the same time.&quot;\n\nWell, so i decided to get gud. Regardless of my success, the game got &quot;old&quot; to me over time. Matchups i&#039;ve seen thousands of times on the same map i&#039;ve played literally thousands of times by now with the toxic kinds of people that shouldn&#039;t be allowed on the internet.\n\nSo as i anticipate my new computer, i also anticipate tons of new games i&#039;m going to play. But this requirement that i never fall off League and always stay up to date is pressuring me to play a game i don&#039;t really enjoy when there is so little left to enjoy. Did i love playing Kayn the first 100 games? Hell yes. Do i now? Well, it depends on the game.\n\nI mean as a veteran player, i've seen every single champion and played every single champion. The only thing i haven't finished doing for the \"full account experience\" is get all champs+rune pages as i am still buying the rune pages. (22/25 right now. boi!)\n\nAnd that&#039;s the problem. League burns you out pretty quickly but it&#039;s also an addiction that has interfered with my school a lot and has put me off from doing everything but playing League at times.\n\nNot to mention i literally cannot quit the game as i have a lot of money put into this account, years of my time, memories, friends, personal history and all that sentimental stuff. It&#039;s like giving away something that you spent 4 years working on almost every day like it&#039;s nothing.\n\nBut then again, i do want to turn a fresh page. I just..can&#039;t.","replies":[]}
