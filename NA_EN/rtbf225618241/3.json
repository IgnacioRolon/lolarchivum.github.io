Support players usually deal less damage than everyone else and this way, mage Supports who hard carry get enough gold anyway and won&#039;t be tagged as &quot;Support&quot;. If you are tagged as Support you get extra gold.\n\nAnd this means total damage, not damage to champions. Otherwise, everything would be a bro lane. Propably should be combined with a number of other factor such as damage taken and how many wards placed. I feel like this should trigger until after Sightstone has been bought just to make sure. High accuracy is crucial here to prevent gold income abuse.\n\nAnyway that&#039;s what i think.

I don't know how to fix that without breaking the role entirely as far as gameplay goes.\n\nMore recognition through stat tracking and pentassists could maybe be possible and could help with some of peoples issues with support, but I worry they can't change much about the gameplay without fundamentally altering how support works, and that's a very scary proposition for people who like support in it's current form (and probably for adcs who like having someone focused on helping them, at least for the early game).","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2016-11-15T04:34:48.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could be right.

With, what, 20ish gold for Frost Queens Reclaim (with a cool down mind you), a cool down on Face of the Mountain (max is 4)  and 5 gold for being near a minion with Talisman of Ascension, that gold is NOTHING compared to actual cs'ing (mind you those are at max rank.

Gold is low on Support.\n\nThat isn't to mention that these items may be \"core items\" but they do not help the actual build. Defensive items (to keep you alive)? Health, amour and mr means nothing if you cannot not deal the punishment. Because by the time you finally get to building armour, mr, or health, everyone else already has offensive items to crush that. \nSay that is your 3rd item (Not including boots). By the time you finish your first item of defense, the enemy has 3 items and building a fourth. Just getting Locket of Iron Solari means nothing if your enemy has 300 + AD/AP. \n\nGold is not sufficient with supports at all.

I play supp, and it is easy to get xp or gold. But for what?\n\nThe problem everybody knows but no-one talks about: the presence problem. \n\nEarly game presence is weak: in the past you were able to get kills on bot without jungler help. Now because of the strong regen/heal abilities, you cannot do anything in early game unless the other bot lane is stupid. It is nice to reduce the enemy hp by 80%, but they run back under tower, regen back in two minutes and your efforts are meaningless. So trading after some games are very boring, since decent supports knows how to protect themselves and the adc (that is their role). Summary: early game is boring unless the enemy does stupid things (e.g. no warding).\n\nMid game presence: this is where most supports shine. The problem is that mid game last for 10 minutes. So from a 40 minute game you can enjoy a 10 minute part. Congratulations riot.\n\nLate game presence is weak: your 1.5 sec stun is meaningless against 10000 hp tanks, your skillshots can be avoided by items the others bought (protobelt, etc.). So what can you do? Warding, initiate a teamfight, and hoping to catch somebody with cc, but if the team cannot capitalize, these are meaningless.\n\nIn the end you feel in the majority of the time you cannot influence the game. You have NO choices, you need to adapt the team choices. You can only HOPING that a team is able to capitalize on a good CC. I just saw some stream recently, and the top laner said that olaf annoys me, I kill it, and he did it. When I am annoyed by a karma, what can I do?\n\nSo what supports need: tools for having a greater presence. What about a consumable item (only supports can buy it), which allows destroying an item in the enemy inventory? Frightening isn't it? But that would give supports a presence they need.

I can tell you, AP Sona is powerful, broken, and I hate it. Just because you mained a champion does not mean you have mastered her or all possible play styles. Example: Tahm Kench. There is top lane Tahm, and there is support Tahm. Two different play styles. One is a tanky soloist, the other is a tank non soloist.\n\nso question for you? is this your troll/smurf account or your main?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-16T22:59:29.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are gonna speak on a champ as far as what they do and dont do then your history of game play and champs experience effects your point of view... hence makes you bias... we are all bias to some degree, sometimes unknowingly. and for someone who has played sona over 1500 games or so would have a more understanding over her then someone who hasnt played sona... which you claim you havent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2016-11-16T13:04:07.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't played Sona.
