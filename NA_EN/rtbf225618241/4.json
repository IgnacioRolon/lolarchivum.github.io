Every champion splash is an example of that.  Riot just has to lower the level of detail to a point where it performs well then if they have time they can figure out how to make the aesthetics better for the lower graphical lever.  This is obviously harder with more complicated concepts, but scrapping a concept and reworking a concept are two different things.\n\nObviously Riot scraps a lot of things for various reasons.  Though what baffles me is how many good ideas that would've made players get happy are scrapped and we're almost never given reasons why.  If the level of detail was the problem then certainly they have the resources to be able to manage reworking a concept.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2018-03-06T14:34:50.830+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":14,"body":"I don't think the point of Ultimate skins is to one-up the next one each time.\n\nI think the point of Ultimate skins is to give champions a better-than-normal skin that people will have fun playing as, and that people wouldn't mind paying the RP for. \n\nYes, Lux has 10 chromas in her Ultimate skin, but she can only choose two (well, three including light) each game.

That's not giving it enough credit, though.\n\nThe particle effects for each of the different variations are indeed different in ways that match the Exo-suit used. The Exo-suit animations and ultimate animations are also different.\n\nThat's where the differences stop, though. The taunts, attacks, and ability cast animations are all identical. There's no different voice-effect for the different suits's AI so the actual difference between the suits are aesthetic--the only way I can really describe it. Different suit designs and different particle designs but that's it. It's cheap, tbh.\"\n\nIt's like they took a Legendary skin, redesigned it a few times, threw it all together and call it an Ultimate skin. There's no real WOW here. Spirit Guard Udyr pushed the idea of a full character upgrade--that's all it really was: same character, updated look. Pulsefire Ezreal explored the idea of a character changing throughout the game, which is something that Elementalist Lux expands upon by giving her overall character and particles changes with each evolution. DJ Sona both expanded on the character and gave you a nice gimmick in changing the in-game BGM that's shared with your teammates. Gun Goddess Miss Fortune is just copied idea.\n\nThat said, here's a suggestion. The skin itself isn't bad, it's just cheaply executed. Each Exo-suit should carry it's own story in their gameplay; give you a reason beyond aesthetics to change the suit. There should be different taunts, different dialogue, different voice-overs, different animations for each suit. And it slips my mind so I may be wrong, but isn't the ring for her E ability the same for all skins? The suits need more variety than design and ammunition, and I think those suggestions would get people hyped for it and draw less criticism as an overpriced chroma-set. The skin is called Gun **GODDESS** for crying out loud. There's nothing very **DIVINE** about it, in any use of the term.\n\nA personal gripe is in the fact that she has no unique interactions with any Pulsefire or Star Guardian skins.
