The f*ck are you on man?\n\nMy very first post: “This is a spicy buff to Vayne's mid- and late-game teamfighting” so a buff to her mid and late game.\n\n\nSad that I have to quote the quote again because you aren’t paying attention. It is a buff to her mid and late game. From my understanding they felt she was lacking there so they added it. Now you can max W first and her q is still relevant in team fights. \n\nLike I said the message in the patch notes was sufficient for me. I’m sorry it isn’t for you.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2019-01-10T17:02:56.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/production.photos.funnyordie.com/upload/aff3567c9abaad4b798a350dc1e1b1a3/3niAkdzQiOTxZUUZ642W_Steve%20Harvey%20Face%2012.gif\n\nThat isn't an explanation. Extrapolating \"Her late game was weak i guess....\" is not sufficient reasoning. The very point of the little text above most balance changes where they explain stuff is there **because they explain stuff there**. They pointed out the obvious without anything to back it up and with no real explanation, other than interpretation which is not how you justify balance changes.\n\nI have no idea how can you suck up to such literal interpretations. It's not sufficient for any half-sentient being who knows that balance changes need to have a reason behind them, especially when they are so massive. It's like removing Nasus' W from the game and putting nothing but \"We removed his W.
