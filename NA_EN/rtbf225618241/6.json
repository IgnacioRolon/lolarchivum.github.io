It is mostly just a matter of preference. The main difference between the two is that you still cannot report individual posters on the Boards Feedback section, as that violates our naming and shaming rule, whereas you can on the discord in a private chat room with a moderator. \n\nFor this matter though (reporting an issue you are having with a Warden/Arbiter/Archivist etc., the boards feedback section is appropriate.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-07-25T20:10:05.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i can report a specific Moderator by name but i can't report a regular poster?\n\nFor example, i can report a person who is a Warden/Arbiter/Archivist etc. by name?","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-07-25T20:21:52.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, so long as it is criticism and not harassment.
