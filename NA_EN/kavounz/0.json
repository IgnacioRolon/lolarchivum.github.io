New to the game so this question might not make sense but anyway, does the content in the Hextech Crafting section expire? For example if I have Ashe and Garen champions do i have to unlock them with shards now or can i wait? Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Leyin","date":"2017-10-26T21:03:54.736+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the content like champions, skins, ward skins etc. last for ever just things like the worlds token expire, but that is always mention in the tooltip of the material","replies":[{"poster":"Kavounz","date":"2017-10-26T21:50:28.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much KNITE Lukas!

Special event content like tokens/Project crafting can expire, but normal content like chests and shards will not.  Your Ashe and Garen shards will remain until you are ready to unlock them.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Kavounz","date":"2017-10-26T21:51:43.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Porocles! That definitely clears things up!
