I really like ivern so far after watching streams of him, but why is such a unique original champion being stuck out with such a generic ult? I mean he is literally called the friend of the forest. he goes around freeing jungle camps, why is his ult just rock tibbers? it even looks like the same model as tibbers with some flowers pasted on. I would love to see some sort of interaction with jungle besides his passive. Like summoning the camps to take revenge or help him out in some way. Individually his skills are neat and unique but all together it seems to lack some cohesiveness. Like he makes brush but only his autos change while in them. Just my opinions on it whats everyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"Jurojin Wuji","date":"2016-09-21T18:16:25.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"woah, woah woah,\n\nFirst.\n\nStop calling Daisy a pet.
