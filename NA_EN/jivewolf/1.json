GLP get outclassed by the other two lost chapter ap items so just please for the love of all that&#039;s good revert it. The active sucks, the stats are decent (however when comparing it to {{item:3003}} {{item:3285}} it sucks) so please just revert the item. The old GLP was a niche item however it was actually really good for some champs apposed to none. It gave you a decent amount of mana,  health, and ap and the only other item that gives those stats is {{item:3027}} . AP supports that use those stats effectively can no longer go for a half tank half damage item now since they need early game power and {{item:3027}} just isn&#039;t good on AP supports since supports need early game power to make up for their ad&#039;s weak phase of the game. \r\n\r\nBut ya just please revert the item or at least change the item so it has a clear advantage over {{item:3285}} {{item:3003}} (I know GLP has an active but ya it kind of sucks compared to the old active or the passives the other two items have)","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-23T02:47:54.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like it as is, but that's just because I can use it as my mana/cdr item on my Glacial Augment {{champion:26}} support.\n\nIt's one of the most fun builds ever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-04-22T20:13:06.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I liked having a replacement for RoA","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-04-23T06:35:16.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say revert everything except make the fully completed item have 10% CDR (Lower some of the other stats a little in exchange). It makes it appeal to those who used to buy it and with some CDR will become more appealing to other champs as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bonipherus","date":"2018-04-23T02:41:53.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh I miss my GLP {{champion:27}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seenan","date":"2018-04-23T02:38:51.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'd like old GLP back.

The old GLP was amazing and I got it very often on supports. Orianna, Anivia, Veigar...I can still play such champs as support but it's not quite the same. With Veigar, you're kind of stuck relying a lot on Manaflow Band again, which I suppose is understandable because he was OP before, and Anivia maybe as well...but Anivia is one of the few mages that I feel like is actually going to take a big hit with the mana changes that are being planned. Orianna has a bit less control without GLP but she can still get work done. The main reason she's having trouble is her damage is kind of hard to land lately. GLP is supposed to change that, but can't unless she wants to be squishy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dethflash","date":"2018-04-22T21:13:02.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked old GLP one some champions, normally i used the active to slow the enemy and be more likely to hit my ranged CC. \nOr if i was playing a champion that usually build ROA, but i started to fall behind, i sometimes would get GLP to help prevent me from falling behind to far early game.\nBut now i dont even consider buying GLP in any situation on any champion, it just feels so bad all around. Maybe if they gave the item like 200 health i might consider occasionally in some situations","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-04-22T20:11:05.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GLP was pretty crap before, and it's still pretty crap now. The only real difference I can see is at least it gives 20% CDR now.

I never saw an ap support with {{item:3030}} or {{item:3027}} (well maybe {{champion:26}}  with rod) and honestly they realy should not go that.\nAnd also if Supports want ap and health or ap and mana there ar eplenty of options: {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3165}} {{item:2065}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3092}} , yea even {{item:3003}} can be used by zileans and sonas.\n\nLike the only champion old glp was better would be {{champion:136}} and pre reworked swain. Well swain got reworked and no longer spends mana during ult. And glp is realy better for a more variety of champions, jsut reverting for sol would not be right. It still ahs potential to be better if it needs to be buffed.\n\nBut don't act like supports need a realy strong early ap mana health item beside {{item:3098}} : I can go this and than {{item:3916}} or {{item:3136}} on most ap supports. Or classic {{item:3114}} items on enchanters.","replies":[]}]}
