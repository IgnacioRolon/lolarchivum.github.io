Both of these elements together created a conflicting character because there was next to no self-synergy at all within his kit. It was bland, it was boring, and when he wasn't trying to run in to R people, he was spamming Q. His was was not well designed at all and it showed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2017-03-24T01:19:31.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1c45Nj5t,comment-id=0004000100000000,timestamp=2017-03-24T01:01:42.058+0000)\n>\n> He had 2 generic mage abilities - he also had 2 abilities that were clearly designed for a tank.

Why shouldn't a tank/mage hybrid have two mage abilities and two tank abilities? And how were his mage abilities generic? His Q was a slow moving skillshot with high base damage, a good ratio, and a powerful slow. His E was a giant skillshot with a nice AP Ratio that ALSO MASSIVELY increased the movement speed of your allies, so not only was it good for poking, like his Q, but it could also be used to help your allies run away, engage, or chase someone down.\n\nI don't know how two mage and tank abilities create a conflicting character design for a tanky mage. I hope you're also aware that if you ran in all the time to R people, you were a selfish %%%%. His R is also great for peeling, and you can even use it to sacrifice yourself so that an ally can escape. Actually, his Q could be used to peel, too.\n\nAlso, I don't understand what \"spamming\" his Q means. It's a poke ability with a short cooldown. Should abilities not have short cooldowns? Should there not be abilities that are good for poking? And what about his E? That could be used for poke, too, and it had a relatively short cooldown at max rank. I remember using E just as often as I did using Q.\n\nAlso, his shield gave him AP from his passive, which increased his damage from Q, E, R, and even the shield itself. His Q, combined with his E, was very useful for helping catch an enemy trying to escape, and then ulting them to finish them off. His W also worked great with his ult, since it healed you, and his ult had 50% damage reduction on it. Therefor, healing+damage reduction= being even tankier.\n\nI don't understand any of your points.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-24T01:23:31.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"KILLER QUEEN? \n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/jjba/images/7/70/Killer_Queen_Concept.png/revision/latest?cb=20160819193253","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-03-22T11:38:12.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-03-22T10:13:08.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I don't.
