Since I just got some dumb automated answer, which didnt help me at all because i had already done all the things the reply said, i will post this here. I just got a new comp (windows 10, i7 2.6 ghz, GTX 960m) which is more than enough to run LOL. Every LOL game i get into I get this graphical bug which actually made my computer crash once, so i really need to get this fixed. So far i already run LOL as admin, I have updated drivers, and have tried rolling back my graphics driver, i clicked the repair button in the client, i reinstalled the league client. The only other game i have on this laptop is COD 5 which runs smoothly, so i definitely should be able to run league.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-07T00:42:07.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate to be that guy, but the best step you can take is to respond to the ticket and provide the information they requested (DxDiag, R3d Log, Process List).  If you've tried the common solutions already, we are going to need to take a in-depth look into your logs to figure out why this is occurring.  Unfortunately, we can't pour over these logs here on Boards as they have some fairly sensitive information in them.  Once you provide these logs, a Tech Specialist should be able to help you out 1-on-1 until we find a solution.\n\nI hope this gets resolved ASAP!","replies":[]}]}
