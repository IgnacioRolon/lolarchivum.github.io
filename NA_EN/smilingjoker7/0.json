The problem isn't that I'm low priority, it's the why it happened. Every time I start a game after champion select ends my game will not load at all. It doesn't even say the connection wasn't established or anything it immediately just gives me the reconnect button. Doesn't matter how many times I click it, it'll pretend to load for half a second before it's back and and I can click it again. AFAIK nothing has changed with my PC since last week when I played league. I've never had this issue before either and already tried repairing the client, reinstalling, flushing my DNS, resetting my internet, shutting off all firewalls, proxy is definitely off, among a few other things. After having it happen twice in a row I decided just trying out different modes in custom and training but the result was the same.  The only thing I couldn't do was renew my IP.\r\n \r\nAny ideas?\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2017-11-29T22:48:59.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can definitely be frustrating trying to troubleshoot what's causing that issue, but it sounds like you're taking some good steps in trying to fix the problem!
