I think you guys will be interested in it as well. Riot will not tell us the facts but that doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t figure it out ourselves. All credits go to richkcho for doing the statistical analysis. All the below is quoted from his report which is linked at the bottom of this post.\n\n> I amassed 61977 matches which included at least one challenger or master player. The data scraping attempted to obtain around 100 of the most recent ranked matches per player in challenger/master in this case starting from April 23rd. (This would vary based on players activity, inactive players would have older games in their past 100 games compared to a more active player)\n> \n> The matches were analyzed to find premades, premades being a group of players who have played at least 10 games together on the same team. There were a total of 1129 games which had at least one 5 man premade. (this might be why Riot doesn&#039;t care, matches that include premade 5&#039;s statistically speaking are a small minority of matches) The team facing the 5 man premade had the following distribution of premades:\n> \n> *  5 solo: 255 (23%)\n> *  1 duo, 3 solo: 313 (28%)\n> *  2 duo, 1 solo: 58 (4%)\n> *  1 trio, 2 solo: 220 (19%)\n> *  1 trio, 1 duo: 45 (4%)\n> *  1 quad, 1 solo: 168 (15%)\n> *  another 5 man premade: 70 (6%)\n> \n> I also ran win-rate analysis. The win rates of the 5 man premade vs the other team based on the premade breakdown of the other team is as follows:\n> * vs 5 solo: 70% (179/255)\n> * vs 1 duo, 3 solo: 58% (183/313)\n> * vs 2 duo, 1 solo: 60% (35/58)\n> * vs 1 trio, 2 solo: 63% (138/220)\n> * vs 1 trio, 1 duo: 53% (24/45)\n> * vs 1 quad, 1 solo: 54% (91/168)\n\n> So Riot decided to limit the premade size to three as a band-aid approach to fix the problems elaborated above. The natural question is is this fair?\n> \n> I ran the same analysis on the dataset but this time focusing on 3-man premades. There were 8170 games with at least one 3-man premade (excluding any games with 4 or 5 man premade). The breakdown of the premade distributions of teams playing against a team with a 3-man premade were:\n>\n> * 5 solo: 4012 (49%)\n> * 1 duo, 3 solo: 2978 (36%)\n> * 2 duo, 1 solo: 548 (7%)\n> * a group with a 3-man premade: 632 (8%)\n>\n> Win rates were as follows:\n> * vs 5 solo: 61% (2464/4012)\n> * 1 duo, 3 solo: 54% (1604/2978)\n> * 2 duo, 1 solo: 52% (386/548)\n\nTl;dr, Premades play teams of mostly solo players the majority of the time and destroy them.\n\nFull report: https://github.com/richkcho/league_of_tilt/blob/master/other/flaws_of_dynamic_queue.md","replies":[{"poster":"GlÃ®tchy","date":"2016-06-16T20:32:39.074+0000","up_votes":102,"down_votes":13,"body":"5 man teams win 70% of games, I vote that we get solo queue back, sick of losing to teams of toxic brats","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2016-06-16T23:15:49.891+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":5,"body":"In challenger and masters.

I just don't want people who come into this thread thinking that the 70% win rate is supported by the thread's title claim of a sample size of 61,977 games.\n\n> Also that is games with at least a single challenger or master player. Thus it is very applicable to mid-high diamond. It's definitely a biased sample, but that doesn't mean it isn't as bad for lower tier players. I can think of arguments for why it would be both better and worse.\n\nGeneralization, however, is not something that I think this set of analysis has. Riot has specifically stated that the match maker does not work well within the highest tiers of play. Even if these games sit in mid to high diamond (seems doubtful to me?) then the vast majority of the player base is still not going to be easily generalized with this analysis.\n\n> In summary - its still completely unacceptable.\n\nThat would be why there is still work to be done. Do keep in mind though that in the given all of the 61,977 games sampled only 255 of them were actually a 5-man premade against 5 solo players, which equates to **0.4% of the total sample**.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2016-06-17T10:14:43.788+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dukevonart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4tsuGXEq,comment-id=00040002,timestamp=2016-06-16T23:34:03.890+0000)\n>\n> ftfy\n\nlyte used 250 games to talk about toxicity and tribunal","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xBushx","date":"2016-06-16T19:16:38.738+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":60,"body":"Riot did give this info.

You could even say they are \"outliers\" in a data set for how much different their skill level is compared to the rest of the population (think SKT skill vs. normal player).\n\n3) **Your data set is TINY when you look at certain \"samples\" in your data.** A group of 45 games to tell you what the ENTIRE population does?

People aren't arguing that Challenger premades are more successful than Bronze premades when playing against solos, they're arguing that Challenger premades are more likely to face a team of 5 solos than Bronze premades, simply because of player population size (much less likely for there to be a 2nd 5-man premade in Challenger where you have a few hundred players vs. Bronze where you have hundreds of thousands).\n\nIn other words, the stats in question isn't the winrate, but the premade vs. solo matchmaking distribution (i.e. the first half of OP's data)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PM Faker Nudes","date":"2016-06-16T20:35:08.796+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThePartyLeader,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4tsuGXEq,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-06-16T20:33:23.831+0000)\n>\n> Not how it works.
