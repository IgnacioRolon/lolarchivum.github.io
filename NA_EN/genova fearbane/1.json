It's tough as a supp when you dive the enemy carry and get it all right just to have a team just stand there or blow ults as described.  Thats why I stopped running tank supps like Leona, Braum etc and started playing more mage supps like Morg.  I can control the fight more and depend less on follow up.  If I land a morg Q it's a free for all of throwing skittles at them.","replies":[{"poster":"BetterCallSoul","date":"2016-10-12T14:31:52.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"''Then you're not praising hard enough.''
