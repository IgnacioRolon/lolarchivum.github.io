Gnar is an example of what should not be. Why would we consider him when discussing that is and isn't ok? Liss is a short range utility mage. 2 of her abilities are skillshots, one which moves extremely slow, and if she uses it offensively, she has no escape.

They stop becoming skillshots when you're rooted/point-click stunned by her other abilities\n\nWhat you're saying about liss' mobility applies to everyone else that has a mobility skill, only everyone else doesn't get good damage and cc to go along with it.  \n\nThe now they don't have an escape argument  applies to everyone with a gapcloser except they don't get multiple cc to keep you from getting anywhere near them if they mess up their engage, cc which can't be missed if used with any competence(use w/r and then the rest of the kit is effectively no longer skillshot-based). If she misses q she just snares or worst case ults you(or herself in the case of a dive) and walks away or turns on you b/c that q will be back up in 2-3s so she'll probably win the 1v1 due to you not being able to ever actually get into melee range of her.\n\nLulu had a pseudo-stun that still allowed movement or an ms boost on a lengthy cd, a skillshot slow that ate up her mana with a 7s cd, a shield or damage spell, and a potential knockup with a slow aura attached that did no damage but gave bonus health and a passive that allowed her to do a little extra damage with autos that could be blocked by minions.\n\nLiss gets a skillshot slow that does a similar thing that only has a 3s cd at max rank with 0cdr, an aoe snare that is guaranteed to hit anyone that tries to go into melee range of you, dash/blink type escape that also doubles as a damage spell in case you're all-inning someone, and a point-click stun nuke/zhonyas that leaves behind a field that slows everyone around it and damages them too.\n\nSo yeah liss is a more offensive-oriented version of lulu that gets equal or greater amounts of cc potential, much more damage and much higher scalings, along with a free mana passive that lets her get the edge against melees early game without going oom, but no lulu was a problem and liss definitely isn't. /sarcasm","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2015-01-25T16:17:36.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hate the nerfs Lulu received, she's an awesome champion with a really well designed kit.\nI also think she should be compensated, her win rate as support was already less than 50% before the nerfs.\nRiot said they tried to not hurt Lulu so much but her mana costs are insane and her vision on an enemy with her Help, Pix! was shortened which was perfect for chasing and countering stealth champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Justaco","date":"2015-01-25T06:32:47.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"To be fair Sona mid should probably never be allowed to be viable.
