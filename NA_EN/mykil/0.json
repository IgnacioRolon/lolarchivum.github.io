Now those of you who have done the update will have noticed a few things. firstly, your weekly rotating game modes are no longer available. i.e. you will never be able to play any other mode other than Summoners rift, Twisted treeline, or ARAM. The client is laggy, implying that latency is now an issue (that&#039;s fucking ridiculous as far as clients go). There are plenty of bugs, I am aware it is beta but dont release it to the public while its still so shit?! For a big company, thats just embarrassing not to mention incredibly frustrating! Once you have the new client installed there is no going back and you are stuck with a 1GB fuck up as your client! Now Im willing to take a lot from Riot as I have been playing this game for 7 years and it has brought me much joy, however, this new client may be the last straw for me! It may be months before you fix the issue of not being able to see the rotating game modes, furthermore it appears as if you are making it a reward incentive to NOT update to the new client. Does that not seem counter intuitive? I mean fucking really!?!!  At least allow us the option to roll back to the previous client for now? Or alternatively hurry up on the fixes!? I would really hate to have to stop playing this game just because your programmers cannot make a simple thing like a client work? Im willing to bet if you look not too far from your own player base you will come across developers who will finish this client in a matter of days! Come on Riot! Please fix this?   HEROES OF THE STORM  is starting to look mighty enticing in light of this new client ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T18:56:24.606+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This updated client is currently in beta testing, so not everything is available or working to perfection.  You do not have to participate in the testing and can return to the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI know you have a lot of feedback, and encourage you to constructively share it with the client developers over at the[ client discussion ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)boards.  Thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackcigarre","date":"2016-11-20T15:20:04.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then dont use it. Its pretty neato burrito imo, it acutally loads, doesnt dc at all and the shop isnt laggy. Not to say after game lobby shows more stats like warding etc.","replies":[]}]}
