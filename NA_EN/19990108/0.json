I cannot change the runes pages when I am at client, so I only have 3pages that can be used, but when I ban\\pick champion and want to change runes, they become exactly the same name, such as I have AP AD AD attack speed,but when I chose the champion ,they become AP AP AP. The most serious is I always got wrong runes in game. I take AP runes for AD carry, take AD runes for AP champion,  I think this problem is personally so I want to you could help me to resolve it please. \r\nI hope you can check my email as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-05T17:31:37.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've seen a few issues with stuck or duplicating rune pages when trying to move them around or giving them a name with special characters.
