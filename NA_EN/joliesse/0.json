Lately I've been having these issues in game:\r\n\r\n- Champions keep gliding around\r\n- No walking animation, but suddenly everyone has shifted\r\n- Delays when clicking to move or pressing abilities (for example, I press Q on Thresh but the hook seems to go out literally one or two seconds after I've pressed the button)\r\n- Ping spikes to over 400 ms (I play from Asia, but it's usually around 200 ms which is playable for me)\r\n\r\nI play on a Macbook Pro, no Ethernet.\r\nCan anyone see if this is just a classic Wi-Fi problem, or something else? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ssouthpaw","date":"2016-09-28T21:36:51.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the EXACT same problem but I'm using wired internet.

To be honest, playing on Wifi can certainly be a culprit of this.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot this, starting with a wired connection if possible.  Make sure to select the Mac box for instructions specific to your issue.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
