I couldn't find any solution online.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T16:44:29.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be happening for a variety of reasons like corrupt configurations especially if modifications were made, or even a bad hardware.  My suggestions would be to first use another mouse/keyboard to rule out hardware possibilities.  If that doesn't work, try resetting your config though keep in mind you'll have to redo your bindings:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"xXAspectXx","date":"2018-01-16T05:46:29.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem but this didn't work for me.","replies":[]}]}]}
