One aspect of being an introvert is paying a ton of attention into detail making sure everything is perfect. (although it's hard to be perfect) I've also took a DISC personality test at my workplace and I'm a high S/CI. Long story short I'm someone who wants to be around a positive atmosphere but also pay attention to lots of details.\nExperience:\n1. I'm a Shift Leader at Chick Fil A, there are a some qualities you need to have in order to be a Shift Leader.\n- Being a thermostat and not a thermometer (Being able to stay cool even when the situation is not looking too hot.)\n- Constant feedback/growth to other team members\n- Having the perspective of the upside down pyramid (Leaders are nothing without their followers)\n2. Coached/Managed my own team: Final Rank - 3 different platinum 5 teams in s4\n- Analyzing and writing down both team/player feedback\n- Reading patches / Analyzing other players, and Team play\n- Strong belief that structures create behaviors\n- Making sure the team is both mentally/mechanically stable\nConclusion: My boss always tells me that life should never be easy, of matter of fact life should be hard. If life was easy no one would strive for personal excellence. I believe with a ton of grinding and personal growth I would be a good asset to this team.

Initially I got into it playing with college friends, but most of them have since moved on from the game.

I have played every position each for many games. I own and play nearly every champion in the game (part of why I am not particularly good at actually playing the game, I am not well practiced on any one champion because I own and play too many).
