I accept the Accept or Decline timer. I'm Unable to see any messages on the champ select chat, I can't lock in a champion, I can't change summoner spells, masteries or runes. When the 0 mark reaches my client freezes on zero and I'm forced to close champ select. If I quit before the 0 I get a dodge timer and if I leave it I'm forced into a game with no idea what lane I'm in, what summoner spells ect ect. It's very annoying because if I dodge again my timer will be 30 minutes and I really don't want to wait 30 minutes for a game. Could you please help me, redirect me to an existing support form or take my dodge penalties away.","replies":[]}]}]}
