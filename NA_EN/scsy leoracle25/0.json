I wasn't ever able to see the Chat Box or see the Club on my Social Tab. Honestly it didn't bother me at first but for months now i've been without it. My sister in law provided the screenshot showing i'm still the owner and still part of the club, but when someone sends a message in it, it doesn't notify me, it doesn't pop up the window, literally nothing happens.\r\n\r\nNow I know months ago people were having the same problem, and whether others are still experience an issue or not, I do not know, but it's really starting to get on my nerves as its one of the only ways I can get a team game started or even just converse with my team all at the same page aside from using discord or something else.\r\n\r\nSo what can be done to fix this or how is it even fixable?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T23:44:08.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes clubs lose their link with certain players, and honestly, I'm not even sure why this happens.
