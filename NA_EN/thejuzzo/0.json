Blasted minions, fed other laners,  pushed waves when we should have been freezing near turret. I was Jinx, and thinking that id get to late game and be useful, however top lane mundo fed a bunch of kills to Jax...blamed jungle, started feeding (and talking about feeding..we will see if the report works) and generally talking smack to our team...he caused a melt-down. \n\nAnother rare occurrence.\n\n\nIll try number 3 tonight.\n\n\n\n**Edit**: After watching some \"top soloq players\" games, had a realization. \n\nThis is just how the game is, doesn't matter if bronze or challenger.\n\nFirst game I saw a guy named japaneseman (Or japanman or something) feed a bunch of kills as TF mid, then go stand in the fountain...every now and then he would move a little, most likely to avoid an afk, but the bad part was that the rest of the team was doing well, and held out for quite a while before losing....Although I cant read the chat on spectated games, Ill bet it was the junglers fault or something, guy didn't do well so didn't want to play any more. Team would ping him sometimes, then he would do a lap or two around the fountain before just standing there again. (Baby)\n\nNext game was a complete one sided stomp, losing team surrendered at 20.\n\nLast game I saw piglet feeding. He got killed a few times in bot lane as Lucian, then every time he went to lane he was going all in, over and over and over (and dying)...Just like the baddies I complain about...obviously piglet is no baddie though.\n\n\nThis is the same crap that bothers me in my games, I think the entire game is just like this and either you deal or you leave. \n\nTLDR: Game is just like this, from the lowest to highest ranks.

At the time he made it he was referring to any form of disciplinary action enacted on players, which, at the time, was exclusively an account suspension. The suspension durations ranged from 24 hours to 14 days depending on severity of case and the number of past transgressions.\n\nI personally had over 8000 tribunal cases and over 6000 correct verdicts. One of my friends had 12000 correct verdicts. Combined between 5 people our total correct verdicts numbered around 50k.

Too difficult to surmise accurately and I don't have any info about what cases my group doubled up on except for one, which just so happened to be some one from our play group. We voted to punish. Mostly for the lols when we told him about it.\n\nI'm just saying that's from 5 participants in just one region. Extrapolation with even a conservative estimate with respect to overlap is going to put the number quite a bit higher than lyte mentioned. Lyte made no specifications as to region, so the assumption is that when he said population he meant it's entirety.

It was never a good system to implement and it's never worked well. The addition of the league system and the arbitrary promotion series only did one thing. I'll get to it in a sec. The old elo system had 5 natural chaos points around the mmr points that defined each tier. When you approached these points is when \"elo hell\" would emerge because of, as you stated, the increased tension and pressure of players playing to finally achieve a goal. Trolling around these points was always much greater than points where ranking up or down was not the end result of a game. With the addition of the league system riot introduced 4 new chaos vortices WITHIN each division, or 4 additional points at which trolling would occur due to players being overly invested in those particular games. Thus, instead of having 5 widely separated \"elo hell\" chaos vortices we now have 5 in every tier and an additional tier to go along with it. That means we now have 30+ points along the ladder at which toxicity is at it's highest. In other words, riot decided instead of having a couple of toxic rungs on the ladder that the whole ladder needed to be toxic. That's pretty much the exact opposite of what riot says it's policy is, namely that the company works to reduce toxicity. They do not, folks. They are lying to you when they say this. Why?

It was never a good system to implement and it's never worked well. The addition of the league system and the arbitrary promotion series only did one thing. I'll get to it in a sec. The old elo system had 5 natural chaos points around the mmr points that defined each tier. When you approached these points is when \"elo hell\" would emerge because of, as you stated, the increased tension and pressure of players playing to finally achieve a goal. Trolling around these points was always much greater than points where ranking up or down was not the end result of a game. With the addition of the league system riot introduced 4 new chaos vortices WITHIN each division, or 4 additional points at which trolling would occur due to players being overly invested in those particular games. Thus, instead of having 5 widely separated \"elo hell\" chaos vortices we now have 5 in every tier and an additional tier to go along with it. That means we now have 30+ points along the ladder at which toxicity is at it's highest.

Sure it can't be proven but to make it seem as thought if 10000 players play 100 games each and they all will have the exact amount of afkers ratio on their team to enemy is just wrong completely. It averages out but can take a very long time to do so. I have played droprate games and have exceeded the rate of it by 3 times on majority of the good ones being 1.5+3.0 the droprate after many hours of doing it and never had anything to make up for all the way below average rates after years. Yeah if you talk about overall average or a very long test period but its very possible for one person to play 100 games and get 2/3 of the overall afkers out of both teams. Everybody experience differs just like some people won't see stupid builds as much as others. Also attitudes can affect other peoples and end up leading them to play worse or purposely die since people are affected by other peoples actions a lot of times. That whole 56% 44% thing is becoming popular and it does apply a lot of times and a lot of people do lose because their skill and its easier to blame others than yourself but I know there are people out there with 200 ranked games that the %'s are against them, And if they are better but not too much better than its very hard for them to climb unless the enemy performs bad if they happen to get the odds against them when it matters more like placements. People refuse to believe that peoples experiences vary and act like if you lose its always your fault. I wonder if these same people would report somebody that is AFK because why if it has no effect it shouldn't matter but maybe they just like reporting if they do it. Solo q you can't rely on people but also you can have the odds against you more often than your best friend billy who plays solo also with the same exact skill level achieving a higher ranking because so. You can also get a ranking you don't qualify for by getting teammates to do the most work. Ranking does matter for the most part but its not definite.
