Normally, being someone who isn't in NA but plays NA anyway, my ping is around 220, and it dropped down to 175 after the Chicago move. The last few patches though have sent my ping skyrocketing up to anywhere between 250 and 700, with wild fluctuations.\r\n\r\nI have tested in two separate computers, 4 separate accounts and two separate locations, wired and wireless. I have turned off all background programs, no change. Closing Skype/Steam/browsers only improves ping by 10ish and the fluctuations up to 700 remain. My ping is incredibly high no matter what. There is no issue with other games - playing on a Chicago TF2 server is not a problem, I can get 170 ping on such a server.\r\n\r\nRunning a tracert goes fine until the very last hop, where the ms skyrockets, like so: 15   257 ms   301 ms   881 ms  104.160.131.1 \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. I want to be able to last-hit again.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-12T23:45:00.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Blu Medic, \n\nYou have tried a lot of different things! o.o You may want to submit a ticket into Riot Support with all of the processes you have tried.
