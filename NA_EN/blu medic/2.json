A big part of this is the MMR Scare, after a doctor Wakefield published a paper claiming that the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine caused autism. The paper was discredited {[link](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452)} due to having basic problems (tiny sample size, no control group, no double-blind testing, etc.) and no other studies could prove any link between the MMR vaccine and autism {[link](http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/419?ijkey=de46be4bb4c2323fe07017c83125d186869d9cde&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha)}.\r\n\r\nThere have been other vaccination scares as well. In the US, people claim that the preservatives used are dangerous {[link](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html)}. But vaccinations are important for the majority to receive, as not only do they protect the individual from illness, but they also protect those who physically cannot have vaccinations, via herd immunity {[link](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/index.html)}.\r\n\r\nBut enough of my rambling. What do you all think of vaccinations? Are you still swayed by Wakefield&#039;s retracted paper and what the misguided media and confused mums say? Or are you happy to immunize yourself and your (potential) children?\r\n\r\nWhy am I asking? Because I hope you&#039;re all sane enough to know that we kinda need vaccinations.","replies":[]}
