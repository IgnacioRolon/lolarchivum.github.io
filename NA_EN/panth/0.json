I freaked out and ran when I realised I was bugged instead of lasthitting the Ziggs. Couldn&#039;t recall or anything. Tried reconnecting etc. Eventually by chance I stunned a minion a few minutes later and it got things working again.\n\nFrom the replay below, right after I landed on the Ziggs & stunned/ speared (at 0:12 in the video), I wasn't able to use any abilities after that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEHs1Hc0EVU\n\nI experienced this bug on Pantheon in the past, season 6 or 5, and even before that I think.\n\nHere&#039;s a forum post from 2014 complaining about it http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1658505\n\nI thought it was gone from the game but seems like it&#039;s back with the recent patch?\n\nHave seen others complaining about it here which confirms it&#039;s not just me\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PantheonMains/comments/5uzve1/bug_huge_bug_with_pantheon_right_now/","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2017-02-23T12:25:38.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If my theory is right, fixed for 7.5","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-02-23T13:59:58.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed for 7.5? what.... so he is just going to have this bug whole patch.
