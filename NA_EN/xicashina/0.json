For example, I always use Officer Vi and did so _before_ new champ select was released, in new champ select Vi pops up with Officer showing 1st.\n\nChampions that I have not played with a skin before the new champ select, keep reverting to classic skin. For example, I bought Koi Nami _after_ the new champ select was released, in new champ select Nami pops up with classic showing 1st.\n\nI'm talking out of my ass now, but it's almost as though playing the old champ select with the skin 'locked it in' for future games, but the new champion select doesn't do this. It just goes with whatever skin I last used in the old champ select, be it Officer Vi, Safari Caitlyn or Classic Nami.\n\nEDIT: I can't actually test this any further while the new champ select is down. I have since played a few games of Koi Nami with old champ select, but don't know what effect that might have had. \nI should mention I don't have a great sample size, I play a pretty limited champion pool and already have most of the skins I want. Koi Nami is the only champion/skin I've noticed this with and is the only skin I've bought after new champ select was released.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-21T20:36:31.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the additional context here!","replies":[{"poster":"iHerring","date":"2016-01-23T06:20:41.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minor update.\nI played a normal draft, swapping from Classic to Koi Nami.\nJust played another normal draft, but this time Koi Nami showed 1st.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xicashina","date":"2016-01-20T23:32:03.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes: It was in the same game too\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2073205756/227656592?tab=overview\n\nIts happened to me in previous games though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-01-21T16:22:30.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed this too.
