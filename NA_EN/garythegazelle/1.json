I thought &quot;actions speak louder than words&quot; and all that yadda yadda. But apparently not to riot or our peers. It appears that your actions have no consequences in this game whatsoever. Not to the administration, and not even to other players. In my experience you can: feed, steal buffs from your jungler, refuse to do common sense things for the good of the team, afk for a while(so long as you dont &#039;quit&#039; the game), and whatever other actions you deem appropriate to sabotage the game for other people. Almost noone will report you! However, if you are the guy expressing your disdain in not so kind words towards this malignant entity; YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. Other players will even start to band together to DEFEND this person. Im not sure if its the community in and of itself or just the product of riots preschool mentality towards social issues; wherein propagating the use of ridiculous labels and creating a ubiquitous term that can apply to anything you care to proffer as such is acceptable. In most cases the situation is never taken into account when maledictions and vitriol fly. Riot simply slaps people on the wrist for saying \"no no words\" in this black and white morally ambiguous community. \"Well, if you said the no no word to the other player you deserve whatever it is riot decides.\" I see time and time again on these boards.","replies":[{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2017-01-31T13:55:02.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long story short:\n\ntrolling is harder to detect then flaming\n\ntrolling gets punished harder then flaming\n\nfirst offense flaming: 10 Games with chat restriction\n\nfirst offense trolling (selling items and build stupid, griefing or feeding) is 14 day ban.\n\nPeople which **just act** like they play on a low level are hard to detect for the bot, the system could punish people which are just bad if poor plays get punished.","replies":[{"poster":"GaryTheGazelle","date":"2017-01-31T13:57:52.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not only a question of riots response to trolling.

Do you know how often i read in my games that i should stop trolling? Just because i did a stupid play. \n\nAt some point in the far future there will be this one guy which just give me the last hit with \"Can you fking stop trolling idiot?\" and i will start to show him what trolling is. That's at least what i am afraid of. \n\nAll the idiots calling people out for trolling should be banned for 2 days. Srsly. It tilts me so hard. And reasons why people are doing that are streamer like gripex which calls his teammates monkey and trolls all the way even when they just fk up a situation on mistake.\n\nIf you want to see real trolls just keep calling them out, some of them will start to show you what trolling is and run it down mid or block your recall with a trundle pillar. THEN you know what trolling is.\n\nOn the oder side:\n\nif somebody is actualy realy trolling on purpose like blocking your escape with his anivia wall or bard ult then nobody in this game would hate you for calling you out.

There's a difference from going Ultimate Bravery - Blue Build Riven and just having a different itemization that suits or supports your team's or your own shortcomings. \n\nPeople will see something like a TF or Sona with Rapid Firecannon as the 3rd-5th item but everything else can be as conventional as any other recommended build. Just that one item and someone just points out \"stop trolling.\" \n\nI tend to build a Frozen Mallet on most of my Marksmen champs (yes, and Ashe before Frost Shot became passive) because I would at least like some health to last out. Everything else can be just what would be on a standard build and I had one game where after a single lost team fight and someone asked \"why are you building tank?\"\n\nI've had two ARAM cases as well. The first, I'd build Face of the Mountain on almost any melee tank (if I were going tank route for the game) but something like having a Garen, Sejuani or Maokai going full tank with 4 flaming orbs around them is enough to register as \"trolling.\" \n\nThe second case is Soraka. I play aggressive, so I don't put a point in W until lv4 because of the terrible trade off (50% reduced healing on the map in case you didn't know). Despite still bringing windspeakers, a bit of AP and some CD, I still don't want to trade 90-100 of my HP to give 30-60 back. I remember someone saying to \"stop trolling and heal me\" before the W nerfs she got a couple of patches ago, so I did. Every time early game the player got low, I healed him up to about half and got immediately killed for it along with him by a stray skill shot. That ensued flaming, and I couldn't help but to laugh a bit at it. We still made it a close game.\n\nIt sucks that some players don't think or notice different approaches to certain champs. They know what they know and if it's not what they know then it's trolling.

You can mute toxic people. You can't do anything about a troll intentionally losing the match.\n\nAs far as people saying you deserve whatever riot decides is a fair punishment... I think they just mean, you should read the summoners code and obey it. If you were toxic, you know that's against Riot's rules, thus you deserve Riots punishment for breaking Riots rules. That I do agree with, actually. It's simple to not break their rules but people do it anyways and then cry that they don't deserve the punishment.

It is difficult to tell a bad game from intentional feeding sometimes, but intentional feeding is a two week ban on first detection. How would you feel if you had a bad game where you died like 10-15 times and then got banned? Another thing is that the punishments for this are not as visible. People generally know what they  were doing to get punished for intentionally feeding so they do not post on the forums to question it.\n\nYou can steal buffs from your jungler. They are your team's buffs, not your jungler's buffs. As long as you are trying to win the game, the jungle is yours and the lane is the jungler's. Taxing is not punishable, and taking jungle mobs is not punishable.\n\nA lot of things you see as \"common sense\" is probably not for most people. There have been a lot of times where people tell me to do something, and I know that doing that is stupid and will do nothing but feed them kills and objectives, then I get harassed for not doing them. It is difficult to tell these apart as well.\n\nYou can not afk for a while. The leaverbuster can tell if you are just staying in a general area or are just clicking to keep the game from kicking you. I have heard that people get punished for this, although people don't post stuff about getting LPQ's often on the forums because they generally know what they were doing.\n\nYou absolutely can not perform actions to sabotage the game for other people. Unless you are talking about the enemy team, in which case that is the point of the game. A lot of the things that fall under this category is punishable by a two week ban but hard to detect. It would probably take a manual review to check most of them.","replies":[]}]}
