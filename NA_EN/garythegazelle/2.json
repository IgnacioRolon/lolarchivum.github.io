So if you guys can tell me how this is overtly negative and how I was such a horrible person in ONE game that i got permanently banned for it, please.\n\nEdit: I know most of you don't care and think ever saying anything rude to anyone is a capital offense.

You were already on thin ice and was still toxic. It didn't matter how small it was any type of rule breaking would have given you the next tier punishment which is a permaban.

You seem to be constantly harassing the Galio. He just got a rework, people are going to be playing him. Some will do good as other will play poorly. then you keep asking for reports which is considered harassment since you would only need to say it to keep the negativity up in the game. Especially since that is not how reports work it's basically useless to do. If he was breakin the rules keep it to yourself and report him after the game since it only takes one report to get someone reviewed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-03-25T11:29:46.851+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GaryTheGazelle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fulcbKEO,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-25T11:17:44.433+0000)\n>\n> Yeah?

Literally nothing you said was positive. If you would have said positive things, that much negativity wouldn't have mattered.

You made the negative environment or at the very least kept it ignited that your team and the enemy team had to burn through. And who knows how many other times you acted this negative and harassing, even in your recent games.\n\nAs others already said, you harassed and threatened to report him for inting...but was he really? Was he really throwing himself at the enemy team without any effort of a fight? Was he really 0 / ## / # < 3 with a bunch of concentrated deaths in one or two parts of the map? **That** is more believable intentional feeding. Reporting for playing a champ without experience or \"trolling?\" Doesn't exist as an option.  Players should feel comfortable to play what they want but that's often not the best circumstance and it's unfortunate that it happens from time to time, especially in ranked and especially when a new champion/rework comes crashing in.\n\nSorry, but you only brought the ban upon yourself.

Like Rossy has been trying to explain...two wrongs don't make a right. \n\nAt any rate, I'm going to guess that most of these permaban situations take into account everything in the chat.  They aren't just looking for that one bad word (though there are some that I would guess get you the boot)....they are looking at the overall picture.  The OP was obviously salty at Galio all game, and then started in on other team mates.\n\nREMEMBER, no one gets permabanned for one incident.  \n\nOne thing that all of these \"un permaban me plz\" threads have in common is that the OP always talks A LOT.
