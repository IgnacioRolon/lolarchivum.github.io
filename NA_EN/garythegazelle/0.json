They want obligatory politically correct phrases to be regurgitated at the right times and a perfect world with no conflict. In a competitive game. Its kind of a joke. Any conflict no matter how minor is responded to with disdain and punishment. They are trying to inculcate every player with a preschool mentality of sharing and caring and that everyone is always a winner no matter what. So if you express yourself, even as you would in real life amongst friends or any REAL people in any REAL social situation, you&#039;re deemed &quot;toxic&quot;. Which is a nonsensical phrase used to refer to anyone who doesnt subscribe to this preschool mentality of &quot;dont say no no words, you might hurt timmy&#039;s feelings&quot;. Gg riot. Should rename your game to &quot;Little League Of Funtime and Happiness&quot; and designate it an official safe-space. Hey, you could appeal to the millenials and gender-fluid who need a happy place. Honestly, just remove the chat system. Not everyone is always going to adhere to your silly take on morality. The only thing you people want to see in the chat is the obligatory: &quot;gg&quot; &quot;have fun&quot; &quot;nice play!&quot; and stupid PC shit like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-02-03T23:14:37.169+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"mature adults actually know how to respect each other more and give properly worded constructive criticisms.\n\nCompare that to the immature beings that like to throw unproductive insults at each other.\n\nI think Riot is onto something good.","replies":[{"poster":"xXRaichopXx","date":"2017-02-04T06:42:08.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!

Answer: it's not. A better way to phrase that sentence is \"Hey, I can tell you're struggling to farm in mid lane, so maybe just swap bot and farm there\". This way you're not starting off with a poor attitude/an insult and instead are just suggesting a solution to help them out more.

Obviously no ones perfect and we all get angry and frustrated every now and then, but we can help reduce how that effects us or others by being smart about how we give our tips/advice to others. We can also just try to choose other outlets for venting our frustration, such as punching a pillow or screaming at the screen.\n \n> My overall point is that people that get offended easily respond to toxicity and that creates even more toxicity.

I myself get frustrated as well, usually due to my own poor performances, but I tend to just yell at the monitor or punch a pillow when that happens. Personally though even though I like winning I'd rather have people on my team who are respectful to others and don't mind joking around every now and then than have a flamer on my team, even if the former results in a loss.
