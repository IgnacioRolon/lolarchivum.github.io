It ruins the true essence of a game seeing a vayne top, a Lucian mid, and a ezreal jungle. Although streamers and pro players may display you being able to get fed and all with these champs overall they do not provide much usefulness late game or in team fights which is what lower elo is failing to understand. The use of traditional champions would help lower elo players understand champions more and actually climb. Plus it makes the game extremely hard having to fight a Lucian mid or any other.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-11-24T16:23:50.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you telling streamers not to have fun in their games?  Not to play the game how they want to play it?\n\nIf someone wants to take vayne top and the team agrees to it then I don't see any problem.  In fact, Vayne top probably works better at low elos than high elos.  Lucian mid and ezreal jungle are actual meta picks so idk what your problem is there.","replies":[{"poster":"whitefoxes","date":"2017-11-24T17:53:02.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying anyone should stop anything I'm just simply posting something I think can be relatable to those who endure these struggle bud.","replies":[{"poster":"whitefoxes","date":"2017-11-24T17:59:02.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and also I'm talking about the use of it in ranked games, not normal, often I see streamers like qtpie play off meta champs and feed so then his subs or followers think its ok to do the same thing and often ruin the experience of their team mates.

They do off meta picks because those off meta picks actually are viable where they play them, and because their team balances it out with a specific pick elsewhere. For example, If a top Vayne's it's likely the support goes a tank, or the jungler, because while they know 2 adcs can carry, they also know they need a front line.  \n\nWhat low elo players do: They vayne top, Squishy Jungler, and enchant support, starving the team of a front line.\n\nI personally Jungle Morgana, Karma, and Leona in elos up to Platinum III to great effect. This allows the team to choose a tank support, guarantees a fed adc, helps lock down and turn around counter tops, and helps sustain a mid game push better than any meta jungler does, because these three champs simply don't steal kills, are guaranteed lockdowns, reveal stealth, are hard to counter jungle against, yet have the burst presence to turn around counters.\n\nMy win rates with Morgana and Leona are greater than win rates with Evelynn, for example, simply because they can go from fight to fight without worrying about whether they have an ult, or whether a dive is going to feed shutdown gold. They can just lock down, and your team then unloads. You pick up your assist and move to the next target.\n\nIt's not your teammate's fault for picking an off meta that actually works. It's your team's fault for not planning to build around it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-11-24T16:22:56.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get what youre trying to ask?
