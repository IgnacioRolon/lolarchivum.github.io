But I swear I am entering it correctly.\r\n\r\nI used the same email for both accounts. When I request account info, I get my Smurf EU account only(which is the account I don't really want. \r\n\r\nTrying to request a password change for the user name sends me the name of my EU account, so I'm wondering if there is any chance I can get info about my original account?\r\n\r\nBoth of these accounts should be tied to the same email.\r\n\r\nCould there have been a conflict of accounts and email addresses when making that server transfer?\r\n\r\nI would be terribly disappointed if I lose that main account that had hours of work and money invested in it(over 400 USD!) from when I was nuts about the game. :(\r\n\r\nIs there anything that can be done?\r\n\r\nI have sent a support ticket but no reply yet...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-29T15:30:25.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome back, veteran Summoner! :D  We don't close an account for inactivity, so it could just be hiding somewhere.
