If you perform better with asol, but enjoy those games less than Azir I'd probably suggest Azir (or vice versa). If you're looking at it purely from an optimizing of winrate I'd probably suggest Asol. Given his low popularity it's far more likely that when you pick him your opponent won't know the matchup and is more likely to lose it (even in a matchup that should be in their favor).","replies":[{"poster":"Daze Clover","date":"2017-10-24T00:53:34.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The last time I checked azir was winning, did you cheat Riot Maple Nectar.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-10-24T01:09:17.397+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rip, I hope I didn't skew the votes!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rajinikanth Fan","date":"2017-10-23T20:15:00.271+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir if you want to become like Bjergsen or Aurelion Sol to become like Huhi!\n\nWILL U CHOOSE TSM OR CLG?\n\nto be continued.....","replies":[{"poster":"BabyNaix","date":"2017-10-23T20:19:50.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"By Bjerg you mean easyhoon lul","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlistarMilking","date":"2017-10-24T00:25:22.381+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Aurelion Sol main, I recommend Aurelion {{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"Celebrimborr","date":"2017-10-24T00:35:16.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"AlistarMilking mains Aurelion Sol.....

He deals a lot more damage: 3 soldiers have 90% ap scaling, while Aurelion stars have 52,5% ap scaling. Azir attacks faster and have a higher base damage. He has great mobility and can avoid ganks with E while Aurelion mobility is cancelled by damage, even though it makes you able to roam quickly. He has good lane pressure all the way from level 2 and scales very well into mid-lategame. \n\nDon't forget that Azir also has some of the best objective damage for midlaners with massive attack speed, both to turrets and monsters. He's also a beast in siege situations with the zoning and passive. I haven't really been playing Aurelion, but I find Azir to be a lot of fun and already got a 61% winrate with him on the way to diamond. He's basically freelo, and even better once you get really good at him.\n\nAurelion shares some of these strengths, but in this meta and with the current damage numbers he is outclassed by Azir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-10-24T07:45:14.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am partial to Azir because he is basically the mage ADC, but that being said:\n\nAurelion Sol is a much better roamer, which for climbing elo is the BIGGEST way to get an easy win. \n\nAzir is a better team fighter (please don't kill me ASol fans, he is still good!) so I think in a coordinated flex with friends he could be stronger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2017-10-24T03:20:40.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The word is that Azir is op right now.\n\nThis means that if you learn practice now you'll get a bit more of a safety net so even in your poorer games you're still able to play and learn.
