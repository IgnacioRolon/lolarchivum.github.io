I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a glitch (I&#039;m assuming it is) or if the sound effects get &#039;overridden&#039; by other game sound effects so they simply don&#039;t appear, but most of the time, whenever I place a ward, there is no sound effect. Even when I&#039;m near baron or dragon, and there is no one else around, and it&#039;s silent, most time when I place my ward, there is no sound effect.\r\n\r\nThis happens in about 3 or 4 of every 5 games, so most of the time, and from what I can tell, it doesn&#039;t come and go throughout the match - the sound effects are either &#039;on&#039; for the match, or not.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, not a huge bug or issue, but if you buy a ward, and there is supposed to be a cool cheering whenever you place it, it&#039;d be cool to at least have it work most of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-10T18:18:00.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey The Spawn Man,\n\nThanks for the report! \n\nFrom the sounds of it, you're referring to the base SFX playing when you're using the Warding Totem (trinket ward). This is working as intended. You'll only hear the a ward's custom SFX when you're placing a Sight/Vision ward.","replies":[]}]}
