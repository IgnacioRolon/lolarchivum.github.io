I guess my real concern, as a Lux main, is that they’re going to nerf her a little bit. The problem I see with that though is that she was never relevant, in pro play, until they changed Aftershock; so I’d think the rune is the issue, not the champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2019-06-20T15:17:27.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I understand it, Lux has always been good, but she wasn't safe.
