And the health bars, mini map and mouse cursor are not just my specific case.  It's like that for everyone.  This is something that needs to be fixed for everyone with 4k, not just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Almo","date":"2016-07-21T23:21:47.268+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes... This is an issue for all 4k Players.

The only problem is that when I alt-tab the mouse gets SUPER small and I'm basically not able to play unless I restart the client. This sucks super hard when something like Skype or windows forces the client to become smaller, and then I have to restart the game.\n\nEdit: This also only works in Full screen. No other mode works well with 4k.

It's strange.  I know it seems like something that is just me, but every other game works fine in 1920x1080 (though I play in 4k on those games).  \n\nThis is why I'm hoping for a slider scale for some other things like mouse cursor and health bars.

When league match launches on the 4k that is running the game in 1080p and if i have youtube in full screen on the 1080p monitor, everything will automatically shift to the 4k. Main issue here, however, is that I cannot run league at 1080p using window mode on the 4k monitor. window mode will not fill the 4k monitor... Not sure if anyone knows of a fix?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deathawaitsyou","date":"2017-01-05T18:45:11.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So whats the point of having a 4k monitor? lol i mean common riot it 2017 already lmfao","replies":[]},{"poster":"Almo","date":"2016-07-24T16:36:45.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7oBIjmFb,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2016-07-22T02:58:15.778+0000)\n>\n> Just to clarify -- are you not able to adjust the resolution of your monitor itself to 1920x1080?
