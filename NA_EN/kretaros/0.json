Freezes?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have  been having these \"lagg\" issues, even though my ms and fps show normal. Maybe the fps do drop, but they drop to 58 fps minimum, so that does not explain the constant \"freezes\", plus they are really weird because is as if like everything stopped working, time freezes, and then it fast foward time to the present, showing really fast everything that happened while the \"lagg or freeze\" happened. I have tried everything, EVERYTHING. My pc is an alienware and my conection is stable, I don't understand whats happening, I don't know what to do and I am very very frustrated.\r\n Latetly the time of the freezes have been reduced, but they still happen. Its like the opposite of a smooth gameplay, constantly having these mini \"freezes\".  I need to know if this is happening to everyone, why is happening? How long till it gets fixed? This was caused by new visuals and health bars?\r\n If somebody could just tell me \"stop playing this game for 2 weeks and it will get fixed for sure\" or some kind of answer... anything that would make me stop fighting against my pc, my conection, and the universe...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T21:57:13.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  This kind of freezing has been reported to happen when the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is enabled.  Disable it and try it out in a custom game to see if it helps.
