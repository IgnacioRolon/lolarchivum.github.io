If you disconnected while loading, though, then it could be possible that your client had an update while restarting.  I recommend running through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot whatever failed to get you to the game server.  Even if it wasn't intentional, the system is going to treat all leaves equally.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
