I think everyone makes mistakes and sometimes out of emotion they anger others or say things they don't really mean. If someone was permabanned in 2015, it is now 2019 and it seems they have had more than enough time to change their ways. Will Riot ever do anything about accounts like that? I think it is very unfair to spend hundreds of dollars on an account and then have it permabanned forever, it's almost like someone has stolen all the money and time you put into the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Reket DeAlk","date":"2019-08-03T22:20:18.733+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already give a final warning.

Whats a measly 3 years? Ill be back on the rift in no time!!! Or... i could just make a new accounts in the meantime and not care much if they get banned because ill have my main account back in 3 years. Hehe obviously I disagree with you. But in the end, nneither of us can really say what \"people would do\". Lets leave that up to the google super computer collecting data on millions of people every day, to predict.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-04T00:09:21.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's 4 tiers of warning in the game\n-10 game chat restriction\n-25 game chat restriction\n-14 day ban\n-permaban\n\nSo, the final warning, would have been the 14 day ban as it happens before you are just out of luck.  Some of these can of course occur faster than others, depending on what was said or done, that the first two will be skipped right into the 14 day ban but still that's a big enough one to tell you NOT to do it again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-08-03T23:03:55.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If one ignored the previous warnings, will another make a difference?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-03T23:27:30.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theft is defined as \"the action or crime of stealing,\" and stealing is defined as \"taking (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.\" When a player purchases RP, they give money to Riot and Riot increases a number in a database that Riot owns and operates. When that player spends the RP, Riot decreases the aforementioned number and simultaneously makes another change to the account which that player is allowed to access. This change might be a flag indicating that a certain skin can now be selected, or an increase in the number of rune pages customizable from that account. At no point in time does Riot sell, rent, or license any kind of ownership of any of Riot's assets to any player. Players are simply allowed to access the account they create, with their authorized credentials.\n\nThis is no different from accessing any other private entity's services. If you notice that a wall at a friend's house is very plain and you buy them a painting to spruce it up, that painting now belongs to your friend. If your friend forbids you from coming into their house, which could be for no reason, any reason, or very good reason (e.g. that you continually broke clearly-defined rules and ignored all reprimands and requests to change your behavior), you don't get to keep the painting. You also aren't owed the financial value of the painting, nor does helping with the decor grant you any right to keep hanging out at your (former) friend's house.","replies":[]}]}
