If this was unauthorized please visit the player support site at: https://support.riotgames.com\"\r\n\r\nI went to the site but couldn't find anything about this specific situation. I will change my password, but I don't know what to do other than that; my password is unique to LoL and is made up of all the usually recommended characters (lower and upper-case, numbers and symbols). I have never told anyone the password and I can't think how I could make it any more secure than it currently is.\r\n\r\nI've made this thread to see ask if there are any bugs that could cause a false alarm. My password hasn't been changed, I haven't received any emails, my IP and RP are the same... It just doesn't seem like my account was actually accessed by someone else. I don't know at what level this error could have occurred, but it would be nice to be reassured that nothing is at risk.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T03:43:12.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for your own safety I went ahead and looked over your account to see if there might have been any suspicious activity.
