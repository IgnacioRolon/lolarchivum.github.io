Recently (literally less than 20 minutes ago as of writing this post), I was trying to gift my friend a skin which they did not have, and while trying to test to see if I could gift the skin through the normal shop, I bought Cosmic Blade Master Yi. I do not have any refunds left and if there is any way I can get this skin refunded to me, I would very much appreciate it. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T03:02:23.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries man! I noticed that you have **NOT** used that skin yet, so don't worry about not having a refund token. Hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and as long as that skin **HASN'T** been used, we should be able to help you out with that refund. \n\nAgain (just to drive the point home lol), make sure that you don't use that skin, not even once.
