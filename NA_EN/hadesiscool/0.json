(in my opinion) i have played over 2000 games and i have not seen one single player that has used the Spellchanger rune. EVER! and i have seen lots of players use Klepto! it helps so many champs like Ezreal and Fiora and Kayle! so much and now we are just going to get a crap rune that will just ruin the game.","replies":[]}
