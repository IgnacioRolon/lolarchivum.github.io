It says it cannot find the files needed to run the LoL screensaver as the specific location. Which means it's gone. I've already deleted it. \r\n\r\nSo what do I do, how come I cannot delete this folder when I've already uninstalled the program? What can it possibly be running in??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T23:09:59.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your PC has since been restarted and the issue persists, then let us take a closer look through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
