It was the one that says survive inside the ring of fire, unfortunately I was recalling and as soon as the event started I was teleport back to base (the channel ended) SO I was out of the ring and thus the game killed me, awarding the kill to a teammate. I had a bounty and we got a hefty county reward (400g)","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-08-16T03:37:56.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you die in the fire it rewards the kill to the highest person on the scoreboard on the enemy team but its currently bugged when that person is dead and it rewards the kill the to highest person on the scoreboard on your team instead of the second highest on the enemy team","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2018-08-16T04:01:50.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is a bug, huh? I was surprised to get gold while being dead and I got to reset my bounty count. It was a good result considering I had 100Hp and I wouldnt have survived the ring of fire anyway","replies":[{"poster":"UncowRival","date":"2018-08-16T04:23:52.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bug, but not just in your specific circumstance. Happens when others get hit by an enemy prior. My Gnar got knocked back into the fire by Hec and I got a double on my own team from it. Same results, but being hit by an enemy champion before dying to the ring doesn't seem to matter vs suicide.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UncowRival","date":"2018-08-16T04:01:03.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dawg, nothing made sense.
