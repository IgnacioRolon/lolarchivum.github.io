These range in severity, but examples usually are spawned because the designer is a pretentious wanker who likes to show what a smart dude he is and how stupid the player is. I do not respect designers who engage in this pattern intentionally, and encourage any design lead out there to immediately fire any of your staff that does. I do understand that it can happen inadvertently, and that you might cause some of this stress on purpose in an RPG for character development.. And of course, I love you WoW team despite the 'playing vs' experience of Rogue and Warlock, as you DO have the best classes of any MMO, and they look even better in Cataclysm.... But, on Bayonetta, did the developers really think the stone award was a good idea? But I digress...\n\n>Severe: There's a popular wc3 map in China where you enter a bonus round, and have a 2% chance of just straight up dying rather than getting cool loot.\n\nI'd recommend Riot Support giving this guy a random skin permanent that they don't already own in this case. Additionally, fixing/looking over the issue to make sure that Skin Permanents rolled cannot already be owned, because seriously, **why** is this possible?","replies":[{"poster":"sId sapnu puas ","date":"2016-12-31T19:11:05.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really want to cry when I get skin owned .

So if i make a new account, buy vayne and get all of vayne skins, then reroll 3 skin shards, will I get Soulstealer vayne? I mean when you reroll skin shards you get a skin PERMANENT and if vayne is the only champion i have and i already have all the other skins the the only skin that i can get is SS vayne right?\n\nJust asking","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T22:38:36.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you wouldn't be guaranteed a skin you don't own.
