The only way to have a ban undone is be a pro player or twitch streamer and pay to have the account unbanned (i.e. Tyler1, Imaqtpie, The Rain Man). \n\nI came back after being out of state to see my account had been perm banned and when i checked the support ticket none of things were what i had ever said. Someone had hacked my account and got it perm banned. What's worse is they used my credit card to buy $200 of RP. I'll post  below what Riot told me in my support ticket. \n-----------------------------------\n\n\"TEMPLAR IYTSUNA April 23, 2017 10:54\nHello,\n\nTo the other players in this match it didn't matter who was playing at the time, they were only made victim to the excessively toxic chat exhibited by this account. For this reason I will not be able to reverse or modify this suspension.

As League of Legends is a free to play game, the amount a player has spent or makes by playing League of Legends will never have any bearing on a situation.

All accounts and players are held to the same Summonerâ€™s Code and the Terms of Use.\n\nAs you have no further concerns and I have explained all I can about this issue, I will be closing this ticket out.

My fear was all the horror stories of riot support just dismissing tickets without real investigation, hence why I posted here as well as opening a ticket to draw attention to it.

The pattern of players trying to use programs to gain information on the game or metrics of their own play shouldn't be grounds for banning, but it currently seems to be. Even if there is an argument that disallows the use of programs that give an unfair advantage, it can be argued in return that currently acceptable programs like Curse Voice or others do give an advantage in-game.

Yet when i was banned i was on a horrible losing streak lol? if i had the recordings still i would 100% post them for review but i had to delete them for space issues sadly. But i just dont understand why I was banned? I dont even use the Macros in Synapse never have probably never will. But why can professional players use replay tools and announcer packs and be fine if i cannot?","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2017-05-14T17:02:15.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GRiM x PsYcHo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MfzMlULM,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2017-05-14T14:08:25.782+0000)\n>\n> I was banned as well for &quot;third party programs&quot; yet the only modifications i had ever made to league was an announcer pack and i had gotten Razer Synapse not long before i was banned. They also said i was &quot;account sharing&quot; yet noone has my account information aside from myself, i do log in from multiple locations because i travel frequently and i used to go back and forth between my parents when i was still with them. I had two other friends banned as well who had just gotten the same announcer pack and both use Razer Synapse and they were both Bronze 2 and Bronze 4 at the time and i was Gold 1.

Also the Riot employee said \"suspicious activity.\" If I were you, I would change the account password to something new. Your account may have been compromised and someone else being on your account may have gotten the ban in the first place.","replies":[]}]}
