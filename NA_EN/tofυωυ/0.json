I was the first one to pick and Im really certain that it wasn't me. It has happened to me 3 times. 5 min, 30min and now 1 h. It's always me aswell. Can you do anything to remove the \"suspension\" for leaving a champ select somehow if it wasn't my fault nut it was the clients fault. Really salty atm please I need help :/\n\nShort version: My game froze after I picked and waited to start loading screen but I somehow dodged the draft and now I have 1 hour penalty after 3 times. 5 min, 30 min and 1 hour.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T20:05:12.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're not able to modify penalties for disconnecting from matches.
