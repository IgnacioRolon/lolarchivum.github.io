They'd use ammo to cast spells and use basic attacks (which would be more powerful this way). Even though Jhin can refresh his Ammo should he be lacking bullet or more and not in fight for some time, they would not be able to regen it until running dry, creating window of opportunity. The time of reloading single bullet might be fixed and it would then scale with amounts of bullet a champ can hold (either fixed on each champ individually, or base amount increased by items).\n\nSo differences:\n- no regen before running dry\n- regen regens whole resource but part of resource cannot be used while regening","replies":[{"poster":"DeathToEcchi","date":"2017-02-04T12:59:11.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would just make a champ that always fires off their combo on cd or is forced to save the full combo for only the perfect moment and right-clicks the rest of the time.

There's a balance that can be made and keep things healthy and interesting. \n\nLike, I feel like Cait's kit is a decent design (trying to leave tuning out of this). She can sit back and right click, but it's not going to be her maximum damage potential. If she wants to maximize damage, she'd basically need a trap > auto > net > auto combo (maybe even add Q > R to the end of that as the target is running away, to complete the full combo). But her trap requires either the opponent to misstep and run into it, or other CC from an allied source which lets her put the trap under the target so they're caught once the other CC is over. On top of that, if she wants to use the net - auto combo, it forces her to use her only escape on a long-ish cooldown to get that last long-range auto in. There are choices forced by both cait and her opponent in allowing her to use her max damage combo. This is healthy design.\n\nOn the other hand, to compensate for the ammo system on Jhin, they gave him a ton of utility. His crits give a significant amount of movespeed. This is guaranteed to be available when he lands his 4th shot and needs to reload, so it's not even that easy to take advantage of his short period of vulnerability while reloading. His kind of ammo system should have the tradeoff of poor waveclear. But he can almost instantly wipe out huge waves of minions with his traps alone. Then there's the long-range ult with the massive slow on any target he manages to tag. Why on earth does it need to have an 80% slow? The ult is simultaneously an execute mechanic and has insane utility. The execute portion makes it feel like it's something he should be using later in a fight when things are already low or held in place by allies. But the slow on it makes it just as good for creating a pick or initiating a team fight. In LCS you see it used more for the slow and deterring the opponents from a push or an objective than you do for actually securing kills. All this together makes for a really cool design and he has a lot of versatility, but I do not believe it's actually a healthy design, regardless of tuning. \n\nI do not believe that moving every champion to overloaded kits because they're more interesting is a direction that's good for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-02-03T19:07:39.990+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"But here's the thing: The way things are right now, marksmen are always in a state of \"3-4 of us are super good.
