However, there isn't a similar item for most champions. A {{item:3800}} and {{item:3069}} can counter a poke team, but it offers gameplay around it. The poke team gets a few seconds to reposition or scatter, they know who to keep away from to avoid the slow, they can protect their priority targets and try give them more space. GW just means mundo heals 40% less. Either he has so much healing it doesn't matter, or his kit loses a huge portion of its power. That's not an interesting way to set up counters.

No matter what you put it on, be it a champion's kit or an item in the store, the uniform effect of 40% healing reduction hits equally hard.

Ignite is probably the closest thing to an acceptable healing counter, mostly because the duration is not as long and it boasts a CD (sure, it's cheap and easy, but so is exhaust, so if one gets changed for shutting down a certain thing, the other probably deserves the same thing).

Lifesteal/healing should be the counter to tanks (as LS thrives in extended fights, fights which tanks should excel at), shields should be the main counter to burst but should not be entirely useless against dps (shield duration and CDs must be adjusted accordingly).\n\nThe main purpose of tanks is to set up kills with their CC, block damage from enemy carries (Shen's W, bodyblocking skillshots, Braum's E, taunts, etc.). Their secondary purpose should be peeling for carries against divers and assassins. Tanks should coordinate their CC with their DPS teammates to kill, not be the ones to 1 v 1 carries...\n\nThe combination of tankiness and damage should be mostly seen on juggernauts and divers, they should be the ones to easily burst/1v1 enemy carries.\n\nGW items should have a clear and meaningful counterplay (at least some sort of CD so GW is not literally permanent in fights), have trade offs comparing to non GW variants (look at {{item:3165}} ), and not be mindlessly rushable like {{item:3123}}.\n\n> Since tanks can't easily build any items that cut healing\n\nI have seen full tank Rek'sai, Illaoi, Rammus, Supp Naut/Thresh/Bard/**Nami** rush executioner's calling... your statement is false but for not so obvious reason...\n\nMind that there is a big difference between a Tank( pure/CC tank like Naut, Leo, Sejuani) and an off tank (Juggernauts and divers like Shyv, Renekton or Darius).\n\n>  Since tanks can't easily build any items that cut healing that means they have to have the damage to kill someone with unmitigated lifesteal or spell camp or inbuilt healing as they aren't expected to have access to grievous wounds. \n\nThat is illogical if you are talking about pure tanks, and off-tanks are already viable with Executioner's calling (viable bacause execall is just broken...).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2017-02-09T00:50:49.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking about grievous wounds for awhile, cause here's the thing, if it was removed, high regen or high healing champs become out of control, if we nerf their healing we'll eventually be at a point where the healing will be identical to what it is now with GW, but getting GW just cucks healing really badly so I thought some changes,\n\nFor excutioners calling and Mortal's we could have a new effect called Wounded:\nThis applies 1 stack of Wounded, wounded enemies receive 10%-25% (dunno what would be a good value) reduced healing for 2 seconds, at 5 stacks, the enemy is applied grievous wounds for 5 secs. (The stacks don't increase the value at which the enemies take reduced healing, it's only there to apply grievous wounds), I was thinking it should stack like Grasp, so even if you hit a person 5 times, it takes 5 seconds to reach grievous wounds\n\nThis makes it so high regen, or healing reliant champs can keep their super strong healing, but on extend fights, would start losing out.\n\nMorello's seem fine as it is since it has a restriction on when it applies grievous wounds\n\nAnd ignite should also be kept how it is as you're sacrificing a summoner spell which is pretty significant","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-02-09T00:28:57.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"IDK I disagree...\n\nHealing should be strong.\nGrievous wounds should make healing weak.\nIt doesn't need to be balanced with grievous wounds. Does suppression need to be balanced so that it's still useful/strong if the enemy has QSS? No. The simple fact that you force your opponent to build a QSS instead of damage is part of what makes it strong. \n\nLikewise, healing forces grievous wounds. Having to save ignite for Swain/Vlad instead of using it on the enemy ADC is a cost. Having your ADC or top build {{item:3123}} is a cost (10% damage from {{item:3034}} is no joke). I think it's perfectly balance-able and it has been done fairly well so far... It only goes out of control when the guy healing like mad is fed and no one buys grievous wounds.","replies":[]}]}
