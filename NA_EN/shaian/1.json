Zyra would be a better, fairer and more fun to play champion if her passive didn't exist. Introducing RNG into Zyra's kit was just such a shit idea.\n\nZyra just needs a new passive completely, if she is going to keep her current passive however it needs to be heavily modified so it's something the Zyra player does and not just RNG. What I'd ideally like to see here is a new passive which causes Zyra to interact with her plants rather than dropping them and forgetting about their existence, for example \"Zyra's auto attacks and her plant auto attacks apply a stacking debuff on enemies, when Zyra lands a spell on enemies with stacks on them she consumes the stacks to deal bonus damage\".","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-01T00:00:03.516+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Zyra just needs a new passive completely\n\nVery possible.

Why would a champ who had nothing outside of her ult build tank? Think about that logically for a second, if old Sej was literally worthless outside of her R she wouldn't do so, because her R is a long CD non-persistent effect. If it were true that Sej was completely reliant on her R she'd likely buy AP and CDR as primary stats to get as much power out of her R as possible, yet for old Sej CDR was a secondary stat and AP was tertiary at best. Her primary stats were HP and Armour because her actual power came from the persistent damage output of her W and to a lesser extent her E.\n\nWith that in mind what I think her rework got wrong was removing power from her old strengths, her decent damage and strong soft CC with good hard CC gated by a long CD and shifted her to strengths which are overly abundant in all recent tank designs, namely the only two strengths any tanks seem to be allowed to have now, absurd durability and absurd spammable hard CC.\n\nOn a kit design level the rework did some things well, her new W is fine and her passive is OK bar it probably being the opposite way round of what it should be given what Sej's design was. Her passive would be a lot better if rather than dropping off after entering combat it rather charged up when in combat IMO.\n\nThe parts of her kit I really take issue with are her new E, her R and the damage half of her passive. I think her old sustained damage output was more fair from a design perspective, a tank DPSing you down doesn't feel too bad, a tank bursting you for 40% of your HP is stupid, which is the problem with the damage half of her passive. \n\nHer E is a terribly designed spell, with a single other melee on her team it's basically Taric's old stun, you can't play around most melee's AAs so you can't play around Sej's E at all with a decent team comp. \n\nHer R simultaneously manages to feel worse to use and worse to be hit by. Why it's worse to use than old R should be obvious, but it's also worse to be hit by R because of the potential for burst from her R/passive. Obviously it's less powerful but there were just better ways to take power out of Sej's R than what Riot went with, for example rather than making it a single target stun they could have made it an AOE slow which then stunned targets if Sej damage enemies caught in it, this would simultaneously feel more like an ult for the Sej player and far more fair for the enemy.\n\nThe TLDR for why I don't like the rework is that it shifted Sej's strengths away from being a bruiser/tank hybrid to something far more generic while also adding some mechanics which are just outright unfair and not even particularly fun to play with.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-01T17:35:07.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's some solid feedback mate, do you think you could write it out in its own post?

Sej, Zac and Maoki were all more unique champs before the tank ~~butchering~~ rework, now they all fit into the exact same mould, 3 hard CCs, 1-2 soft CCs hard CC ult with some form of durability steroid on their passive. So damn unique.\n\nRiot was never creating diversity with their class reworks, they were creating novelty. On mass the classes that were reworked all became more homogeneous with the only exception being the ADCs. \n\nBefore Sejuani was a bruiser like tank who relied more off of the damage from her W than traditional tank tools to work, having both less CC and less durability than most tanks. Zac was a fairly standard tank in terms of design but at least his passive and ult gave him some unique positional gameplay which separated him from other tanks. Maokai had some fairly unique supportish attributes because of his R, he was unique from other tanks other than Taric and Braum who were both far more defined supports than him. Now all 3 just play as fairly standard tanks, the only one having any of his original identity left being Zac, but even in his case it's heavily eroded.\n\nEvery tank now feels like they follow the 3 hard CC 1-2 soft CC +durability steroid model.

I actually loved Zyra's changes.  She feels great as a constant harass and threat champion and the seed passive combined with the W cd refund is my favourite thing on midlane Zyra.  However, the one thing that has felt awful since her mini rework has been her burst potential.  Zyra used to be able to land a full double seed combo from brush with ult and kill someone from full health.  You caught them out and you landed an entire combo and they died unless they flashed/dashed etc.  This is almost never possible anymore since she just doesn't have the raw burst potential that she used to.  I find even when I'm an item or two ahead I still can't seem to burst down someone anymore and that makes me really sad.\n\nIn terms of changes, I'm uncertain what can be done.  I enjoy her current iteration of creating lots of plants, but I miss her damage potential from before.  I think a change could be to make it so that plants empowered by her ultimate couldn't be killed for the duration of the animation.  This would give them protection when she lands her combo and allow more damage from them before they are taken out.  It also wouldn't affect the laning aspect as much since it would only be during her ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hpp3","date":"2018-03-01T17:38:30.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get 0.5s invulnerability/untargetability on plants when they first spawn then?

So frustrating to play. Is this good design? &amp;quot;Zyra is the plant mage and we want to emphasize that so we put half of her damage into plant AI&amp;quot; (season 6). I used to hear &amp;quot;all because of the amount of plants she gets&amp;quot; are the reason for worse ap ratios, base damage, scaling hp. What are my plants doing now though? Half of my damage is not existant with ur recent changes.\n> \n> Cant i get a statement on what you think? I&amp;#039;m not even looking necessarily for &amp;quot;Riot thinks this&amp;quot;-statement. What do you guys personally think when you watch this?\n> \n> When i look at how it lead to this I feel like you trapped yourself with the passive you gave her. You cant balance it for low mmr when a champ has half of her damage in AI. But, what i watch in this video is just unacceptable. This is not about Rengars skill. He oneshots my plant in a fullcombo before it can even get empowered, just by running with attackmove.\n\nI've played the game since 2011 and I've abhorred 'plant health' as a mechanic since its inception. It's never really made sense. Its exact values have changed two or three times now, and it SEEMS simple: Plants have 8 health and take 1 damage from minions, 1 from damage over time, 2 from large minions, 4 from AoE abilities, 4 from Ranged attacks, 8 from melee attacks, 8 from single target spells...\n\nBut there's so many possibilities you have to keep track of. Minion aggro. Luden's Echo. Liandry's Torment. Statikk Shiv. Red Buff. Sunfire Cape. Iceborn Gauntlet. Ravenous Hydra. Titanic Hydra.\n\nAnd those are just the things that can dramatically affect how long your plants last which are available in every single game. Then there are specific champion concerns like auto-resets and on-hit effects and certain spells or buffs...\n\nIt's a complete gamble as to whether the plants get to do anything or not, and it feels absolutely terrible for everyone involved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2018-02-28T16:39:13.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did Rengar sneeze and killed all the plants?
