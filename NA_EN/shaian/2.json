Her Items are in a good spot, she has several choice (probably more than most Mages). We have Tanks, Mages/Antimages, Hypercarries with Melee supports. The Meta is in her favor. But, Zyra is not quite hitting the mark. Her winrate did not change since she was considered \"too weak for both roles since preseason\". We know and have read several times the new runes were not in her favor, on the other hand AP items got kinda compensated for the mediocre Sorcery tree for mages. But, this is not the point of my post.\n\nI want to talk about what sucks on Zyra. Especially for Midlane, but as a Champ too.\n\nLet's look at the enemies Zyra faces midlane and how good she should be against these Champions.\n\nWe have Melees (Assassins+Galio), Midrange Mages, Artillery poke mages.\n\nZyra is supposed to be getting smashed by poke and  to be weak (but with opportunities to fight) against Assassins and she should be a good duelists against Midrange Mages, who come too close to her.\n\nLet's talk about what Zyra should be good against, since i feel like thats the most important part on making her a good midlaner.\nFirst thing, what Champions do i mean, which she should face? \n\nMostly these {{champion:34}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} are the Champions Zyra wants to compete with. Now what is her problem?\n\nFirst of all, she gets significantly squishier than any other mage (except Anivia) with every level.\nSecond and thats the more important part, her Q makes it too clunky to lane and teamfight and this is why:\n\nThe Hitbox does not match or synergys in any way with her kit except her passive. Its a Malzahar Q, with significantly less range (100), less damage, less AP ratio, which offers more reaction time and has a more visible hitbox. I think its harder to hit than it should be. 800 Range is a reasonable number, but with this hitbox its significantly lower and less effective compared to circle-shaped-AoE. Some mages even have >800 range while still having a circleshaped spell. I get the point of this new Q to make use of the seeds she additionally spawns, it just feels terrible to play. It makes sense on Malzahar, because of his other spells, but not on Zyra.\nLets get into a teamfight. My Thresh does land a hook, pulls himself into the enemy team and flays 4 people towards us. I am able to get a great 4 man snare, press R thats so much AoE and the dream moment of every Zyra player or Controlmage players. But, as final spell i cast my Q, in a right angle towards my E, meaning i can only hit 1 or 2 with it instead of all 4 that I snared with my root. That doesnt feel great to play, but really awkward.\nSo all my enemies got to do is, when i cast my Q run up or down, and when i cast my E left or right. Deadly Spines is such a telegraphed spell for what it actually does. I feel like there is too much power put into plant spawning (especially with his big secondary hitbox) than in it being a good damagespell on its own. Deadly Bloom was more satisfying to play, while having the same castrange and the same delay as the new Q. So what i suggest is giving her her old Q hitbox, with maybe a secondary circleshaped \"plantspawn-hitbox\", until you decide to give her major passivechanges.\n\nBut, why did you change Zyra's Q hitbox? Yes, plants. You saw my frustration in that videoclip against the Rengar. https://twitter.com/Shaian1112/status/968652789713915905\n\nNow first of all. Zyra is supposed to be a disruptive control mage. A controlmage makes people afraid of straight up and randomly diving her. In her strong moments you are supposed to run away than run into her. However, at the moment it is just too easy to charge into her.\nMelee attacks onehit plants. You justified this change with \"It is a big trade for a melee to auto a plant\". Is it that big though?\n\nHalf of Zyras damage is balanced into being distributed by plants. In what case isnt it worth to get rid of that? What else can Zyra do? Autoattack an Assassin to death while he uses one attack to deny 50% of your damage? In this clip Rengar automatically killed the first plant just by how being snared affects your champ without him actively wanting to get rid of it. My plant died without dealing any damage and it couldnt get empowered either. EWRQW is the standard combo for 2 plants of each type. But, too slow to empower my first plant against a melee. The empowered plant took 4 damage by him healing himself with W. He uses his E to get rid of the remaining 8HP, but he could have just used another autoattack to kill it. He did not need his E to kill me few seconds later within a short moment anyway. Whats his tradeoff for using his E? There is none. Its always worth.\nIf my plants are so squishy in a 1v1 and get cleared without the enemy noticing, how squishy are they in a 5v5? \n I try to unisolate myself with a plant when I'm afraid a Kha'zix might jump on me in a fight or 1v1. What happens? He autos the plant and turns on me. I can't use my experience of having mained this Champ for almost 5 years. I dont think I am the one who has to adapt in regards to her plant HP. I was adapting for so much and defended her Rework in 6.9 like noone else did. It just sucks right now.\n\nBack to Rengar's E though. Single target spells oneshot plants, too. What does that mean in Midlane? A Ryze using my plants for his own waveclear and if it bothers him he uses any ability to kill it. There is no big tradeoff.\nWhat else is oneshotting Zyra's plants? Cassio can charge into me laugh while getting hit by QW, oneshot my plants with an E and do Cassiothings. She's able to kill Vinelashers before they auto her. She wont get slowed. Whats her tradeoff? She benefits from standing in my dangerzone killing everything on her way to me. Its not any different for a spell like Viktor Q too. It doesnt matter if you cant cast it on Zyra. You will outdamage her, just by denying her damage.\n\nThere is no worse feeling than seeing a plant die within an eyeblink. Especially when they cant even do a single attack, or when they cant get empowered though you spammed R the moment you casted W. I dont mind my passive seeds. But, dont make my W seeds as bad because her passive is too hard to balance. Differentiate their plant HP's at least, their seeds got different colors already. There are so many stupid cases and bugs like Corki autos, his E, or Karthus Crit Q oneshotting plants. Seeing plants die onehit every game just by statikks is just stupid as well. Electric is supposed to be weak vs grass :P\n\n I think her Q and her plants are the main reason she doesnt see any play in Mid. And she is not doing very well on support either. I remember a Rioter saying in season 5 \"Zyra's cant get buffed, because she sits on a 53-55% winrate and it was always like that. She is sucessful fulfilling her niche and as long her winrate doesnt drop way lower she's in an ok spot for us.\"\n\nHer niche ddnt change. I cant tell about her playrate. But, her winrate dropped in a patch which was supposed to be really good for her and is at 49% right now. She just needs some help.\n\nThanks for reading\n\n(PS: In case you revisit Zyra, maybe you could look into changing her manacosts so her W costs something as well? I found myself liking Seraphs on Zyra over Ludens (never thought that would happen lol), but shes mediocre at stacking it, since you changed it to mana-expenditure. I finish it later than my opponents, but i still like to buy it since it feels so good)","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-07T23:42:48.238+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.

If it’s ever strong enough for a solo lane it makes it too strong for a duo lane as support.

Cheers!\n\nWhat do you think about Zyra's R actually spawning seeds on R cast (within the circle) that would allow Zyra to uproot the plants with her spellcasts? This could potentially either allow her to turn her \"forest\" into a ranged danger zone, slow death-grip zone or potentially split among both plant types but having to spend spells in such a way that she won't always lay it on top of her enemies to hit the right ratio of plant types.\n\nAnd what i also had in mind is that the seeds become denser with R rank and they spawn randomly within the range of her R but with a certain number of seeds anyway. These seeds would follow instant death immunity paradigm once spawned (just like her regular and W seeds) and can't be immediately destroyed upon being stepped on.\n\nThis could potentially play out on Zyra's plantmancer thematic even more than the current one and would allow her to \"instantly\" prime he forest if she needs to defend herself.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-03-20T15:18:51.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea, but we're just trying to get some basic functionality cleanup, not any redesign.\n\nThough I have long supported the idea of Zyra's ult spawning plants from seeds in the ult area.

We decided that this one was the best and we would like to share it with you.\n\n- We think Zyra overall needs buffs, especially midgame onwards. She cant really make as much use of her leads as she used to. Her lategame is bad despite being carry.\n- She still does well early game, especially in low MMR due to plants and them being ignored.\n- Her plants being such a big part, but offering too much counterplay in high mmr has to be addressed. Quality over Quantity\n- New Runes + recent changes to W (removal of passive plant HP) leave both Q and W in a really rough spot and are Zyra's main issue she is \n  struggeling. Leveling abilities after level 9 doesnt do much.\n- Make her more fun and skillful to play\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/eTqxgfx.png\n\nWhat these changes do:\n\n- HP on par with other mages\n- small reverts of her Manaregen in cost for other parts of her kit\n- Nerfing the base spawnrate of her passive to a third early (to have less plants, which are stronger on the other hand)\n- Give Zyra the range back she needs to compete with an awkward spell like  Q / A circle would be way better than rectangle though and wouldnt need range buffs.\n- Bring damage to her spell, skill expression in skillshots rather than plants. Makes Zyra a more diverse champion towards playstyles. Makes her feel better and rewarded to play well.\n- Make her a Champion which can stack Tear more effectively\n- Plants to naturally be more durable vs spells, in teamfights and most importantly after most of the laningphase is over.\n\nWe think its ok if plants need 2 melee hits after level 6, because at that point she either bullied her enemies and they cant clear her plants or she lost lane already. A point we want to highlight as well is, Zyras winrate vs melee supports are all under 50%. Resolve is also a very strong tree to survive the lane vs Zyra. She is easy to all in like every ranged support as well these days, due to how squishy she is compared to Aftershock users.\n\nIn other versions we would like give her W a damage amplifier, flat bonus damage or attackspeed per rank on plants like Illaois Q (The others actually mentioned that i could add 2% per W rank as well in this version since we removed 2/3 of her passive plants early game and want to shift power into post level 13, as well. I was not sure how you would react seeing this list though with plant damage buffs). Another idea was to differentiate the damage her plants deal via putting points into Q or E. A Mastertier Midlane Zyraplayer from NA emphasized how much of a better and more satisfying Champion Zyra could be with a higher misslespeed on E (as you see in her Championspotlight). But, overall we agreed that this is the best iteration for a start and pretty balanced. We do believe that even with these major buffs, she would rather end up slightly too weak than too strong. Additionally, if it occurs that shes op, shes way easier to balance than currently. And more fun to play anyway. \n\nAt the end of the day we all hope our enemies are going to feel the Thorns embrace {{champion:143}}\n\nEdit 14 hours after this post: one of the persons we discussed told me to add this chart showing her plantdamage numbers at level 18(!), which are the extremest when you add the W amplifier. I personally  would see attackspeed as a better stat though, since we got a dmg amplifier on R already and would make it less good and exciting if its mulitplied:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oviL1Ny.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaipop","date":"2018-03-10T16:39:19.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Master Zyra mid OTP, I just really don't like how much she relies on her team to do anything. Other mages feel like they are able to do so much more on their own with added safety and little effort. None of her other spells can really function that well if the enemies aren't already CC'd. It's too dangerous and hard to land poke with Q on enemies mid-late game without them being already CC'd, and plants simply die too easily when they're not ulted. It's hard for her to CC enemies on her own since E is too easy to dodge without it following up on someone else. \n\nCome mid to late game she's really only an ult bot, and not getting a good ult means you basically won't have any reliable DPS with plants dying instantly. I really wish you could help Zyra, especially for mid (comparing her to other mages). I think her support is in a reasonable spot at the moment. What I most want is a buff to her E missile speed, and definitely some way (through changing her w/passive/ult) to fulfill her fantasy as a plant mage. It may help to also increase her AP scalings, as her access to flat magic penetration has been reduced over time, which would make her Q and E more impactful for DPS. Her plants simply aren't as strong as they need to be come mid and _especially_ late game. Also, please stop letting MF autos/Corki autos 1 shot plants.

One of the main issue that I have with Zyra is her new Q shape is that not only it is awkward to use but also have a shorter range/smaller radius than her old circle Q. Before the rework, Zyra used to be able to land her E(root) at max range and able to follow up with her Q at the very close spot. With the new Q shape, Zyra cannot do that because it has shorter range and required Zyra to walk up closer to the enemy to cast it. By the time Zyra walk to them, her root duration is already over and the enemy would just walk away with Zyra unable to follow up with her Q.\n\n2. With the recent plants AI changes, Zyra's new Q is unable to fulfill her fantasy to zone the enemies because her plants would only prioritize the targets that got hit by Zyra's abilities or auto attack. Since it is harder to Zyra to land her Q and super slow projectile E (root), what is the point of having plants?\n\n3. Zyra E is not only a slow projectile, but also have a very low root duration because Zyra has to root herself as well to cast the spell out at lvl 1. For mid Zyra, this spell is not worth maxing because it has a high cooldown and very unreliable. In addition to that, Zyra needs to max her Q first for the waveclear.\n\n**Suggestion:\n**\n1. Revert her Q back to a circle shape (making Zyra feels satisfy at poking enemies again), or make her current Q shape bigger in vertical but smaller in horizontal, that way Zyra can have a big more range to compete against mages like Syndra, Orianna, Brand, and etc....\n\n2. Buff her root duration at early level and nerf it at late game. Change her root duration from 0.75s(level 1) to 1.75s(level 5) to 1.1s (level 1) to 1.5s (level 5). This would make Zyra combo goes a lot smoother like other mages who lane their hard cc. \n\nAdditional Changes (not sure):\n3. Give her Q a slow and remove her melee plant completely since most Zyra would rather have range Plants instead of melee plants for zoning. This is for the buff compensation for early game root duration. This way Zyra won't be stack with a lot of cc in her kit but have a smoother gameplay and kit as a ZONE mage which is strong early-mid game but decent/bad late game because of her scaling. \n\nThank you so much for reading, if you do read it. Thanks again for looking out for Zyra as a champion and her community even though she is not a very popular champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-03-09T13:47:14.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RiotRepertoir: I was a midlane Zyra main from when she came out.

Riot stated that a Champ like Zyra is balanced when she sits on 52-54% winrate, due to the niche she is fulfilling and with her low playrate. Shes losing more games than winning.\n\nRepertoir already stated in a different thread that what happens in this video is kinda fucked up. Its not like Rengar is sitting on top of me fighting and assassinating me. No, Rengar misstepped at a range he cannon fight me and was not punished for it. He cleared my first plant just by how snares work and make u auto the closest target, before it got empowered or even dealt any damage. Not because he actively wanted to clear it. Thanks for giving props to my speed. But its still too slow to empower my plant :(\n\nNo, the ability placement was not misused. When Rengar gets hit by my combo I create a deadly are around him like \"You better hope you get out of here alive\". The way you want me to use my spells creates an area he can just avoid. My intention is to kill him, not to make him run away. It doesnt matter what kind of mage im playing. If i was a Cassiopeia with the amount of gold i had at that stage of the game i would have killed him, if I was a LeBlanc, Viktor, Anivia, Lux, Azir. It doesnt matter. I am a super fed AP Mage, getting a fullcombo on a fulldamage assassin. \n\nFurthermore:\n\"It feels horrible to try to put my plants outside of enemies' auto range just to make sure they can't auto them right as they spawn. I am ok with placing my seeds in front of enemies' skillshots like hooks, but something that is automatic movement by enemy should not be necessary to play around.\" - Nigelf, every Season Challenger Player, used to main Zyra, but dropped her.\n\nI keep seeing this \"Place your seeds differently\", but I literally have never seen a player above gold who thinks that its good. In fact Diamond+ players (Zyramains, Midlane/Supportmains) they all said its horrible to play around placing seeds away from your enemies when its about your ultcombo. You trying to justify Zyras current state with me drawing triangles when i want to do a fullcombo and to be suboptimal regardless.\n\nI dont care if my passive plants are oneshottable. But, the plants I actively want to place should not be as bad just because of that.\n\nLook, Zyras plants are as Repertoir stated in a different tweet towards me mostly balanced for Silver. They offer way too much counterplay in higher mmr where people actually recognize them. As you say, you only play Zyra support. The recent planthp changes in patch 7.24 were only compensation for her \"midlane buff\" when she gets resets on W. Zyras plants were not oneshottable ever before that. She was not oppressive when they did that change. Riot stated she was infact too weak and they wanted to help her out. Her situation did not get better, infact shes just even less fun to play for alot of players. \n\nYou not recognizing this only proves that you play where Zyra's plants were balanced for and thats her issue. Too much power in plants, when people in lower MMR cant play properly against it and people in higher MMR are suffering way too hard from it.","replies":[{"poster":"swanington","date":"2018-03-09T16:03:15.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding so thoughtfully. Definitely some good points in here for me to consider. \n\nBut I don't know... in the end I guess I just don't find it to be such a bad thing, although I do understand the desire behind it. I have fun playing around her plant placement and find it challenging but not impossible. \n\nThe sentiment of \"something that characters do automatically without effort shouldn't negate my ability\" makes sense to me and I agree that it does feel shitty when it happens. But at the same time that is part of the challenge I enjoy playing around. \nIf the plants were invulnerable for 1s when they first arrived it would feel cheap. \nI don't want to point and click and have my enemy die. \n\nAlso, no I didn't see the stats on who was how fed in your replay, just saw the action. I still think you'd be better off putting your seeds just off to the side/in front of him. Could still land your combo but they would live to hit him. (Although I don't think that would have killed him still even ignoring the janna). Side note: do you cast your seeds then abilities or abilities then seeds? It looks like the former, but you cast so quickly it's hard to dissect. \n\n I don't think saying \"place seeds differently\" is such a bad thing. Sometimes characters change. Sometimes in in big ways and sometimes more subtle, but either way it's always necessary to adjust playstyle.  \nAnd yes, sometimes I also hate the new playstyle and end up dropping champs (haven't touched urgot since the rework).

Their damage are reliable, when you get hit by malzahar's E, it will damage the enemy for 4 seconds no matter what, the enemy can't do anything about it but to take the damage. \n\nZyra on the other hand, can summon plants but the enemy can just kill them with auto or targeted spells to neglect further damage easily. \n\nHow could you say Zyra's slow and snare is massive? like do you not see how slow the projectile speed is and Zyra rooting herself while casting it? \n\nI don't see how Zyra plants are oppressive when they were tankier before the rework and no one was complaining about it. In order for her plants to even be oppressive, Zyra has to land her short range spells or auto and any compete enemies would not stupid enough to just walk up to her range and eat her Q or E.\n\nWait you actually think Zyra built for dot and utility? \n\nDot? Plant dies in one melee auto or targeted spells ( meaning they get to maybe attack once before dying), so no Zyra is not a Dot mage anymore.\n\nUtility? Like really? Utility?

It's worth focusing damage on to them to kill them before the champion.\n2. It's not worth focusing them, and you should just try to burst out the champion.\n\nThe problem is that it's really really hard not to have them fall into the second category. Assuming the summoner is squishy (they all are) and assuming the summoner has meaningful damage outside of the pets (they all do), then focusing their pets will often naturally become more costly than effective.\n\nThere are a few ways to counter this, but Riot has seemed to mostly go for \"Make pets die really quickly - but resistant to aoe\". That way they can't be cleared for free just by using your aoe spells, but they still die relatively quickly to focus.\n\n\nAnother issue is that it's really hard to make control mages that work as control mages but aren't excessively anti-melee - the fundamental idea of a control mage is that they set up a space as their territory, and they zone/punish using short ranges and slow-ramping abilities; but most melee champions don't have the tools to avoid or play around their claimed territory.
