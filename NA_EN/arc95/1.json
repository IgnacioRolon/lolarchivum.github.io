That screeching audio can happen for a few different reasons depending on what exactly is going on, so let's try a couple different quick fixes first. \n\nIf you're using Razr Synapse, let's try disabling that when you make the highlight. I've seen some reports from other players that turning off your Synapse has helped make that screeching stop for some reason.\n\nNext let's try rerecording that highlight, but _**make sure not to use the fast forward feature before you start recording**_. This is another weird thing that I've seen many players confirming that this is what caused the noise to begin with, and not fast forwarding was able to make it stop. \n\nHit me back up and let me know if either of those works, I'm actually incredibly curious to get to the bottom of this myself.","replies":[{"poster":"arc95","date":"2017-04-29T03:17:04.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response\n\nso the first recording was done without using the 2x style fast forward and it had screeching (made another one just to make sure and it also had  screeching)\n\nI made an another recording without using any timeline traversal tool( so I didn't skip ahead in the game) before starting to record and it minimized screeching there is only a little bit in the beginning before I skip forward (I also made another highlight from a different recording doing the same thing and it also only had screeching prior to the skip none after)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOz-OK-LDb0&feature=youtu.be","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-29T03:46:02.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's good we were able to tone down that noise a bit, but I definitely want it gone for GOOD.\n\nReach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can take a closer look with you at what exactly is going on.
