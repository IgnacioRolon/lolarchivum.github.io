Its the junglers job to make sure *you dont lose your lane*. Lets say you ganked that irelia lvl 2 after scuddle and blue. Maby your top would of won lane. The problem with junglers is that they tend to ignore top lane completly. If you dont gank top lvl2, 3, or 6 you deserve to be b1tched at. So yah dont act like you have not your fault at all, it's a team game dude.","replies":[{"poster":"EpikFeeder","date":"2015-03-29T15:39:58.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which makes no sense, seeing that most junglers start where bot lane starts and finish first clear on top side.....why not just stroll into top lane before you recall lolz.","replies":[{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-03-30T19:23:05.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because most junglers when they reach top lane will have about 25% health, if they can even get that far.\n\nPersonally, when I get to top I check status up there, if the lane is pushed favorably and the enemy laner is low, I will gank. If not, I kill scuttle and back. If the enemy laner is full health, the odds of me simply feeding a kill are very high.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riv x Kobe","date":"2015-03-29T23:30:56.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if I'm shoved up to my turret for the entirety of the lane phase and never get a gank there is a problem. Also, junglers who afk farm the jungle are the worst.","replies":[]}]}
