But C9 knows better (most of the time) than to take a disadvantageous fight.\n\nThe point, though, is that ahQ clearly didn't pressed in any resemblance of a decent way to get an advantage, that was the key of the game\nBalls was clearly suffering in the 1 vs 1 vs Ziv, but ahQ did not pressured in any way top  with Ziv not diving Balls under tower and/or sending other members of the team top (and rengar would have been the perfect champ to sneak behind Balls). \nThey didn't even press other lanes or trying to estabilish pressure to scare off C9 from getting objectives around the map, and that's why evryone got surprised when C9 got 1st dragon with such ease...really, even bottom of the table LCS teams would have tried to pick off Balls shortly after getting their first blood on mid to push the wave top and at least trade the dragon for a turret\n\nThat's why people are arguing that this loss was pretty much ahQ fault. They really stopped playing their style...or well, any style after getting that first blood on incarnati0n. Anz Ziv and westdoor had subpar perfromances overall\nAgain, no one is taking credits off C9 squad, but those ahQ passiveness and lack of team strategy seemed like watching a talented amateur team try to play vs pros.

I think they just suddenly got lost once they had the first blood on incarnati0n, which made even less sense given that, as you correctly pointed out earlier, they thrive on fighting after getting kills, and instead they remained hyper passive, and that was about the time when Sneaky and Lemon started to win the bot lane battle that started up the entire chain of events that led C9 to win (get uncontested first dragon, then having the successful teamfight, and then the completely stomp)","replies":[{"poster":"Magearna","date":"2015-10-02T15:13:44.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember exactly when it happened, but Rengar didn't ult, he just walked in.
