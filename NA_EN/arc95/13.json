You would be punished for not connecting.\n\nIt's funny how people throw the it can be exploited excuse when there is nothing to exploit. This just allows teams starting as a 4v5 to end the game at 10 minutes instead of waiting until 20 minutes, that afker receives a punishment whether the game ends at 10 or 20. So, the only difference is the team of 4 saves 10 minutes and the painful experience of waiting that extra 10 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-03-29T13:38:18.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once our team stomped so hard that the enemy jungler ragequited and we won at 15 minutes.
