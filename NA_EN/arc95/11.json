You don't need to be a challenger smurf to beat darius as Aatrox.\n\nMax E and fire off lots of poke. It's magic damage and it's taste of darius's own medicine (Darius has a lot of damage in the form of magic damage, so it's hard to go on defense outside of building straight up HP. It's not in the form of poke though.) \n\nThings to be weary of against darius as aatrox: Ignite. He has just upped the anti on his early cheese factor and is much stronger in a duel against you, however he's still on a ticking timer of \"Either I stomp this lane into dust or I start falling off heavily\" (Aatrox isn't know for his lategame either, but is way more flexible in teamfights and naturally a better splitpusher... Darius is even more useless if he opted ignite instead of TP/flash)\n\nMore than anything, the enemy jungler. He could lose you this lane and may play a bigger factor than darius himself.\n\nThe lane explained: You need to realize that you can't really 100-0 him like he can to you. Your strength comes from the poke he doesn't have and the sustain he doesn't have. Weave in and out of trades if you choose to go into a melee brawl that isn't enough to kill him. Be mindful of his pull as it will cancel your Q in mid flight. Disengage early so when he does pull you back, you can still walk away. Your ability to heal back up with W by whacking minions is huge. He has no built in sustain. When darius trades in the middle of a minion wave, which he is likely to do... it shoves the lane toward your tower. He's got nothing but flash for an escape and is an easy gank. You have no reason to push to his tower. Ever. On any champion. If it can be helped, just don't. \n\nAatrox is actually listed as a great counter to darius and it's true.

I think the above matchup is similar. Atrox can \"outplay\" Darius even if he can't win a direct fight. How you play is a big factor\n\nOther examples that I see might include Galio vs Ahri. He can completely out damage her, and out sustain her, but if he fails to land consistent skill shots, or Ahri utilises her mobility well to whittle down his hp, Galio can still lose either due to mana or just generally being outplayed.

This includes champs like riven or nasus. The top laner needs to keep them down, and if they are fed or stacked, don't gank, it's no worth. \n2: the 2v1 top champ. This includes rumble, darius, my favorite, mordekaiser. These types can 2v1 the opposing top laner and jungler. This is not the normal gank, you need to be careful and aware of their cool downs.
