I'm not new to MOBA's I've played a few, but I decided I might as well give League a try considering how large it is.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I just downloaded the game and started the tutorial. But when it wanted me to recall back to base (which for me is the B key) it wouldn't work. I don't know why, because every other hotkey has worked just fine. But for some reason B, or anything I bind recall to, won't work. The icon for recall isn't even there. It's just a transparent circle with the letter 'B' next to it. I don't want to jump into any games before this gets fixed, so is it just a problem with the tutorial?\r\n\r\nRunning Mac OS X btw. I have already tried the whole deleting a file inside the Config folder but it still didn't fix anything. PLEASE help because I'm very interested in this game and would love to get into it.
