I only ever feel like I'm cheated by him if he has Rylai's + his passive procced, or Conqueror procced. His synergy with Rylai's and Conqueror is frustratingly strong, but I just remind myself that he's a Juggernaut. I wouldn't have a fun time if a Darius, Urgot, or Garen had gotten atop of me either, so why should Mordekaiser be an exception?\n\n Overall, I rather face Mordekaiser over any other Juggernaut because he gives more breathing room so long as you dodge the claw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-27T17:42:34.752+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Posting about how easy Mord is to deal with when you main him with a 65% winrate is a bit shady....","replies":[]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-11-27T12:08:22.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you sure it's not that you're team comp was horrible, you and your top fed. Like they were going to win if there top was darius or someone else.\n\nLike this shows you have no clue wtf to do vs mord  \"All he had to do was flash banish my arc, and heal his way to victory.\" Like you know the adc isn't everything right?  You know the enemy is down a player also right? You know your neeko and it's basically impossible for a mord to kill you right? Especially with that build right? Like you know you didn't have %pen in a 40 min game right? \n\nLike how about you try learn about how to fight a champion before complaining in fact I'm pretty sure that the fact he was mord give you a chance. Since if that was a darius or renekton that fed you would of lost Much faster.\n\nPlease don't say a champion is op when he is fed since it means nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"playboi2001xD","date":"2019-11-27T12:23:05.386+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I swear to God Mordekaiser is terrible. he's literally AP Garen, completely shutdown by anti-healing items, only relevant if he gets ahead.\n\nAll you have to do to beat this garbage champion is not die, which is incredibly easy as his E is;\n1. easy to dodge\n2. on a 24 / 21 / 18 / 15 / 12 second cooldown (way too long to be good)\n\nHis ultimate is essentially his only relevant spell and even that is only relevant if he gets ahead.\nIf you are losing to this champion, it is because your top laner fed him.
