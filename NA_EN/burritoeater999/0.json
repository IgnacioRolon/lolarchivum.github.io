You also track in game chat (like they do know) and take into account any bullying/toxic behavior and then adjust LP again on the outcome of that.\n\nTime spent by Riot building a system like this would do better for the health of the game then a new Lux Skin and in the end better game Health = more Skins bought.\n\nRiot is spending their work Time on the quick buck in a game that has been out for 10 years.
