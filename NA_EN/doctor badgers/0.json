Shouldn&#039;t level 20-30&#039;s know how to play the game by now?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-11T01:45:18.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, if you're talking about playing on that account, you are unlikely to play with a lot of people that know what they are doing. The learning curve for League is steep and it takes a while to really learn most of the basics properly. Hit 30 first, then focus on improving yourself, because you can't exactly improve those around you very much. If you really are better than those around you you will tend to climb up in Rank/MMR and start playing with people that know better.\n\nLooking at your matches, you don't seem to know any better than your teammates (which is fine, it's expected); watch high elo streamers and pros, read guides, ask for tips, and keep practicing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Badgers","date":"2016-09-12T03:46:33.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have considered that.

They run aimlessly, build bizarre items, die over and over and are often toxic children not yet weeded out.\n\nYou will start seeing more intelligent people in normal games a bit past 30. This year lowered the exp needed to reach 30, so the current new lv30 is more like the lv20 of last year.
