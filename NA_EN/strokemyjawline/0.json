VERY early this morning i got a notification from my bank that I was charged $35 again but I didn't have a second receipt, nothing besides what i bought in my transaction history, and no change in the amount of RP I have. I tried submitting a ticket but the page wouldn't load all the way or correctly, so i couldn't fill out everything. If i could talk to a Dev that'd be fantastic since I can't find a phone number to call either.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T20:35:29.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this for you, I only see one transaction for the RP purchase you made.  It's very likely that the additional you see might be showing as pending, and won't go through at all.  You can reach out to us to confirm by sending us an email via support@riotgames.com, in case the ticketing system isn't working for you.  We'll respond as soon as we can!","replies":[{"poster":"StrokeMyJawline","date":"2016-10-21T21:35:22.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for replying!
