I try to download and watch replays of pro players from op.gg. But they are with lags all the time. Or replay starts from 10 minute. For example after 2/3 of replay length I get \"Unable to download spectator data. The game will now exit.\" error. Or replay starts from 10 minute. Is it problem on my side or with replay files? How to fix it?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-30T00:53:17.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't provide any sort of troubleshooting for Op.gg replays.
