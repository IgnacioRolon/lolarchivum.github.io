Truth be told, I don't know if it was always owned by Tencent, but the game turned beyond garbage.\n\nWhen I logged in for the first time most of the content was f2p, quite literally there was only one entirely cosmetic character model you **had** to pay to get it.\nThe rest was like IP/RP system we have in LoL, with a twist; you can rent a weapon for a day, a week, a month or perm for either in-game currency or $$$.\nNow, 3 years after I stopped playing and about 5 since I started, 90%+ of the content is Pay 2 Win.\n\nLike, they added a chest system, which you could buy for Crossfire's IP or RP. At first it was 50/50, like 2 f2p chests and 2 premium ones.\nWhen I checked it half a year ago the number of $$-exclusive chests is about 5-7 times as high as f2p ones.\nSame for buyable content.\n\n---\n\nHow does it fare for Riot Games and League?\n\nSo far we had skins price adjustment and since then most of newly released once were, in fact, more expensive. Hell, when was the last time a new champion had their launch skin priced at 975 RP?\n_\"But muh new spell sounds\"_, said Katey explaining why Fire Diana is 40% more expensive than L.Goddess Diana.\n\nThen we have Hextech System in which it's pretty much impossible to get enough key fragments to open all chests, basically saying, _\"Go to the shop and spend $$$ to unlock me!\"_.\n\nOf course then there's also Dynamic Queue which caters to casuals and fucks up matchmaking balance by allowing any number of people make premade lobbies and play aganist unorganized parties of any size or solo players.\n\nNot to mention back in the day, when they introduced Ladder Overlay to ranked queue, so people wouldn't _feel bad_ about their rank, or so they'd feel like they're making progress.\n\nOr when they made it impossible to get demoted from Gold for inactivity, so casual players can get all rewards despite not actually playing ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"RoyaiChaos","date":"2016-04-28T19:42:11.564+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":6,"body":"I can't believe you're saying that Hextech crafting is a sign that the game is more ptw (when did _skins _ even become ptw?).

Sure the keys incentivize you to buy boxes or keys with RP, since you usually end up with a lot more of one, but you don't have to buy shit. If you have some patience, you get a box a week and a key after a few games if you queue up with at least 1 other person. If you still want to queue solo...go for it, just less chance of free skins...which never existed before anyway so in that case nothing has changed.\n----\nI guess the only complaint I really have is the wide range of ranks they allow to queue up as a group in ranked (gold 5 can queue with plat 1. That is actually disgusting, but a very rare occurrence. My personal worst experience was when I was plat 5 and had a plat 2/gold 4 duo, which tbh yeah did ruin the game).\n\nbut eh, rank isnt everything.

Rito is still in charge of themselves, but Tencent makes profit off of them and Rito has to make sure the game will work well in China.  China isn't the only country that League has to pander to, since there are many restrictions throughout the world on certain things, like drugs/alcohol and blood.  China is the reason that Karthus doesn't have a skull face anymore, but it isn't due to Tencent, it's due to not wanting to violate Chinese law.  Rito is even replacing Tencent art resources and removing control of the pipeline that Tencent had in China with the global splash art unification project.  League is still a great game, and I certainly wouldn't say it's being destroyed.  It is in a transitional phase right now, as Rito revamps a lot of the systems in place behind the game, such as the client, the new champ select, dynamic q, global splash art unification, class updates, tons of champion reworks, etc, etc.  I honestly think Rito is trying to do too much at a time right now, so a lot of things don't get as much attention as they deserve, but this phase should be over within a year or two, and League will be way better because of it.\n\ntl;dr Tencent is bad, Rito is not.

You're just using Tencent as ammunition, and I'm quite sure you've no idea how a real business works. It seems to me you're just angry that the game is not in a favorable state for you right now, and you're looking for scapegoats to blame. \n\nTencent is not to blame. In fact, no one is, \"to blame\" unless your biased opinion is that the game is shit right now. It seems to be doing quite fine as of late. Balance issues have always cropped up, I don't know what online game doesn't have to deal with them these days, its the way it is. Perfect balance can probably never be achieved, and again, its certainly not Tencents fault for this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PuffySoftBunny","date":"2016-04-28T23:11:38.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thought I would give my two cents.\nI have been playing this game since closed beta, however I have been playing it much less since most of my friends play DOTA, and I personally enjoy more aspects of DOTA.\n\nFirst i will say that your assessment of TenCent being an evil as fuck company is 100% accurate, currently they are gamifiying nationalism in China Ref.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHcTKWiZ8sI. ]\nTLDR for the ref: Facebook with a gamer-score associated to you as a person and the more you do things that promote and agree with china's agenda the better your score and the more access you have to economic options, mortgage rates, rent, tax deductions ect. (Where it gets fucked up) the score goes down if you do the opposite or if you have friends who do the opposite, not currently giving you anything immediately negative, but of course they wouldn't do that publicly, it will probaly happen on a micro and social level.\n\nI left LOL for 2-3 years back in 2012 because I didn't like their business model and I didn't like the a few of the game mechanics. The reason I state the mechanics is that you are talking about the direction the game is going, and i'm giving my perspective on two different on how to popular games in the same genre handle mechanics and resource management\n\nMajor reason:\n1: Lol has a very low level pay to win business model: 90% of champions are released stronger than average for two reasons, so that i don't sound like i'm blowing smoke out my ass. The only way riot makes money off players is through the purchase of RP which you can use to buy skins and champions. Release a champion super strong w/ skins and get players to purchase both. 1st which is valid: Releasing a champion broken means more people will play it, giving you plenty of data to balance it. The 2nd reason which I didn't like is that anyone could guarantee themselves a 70% - 80% win ratio for a while until they were balanced, if they are balanced. Examples, Mord, Vlad, LeeSin, Kog, Shaco, Ezragril, Lux, Garen, Udyr, Noct, Jarven, Riven, Irelia, Darius and others.\n\nMinor Reasons: Resource management:\n1. -Defenses (health and resistances) are two plentiful in relation to per gold spent. Thus the Tanky DPS meta.\n2. -Stagnate setup and lane meta. Pretty much only 3 -5 champ jungle rotation viable (pro level specific), not a whole lot of roaming diversity among lanes,\n3. - no gold loss upon death, a distinct difference between Dota V LOL (not including time not spent in lane from death)\n\n**I'm not saying the game is bad, i'm saying its a different game than what I want to play and here are the reasons I was driven away.**","replies":[{"poster":"IreliaCarrlesU","date":"2016-04-29T00:05:42.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"the balance argument is lost, on you, since u don't know how to balance champions. irelia has had 6 nerfs, and 1 buff in 2 years, and has remained able to beat all the new released champions,( and most of your examples) if played well.\n\nas for your minor personal problems, the first one is just called meta, it changes all the time, and that u listed one of the most inconsistent, player base dependent things in the game as a problem tells me your impatient, or inexperienced.\n\nminor2: JUNGLE META, changes all the time, very inconsistent, 1 players experience cant be used as a factual, representation of a problem at all, yadda yada yadda.\n\nMinor 3: gold loss on death, creates too much loss upon death, since u losing gold,and your enemy gaining gold creates a gap, that would make those very same, on unbalanced and unfair newer champions have a highly unfair advantage. u cant moan about unfair champion experiences and then ask for a mechanic that would intensify that very hypothetical problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Rendarkan","date":"2016-04-29T03:05:03.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See you can't use Irelia as an example though cause she beats almost every god damn match up she goes against.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
