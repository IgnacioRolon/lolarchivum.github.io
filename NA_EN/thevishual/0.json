Typically requiring my junglers attention. In some match ups i can't always count on my jungler being there 24/7 which is why i may take champions that are different from my usual play style to come out even and help my team out overall. Essentially jungler doesn't have to camp me 24/7 and has a greater possibility of getting the other lanes to snowball.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
