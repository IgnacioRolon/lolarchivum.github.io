Could you get used to it after months of playing? Maybe. Is it how you liked it and laid out in the most pleasing way for you? No. It was unneeded and no one asked for it.\n\nIf someone doesn't like the UI, why are you to tell them \"oh well you'll just get used to it\". It's our game, not yours. I didn't say for the people who think its good to delete the UI, just give an option to toggle from classic/new. I've been using it for several years, it worked great and it hampers my ability to play the game when I have to re-learn everything I've been doing forever for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Saruyan","date":"2015-07-23T15:20:12.589+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"actually changing things without giving them the choice is a perfectly normal thing, and this isnt the first time.\n\nthe old shop existed, took time to get used to and now its considerably better,\n\npeople hate because people resist change. \n\nits not inefficient in information, in fact its more efficient in information, because it gives stats in the primary area that screen than the old one did, ie cdr,range.\n\nthere are places where the information is not as good, such as seeing the actual cdr timers on ally ultimate, its pretty small if you were looking to see exactly when their ultimate is coming up, but even then it gives more info than the old.\n\nthe main reason i believe people are angry with the hud, is that they continue to look in the top right for their quick information, and finding it there, which is something that could be addressed.\n\nproblem is, everyone is just bitching, and not giving feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"TheVishual","date":"2015-07-23T15:24:11.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saruyan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rU7nUAFQ,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-07-23T15:20:12.589+0000)\n>\n> actually changing things without giving them the choice is a perfectly normal thing, and this isnt the first time.\n> \n> the old shop existed, took time to get used to and now its considerably better,\n> \n> people hate because people resist change. \n> \n> its not inefficient in information, in fact its more efficient in information, because it gives stats in the primary area that screen than the old one did, ie cdr,range.\n> \n> there are places where the information is not as good, such as seeing the actual cdr timers on ally ultimate, its pretty small if you were looking to see exactly when their ultimate is coming up, but even then it gives more info than the old.\n> \n> the main reason i believe people are angry with the hud, is that they continue to look in the top right for their quick information, and finding it there, which is something that could be addressed.\n> \n> problem is, everyone is just bitching, and not giving feedback.\n\nThe new shop still sucks...
