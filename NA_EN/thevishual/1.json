The same applies to League. Some champions will barely be stronger than others. Right now I think the issue is with items, not champions, but that will get fixed in time. Vayne is NOT that much stronger than ANY OTHER ADC in the game. She isn't. The balance between ADCs is the best it has been in a very long time.

Go learn the game, quit your crying, and stop making negative posts.\n> \n> Happy laning.\n\n**TL;DR**: Vayne is extremely hard to punish, because she has so many safety mechanics. The second she is picked, you're obligated to win lane because you'll lose it by default if it becomes a farm off. At level six, she becomes one of the best duelists in League, and counterbuilding her is tough.  Therefore, while not necessarily overpowered, she is rightfully hated because there are few and far between windows of opportunity to punish her, and she has SO MANY ways to keep herself safe.\n\n-----\n**Long Version**:\n\nI'm not the OP, but I'd like to chime in. Vayne is annoying because she's a relic of the past, when \"Just beat them pre-6\" (As laughable as that was) was considered legitimate counterplay. Plus, a tun of her counters were nerfed over the years, and Riot has no interest in making ADCs actually weak early game.\n\nHowever, this is only ONE SMALL PIECE of the puzzle. Plenty of champions scale well. However, Vayne is also incredibly safe. She has a knockback (Potential stun), a low CD re-position and stealth. So, punishing her is often a very difficult endeavor. Does the list end here? Not at all. We're just getting started.\n\nShe's an incredible duelist. One of the best duelists in League, actually. So, odds are, unless you overwhelm her by devoting an incredible amount of resources to keep her down, she'll catch up even if put behind. It's even more difficult to put her behind because she is so innately good at beating people in a 1v1/2v2. So, here's ANOTHER REASON she's difficult to punish.\n\nSurely that's it, though, right? Well. She has % max health true damage, which shreds the Hell out of tanks. That makes it difficult to even counterbuild her, in addition to counterplay her.\n\nAdd to this the fact that she also scales extremely hard, and she can just play it safe, abusing all of these defensive mechanisms. The second Vayne is picked, you play the Vayne Game. You absolutely must her behind and yourself ahead, because by default, you lose the lane if it becomes a farm lane.

But, their safety strongly works to prevent this. Therefore, overpowered or no, she will always receive complaints. That is the nature of champions that are both extremely frustrating to play against and considerably safe.\n\nAll I see is people listing her strengths. Anyone ever thought about her weaknesses?\n\nShe has some of the lowest starting armor + armor per level scaling in the game, as well as one of the lowest health gains in the game. She is extremely squishy, so she is easy to burst if you catch her. She is also ranged, so her magic resistance stays at 30 for the whole game.\n\nShe also has a small mana pool coupled with a 90 mana cost on condemn. Early game she can only afford about 2-3 condemns before she is out of mana. That's when you engage, because she also can't tumble away.\n\nOn the account that it is hard to CC her because of her tumble, play someone with targeted CC like Taric or Ryze. In the event that you don't have targeted CC, throw an ability to force her to tumble out of it, then throw another to catch her.\n\nPLAY SOMEONE WITH A BLIND/SUPPRESSION. Malzahar, Skarner, Urgot, and Warwick all counter Vayne. Teemo and Quinn can easily 1v1 her late game without problems. And to those of you who say that they \"aren't viable\" I think that a champion who can effectively shut down the enemy ADC, and then proceed to kill them, is viable enough.\n\nUpgrade the trinkets. Throwing down a pink ward or an oracles lense in the middle of a teamfight can go a long way in shutting her down. Her stealth is meaningless.\n\nBait. Out. The. Condemn. Use someone who can get in and out of a fight to kill her and force her to use spells to keep herself safe. Then go back in with a partner to kill her once things are on CD. If she flashes or heals you have 5 and 3 1/2 minutes respectively to try again and kill her.\n\nPeople say that fighting her is difficult. And I agree that it is. But it is no more difficult than it is to fight Lux or Sivir or Jax or anyone. Counterplay is there. I think what is defeating everyone is that she is banned so often these days that when she does get picked people don't know how to effectively fight her. Complaining about the problem doesn't make it go away. It actually makes the whole situation worse, because every moment you spend complaining about something is a moment that could be used to learn how to beat her.","replies":[{"poster":"Names Are Scarce","date":"2015-07-26T07:17:53.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People would rather complain because she's \"OP\" than learn how to beat her.
