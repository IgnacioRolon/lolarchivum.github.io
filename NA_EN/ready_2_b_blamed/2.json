I mean, I've played a few games today. First day of the patch so nothing's set in stone. But in all my years of playing I've never felt worse about a specific iteration of jungle than the current one.\r\n\r\nIt's mainly because if the game- and i'm not exaggerating, if the game is lost within 3 minutes.. It's just lost. Let's say top, mid and/or bot dies within your first clear. And it's probably likely that'll happen. Okay! Well, you lost river control. Unless your top laner tps in and the enemy stays like an idiot then you gank and re-gain river control. But in all likelihood, you probably lost topside scuttle by then. Which means the enemy jungler is ahead by an entire level and you lose river control by default. I just feel like not being able to effectively gank before my teammates inevitably feed first blood sets me further behind than even them. And that's unhealthy for junglers. Like, jungle wasn't perfect before but it was punishing. Because even though ganking top @ lvl3 is the most telegraphed gank of all time- it worked because top laners are... Kind of dumb, to be honest. So, I did rely on that as a leverage to get an early lead. \r\n\r\nNow? I don't really have that. All I've felt that has worked for me is messing with their jungler (assuming I've picked a jungler that wins in 1v1 scenario) and just hoping I got better laners. That way, my lanes can just win w/o their jungler stopping them. But if I don't have better laners then I am just wasting my own time. But ganking, often times, doesn't really work because the enemy laner is just so much more ahead and i'm 2 levels below their jungler because they got scuttles and I couldn't. Effectively we lose every 2v2. There's also the RNG aspect. Let's say your top is winning but your bot is losing. And scuttle respawns bot river. Then you just lose it. You're behind again even though you have 2 kills and their jungler died earlier. Your top laner is kind of useless because it's top lane. I mean it's not the easiest lane to snowball cuz' there's not much to work with. It is possible, though. If your top laner fucking stomps them by 10 minutes. You get herald, rotate mid get tower and reset. But even then, that isn't the safest play because their bot lane and jungler can always rotate mid to stop it pretty easily. But if you wanna be effective, you just have to find the way to get a lead early and turn it into a snowball as it's really easy to do so now. There's hardly any inbetween. You just snowball or you lose. Even if the enemy jungler doesn't snowball as hard as they should be; they're ahead because their laners are winning.\r\n\r\nIf I had to say what the problem is: it's that scuttles offer a LOT... But if you lose lane lottery then you don't get scuttles. If you don't get scuttles then the game is over. There's no way to get back into the game, as a jungler. That's my take. Jungle just became more RNG-based and not a role you can carry in.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-05-16T18:27:34.422+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"It just feels like they wanted to take jungle pressure down, but made changes that favor heavily junglers who can clear fast, duel well, and pressure the map well and forced out other junglers who aren't WW, Lee Sin, Xin, Trundle, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazter","date":"2018-05-16T18:53:44.228+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"That's exactly how I feel.

Not effectively. Think about the fact that ADCs aren't necessarily gonna be any easier to kill just because they traded armor for HP. It just changes the dynamic of laning phase a little bit. Matchups should be a little more important. The stronger AD should win. In essence, Caitlyn's gonna have a field day next patch. But the problem with bot is the Supports. It's too effective of a role because too many champions within it have the ability to kind do it all. Rakan is the prime example of this. He's a guy who can casually engage from across the lane and CC your entire team and still shield his ADC twice for the same amount of a Janna shield. You got Lulu who can turn the table with the click of a button. Braum who, for some reason, is one of the most threatening champions in the game. If that guy walks into your jungle you just gotta give the whole thing up. Not much of a choice! A lot of people argue that it is just that they get too much gold. I'd argue simply that they have too much stats. But then there's the gold increases for AD items. Specifically around the Zeal archetype. And that should slow down the scaling of a fair few of ADCs but I'd argue that with the change of bounties that it just creates an incentive to funnel gold into the ADC. Because now they just get basically all the gold. So, in a way, it's kind of an indirect buff that'll especially be prevalent in competitive play. And for all intents and purposes, we might see mids and AD getting smite because you could funnel scuttle crab xp/gold into carries instead of the jungler since it offers so much I am sure that'll be a discussion.\n\nSo, if there was a point here: it is that jungle is not in a position to get \"in line\" with the other roles. It simply adapts. It has always adapted. That's consistently been the problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hold Ma Baguette","date":"2018-05-16T23:55:50.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's still to early to make a post like this give it atleast a week, no  likes having their role nerfed but tbh it was about time jungler's early game impact was tuned down.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-05-17T01:21:39.042+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me put it this way.\n\nI just jungled {{champion:516}} .

It was a defense mechanism for, what essentially amounts to stupidity. You can't play top lane and expect to not get ganked around level 3. It was the most telegraphed gank timer in jungle history. I'm sorry if i'm punishing simply because you don't expect to be ganked @ level 3 even though it's probably happened to you in 95% of your games and- honestly, even now it's still gonna keep happening even if it's very punishing to junglers to trade scuttle crab for an early gank. But the argument there would be that you set your laner ahead, therefore, you get river control for the rest of the game. Unless they fuck up. In which case, you probably lose the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"royalpaste","date":"2018-05-17T16:02:10.189+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"after playing on pbe for a bit, all i can say is right now jungle is awful. god forbid you pick a tank or a scaling champion. they got a lee or xin? well your fucked now cause you gonna be sitting there 3 levels behind 3k behind in gold and useless as a sack of rocks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hügö","date":"2018-05-16T18:57:22.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Had a game.

There was a small window in which you are a level higher than laners but it's very telegraphed so, on paper, it should hardly matter but laners get punished during it anyways. If anything, Riot needed a way to just slightly shift xp towards the later parts of the game. And for the record, you can still gank early and have an xp lead. Just do blue-gromp-scuttle and gank top. Or red-gromp-scuttle and gank bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Hügö","date":"2018-05-17T17:26:42.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did alot of cheese things.
