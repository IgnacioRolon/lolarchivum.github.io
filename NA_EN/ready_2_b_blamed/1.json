Shut down your top laner and make the teamfights 4v5. That or make it so that the jungler has to come to your lane to handle you. Thus freeing mid and bot to do whatever.\n\n> 9. Is ADC the most toxic role? I personally think it is.\n\nAs the name implies, a lot of people think its the sole \"carry\" role so people would have over inflated self importance on everything.

There's no way a utility-tank-assassin will ever exist in the game in a healthy manner. By definition an assassin is  basically a champion who can kill a squishy in a few seconds. If Ekko can fill the role of assassin while also sporting tank builds and maintaining a high amount of utility, he definitely isn't balanced nor is he healthy. Either Ekko will be able to do way too much or he will be useless. Ekko currently is primarily played as a Jungler and goes for a bruiser or straight tank build almost every game. You could say this is fine because Ekko's damage lacks behind other assassins, but this is simply not true. Ekko as a tank falls behind other assassin' damage output by usually 3,000 - 4,000 damage, and when he is built with a mostly damage build he is pretty much in the normal range for assassin damage per game on average (being around 20,000 - 22,000)\n\nIt doesn't help that his kit is insanely overloaded and his kit is designed to unpunish players for making mistakes with him which is my main point about him being broken. _**You accidentally got caught out? R to restart to your last save!**_ on top of him having a dash and potentially a targeted blink is simply too much safety on top of him being able to build tanky (and still maintain his fair damage output). He needs a rework that gives him a defined role outside of \"utility-tank-assassin-bruiser-mage\". It's like Azir who had no defined role or strengths, he could do so much and his kit kind of made no sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-04-06T15:25:38.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Top of the Ladder players think Ekko is one of the most broken champs in the game by far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zidaryn","date":"2016-04-06T10:29:01.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I definitely agree with you on that Ekko part.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nyhver","date":"2016-04-06T18:39:05.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=killzkrazy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MfIc94TX,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-06T03:32:23.108+0000)\n>\n> 4.

Darius seems to have gotten pretty rare these days.\n\nMuch to the surprise of many people, darius actually seems to be a pretty decent counter to champions like poppy who love to get in people's faces. Since darius isnt usually encountered all too much, people really dont know how to play with him. This is kind of a double edged sword because sometimes youre teammates dont recognize the importance of allowing your ult to finish that low enemy instead of taking the kill and preventing you from getting noxian might (that lowers your damage output by a lot).\n\nOf course, as someone mentioned before, lane bullies are always good in solo queue, especially lower elos where people seemingly refuse to play safe even when they are behind. I've gotten to points where the enemy jungler would come in and gank, I would shrug and just get a double kill with the dunks.\n\nDarius is, or perhaps was since the new meta, the archetypical lane bully.

But you did state that such champions were good at splitpushing (Udyr,Yi) I just don't think so. I mean yeah, they do. I just don't think junglers are in a good spot to be splitpushers and that's why Zz'rot portal is there, to do it for them. Reason being is because top laners can just take tp, also get zz'rot and splitpush on their own. Nowadays tp is a requirement if you wanna splitpush. Also I don't care too much for team comps in soloQ or.. dynamicQ* so I don't really care if a team is full AD. I just don't think these champions have much uses because of their inconsistency. If the enemy snowballs while you are an Udyr or a Yi they kind of just win the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-04-06T04:48:09.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ideally, junglers *shouldn't* be splitpushers.

He's a wall but with some walls you just have to turn the corner and that's what I personally think Udyr is. Sure his base damage is high but that's like mandatory for every tank in the game! A \"good\" tank needs something unique something that defines them and also makes him stand out, makes him traditionally not just annoying but basically a raid boss. A good example of what Udyr is.. is Sion. Sion may have a sprinkle of CC and is damn tanky but he doesn't really DO much. He just sits there and becomes a wall where you can just turn in the corner and pass by it like it doesn't exist.\n\nActually you can say that the later the game goes the better it is FOR the full AD comps. Sure around 30 mins the enemy may have a bit of armor but around 36 mins your team should have a box filled with last wispers and it just becomes really easy to win no matter how much armor the enemy has. I guess it moreso depends on champions although I believe this works out in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-04-06T05:30:29.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not wrong, because there *are* better tanks who does that job better.

But, I have time, sooooooooo.\n> \n> Your move.\n\nOkay. First, addressing Yi, Udyr, Shyvana\nYi: I admit champions like these tend to have insane damage output but at the same time it's an amount that exceeds the necessary damage you should need. I am not arguing that it's not a lot of damage but, with my experiences against Yi's it's easy to just wait for him to come in and burst him or catch him and burst him. Another point is that he takes WAY too long to scale. Well, not that he takes long but during the early game you're setting your team to basically 4v5 because you're just useless that entire time. Even when you have sated you need like 2 items to really spike, which I guess you should have an item and a half by that time but still. Counterganking is really hard to because Yi is probably the only 1 of these types of champions that doesn't have innately strong base damage. He's basically a weaker Shyvana in all points because even if he may have slightly more damage output later in the game, he still has the weakness of being easily burstable (no matter how you build him) Shyvana is just tankier in that regard so while she can be bursted it's not to the extent of Yi. Which bring me to Shyvana.\nShyvana: She basically is Yi but she doesn't have his weaknesses. She's still pisspoor at ganking early but she does carry that innate damage that helps her countergank. Easily kiteable like Yi yeah but she's got it. The only thing i'd say is that she's a DEVOURER jungler so... I only consider her good in higher elo where you have more reliable teams to not get snowballed on way too early into the game.\nUdyr: As much as I love Udyr's design I hate his kit. He is easily the most useless champion in the game for me. Like, his ganks suck ass unless the laner actually tries to get ganked by him. I think Yi ganks better than Udyr because at least Yi has Alpha Strike to close a gap. Granted, Udyr's damage output is INSANE! It's just way too hard to actually get it off because he's easily the most kiteable champion in the game. I just think the only reason people saw him as \"OP\" is because he was firstly selected to take Zz'rot. Zz'rot is truly OP and is nothing to do with Udyr.\n\nI personally don't like tanks because it's just a luxury, not for you, but for your carries. And it's soloQ you can't really carry with a tank especially in lower elo because carries are unreliable. Especially ADCs who are obsessed with having a \"Tank\" on their team and like... It gets BAD. When you hear  them say \"We woulda won if we had a tank\" you know it's just dumb. SoloQ players shouldn't expect luxuries and if you need a luxury to carry you are just not climbing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2016-04-06T14:53:19.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=killzkrazy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MfIc94TX,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-06T03:32:23.108+0000)\n>\n> 1. I think devourer junglers are bad (excluding Kindred because I don&#039;t really consider her a &quot;devourer jungler&quot;)\n\nDevourer junglers are usually better for SoloQ, especially low-mid elo(bronze to gold, maybe plat), because they can take advantage of Guinsoos and Sated so easily and go full tank. However with enough team focus, so against a 4-5 or maybe even just 3-man premade working together well, they can easily win against them. Master Yi is the biggest offender, often working in even high elo because of his untargettability with Q.\n\n> 2. Ekko?\n\nPersonally I think he's pretty stupid at the moment, building tank and doing tons of damage, but I see just as much of a problem with champs like Fiora and Graves.\n\n> 3. What sort of top laner you think is better for soloQ\n\nGenerally, if you have map awareness, I think Shen. He's a good laner, has a global ult, and with TP can easily gank lanes with his almost unnoticeable ultimate effect and go in for the taunt and slow for the kill. Then he can teleport back to lane or if possible just recall and get items or take the tower.\n\n> 4. How balance is being handled right now. In my opinion it&#039;s going horribly wrong.\n\nI think its terrible for the players but great for Riot. From a business point of view, making champs always OP at times makes more people buy their skins and they've been keeping most of them OP just long enough to make people think they'll stay that way, then they nerf them to eh-range and buff someone else.\n\n> 5. The state of junglers\n\nI think junglers are probably in the best stay as of current, the only offenders being devourer junglers.\n\n> 6. Dynamic Queue\n\nLike balancing and getting people to buy skins, Dynamic Queue is doing the same thing, putting players in a position where they need a premade or else they get rekt in Ranked and along with premades is the pressure from your friends to buy a skin or buy RP to get a champ or more rune pages and save IP for runes or something of the sort. I personally don't think they'll ever remake SoloQ for that reason, they've done it before and they'll continue saying they will for awhile until we stop complaining and forget about it for the most part, then they'll stop saying they will and won't say they won't.\n\n> 7. Taric Rework\n\nIt looks pretty good, but I feel like the first patch of release will be like any new champ or rework where its pretty OP so people buy him and skins.\n\n> 8. Tanks. I just don&#039;t like tanks in soloQ especially as a jungler.\n\nTanks are a huge problem since the juggernaut update and the Burning Tides event. The new juggernaut items, juggernaut update, ADC update and constant addition of %health and true damage have destroyed the role and turned it into the support who protects his ADC early, possibly lands a few grabs if he has a hook or peels for the first few minutes of a fight before being melted like butter so that he's forced to build a Zz'rot Portal to be semi-useful.\n\n> 9. Is ADC the most toxic role? I personally think it is.\n\nAD in general is very toxic right now, melting tanks like butter, dealing burst and consistent damage, and almost always having mobility whereas AP almost never does, and in general just being the best class in the game. Anyone who scales with AD is better than those who scale with AP, plain and simple.\n\n> 10. Why do people still ban Udyr,Yi,Shyvana and those types of champions.. Why did people think they were good in the first place is a better question?\n\nUdyr was from the start of Devourer, but people learned to play against it and peel. After the Runeglaive update he turned OP because people couldn't kite or peel off of him nearly as easily with the extremely early MS and burst boost. After Runeglaive was nerfed he turned balanced again and people just won't accept it when they get pwn'd by an Udyr and will blame Runeglaive.\n\nMaster Yi is... well, almost everything. He can avoid damage and CC with Alpha Strike, his E procs twice every other hit with Devourer, Devourer AS and Guinsoos AS scale with his ultimate and passive, and with all that Guinsoos, Devourer, and E damage proc'd twice every hit with his passive and Devourer, it makes for tons of damage and after Devourer and Guinsoos he can build full tank, avoid damage and CC with Q, possibly also build Banshee's to dodge more CC and be tanky, his W reduces damage and heals so unless he's CC'd during that time which he can generally dodge with Q if its up then he takes almost no damage.\n\nIn good, communicative premade groups it makes it easier to gang up on him and CC him down, but even then with all his ways of dodging or removing CC(Q, Banshee's, Quicksilver Sash) its very hard to keep him from 3-shotting your carries while moving at 600+ MS.\n\nShyvana is pretty balanced as of this moment, easy to peel and kite if you have the CC or mobility, but before her W MS nerfs she moved so fast you couldn't and her tankiness combined with her ultimate dash and knockback plus Devourer and BotRK or Guinsoos as well as her Flame Breath and Twin Bite made her a prominent threat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-04-06T12:19:52.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">1.I think devourer junglers are bad (excluding Kindred because I don't really consider her a \"devourer jungler\")\n\nPoorly designed and thought out item. Needs to be replaced with something that's less broken when stacked and doesn't encourage mindless AFK farming. I agree that Devourer junglers aren't as overbearing as the boards would like to believe but it's still just a terrible item.\n\n>2.Ekko?\n\nWho decided it would be a good idea to give an assassin an AOE stun? I think a lot of people predicted on release that Ekko was always going to be played tank or bruiser and only be played as an assassin when completely broken. The last buff to him was immensely stupid and if there were any brains at all in Riots balance team they'd be a revert on the PBE already.\n\n>3.What sort of top laner you think is better for soloQ\n\nTanks. Tanks are the best junglers/supports/tops in solo que because uncoordinated players are terrible at killing them.\n\n>4.How balance is being handled right now. In my opinion it's going horribly wrong.\n\n100 monkeys on 100 typewriters. Someone inform Riot that's a proverb and they weren't actually meant to try it.\n\n>5.The state of junglers\n\nEcho's slightly too strong, Cinder's slightly too weak, Warrior's crap and boring, both it and Devourer needs reworks. As for champs Lee's still my least favourite champ in the game. He's picked in every game and I'm sick of him as I have been for the last 2 years. Jungle leashing also needs to be way more punishing to hurt Graves and Kindred. Those champs get too much advantage by kitting camps.\n\n>6.Dynamic Queue\n\nNo strong opinion, I solo when I ranked and I really haven't noticed a difference. It's idiots as normal.\n\n>7.Taric Rework\n\nLooks promising. Seems strong as both a support and a top lanner right now.\n\n>8.Tanks. I just don't like tanks in soloQ especially as a jungler.\n\nTanks add more strategic depth to the game than any other role. When they're weak the game devolves into an assassin shitfest where the person with the quickest reflexes wins and strategy is a distant second. I love jungle tanks (as you can see from my icon I'm not at all biased) and I generally think they're the best pick-ups in solo que. People just suck at focusing them down properly, and BTW most of the time you should focus the tank, that whole \"don't focus the tank\" thing is the dumbest idea bronze has ever came up with.\n\nRight now the problem with tank items stems from a deeper problem in the game. MR isn't a needed stat in most games because the highest value mages are low damage, which in itself stems from itemisation problems. Because of this the two or three strongest armour items in the game become utterly insane and it doesn't matter what they are. Before it was Deadmans and FH, then Deadmans, GA and ZZ'rots now it's Sunfire and IBG. As long as the expected damage output of the enemy team is 80% physical the strongest armour item in the game is going to be the strongest item in the game.\n\n>9.Is ADC the most toxic role? I personally think it is.\n\nYes, bonus points if they're Vayne. Other strong candidates are hard carry junglers and top lanners and assassin mids. People playing non-playmaking ADCs like Ashe, Sivir, Cait, Kog ect are usually OK though, it's normally the Vaynes, Lucians, Ez's and Jhins who are arses.\n\n>10. Why do people still ban Udyr,Yi,Shyvana and those types of champions.. Why did people think they were good in the first place is a better question?\n\nThis is Solo que, where Sej had an above average ban rate 2 months after she'd been gutted.

It gives a to delayed to powerfull spike and caters to champions that on their own are already rather problematic. \nAs a result, low Elos are dominated by devourer as you usually easily can afk farm till sated without worring to much and then just find those small fights where melee-dps champs that use devourer usually thrive, or your YI and thx to the the long game times in low elo you usually reach the breaking point of becomeing op eventually.\nIn higher elos, they are simply usless. Giving up so much early pressure is rarly worth the reward, especially since more coordinated teams can easily handle melee dps later on, as they are easy to peel in teamfights. \n2)\nHe's in a rather good spot right now, if anything his ap-builts could use some help mid-lategame as ap-ekko is rather snowball dependend. Tank ekko might be annoying, but his damage isn't nearly as high as most people claim it is. AS a maokai with same items, i do more damage...\n3)\nLanebullies, SoloQ is all about snowballing right now, you don't want to rely on your team poulling it together and do a proper teamfight, you want to be able to controll the game as soon as possible.\n4)\nDepends on what you all incloud in 'balance'. If it's just the raw powerlevel, i'd say it was horrible at the start of the season and is now on a good way, though still rather slow on reacting to outliners. If you also mean power-distrubution within champions kits, this is where riot goes horrible wrong ever since mid S5. Waaaay to much emphasis on 'unique strategic niches', resulting in over exegerated strengths and weaknesses, resulting in heavy counterpicks and binary situations.\n5)\nMostly the same as in the past, Still incredible massive impact on the game early on, thus only the alreound earlygame powerhouses are good in high elos, especially competetive play. Champs that simply can do it all in the early, clear fast and sustained, gank, savely invade and either have a strong duel or great disengage, so lee, gragas and elise as evergreen jungler unless gutted in numbers with some others rotating based on meta, currently kindret, graves and nidalee since toplane usually packs alot cc so you don't need it from the jungle and can have powerfull ganks with just damage.\n6)\nDon't know why anyone would have though matching solo players and teams against each other would be a great idea...\nAnd the champselect also is rather bad executed, primary role for me should mean 'atleast 60%', and there is a 'random' option missing, as fill = support.\n7)\nGood concept, but the usual balance issue: his powers and weaknesses are to strong defind, leading to a huge diffetrence between worst and best case.\nIn Tarics case, the issue is the passive. As long as he can keep useing the passive AAs, he's a broken beast that can duel even a jax without really loosing any health. But if he gets kited, he has a really hard time as his only skill that helps himn to get into aa range will have a huge CD, and his tankiness also is rather poor if he can't use the passive to lower the shield and heal cd.\nPrettymuch a support juggernaut, probably going to stop in low elos while beeing on the weak side in high elos.\n8) \nI like tanks only if i have a good matchup there i can eventually snowball in soloQ, but i really enjoy them with premates, beeing the main engage and seting up the plays is a great thing - as long as you can trust in your team to bring enough follow-up.\n9)\nKinda agree, though adc is a wierd thing. They have the biggest impact on the outcome of the game as a class, but the players playing the have rather low impact as it's mostly about the team setting them up. This often leads to adc feeling like gods and getting a huge ego while it's the team that does most of the work while they just do their job and clean up.\n10)\nSee 1), and also because they are really sacrrie **IF** they get going, and people probably remeber one or two games in which a yi or shyvana just crushed the game, ignoreing the four other games in which they did absolutely nothing.\nMost Binary champs a precived way more powerfull than they are in average, while consistantly well performing champs like Janna are usually precived much weaker and less opressive than they usually are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-04-06T11:17:51.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I think devourer junglers are bad\n\nDevourer as an item is bad because it promotes unhealthy playstyles.\n\n>Ekko?\n\nOverloaded obnoxious poorly designed mistake.

I see what Riot is trying to do. Like everything Riot does its a great idea in theory, they are just executing it horribly. The vision is that a year or two from now every champion will be reworked to some extent, each will have very strategic niches they occupy and that every champion can carry the game if fed. The correct way to do this would have been to diversify each champion and THEN buff them so could all carry. However, Riot has decided to rework and buff champions at the same time, causing the reworked champions to feel much more powerful than those who haven't been touched yet. Eventually it'll all even out (I hope) but right now everything is jacked up.\n\n6. Another idea that is great in theory but poorly executed. People wanted team builder in ranked: problem solved. People wanted a way to play team ranked when they didn't have 5 people: problem solved. However, the idea to make this system the primary ranked queue is absolutely horrible. Not only does it favor one trick ponies over people who can play a wide variety of champions competently but it also allows boosting to be done very easily in groups of 3 to 5. The biggest effect though is at the challenger level though where LCS premades can dominate lesser known but equally skilled players. The challenger rankings used to be a great place to find rising talent on the esports scene. Now challenger rankings are more about who you know and who you queue with. This is going to make finding and fostering the next generation of pros much more difficult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-04-06T14:17:05.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 2.ekko\n\nwtf about ekko? the tank thing?\n\nFor number 3. \n\nNasus and renekton are pretty sweet right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-04-06T04:32:41.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Yeah, there are better options.\n\n2) Ekko is an interesting product of the Defense creep.

Hmm... Devourer + Guinsoo's is aa hellish combo, but there are champions that can utilize Devourer's without being ridiculous.\nGuinsoo's is too far price-efficient for its effects and damage though.\nI think it's more of an intrinsic problem with the way Devourer works, because the ones that abuse it the most are the ones that can proc it the most (ie, AA champs - Yi, Jax, etc).\n\n2. Ekko QQ is fucking stupid and the people complaining are stupid.\n\n3. For Solo Q? Depends on rank/Unranked.

Either negligable impact, or carries the game, but that's always been a problem excpet around season 4.\n8. Don't care about solo Q, but I also don't play outside of aram unless I have friends to join because of #4.\n9.

Devour Junglers dont fit in this snowbaling meta, early game pressure Junglers are way better.\n2. full tank ekko top is really over-tuned and need immediate action.\n3. pressure tanks, nautilus is a great example.\n4. actually its getting better, they are addressing the issues and overtuned champs pretty fast, compared with the examples of Vayne or Riven in previous seasons when they were must ban and total cancer and riot just ignoring the issue because \"pros dont have a problem with those champs\" its like saying \"get gud scrubs\" but in rito language.\n5. Really good, cinderhulk is a bit weak but i understand tanks are ruling now so any cinder buff will be a problem.\n6. unpopular opinion, i have no problem at all with Dynamic Queue, Premades dont mean good players or good synergy.\n7. Love it!! wont be able to play him tho because it has been months since i played support thanks to the \"queue support secondary or fill that means 100% support\".\n8. yeah they are a bit too powerful now, we need more anti tank options on mages \n9. dont think so, its a necessary role that creates strategy, adc meting tanks while assassins trying to get them thru peeling supports, instead of 5v5 random brawl like 2010.\n10. have no idea, they are so easy to counter, i do ban yi when i play shaco because i cant fight him as shaco and i dont trust my team to be able to handle him, other wise i will not ban him","replies":[]}]}
