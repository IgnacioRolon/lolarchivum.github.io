After the last box has been dropped this bonus quickly decays over 2 seconds. Each box lasts for\r\nup to 60 seconds. Jack-In-The-Box Attacks deal 40/60/80/100/120 (+30% ap) (+15% Bad) magic damage.

Additionally, all physical and magic damage taken inside this\r\nzone are inverted. Each explosion deals 100/200/300 (110% ap) physical damage.\r\n\r\n*Each clone deals 25% of Shaco's damage. Shaco cannot control the clones.\r\n*Giant box deals double the damage of a normal box. After a 2 second delay, the giant box is armed and, upon\r\nactivation, fears all enemies inside the area for 2 seconds.\r\n*Giant box has 400 HP.\r\n\r\n**CONCEPT**\r\nThe idea behind this kit is based off of everyone hating the current Shaco. Mains hate him because he's terrible. Players hate him because he's a pubstomp champion. Everyone hates Shaco even riot. Shaco already has cool, thematic components to his kit but they're the most useless parts about him more often than not. Eventually he is relegated to blinking into invisibility and just running towards whoever he can possibly kill. And then he prays. It's not very interesting especially since Shaco is not supposed to be the religious type. So the way I think it possible to fix these dilemmas is simply to give him less frontloaded damage and make the unreliable parts of his kit more reliable as well as converting him to AP.\r\n\r\n_Damage_ - So, why AP Shaco? Magic damage in the jungle often finds itself in a niche position for several different reasons but that's whatever. The main point is that physical damage junglers are abundant and are forced to contest one another in terms of viability. Shaco has significantly less trouble contesting AP junglers. They all have different kits that wanna do different things depending on comp. The only real contest would probably be against Evelynn due to their kits and the way they end up playing being somewhat similar. However, Evelynn is incredibly hard to pick because there are so many champions that outright counter her without even trying. Which makes her unbelievably good in perfect spots but any less than perfect and she tumbles in priority. The hope is Shaco becomes significantly more blind pickable.\r\n\r\nBeing AP and having his base damage reduced means ganks are somewhat weaker early. That is because Q duration got flattened(buffed early;nerfed late), and MS increased which makes it more reliable to get into lane without feeling of shame of having to trade damage for 3 points of Q to be able to gank. You might notice there are 2 charges to Q (max) and the game starts with 1 because it serves as an easy way to tune his early game. You can easily have him start the game with both charges and suddenly his ganks are a lot stronger. However, I don't think riot wants that nor do I think he needs it. But it's a good way to plan ahead. \r\n\r\nNotably, it's still possible to go AD Shaco. It'd probably be a lot similar to current Shaco in terms of damage output. But I don't think it'll be as viable given that AD Shaco doesn't take great advantage of what this kit offers. I've ensured this to be true by lowering base AD so that tri-force Shaco is nerfed. Opportunity is still there for fun, though. \r\n\r\nAlso, why are there charges on his Q now? Isn't unfair he can blink twice almost instantly? Well, the the thing is if Shaco is going IN he's committed. This new kit is to incentivize hit-and-run tactics whilst also opening it up to teamfighting opportunities. Such as Q'ing in behind enemy lines and blockading their exit with W. Boxes are still fairly easy to kill so it's not like this strat has no counterplay.\r\n> The boon is moreso that Shaco can now toss body forward, create more opportunities and wittle down opposition with less risk at the cost of instant reward. \r\n\r\nThat sentence serves as a good TL;DR so I'll highlight that...\r\n\r\n_Theme_ - Current Shaco is extremely one-dimensional. He goes in and tries to kill; like any other assassin. This Shaco is less like an assassin and more like... A clown. Or at least is more bothersome than fatal. But more than that it plays around with his lore; the fact that he is a marionette- a toy. Again, the coolest aspect about Shaco were his toys. As is apparent I've made his ability to use these toys in greater abundance and more reliable as added benefit. I even brought back the E minigame where the target has to walk back to not get hit in the back cuz'- hey that was just fun gameplay. \r\n\r\nThe ult is self-explanatory. Not everyone will prefer it. That said, the interesting part is \"damage inversion\". This creates a looot of different dynamics that I just won't go all into but basically let's say you have 1 lone carry on your team and the enemy decided to build against them. This would help in that situation given that physical damage becomes magic damage and viceversa. Keep in mind, though that ALL damage is inverted inside the zone so, like Kindred's, it can be a double-edged sword. \r\n\r\nThat is all.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-29T21:47:06.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mains DON'T hate him, though. Riot has said several times that they're terrified of trying to rework Shaco specifically because of his rabid fanbase. I mean, when the assassin reworks happened we had Shaco mains who were absolutely livid about even the slightest changes to his passive and ult (Changes that were obviously nothing but net benefits for him).","replies":[{"poster":"Ready 2 B Blamed","date":"2019-08-29T22:57:23.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know bout all that but I did speak with some hyperbole. Ofcourse we don't \"hate\" him.

Really the only ability of his that looks like it could be completely reworked is his E. I can see the rest of his kit (such as his Q) being modified to play around his passive a little better, but that's it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ready 2 B Blamed","date":"2019-08-30T00:33:36.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't fix what has never worked. Shaco has never been competitively viable and any synergy he has with other champions is predictable in nature due  every one of them requiring a tether that is predictable to see besides Shen who, himself, is not a strong champion unless he finds incredible lead. Both champs benefiting from one another's kits yet both demand gold. It is plain to see why the champion's kit itself is the problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
