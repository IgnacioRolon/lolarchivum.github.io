Let that update do it's thing, and hit me back up if you encounter any errors along the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Rags Maroon","date":"2017-07-10T23:36:25.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know, this is the new client, that's why I'm confused. This doesn't download anything besides updates, and as far as I know there isn't an update waiting to be installed. I only reinstalled like 2 months ago, so I should have downloaded the new launcher and not the old one. Is there something I'm not doing, or did I not download the right installer?\n\nFor reference, this is what my launcher looks like when I log in https://i.imgur.com/aZ5bYbx.png\n\nThanks for taking the time to respond :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T00:34:12.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is indeed the updated client! I thought previously you had mentioned being stuck on that client update, but that doesn't look to be the case.\n\nSooooo I'm honestly a little confused. Your client looks like it's functioning normally, is there anything that been giving you any errors?","replies":[{"poster":"Rags Maroon","date":"2017-07-11T00:57:44.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well no, it's just ugly to see that every time I launch. I don't even know what other people see but it's better than a client telling me it's doing a year old update.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
