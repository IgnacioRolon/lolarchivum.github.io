It tells me to lock in, but I have no option to lock in, then I am punished for it not responding in time. \r\nIt has **ONLY** happened during promotion series, never in between. Which means I have to win another game to get on my promos (FOR THE **THIRD **TIME) and hope I can win them back to back before I get this.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's just my connection, which it may be. However, I do not like the fact that I cannot even lock in once it gets to my turn, I feel like it's a bug because it doesn't only happen to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T18:05:36.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically when I see this situation, the culprit is an unstable connection to the servers. When your connection is unstable to the servers, it can prevent the server from getting your inputs of champ selection, runes/masteries, and even kick you out of champ select entirely. There are a number of factors that could cause this, and you can find most of the solutions on our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if this helped you out.","replies":[]}]}
