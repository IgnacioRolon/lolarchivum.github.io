I usually have it uncapped, and sit around 100 to 120 fps on average during any game mode that I play. I think this issue started on Jan 10th, and just became unbearable after downloading the new patch.\r\n\r\nI've attempted many things\r\nUpdated GPU driver Rollback said driver\r\nTurned all graphic settings down to the lowest settings on the client Flushed out my computer\r\nTried different internet connections for the heck of it Nothing running in the background\r\nReset computer multiple times Running old client, not the new one\r\nIf interested on what I\"m running, I have a 8GB AMD Radeon R9 390gpu, and a i5 6500cpu@3.20ghz for basics.\r\n\r\nI lost on what to do next, my last ditch attempt to resolve the issue is to uninstall LoL, and re download it.\r\nIt might just be a minor 7 fps drop from having 60, but god I can feel the stuttering.\r\n\r\nAny assistance would be much appreciated! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T23:10:44.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your PC may be too good, and in which case you may need to cap per the [high specs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626-Frame-Skipping-on-High-End-PCs) guide.
