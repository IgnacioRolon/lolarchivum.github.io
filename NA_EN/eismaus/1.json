However, one of the images in the post mentions some rough data about \"The Perfect Game\" and says that \"68% earned any Shurima icon, 33% earned the Perfect Ascension icon\", which left me wondering - are those percentages calculated off all the players that **participated** in the event?  Or the total player population?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2014-10-30T11:20:18.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was for players who \"played at least 1 game of Ascension\". Obviously not everyone played Ascension, so the percentage of the total population with Shuriman icons is smaller.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-10-30T12:30:13.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the confusion though. It seems a bit odd that one third of acension players never won a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Tarreb","date":"2014-10-30T17:56:39.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people probably played only one game and decided they didn't like the game mode and didn't play again. Of those players, some of them probably lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-10-30T18:12:30.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the thing is just, it's not some, it's a lot.\n\nAbout one thirs of players played one game and lost, one should expect nearly the same amount of players played one game and won. That means only about one third of ascension players kept playing.\n\nAlso of note is that one third of players were perfect. So most of the actual acension players kept playing until they got that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eismaus","date":"2014-10-30T12:57:13.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the expedient reply, Latency!","replies":[]}]}]}
