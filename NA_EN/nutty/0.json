Feel's not the only consideration we think needs to be weighed here though, with pace of game (choice versus twitch reactions especially) also a really important value.\n\nI can see instant casts being anti-fun because of other champions that have or would have instant casts would not have much counter-play if any, but khazix's Q has plenty of counter-play already and that would transfer to when he gets instant cast or close to instant cast Q. Other instant casts do not have isolation like chogath's ultimate. If cho's ult did have isolation there would be plenty of counter play because he can no longer flash insta kill you under tower or in a minion wave etc it all relies on your positioning and not reaction time. So stating that this would be poor because of reaction time makes no sense because it's more towards positioning. \n\nI'm not asking for it to be instant but close enough to instant where it feels rewarding to good kha players. Kha'zix's problem right now is that he does not feel rewarding to play and is clunky. Everything else is fine and from my experience (I can confidently say I know Kha the best and inside out) this is the exact change he needs to make him the rewarding fast paced squishy assassin that everyone wants. I've tested the changes plenty on PBE and I know from experience that this change would not put him over the top and would put him where no more complaints and or changes would be needed. \n\nI would love to discuss in some sort of instant chat system so everything can be discussed between me and Riot, I want to get all my points across in one discussion. Thanks so much for responding though would love a fast response and maybe talk more in a live chat system? Just to get everything clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deme","date":"2016-02-26T21:39:24.109+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is a good \"buff\" towards Kha'zix.

Sometimes you hear and see the animation go off and nothing happens, other times it does actually connect. \n\nOther champs already have instant moves with no counter play outside of bating it.\n\nKha also does not instantly blink on top and Q someone. He has to get into range which requires an E, R, really good positioning, team coordination, etc. All of those have counter play between sweepers, vision skills like Lee Sins Q, CC, etc. \n\nThe lag on an already casted Q in melee range doesn't make much since.
