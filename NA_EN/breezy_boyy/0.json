While her lore doesn&#039;t state exactly when her &quot;birth&quot; happened, we do know that she was active well before the fall of Zaun, and before Piltover was built on top of it. From her lore it, states that much of her worship came from sailors who looking for a quick voyage, since before Piltover existed, the isthmus the city is now settled on made passage impossible, forcing sailors to sail all the way around the Shuriman continent. So now we know that aside from having a Shuriman name, and being active well before the modern day Zaun which we also know is built atop a Shuriman city, that she worked in close proximity to Shurima during her early years.  \r\n\r\nIn the real world, the easiest and most effective way of spreading a culture&#039;s faith was by trade and travel, for example, the Greek goddess Aphrodite, who has roots from the ancient middle Mesopotamian goddess Inanna, or sometimes referred to as Ishtar. Janna, being a goddess that was heavily worshipped by traders and explorers, would have a wealth of opportunities for faith in her to spread, which no doubt may have happened. However, we do have to consider the Shuriman faith. \r\n\r\nWhile there has yet to be a canonical perfectly mapped out timeline, we do know that the ancient Shuiman Empire, in place of more traditional gods, worshipped the Ascended, mortals gifted with god-like power and near immortality. How long age the Empire, and for how long exactly, the Empire was active is unclear, but we do know that when it fell, the Ascended went from being worshipped to almost outright hated in the centuries to follow, with few alive to tis day, though this is a story for a different day. The point is that when the Ascended fell from glory, and the Empire fell with it, it would leave the Shuriman people without any organized or practiced faith. It is around this time that I believe Janna may have first sprung into existence. \r\n\r\nThis is the basic rundown of my theory:  \r\n\r\nAfter, probably a century, the fall of Shurima, the people of of Oshra Va&#039;Zaun, the ancient Shuriman city predating present day Zaun, with no more Ascended to worship, look for a new faith. From their search of faith and prayers Janna is born, and as the the city, more specifically its sailors, become more dedicated in their worship of her, the spread of her faith begins. After her faith is spread across post-Empire Shurima, she then recieves the name Janna, and the rest is history.  \r\n\r\nWhile Janna is unquestionably one of the longer lived champions in the League universe, she was (probably) not active, or even existent, during the time of the Shuriman Empire, as belief and worship of her would have most likely have been viewed as an affront, and an act of rebellion, against the Ascended. It&#039;s after their fall that Janna is born. While she isn&#039;t from the Shuriman Empire, she, no doubt, has Shuriman roots.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-10-12T22:09:50.960+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very interesting theory.

Also, as somebody who has read every piece of lore, and knows nearly every champions story by heart, please don't change Janna's new, current lore, I think it's what works best for her.  \n\nShe went from being a kind goddess of the seas and winds that helped sailors, to becoming a bringer of hope to the hopeless in Zaun, which could be considered one the worst places in Runeterra to live, when compared to the rest of the known locations. She ascended from being a simple weather based deity, to becoming a protector of those without anybody to look to, which is one of the most noblest things one can do. The only issues I can find with her current lore is that her presence isn't really felt, mostly due to the fact that despite being a goddess/spirit none of the other Zaun, or even Piltover champions reference her, or even have chat directed towards her in game. Plus most of her skins are very lighthearted and soft, not making use of her powerful nature. \n\nSorry this post is so long, but just one final thing, again, sorry.  \n\nAs I'm pretty sure you know, Soraka's lore isn't the most up to date, and from what I can tell, the direction you're going with is that of a celestial being who watched humanity from above. Janna could be a great foil to this. \n\nJanna watched and cared for humanity directly, and has first person experience with it. Over the centuries that she has been alive, she's watched the best and worst of humans, seen the ones she's cared for die without her being able to do anything. She's learned the painful lesson that you can't save everybody, and so she stands back from to time to time. She isn't dispassionate or unfeeling, that she has accepted that some things can't be helped, but will do everything in her power to help those she can. Janna , in a way, could imbue something of the wise fey creature, similar to Galadirel from Lord of The Rings, helping more indirectly, and giving sage advice when it's needed. The perfect example of this would be from her short story \"Deep Breath\". Instead of simply giving the boy money or power, she does the simple act of kindness by hugging him and giving him powerful advice.  \n\nLets say there's a man who is in awful agonizing pain, and near death. Soraka would probably cut off her arm if it meant is would save the man, even if it still kept him in pain, while Janna would grant him with a quick death, ending his pain. Where Soraka represent selflessness and altruism at its purest form, Janna represents a much wiser and realistic form of altruism, knowing when to let go.  \n\nAgain, sorry for such a long post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2018-10-17T04:16:42.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno, now that the Darkin are connected to Shurima too, I think we've got enough characters tied to either Shurima or the Void...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-10-11T10:16:32.745+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":9,"body":"Nah, she's an Ascended.\n\nEveryone is.","replies":[{"poster":"Zyranium","date":"2018-10-13T00:00:21.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love how people downvoted this, thinking it wasn't sarcasm...","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-10-13T00:02:12.296+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-10-13T00:19:43.016+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking that too.

Also, in the real world, deities and religions don't just spawn across an area simultaneously, but come from a single focal point, say a village or large city, before spreading. However, this is the League universe and not the real world, so you may be right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-10-11T20:04:56.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"wait how did you know that she has a Shuriman name?","replies":[{"poster":"Breezy Boyy","date":"2018-10-11T23:18:20.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Noor Sakata,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=7eBWYcTc,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-10-11T20:04:56.007+0000)\n>\n> wait how did you know that she has a Shuriman name?\n\nIt says so in her bio.","replies":[{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-10-12T00:43:38.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Breezy Boyy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=7eBWYcTc,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-10-11T23:18:20.526+0000)\n>\n> It says so in her bio.\n\nIdk why did I get downvoted for asking such a question\n\nAnyway , sounds right  , Shurima has always been to me more like the Arab Version of countries in the game , and kind of deserts ? and some Pyramids and stuff , not sure if this is related but , Janna name has always sounded to me more like an arab name \" Not Jana \" Janna with \" Double N \" an arabic name that means Paradise or Haven , perhaps that makes sense why people worship her? and probably it's related to your Theory about her being Shuriman , I guess we will learn more about her lore later","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-10-12T20:31:37.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact she originated as a bird.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-10-12T23:34:40.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can transform into her bluebird form at will, too.
