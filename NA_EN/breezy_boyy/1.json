Out of all of the however, my favorite of these many different character arch types to choose from  has consistently been the &quot;powerful but used.&quot; \n\nThe &quot;powerful but used&quot; is a character that has an untold amount of power, whether it be magic, martial arts, or just intelligence, among many other things, often either hidden away or yet to be completely unlocked, but the fraction that they do have control over right off the bat makes them incredibly dangerous and a force to be reckoned with in their respective world/story/universe. Despite all this, the character is somehow used by others, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, but most often it&#039;s from emotional manipulation or through outright force, such as mind control, with the one holding their chain usually being the main antagonist of said story, but they can also be used by a group rather than a single individual. Something about how they have so much power at their fingertips yet still fall under the control of another has always intrigued me, and in a way helps humanize the character and makes a great balance, that even though they contain this awesome strength, they still can be led astray.  \n\nSome great examples of this would be; \n\n* Haku from Naruto \n* Lapiz Lazuli from Steven Universe \n* Angel from Borderlands 2  \n* Terra from Teen Titans\n\nSo far, there are yet to be any champions in League that fulfill this arch-type, which is understandabe as most probably don&#039;t want to play a champion that&#039;s theme is about being used and controled. However, I could see this coming in to play in Morgana new lore when her rework is out, and if you want to stretch it out, technically Kayn coud follow under this arch-type as well, considering his relationship with Rhaast. \n\nWhat are some of your favorite character arch-types and/or ones you&#039;d liek to see in future champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-24T02:33:14.191+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}}  ?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-09-24T03:48:11.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You could also argue Khada Jhin (used as a weapon by a cabal in Ionia), Lux (effectively controlled by Demacia as she risks death/exile if exposed), and Sion (literally an undead weapon with a semi-trapped consciousness).","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-09-24T04:48:19.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't follow your logic, or that the logic is kinda thin. The description OP gives is of character's potential held back by another individual. But if it wasn't for the secret cabal, Jhin wouldn't have his magical gun or the freedom to perform his new murderous art. Plus the writers never acknowledged how or even if this cabal could keep a leash on Jhin's actions if he suddenly went AWOL. If anything it was being in prison that withheld him from achieving his potential.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-09-24T06:47:08.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure he is only going by the cabal's script to avoid going back to prison. Despite the fact that the cabal pretty much gives him whatever he wants, Jhin just doesn't seem satisfied with his life now. It pretty much says in his lore that he isn't content with being the cabal's puppet and wants more recognition for his work, as well as freedom. Perhaps he could go rogue one day, and I am curious as to how they would stop him. I would say that they could simply equip Zed and Shen, but I'm not sure how they would feel about working for the same people that set their childhood trauma free. The cabal could simply lie, of course, but those two are clever things. They would find out... Eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-09-24T13:26:52.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Jhin just doesn't seem satisfied with his life now.

His work has brought fear to many foreign dignitaries and to Ionia’s secret political underground, but how long will a serial killer, craving attention, be satisfied working in the shadows?\n\nYou could make the argument that he finds this new life far better as he gets paid to kill people. However, I think the greater motivation for him now is just remaining free, even if it means sacrificing the ability to do whatever he wants and the recognition he would have gotten before. Even more, he is working to someday confront Zed and Shen. In short, he doesn't really care what the cabal is telling him to do. To him, every assignment is a rehearsal for the finale.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-24T14:21:22.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the opener is talking more about someone who willingly serves someone else that is weaker than them,either through loyalty or due to emotional problems.\n\nAurelion on the other hand is partially brainwashed(as it sounds like the crown can force him to do certain actions,even if he still has some free will over how he does them and might even be able to resist commands entirely sometimes) and is additionally blackmailed by the aspects(as they take his suns as hostages).\n\nSo while Aurelion fits the bill of \"powerful but used\",he likely isn't exactly the kind of character the opener meant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2018-09-24T04:30:10.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that he's more of a \"higher being tricked into service\", but I agree that this theme already exists in League, most notably {{champion:163}}.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-24T14:16:54.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Taliyah was this kind of character,but she doesn't work for Noxus anymore,so it doesn't apply for her anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-09-24T04:58:45.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qFu8FEdP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-24T02:33:14.191+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:136}}  ?\n\nThat's pretty much /thread lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-09-24T05:06:46.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Some ideas:\n\n1.

They'd be like the darkin but a lot cuter and not evil.  Maybe they are runeterra's newest answer to the darkin.  \n14. An ADC/AD bruiser meant to support first.  \n15. I remember reading that originally Lissandra was going to be a sword user back in the JOJ.  Maybe bring that idea back as the one who the current lissandra took the form of, and maybe the person who blinded her.  \n16. An auto attack based AP marksman designed for bot lane.\n17.

A notorious flirt that hits on most of the other champions in league regardless if they're male, female, dragon, or whatever Malphite is. Totally different archetype, but I thought I'd toss that in there.","replies":[]}]}
