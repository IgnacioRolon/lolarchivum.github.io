For instance lower his slow or make it a skill shot not sure how you&#039;d do that but he is suppose to have a weakness in being kited I would understand a slow would be needed to give him some form of a way to get close to his target but his current slow is way to much for Nasus to have. His Passive is not healthy I understand he needs sustain but maybe make it so you have to hit minions with your Q or hit champions with Q like Yorick this not only enforces stacking but its also healthy instead of just auto attacking minions. His resistances late game are way to powerful with his passive possibly lowering the ability would make him easier to play against late game. And lastly his Q is pretty unhealthy to the game stacking in general is unhealthy sure its unique and what not but its just not healthy maybe make it take longer to stack or just remove the stacking and just give him increased damage on his Q.\r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion obviously there are gonna be some Nasus mains or just people to flame me for thinking Nasus is in a bad state as a champion but hes just way to unhealthy to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-30T02:39:09.240+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":10,"body":"is that why he's at a flat 50% and hasn't budged from it since the patch lol\n\nleave Nasus alone he finally gets his time in the sun and you goons are trying to euthanize him","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2017-07-30T03:45:37.299+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Just because his winrate is stable doesn't mean his playstyle is healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-30T03:52:14.240+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":9,"body":"there's nothing wrong with his playstyle","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2017-07-30T04:31:55.735+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, there is a very toxic and negative aspect to \"If I farm I can just win out the game.\" as a playstyle, and hence why Nasus has seen very few changes and buffs over time.  You don't want champions that require lots of focus to stop from dominating the game to be too powerful.  The difference between an adc and a champion like Nasus is that Nasus is incredibly hard to kill, and the only form of counterplay to his kit is kite him out, which works fine if you're ahead but not if you are behind.\n\nADC's have lots of counterplay, including zone control, cc, or just kill them.  It's easy to say kill an adc, because they lack the kind of damage mitigation tools that are available to other champions if they want to have any kind of impact on the game.

I don't appreciate a champion whose winrate and performance is entirely tied to game length rather than overall performance.\n\n-  Several other champions are low mobility and vulnerable to ganks, it is a built in delay to him, but that still makes his gameplay unhealthy.\n\n-  Um, sort of but not always.  Nasus strength comes from being able to take towers at alarming rates and requiring focus to deal with him.  Wither is incredibly powerful, so a single champion isn't going to be able to kite him effectively unless they are built entirely for kiting or they are much stronger than him at that point in the game.\n\n-  So, if someone misplays heavily you can counter them?  That's innately true of any champion, it's not unique to Nasus nor does it address his unhealthy infinite scaling playstyle.\n\n-  I disagree heavily on the viability of a 5v5 Nasus, because a lock down comp with Sejuani can definitely allow Nasus the power to dominate in fights.  Actually just Sejuani is really powerful with a Nasus (or any melee champion for that matter).  It is the tank meta for junglers atm anyway.\n\n-  His sustain isn't garbage if it requires an item to counter it, but there is certainly a built in counter to lifesteal based effects in the form of GW that I wish more people used.  In all the games I have played that the enemy is using a heavy healing comp, Soraka, Vlad, etc I'm usually the one buying it as the jungler later in the game because the lanes just ignored it and got wrecked.  This is one of the points I agree with.\n\n-  Again, being denied is just a delay to his unhealthy style of gameplay and doesn't address the issues here.  It's not that Nasus is too powerful, it's that he's just bad design.  Feast or Famine style champions are not very intuitive to begin with and for a game that prides itself on options having something be very arbitrary like Nasus is not good.  It comes down to are the other lanes winning, and is Nasus farming.  Because the other aspects of the game just don't seem to apply in Nasus games.\n\nLike, I get that you are trying to explain why he's not got a high winrate, but you aren't addressing the issues with his kit that players have.  I personally hate Nasus, both playing as him and playing against him.  It's not a fun feeling, there's not a lot of choices, there's just \"Do this one thing, end the game, or you lose to his q.\"  The previous thing about Nasus was that he was entirely split push so you could kind of try ignoring him and rushing down teamfights and pressuring harder than he was, but with his ultimate changes he can become a teamfight monster, bursting anyone in range down.  And with the amount of lockdown in the game now it's very easy for a couple q hits to completely swing a fight.  Nasus is the kind of champion you DON'T want having a decent or viable winrate, a relic of the past.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-07-31T14:19:30.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is meant to be feast or famine because if he's ahead he'll stay ahead and if he falls behind then he'll have a hard time coming back because he revolves around getting farm. \n\nThe reason I'm not \"addressing\" his issues is because he's fine in his current kit and already has an abundant amount of counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2017-07-31T14:37:36.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, that's your opinion that a feast and famine playstyle is fine for the game.
