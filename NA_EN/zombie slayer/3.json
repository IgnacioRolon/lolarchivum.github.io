But I don&#039;t see why there aren&#039;t any more of these bans going out like if a player doesn&#039;t int or troll then they should get chat restrictions. I was never punished on this account before 2 weeks ago I played a game and got a 14 day yet the evidence of chat was only in that 1 game I didn&#039;t int I didn&#039;t troll I just said 1 inappropriate thing. I believe that I should have just gotten a simple chat ban not a 14 day or even multiple chat bans because of the fact that I only typed and didn&#039;t do anything else shouldn&#039;t have gotten me a 14 day I believe that Riot should hand out chat bans and even extend them based on the offence. For instance I said a inappropriate thing to another player and instead of a 14 day ban I should&#039;ve gotten a 14 day chat restriction or more and say after getting a certain amount of chat ban or if I do start trolling or inting then I would get the day bans. Once again I&#039;m not saying I didn&#039;t deserve a type of ban/restriction but that the ban was not the right one I deserved.","replies":[{"poster":"jwebb0113","date":"2017-10-08T02:25:29.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"typically a straight up 14 day ban has to do with hate speech ... terms of kys, get cancer, racism, homophobic slurs etc etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"b√†n","date":"2017-10-09T16:44:01.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get banned, make a new account, lvling takes forever, spend a few $$$ on boosts. its all about $$$","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rainfall","date":"2017-10-08T19:40:58.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leveling up now is easier and the monthly game counts have been low for riot this season.\nEasier to get permabanned+Easier To Level Up New Account=More accounts,More games,More revenue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mus","date":"2017-10-08T10:25:35.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will agree with you\nI think they did something to the punishments with their detection system.\n\nAbout a month ago,  I've seen a level 26- post something under this thread.\nThis was his First Offense btw. No racism. No slurs. NO \"K-Y-S\" just flame and no more. \n\nTwo games. \n\nSeem like basic flame not worthy of skipping tiers.\n\nAnd what happened to the level 26. He was banned for 14 days for something small as flame, which should warrant a chatban.\n\n\nSO after seeing that, I do believe something was changed with the punishments over the month. If a level 26 can be given a 14 day ban for flame? What stops other first offenders for the same thing? \n\nSees a little extreme.\n\nSorry for rant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-10-08T02:29:14.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see notifications of punishment sometimes.
