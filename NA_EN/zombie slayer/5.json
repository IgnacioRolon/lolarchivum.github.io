If it manages to eat a celestial, living entities conformed by stars, then what comes out is a Dark Cosmic....or nothing, and it gets deleted forever, we are talking about a Black Hole after all.\n\nNeeko's gem seems to be damaged too in the teaser, and Xayah/Rakan seem to keep their gems, or at least a copy, if their recall is right, so it might be something more related to Zoe and her madness than to the gems, I'm not sure about this though, so I will await some lore that confirms or denies it. I can only hope they don't tie Dark Star and Star Guardians beyond what they already are, with the First Star probably being a Celestial","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-27T08:00:12.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The lore could be something like this, based on what is already confirmed and the assumptions we can make based on what we've seen so far.\n\n* Zoe is an older Star Guardian in terms of when her team was formed.\n\n\n* Zoe lost her team, and became so grief stricken/insane that she took Ahri's team away from her just so that she would have a team again.\n\n\n* In order to get them, though, she had to corrupt them too, which would likely involve damaging them and/or their gems.

Could you post a link to them? I'm also curious to see them. \n\nDon't think that sending the gem off kills Rakan, but makes him get completelly corrupted for a while, it seems that using their powers is what corrupt them more and more each time, although it might just be a gameplay mechanic (Why doesn't Zoe get a similar Dark Aura?....)\n\nYes, Dark Star is too big to take time to corrupt a Star Guardian, if only it would devour the whole galaxy to craft another Corruptant, but it does worries me that they seem to have the same star mark than Dark Celestial Jhin, it looks cool, but I feel that they might be stepping into dangerous terrain","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-27T11:53:47.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All the Dark Stars have that mark if I'm not mistaken.

Rakan's gem may or may not be his \"mirror\" for this skin.\n\nDo they? Haven't really checked on them since they came out, so I wouldn't know.\n\nThere are a lot of possible explanation for that skin overlapping, like that those fragments are attuned with the light of said celestials and they modify the user to more or less resemble them upon first use, or that they are the reencarnation of those Celestials and that's what makes them worthy of being Star Guardians... But I would hate that they mixed Eldrich Horrors with Magic Girls.\n\nYeah, you're right, they probably would have used Jhin to tease such conection in any way, even more knowing that this Corrupted Star Guardian turn was probably planned by RIOT since the second batch of skins.\n\nThanks, i was eager to see the splashes, even more after reading that Xayah/Rakan's was specially beautifull, and it is, but I think I will keep DC Jhin as wallpaper, they look cool, but not more than him","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-27T12:20:16.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah.
