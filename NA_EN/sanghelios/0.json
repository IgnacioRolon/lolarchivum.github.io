Though with the recent changes to the game, \nI considered returning in anticipation of the Aatrox rework. I wasn't expecting much \nfrom Riot, knowing that prior reworks have been hit or miss (Warwick//Galio). \n\nI can not politely describe the disappointment I felt when I first glimpsed upon this aatrocity. So I'm going to ask a simple question instead: \n\nWhy would any sentient human being/collective of humans decide that it is a good idea, to **delete** a unique, perfectly viable, and fun champion, only to **unwork** it into a low-effort reproduction of something, that is already in the game (Riven)? \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/H31a6Ou.png\nSuch cowardice..\n\nMoney. New Aatrox is (arguably) worse in every aspect, except that he now appeals to a larger audience. \n(The model, and its animations are despicable. It's arguable whether voice/gameplay is worse, but it is definitely not authentic. They deleted the character.) At least the splashart is nice.\n\n**_B-But he's less of an issue to balance now!_**\nIf only there was something like a gameplay update, something\nthat wouldn't require an entire overhaul, neglecting everything\ndedicated players enjoyed about the champion.\n\nAAtrox doesn't even AA anymore?!??\n\nThis is the Galio rework all over again.\nThe audacity...\n\nAatrox compared to a recent case of severe identity theft\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3oMyiUM.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QhVzqaf.png\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kGiiqE-b7bk\n\nAnother champion reworked into a stereotypical piece of s***\nhttps://youtu.be/7coK9jJ1HbI\n\nI know it doesn't matter, but I definitely will never return to League.\nIf you like these reworks, congratulations - you're the target audience, and there's\nnothing wrong with that.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: If you actually read the damn old Galio lore, League Judgement, voice lines, and whatnot, you will KNOW the old Galio was literally a flying dog made out of stone. Let alone some kind of unique personality, the old Galio barely has any sentience. The new Galio is good because it actually explores the identity crisis part of Galio's theme really well (something that can not be done well when the character is really only as smart as a dog like the old Galio), if you actually take the time to read any of the damn thing related to the new Galio.\n\nAppearance wise: The colour scheme change is solely because of the colour scheme change of the national colour of Demacia, and has NOTHING to do withe Galio specifically. And it's also kinda funny that people want Galio to not be \"stereotypical\" but complains that Galio is now no longer a stereotypical Gargoyle.\n\nAnd the only thing Galio actually loses over the course of the rework in terms of the gameplay elements is really just the on-hit shield, and the really bad MS thing that nobody really remembers Galio for because it's just such a presence-less ability. The rest has been kept, he has now more straightforward scaling with MR instead of the 2-staged indirect scaling he had that was really bad and inefficient, he is no longer so reliant on Flash and his ulti, he still pokes and can be built as mage just fine, he still AoE taunts... etc etc.\n\nThe new Galio hate train is really just overplayed and brainless, imho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2018-06-16T06:38:02.375+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who's enjoyed Aatrox a few times, I genuinely don't think his previous design was salvageable.\n\nHe was one of the purest stat checks in the game, what with 3 out of his 5 tools (4 abilities + passive) existing as passive steroids. The only interaction they had was a toggle on his W and an activation on his R.. So not much.\n\nOntop of that he came with strong mobility and catch tools. Compared someone like Trundle as an example, another steroid heavy melee bruiser carry, Aatrox had insane amounts of target access. That alone made him staggeringly difficult to balance.\n\nThen there was his healing and the revive passive. Both of which made it even harder.\n\nI genuinely don't think old Aatrox was a concept which could have been made to work. But, more importantly, I don't think it was worth making work.\n\nI mean really here, what was his identity? Dive fighter who gets stronger the longer he attacks &amp; heals through offense?.. How many other champions do we have who do that? Shit, Warwick had that EXACT identity, but was reworked because it was bland and unbalance able without severe alterations.\n\nSo far as new Aatrox goes, I hugely disagree with the visual update. I dislike the new model, dislike how 'generic' he's become VO and such wise..
