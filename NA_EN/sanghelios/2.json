To elaborate, I will summarize my League of Legends ranked history from the beginning to now. \n\nPreseason 6 was when I started playing, and about midseason I decided to play only rankeds, which with dedication and the many games I played, maining Yasuo, Skarner and Teemo (I know, I know), I climbed from my initial placement being Silver, to Plat. During this period I have never been hardstuck, never been on a win/losing-streak-deathspiral. I was content with the rank I acquired during my first season as a Top/Jungle player. \n\nI was greatly enjoying the game to the point of playing up to 10 games every day. League was the only game I wanted to play and Diamond the rank I strived to achieve. I was ambitious, determined, a winner. I would annihilate everyone in my path. Don't play Yasuo they say? Yasuo. Yasuo is not a champion for new players? Yasuo. I was so proficient and determined at the champion that I knew every matchup, knew how to defeat every Riven player on this damn ladder. (This used to be a skill matchup)\n\nThat was, until Riot decided to gradually nerf Yasuo out of Toplane, from changing Trinity's path(Zeal) to changing Yasuo's fluent playstyle in S7 by nerfing E and transferring power into his Q. I was extremely displeased by these changes, because I knew that they weren't right. Every Yasuo player knew. The problematic aspects of his kit were Q allowing an experienced player to win otherwise difficult melee matchups, and Windwall - the bane of ADCs and mages. Yasuo was wrongfully addressed and because of it, the same issues of Yasuo are present to this day.\n\nAs a result, I(late S6, pre7) decided to play a new lane, one that was closest to Toplane, and with Mid as my new role, I ought to play the next edgiest, mechanically intense champion on the list. Annie... I'm kidding, it's Zed. \n\nI was having a blast even though I was awful at Zed, I enjoyed the learning curve as I have with Yasuo. What would stop me from acquiring proficiency once again, but on a different champion? Nothing, so I thought. Midseason 7 was when I considered myself a worthy Zed player, I had surpassed 150k mastery practising primarily Zed in my ranked games. You read right, I had achieved ~150 ranked games on Zed with a winrate close to 45%. I was not discouraged (yet), as it is an expected sacrifice of learning Zed (I hate normals). These fools, I thought, these foolish Orianna players, foolish botlaners. I would get my revenge now that I have died a thousand deads on this champion. I will reap their flesh and shadows, I will finally climb back up. \n\nThat was, until Riot decided bot lane required a higher power budget, required the aid of Ardent Censer and the cleansing of the dreadful system named autofill, - by shifting power from nowhere to the support class. People would play support, and Reddit would not be complaining about autofill. We, Riot Games, solved everything. \n\nArguably they did solve this issue, but for me it was hell. The torment I choose to endure during mid-late season 7 playing Zed in a meta dominated by enchanter supports and adcarries running rampant on shields and healing. It is beyond words to describe the magnitude of tilt I, an unfortunate, still somewhat determined soul had to experience. \n\nThe logical course of action would be to abandon Zed, abandon playing assassins altogether in favor of control mages. But believe me when I say that, there was nothing I desired more than the killing of botlaners. I would flash ult ignite even for supports if they dared to poke me, even if I knew it would mean the death of me, I would take this smug support with me, tear it to shreds as my team flames me for an inconsiderate play. The occasional satisfaction of killing was enough for me to keep playing Zed. I was an assassin for reason, no, a killer. \n\nI was a shadow of my former self, shaped by tilt and the hatred for balance. Not balance in its literal sense, but the game balance and paths Riot had taken this game.\n\nI did achieve Platinum at the beginning of season 7, however ever since mid season 7, until now, I have been hardstuck in low Gold for the reasons aforementioned. Stopwatch was merely the final straw, - and even now that it is gone, the game is still equally frustrating for me to play, be it top or midlane. \n\nEvery time I relive the fraction of determination still within me, I play myself into a winstreak quickly followed by a losingstreak. Every time I play to the peak of my ability, a surge of my former competitiveness, I am downed by games that cannot be won, games that were seemingly scripted and predetermined to send me back. Something I had never experienced during season 6.\n\nLeague of Legends has taken my mind and mentality, my determination and with it, the desire to climb. \nIt is time to leave, but I know I'm too weak, know I cannot uninstall until I am only a shell of hatred, deprived and escapen by all my pride and determination. Soon it will all end. This is my story.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-03-06T01:51:57.527+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":7,"body":"> Preseason 6 was when I started playing,\n\nSorry you were too late to play when league was fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-06T02:39:43.177+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Weird, I've had fun every season since season 2.","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2018-03-06T03:42:06.540+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Apparently if you have fun lately you're considering wrong by the community.","replies":[{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2018-03-06T06:43:45.484+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, I personally believe this game is cancer for everybody, and that it's incredibly unhealthy to play 1 game of league a day, but yes...

The thing most players writing posts like this one though is for the \"balance\" of the game to be more in balance. That or to be skewed towards the champs they play. I've since season 3 I believe. Almost exclusively ranked once I hit 30. And the balance team has gone from trying to achieve actual balance to making flavor of the week or month op champs which are merely swapped with the passing of each new meta. I much prefer - and it is within their ability to do so - a game that is balanced around... balance.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-03-06T17:25:38.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a dopamine addiction is all.\n\nIf they can hook you on a dopamine release, then you'll spend far more hours chasing that same rush, even if they remove it. \n\nThere's no reason for them to make a balanced game, if they can make a game that will better get players to keep playing for far less effort and resources.

If you have an addiction, try tearing yourself away from the game. Go outside or on a camping trip. Go hang out with friends, and if you don't have any friends, go to a public place and try to get some. Do whatever. Yell out loud and attract attention. You're bound to get some people interested in you. Just talk about anything one you find someone. Ask questions and keep eye contact. Always tell the truth because you want a real friend. Just do anything to divert your attention away from the game. Even shows could do the trick. Once you don't think you need it anymore, try playing again and I can almost guarantee that you will be happier playing and it won't be as important to you, which will also help you grow as a person and player. \n\nThat's my advice.

Like a good disengage comp winning in a meta for disengage is fine; however, a poorly executed disengage comp should not beat a perfectly played hard engage comp just because disengage is the meta. Does that make sense?\n\nSimilarly, I'm fine if gp, vlad, and tanks are the meta in top right now, but it doesn't mean they should auto-win if I pick something other than meta toplaner at the moment. If they play equal to me or better, that's fine - they should win because the current meta gives them an advantage all-else being equal. However, if I clearly play 10x better than my lane opponent, they shouldn't be able to beat me just because I'm not on a meta champ. Get where I'm coming from?\n\nAnd that is the problem. Stuff has been empowered TOO far towards enforcing the meta in recent history. Ever since juggernaut rework in my opinion, many patches have gone from trying to help balance things out while changing what's meta to intentionally grossly overpowering certain champs or roles and trying to enforce said champs/roles/comps as a meta that must be followed if you want a fair chance at winning. When meta comp executed poorly beats non-meta but perfectly rounded out comp executed at average level, you have a problem in my opinion. Because then it is almost entirely about the draft - rather than making it somewhat about team comp but still allowing 2 decent team comps to come down to player skill and teamwork moreso than what champs are locked.

Stopwatch was merely the final straw, - and even now that it is gone, the game is still equally frustrating for me to play, be it top or midlane.  \n\n\nSadly I'm having this exact same issue this season.  Normally I can achieve high gold 1600 MMR every season, this one feels way different in terms of carrying from top lane or mid.  \n\nstomping my lane really hard just doesn't do it anymore, I literally gotta win each lane and make sure I get bot lane fed for my team to be successful this season.  I use to play Evelynn and snipe off 2 people before team fighting or split push, however she has really weak wave clear on her (Q) since rework, now split-pushing on her has become somewhat useless.  This season I play mostly rumble top, I can end lane phase with a really good cs/kill lead and still get dumpster by the enemy support and adc with way less gold.\n\nIt has become pretty pathetic imo.\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:68}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxyrotten","date":"2018-03-06T04:37:02.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What has this game made us?
