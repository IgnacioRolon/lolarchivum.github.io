I think that would be a step in the wrong direction. Playing a Champ alot and get rewarded for is a good thing and if they make Champs like Azir easy everybody is rewarding after 5 games or less. I love the mechanics and the kit. I thing little buffs would be better than changing the Abilities. Maby you can add the old W tower push mechanic again or the ult stay longer or is bigger but didnt change his theme to much this is my only wish.  But in generel im very happy with the Changes you make.","replies":[{"poster":"Dokkaebi","date":"2017-06-03T22:23:43.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know that champion can be easy to learn and hard to master at the same time :O Mind blowing, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightcrow Teo","date":"2017-06-04T13:03:14.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo mains, riven mains, master yi mains. \"Hard to master\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"ISlushyI","date":"2017-06-03T22:25:58.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats exactly what i hope ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neclord","date":"2017-06-03T22:11:19.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just need to shift him into more of a Battlemage IMO (in terms of sustained damage over burst).\n\nShift damage from his Q into his W, return utility to his E.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-06-03T22:15:44.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Neclord,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XAxzmiJn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-03T22:11:19.082+0000)\n>\n> They just need to shift him into more of a Battlemage IMO (in terms of sustained damage over burst).\n> \n> Shift damage from his Q into his W, return utility to his E.\n\nMore like remove damage from Q period, he's already got really good DPS.\n\nI'd be fine with a W damage buff if his Q CD was also nerfed - it's too hard to outposition Azir's soldiers right now, with it's slow + short cooldown + abundance of CDR.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-06-03T22:17:44.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They can't just buff azir, yo.

Kite mages generally wanna, you know, kite, meaning they're close enough to do damage but not close enough to kill. Azir's got huge range, so he would be far closer to Artillary in that sense, and if they give him the tools to kite, he'll be very oppressive for not just melees, but ADC's as well. He'd be able to kite ADC's, and unlike Quinn, he doesn't need to land a body-blockable skillshot to do so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-06-03T22:16:41.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deserts emperor,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XAxzmiJn,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-03T22:09:49.248+0000)\n>\n> I love the mechanics and the kit.

Flat out buffs are the worst possible thing you could do to him.","replies":[{"poster":"ISlushyI","date":"2017-06-03T22:23:14.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok im fine if they Rework instead of straight buffs  but i hope they doesnt change his topic to much and make him Easy.
