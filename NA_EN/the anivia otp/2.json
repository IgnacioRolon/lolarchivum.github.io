be very misogynistic\nand it's sad that talented women being popular is rare :(\nhow ever , you can always get a person to play with you videogame , the thing is , don't throw them in LOL right off the batch,\nstart slowly with open games (like a mario party game)\nOnce the person is used to being playful you can finally get her to play Rpg , from that point , you're almost good to go.\nbut anyway , choosing specifically an \"asian\" person is harder than it seems,\nyou may want to learn that culture first , after that, if you start discovering an asian culture , finding love might not be as hard as you imagine,\nthere tends to be a lot of misogyny in a lot of asian culture,\nprove that you know better then that, and as sad as what i'm going to say is,\nyou'll top a big percentage of other asian people.\n\n2- Technically , there are a lot of kind of professional gamer, but here i my question to you , what KIND of professional gamer do you expect to be ?\nyou can become a beta tester, there is even PBE for that , go hunt down bugs, and learn on how to make a report ;)\nyou can become a streamer, there , your image will be the hardest to manage, getting new people to like you content mean that you are able to give them something they don't have\nyou can become an E-sport player, there, you are gonna need a coach , or a lot of time.\njust to give you a small look on what kind of document you have to get used to : https://imgur.com/BTv3bsA\namong that , hours of training are needed , but if you really want it hard , i truly believe you can become an E-sport Pro,\nhowever , it's not gonna be simple.\n\n3- I do play monster hunter world , i actually shove the game , if you want to meet around i'll be glad to drop a name so we can play.\n\n4- Something that is a misconception about jobs is that jobs are annoying, i don't think so, i'm someone that , for a \"game\" he created himself would stay awake at 3:36 am to answer someone in the forum and guide him through his hard times and questions.\nYou see , everything can be a game, even programming , as long a you understand what is the purpose of what you are doing, anything can be a game https://imgur.com/z2wt93f\nthat thing took me like 30 hours , and a bunch of math problem solving to figure out , i did that for a friend , and it's not even finished.\nbut i had a LOT of fun doing it, and i BET i can be paid for doing that very thing.\nFind a job you like , and  you'll never have to work ;)\n\n5- technically , Being tired is just a signal , it's like being hungry , if you eat too much too often you might not be able to know when you are hungry.\nbeing, you can overcome that problem if you start battling it the good way , start by waking up earlier and sleeping sooner , and use the extra time you get each morning to meditate (sit , don't sleep)\nby slowly getting yourself in mood you will stop feeling tired if you make sure you sleep the correct amount\nyou can try taking a little nap in the middle of the days to get back on track when needed.\nslowly but surely you will stop feeling tired at all.\n\n6-As a Pokemon player myself i know that,\neven Nintendo know that , but you know , that's why they simplified iv distribution\ngetting a specific 30 iv Pokemon is dang hard.\npeople will always  cheat to get those , but get your hand on every 31iv pokemon + DW ability so you can always make any poikemon you need , \nthis is LONG and Tideous , but dont hesitate to ask trades with people , you'll get there in the end ;)\nin the end , a legit Pokemon winning always feel good , and cheaters can't go far, even you know that.\n\n7-Stand your ground , a person might want to be alone for a moment , usually , lack of confidence just make that worse,\nyou have to be subtle, if you show you don't want to be alone because people force you too , but because you actually enjoy it , show it proudly,\nthere no reason for someone to mock you for reaching an internal peace, or disturb you.\npeople want sometimes to help you when you feel alone , that's the reason why they look at you , we are social animal , some don't understand how we can desire to be alone.\nusually those people have problem thinking for themselves.\n\n8- Yeah i have bad news , the only solution to this is : get a job , buy booster packs LMAO;\nor you can steal them , but i'm not sure it's very .... legal...\n\n9- Nintendo has problems with sequels, they don't occur often,\nthat's their policy , that's why it's almost impossible for them to stick two games together.\nHOWEVER,\nthere is something you can do if you really wan't that game to exist :\nMAKE IT YOURSELF BUDDY !!!\ndon't hesitate, if you want it THAT bad , no one is gonna serve you better than yourself.\n\n10- Trypanophobia is a quite common phobia,\nusually , people don't realise how they can think of the human body.\nthis phobia is usually hard to approach since it's quite hard to know where it comes from,\n i think you take the problem from the wrong side.\nyou whole body is like and immense sponge, your skin is porous and covered with an acid layer making you feel like it's completely smooth.\na needle inside your body usually is like a needle trough a sponge , it's just a slightly bigger hole than the one existing (like putting a pin on a shirt)\ni'm not an psychiatrist but i overcame my apiphobia so i can surely tell you that meditating and calm helps a lot against phobia.\npeople will always need your blood to test and you blood is inside your body , sorry bud , but to test it , i'm not sure there is EVER gonna be another way than  puncturing a hole to access your

skill,\nyou see, we have two ways of dealing with a problem (if you cut down)\n* a quick and fast paced way where you use biased decision that you learnt over the course of your training\n* a long way where you think about every detail\n\nusually , games use one or both of these system\n\nthe first one is the system you tend to have in games like FPS where mechanical skill is present a LOT.\nthere in no secret in these kind of games, you have to strain yourself , like learning piano at using every micro play technique possible\nOsu is the perfect example of a game relying on that specifically\n\nthe second one is a little  different , it uses logic to create deph.\ntherefore , to progress you will need a clear understanding of the game functionning\n\nHere are a few example:\n*Positioning strategy : Chess, the game uses the position to dictate the strategy, or tower defense games\n*Statistical strategy : Any Rpg, you need to understand the math behind the scene to work with it\n*Prediction strategy : recognizing patterns in opponent's movement, i guess stocks market trade is specifically about that if you call that a game\n\nany of the game you play use a combination of these things to create a game,\n\nthe more of there complexity you add to a game , the harder it becomes\n\nlol uses these 4, and they represent the 4 aspect of the  complexity you can add to a game.\nevery of these aspect contribute equally to victory.\n\ni suggest , if you can't think of a clear reason why you suck , to first try to see what aspect of the game you plays you find the most commonly in them and work on that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-11-05T19:59:08.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont have any problems, plz
