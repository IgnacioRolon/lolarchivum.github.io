Before that, I played League at a pretty consistent 250-300 FPS, but when I turned on my computer yesterday, I had fluctuating frames anywhere between 40 and 200 throughout any game I played. I tried everything on the support board; dusted out my computer, defragged hard drive, cleaned out registry, looked for malware, etc. I even reinstalled the game twice and still nothing's changed.\r\n\r\nI dropped all my settings and that didn't help either, so I'm really stuck on what to do next, aside from just straight up reinstall my OS and see if that works, but there's a lot of things I would have to reinstall if I did that so I'm trying to put that off as long as possible. Anyone else having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T16:39:28.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fluctuations in your FPS can be caused by a number of potential factors.
