Think of the power budget he'd have to work with when there's not big chunks of it being ripped out for crowd control and dashes!\n\nUnfortunately, Riot appears to extremely undervalue mobility when it comes to power budgets. When you have champions that are blinking and tumbling all over the place, they don't seem to give up much in return for that huge boost in power. Morde could probably have some form of noticeable mobility placed into his kit if he gave up 3 base AD. Maybe 5 if it's point and click.\n\nThe question then becomes, should he be given mobility? If mobility is being given away dirt cheap and is so damn powerful, is it irresponsible to to give that up because tradition says Morde is immobile? These are questions that Morde players really have to sit down and ask themselves. Shame on Riot for putting the Morde players in this position in the first place.\n\n>There could be an argument for replacing the dragon mechanic with something else.\n\nThere would be, if the dragon ghost took any power budget at all. There was a red post way back when that stated that since the ability CD was basically 6+ minutes, that it took practically nothing from his budget. If it was removed, it wouldn't free up all that much. Like mobility, it takes up so little of his budget, but has a huge impact on the game. It would be silly to give that up.\n\nThe W passive, on the other hand, was something Morde got nerfed to hell and back for having. His base stats got hit hard because he naturally gained a level advantage over his opponents. Yes, Morde rarely goes bot to use the passive anymore, but he'll never get that power back as long as the potential for that 100% pick/ban rate in bot lane remains a possibility.\n\nIt's not that the ability has no cost because Morde never uses it, it's actually more like Morde is paying for an ability he never uses. _Huge_ difference.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-29T16:50:47.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's not that the ability has no cost because Morde never uses it, it's actually more like Morde is paying for an ability he never uses. *Huge difference.*\n\nGood point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-07-29T16:04:57.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">There would be, if the dragon ghost took any power budget at all.\n\nYes, this is probably true. In power terms, it certainly isn't a major contributor.\n\n>but he'll never get that power back as long as the potential for that 100% pick/ban rate in bot lane remains a possibility.\n\nI disagree. If he's currently stronger in solo lanes (which he is), and he's barely touching viability in bot lane (also true), and he's received balance changes since then specifically aimed at placing him in solo lanes, then this isn't taking up any part power budget. It's more akin to the AP ratio on Jinx's chompers than it is to a legitimate point of balance.\n\n>as long as the potential for that 100% pick/ban rate in bot lane remains a possibility\n\nTo be frank, that potential is completely dead, and the reason it is dead is because he's been balanced to be stronger in solo lanes. He'd hit a point of 100% solo pick/ban before he hit a duo pick/ban. It would take balance changes specifically directed at his duo lane to make this a problem again, and Riot has the option of just not doing that.\n\nIt's not a part of his power budget because it isn't utilized in his strongest role, and his weaker role is significantly weaker than his stronger one. It may have been a balance limiter in the past, but to say it still is disregards all the balance changes he has had since the rework.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-07-30T16:06:48.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">and he's received balance changes since then specifically aimed at placing him in solo lanes, then this isn't taking up any part power budget. It's more akin to the AP ratio on Jinx's chompers than it is to a legitimate point of balance.\n\nThis is bullshit, and I'll tell you why.\n\nThe major changes Morde went through to become viable in solo lanes? He can now cast his W alone or on a minion. That's almost the full extent of those \"changes since then specifically aimed at placing him in solo lanes\" after he got nerfed in all roles for dominating worlds. He can still use his W to full effectiveness in a duo lane.\n\nUnlike a lot of other champions, Morde is in a unique position that he's getting buffs delayed because he might become too much of a problem in a role that he almost never goes in. That's both insane and insanely unfair. Removing the W passive, despite Morde getting nearly no value from it, would indeed open him up to buffs by removing the fear of him dominating bot lane once again. It has no numerical power in his budget, but it has to be budgeted numerically in his power.\n\nAnd the Jinx comparison? I don't remember anyone running around dominating a major tourney with AP Jinx. And I damn sure don't remember Jinx getting nerfed down to almost unplayable levels because someone was building deathcap on her and going mid. The context is completely different between the two abilities, despite the situation of \"this is worth nothing to the kit\" being similar. The context difference is that Jinx can still get buffs despite her AP ratio, Morde can't because of his W passive.\n\nNo W passive = No bot lane Morde = No fear of buffs from Riot = More power to Morde's kit.\nIt's a bit roundabout, but the W passive still holds power in Morde's budget. It's just power that's more political than numerical.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-07-30T16:57:50.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">That's almost the full extent of those \"changes since then specifically aimed at placing him in solo lanes\"\n\nYes, and they were enough to make him strictly better in a solo lane than he is in a duo lane. That's how easy it was to make him a solo laner. His kit is not well-suited to duo laning, and never was. The only reason he was ever overpowered in a solo lane was because he was specifically restricted from going into a solo lane. As soon as the restrictions were removed,. \n\nHe'll become OP in a solo lane long before he's op in a duo lane. \n\n>Morde is in a unique position that he's getting buffs delayed because he might become too much of a problem in a role that he almost never goes in. \n\nI think that is completely wrong. It presumes that there are no buffs that we can give that would help him in a solo lane more than a duo lane, and I think that's just bullshit. It doesn't fly.\n\nI would agree with the claim that our number of options for buffing Morde are limited by the presence of his ability to go bot lane, but it absolutely does not change our ability to increase his solo lane power more than his duo lane.\n\n>The context is completely different between the two abilities, despite the situation of \"this is worth nothing to the kit\" being similar.\n\nThe historical context is different, but the current game situation is not different. Jinx can be buffed despite having an element that is worthless to her kit, and so can Morde. The only difference is that Morde's could still theoretically become part of his power budget again, so we have to tailor buffs so that they don't allow this. That is not a hard task.\n\nI have an alternative explanation for why Morde hasn't received buffs: He's reasonably close to being in a balanced state, and Riot knows he's terribly designed right now. They hate applying balance changes to champions they know they'll need to rework unless they're extremely out of line. That's why they're sitting on Morde. It's not because they're scared of buffing him; it's because they don't want to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-07-29T00:12:06.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so your saying just nerf him?","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-07-29T04:29:48.732+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say to do anything to him.

In practical terms, he'd be just as strong if he didn't have it as if he did.\n\n>every part of a champion's kit is part of their \"power budget\"\n\nNo, it's not. If you have an aspect of a champion's kit that isn't part of that champion's play in the role they are balanced around, then it isn't part of their power budget. This is why we differentiate \"power budget\" and \"kit mechanics\". A champion's kit makes up everything they have: a champion's power budget only incorporates things that they actually use.\n\n> Riot has adjusted his per-level base damages and benefits to be balanced around him being in a duo lane with bonus XP.\n\nYes, and then they had to do multiple balance and design changes to move him away from that.

Because when the jungler ganks and you push together, is he not using it? When bot lane rotates to help you push, is that not using the passive? When you get a dragon ghost and group with your team to push, is that not using the passive?\n\nJust because it's no longer an integral part of his laning phase doesn't mean it's completely superfluous.

No. But saying that because he doesn't use it in the laning phase it isn't part of his power budget (or is only a small part of his power budget) is ridiculous. Dragon Ghost is harder to utilize as top lane Morde than your W passive - does that mean it's not part of his power budget too? Mordekaiser can get solo exp no matter how many targets are near him as long as he gets the last hit - this is powerful.

Start buffing him and all of a sudden his utility is just too overpowered! The same thing could easily happen to put Morde bottom lane again, as long as the W passive exists, and so it's not \"unrelated\" to his power level in any way.

The vast majority of solo Morde's CS throughout the game is going to come without any allies being around, and by the time of the game where this does start to come into play even a little, xp differences that minor become extremely weak. \n\nIt is as nonfunctional to a power budget as any mechanic in the game.

It's also one I happen to agree with. Morde's potential to go bot lane does mean that when he gets buffed, certain buffs aren't options because they would support bot lane more than solo lane. That is a design limitation.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that the XP passive is currently part of his power budget. Instead, what it means is that it has the potential to be part of his power budget, and we have to impose design constraints to avoid this. That is a good argument for removing it, and I suspect Riot will do so at some point in the future for this reason, particularly if they ever rework Morde.\n\nIt also doesn't mean that his power is limited as a result of this design limitation. We have already proved that we can buff Morde while helping his solo lane more than the bot lane. That means that we can continue to ignore the XP passive, so long as we are comfortable with limiting his design options as a result. (I'm not saying we should be comfortable with limiting his design: just that we can easily alter his power at will without risk of bot-lane Morde so long as we do).\n\n>Like seriously, look at for an example of a champion's complexity and small mechanics pushing them into OP land.\n\nI wouldn't say that it is small mechanics that are making Azir unbalancable.

His problem is that by design, he has an answer to every situation, so long as you and your teammates can afford to play very passively during the stage where you are weak.\n\nHaving an answer to every situation is not a complaint anyone could ever lodge against Morde.\n\n>The same thing could easily happen to put Morde bottom lane again, as long as the W passive exists, and so it's not \"unrelated\" to his power level in any way. \n\nThis assumes that we can't buff Morde without risking his bot lane becoming a problem again. That's just not true. We've already proved that we can alter the relative strength of Morde's roles through selective buffs. We can continue to do so easily in the future. That means we can buff him as we choose without risking bot-lane Morde. That's how we got away with reintroducing solo-lane Morde in the first place.\n\nAgain, the problem with the XP passive is that it imposes design constraints, not that it imposes power constraints. We can easily give him whatever power level we want without bot-lane Morde, but we have to avoid certain buffs to do it. That's not a good thing, but it's a different problem than the one you're talking about.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-07-29T16:49:52.287+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd totally lose the xp passive in favor of slight base stat tweaks.\nThough I'd prefer totally scrapping his W and giving him an actual juggernaut-styled W.\n\nLike his old W shrapnel cloud.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2016-07-28T22:14:54.314+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still play it quite a bit.
