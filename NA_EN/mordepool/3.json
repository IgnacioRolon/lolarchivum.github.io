(Soon&trade;)   \nTo really Nail down a Direction  we need to understand the man  underneath the Armor and where he fits into the game as it stands\n\n#What is his Theme? \nAn immortal Warlord  Bound in Undeath, an ancient Evil  about to launch an assault on middle-earth(whoops) to cover the lands in a Second Darkness.\n\nHow is his theme brought to the Rift? Green mist? He came before the shadow isles so not sure that works\nhttp://gifsoup.com/view/4776518/fart-gun.html\n\n  he sometimes gets a spooky scary skeleton dragon. Oh that&#039;s it?,. Really? And most of the time the dragon just ignores his commands? Wow, and the players are ok with that? Oh so the players complained so Riot made it worse? Interesting? \n #(Warning the above statement is dripping in sarcasm)\n so we have room for improvement.\n\n\nWhat is Mordes Gameplay Fantasy?\nhttp://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/4578446/sauron-o.gif \nSums it up pretty well   maybe add some Iron Maiden in the background for effect. When Playing Mordekaiser the enemy team needs to feel threatened by your presence. Feel the inevitablity of death closing in.\n\nWhat is his Role as a champion?  \n Mordekaiser has decades of Battle experience knows the limits of his strength and can assess the strengths in others. With his cycle of Rebirth being a key strategic point to his victory. He can lose the Battle to win the War. when such a sacrifice is needed it&#039;s always a net gain for Mordekaiser.\n\n\nWhat are his expressions of skill?\nTiming his long ass cooldowns/flash 3rd Q don&#039;t really count. \nhttps://media.tenor.co/images/98ea3573b5b5e979739f3d884b3c6f74/tenor.gif\n ##Getting this Dragon to obey for longer than 2 seconds\n\nDoes his Subclass even fit? \nThis is a question is a thread unto itself. But I can say that having played him since S1 he is a Battle Mage/Juggernaut and not a Juggernaut/Battle Mage. The Juggernaut classification seems like just an excuse to drop his MS to 325( which needs to change)\n\n##What does Morde bring that is Unique? \n &quot;He turns his enemies Strength against themselves &quot; this is THE CORE ELEMENT to Mordekaiser. It&#039;s how he Wages War on Rune Terra \nPassive- iconic\nQ&amp;W&amp;E- cool but meh\nR- is what Defines him as a character ( and no I&#039;m not talking about the Dumb Dragon) &amp; I&#039;m not talking about the dragon. \n\nComing back to Mordes Core element turning the enemies Strength against them.\nMy vision of a New ultimate\nMy idea:  Children of the Grave curses the target damning the target to a fate worse than Death.\nFor the next 12 seconds all damage dealt to the target  by Mordekaiser from aa&#039;s and abilities deal an additional 50%(for example) damage. In addition any of Mordekaisers basic abilities that hit the target apply the grounded cc for 1.25 seconds.  \nMordekaiser&#039;s Ghost \n Lingers for 45seconds, persists through Mordekaiser&#039;s death and is still controlled by his Master FROM THE GRAVE. \n( Reinforcing his willingness to Lose the Battle and  win the War)\nThe leash range for the ghost is the balancing lever riot could use \n\nWhy add the Grounded CC to his Kit?  I thought he is supposed to be the immobile no CC champion.\n\nWhile this is true after 7 years I feel like having Mordekaiser depend on one Crystal scepter so much is a sign of bad design. \n ultimately his strength of character won&#039;t change by the addition since it&#039;s presented in a Window of Power that is gated on positioning and proximity to the enemy champion. \n\n\n\nMoving Forward:\n #1 Reducing Feast and Famine.\nThis should have been the goal the last time around,  being able to contribute to your team when behind.  see &quot;My idea&quot; for his ult change.\n\n\n#2 330 movement speed Please  if you don&#039;t like the grounded cc addition recommended 340.\n \n #3 His R: Dragon Ghost has to go. it has proven a balance nightmare that Riot is using Bugs to keep ineffective ( I want a functioning Champion not a gimmick anyway)\n  The damage portion of it is lackluster and could be removed entirely making his ultimate a utility spell  \n#The rest of his kit could stay as is with some rebalancing for a none damaging ult\n\n\nTo all those curious as to why I have stayed loyal to this champion for 7 years and why not just play the New OP\n\n Because I don&#039;t need the FOTM OP to win just the tools to effect the game and when I played him before the Rework, EVERY GAME was Fun. Now it feels like I&#039;m playing a cripple with a big stick.\n\nLet me know what you think\n\nMordepool still on vacation thinking of you Metal Man\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0deA1JUUZFQ","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-04-25T23:49:05.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's a big Wall of text I tried to break it up to make it readable","replies":[{"poster":"Kilanost","date":"2017-04-26T02:10:38.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're supposed to have decent control over dragon?

The dragon just pauses any possible interaction.  \nForcing enemies to keep at a distance   while the Morde player is dealing with an unresponsive erratic turret tank.    \n\nIt's not fun for either party.

That is an opinion I cannot see your side of at the moment.  Between having my early dragons simply melt or my late game dragons aggro juggled while I get killed by one or two champs that know dragon should not be the main target of anything besides an afterthought stun I'd say it has plenty of work around.  Lets reel things back for a moment to better understand the situation, who plans and practices around fighting against Mordekaiser?  Can you really blame a player for not knowing how to play against that when they are almost as likely to have Urgot on their team?  Personally that WTF do I do moment is why I like the game so much, though I am by no means a good enough player to work out 80% of those instances.\n\nThat again is just opinion.  I still have fun playing Morde when ever I get the chance and the only wasted potential is on me not knowing how to make my favorite character work.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-04-26T11:35:03.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Selegun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OOernG0E,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2017-04-26T03:47:28.111+0000)\n>\n> My example about Dragon stalling any interaction is based around the early game 1v1   when  the powerspike is most noticeable and when most champions haven't finished a defensive item.\n  since as soon as mid game rolls around  the enemy team can group and make the Dragon irrelevent  unless both teams are present.  \n\nMy remark as to Mordekaiser's wasted potential has alot to do with public perception and how it feels to play him .\n\nI see 2 threads a Month by  random people putting forth Mordekaiser Rework threads. \nNearlyn's bug thread on Reddit \nMalicious Metal's Passionate presence on the Boards.  \n I see New people picking him up asking for help with builds and still his playrate \nDropping.   1.4%-1.2%. \nHis public perception is mostly a Negative one\n\nAdd these all up and I see a champion with a strong thematic to pull in new players. with a playstyle fun enough to keep them playing until  that's ruined by bugs\n\nMost of all I see an opportunity for improvement","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-04-27T01:02:16.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can agree that the wasted potential lies heavily with public perception I feel very strongly that this is the fault of us, the players.  I very much admit I have not seen the boards for several months so the point I'd like to raise may very well be invalid but the impression I had after the Juggernaut rework could be boiled down to read, 'If you are not Plat/Diamond then you cant enjoy the character because you don't know what fun is.'  This is very much the attitude that made me lose respect for a large number of players as it turned into the sole argument against the few players that did/still do enjoy Mordekaiser.  What satisfaction can be had in a conversation about something you enjoy only to be stopped by the thread bouncer and told you cant join since you are only silver 2?  Please dont get me wrong, these players still have valid ideas and thoughts but when someone else wants to talk enjoyment and fun just to be told they cant because they are bad is it any wonder why the only people left on the boards just seem to consistently bitch?\n\nI agree very much that Mordekaiser's thematic has a strong draw on newer players, hell, that's the reason I picked him up in the first place despite the laments of the ass-goblins that insisted on teaching me League to begin with.  Personally, it feels like the lack of back and forth conversation is what keeps driving newer Morde players away rather than how buggy or how unbalanced he feels on any particular cycle.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-04-27T01:44:57.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Selegun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OOernG0E,comment-id=0000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-27T01:02:16.316+0000)\n>\n>ass-goblins \n\nThat cracked me up lol. \n\nJoking aside you sir bring up some very good points   I thank you for taking the time to share them.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-04-27T02:24:50.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for hearing me out.  Its not often I'm able to feel satisfied with a board post as I am now. \n\nIf I could pick your brain a moment, your post above mentions wanting more base movespeed and that makes me curious as to why.  I very much feel giving Mordekaiser more movement speed would make him more consistent yet come at the cost of making him feel cool.  What I'm trying to get at is something we can look to a similar character for an answer in the form of Sauron.  Have you ever seen Sauron run?  Jog?  Trot maybe?  I cant remember off the top of my head but if pressed I would need to answer with a serious question, why does he need to?  He is all powerful, near invulnerable and ever living!  There just isnt a sound reason in my eyes that anything more than a confident stride should be anything more than what his speed is set at without some heavy penalties to damage, defense or both.  \n\nAt the risk of pressing my point to obsurdity, I would gladly give up 5 more movespeed if I could see that number go directly into his armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-04-27T11:06:43.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Selegun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OOernG0E,comment-id=000000000001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-27T02:24:50.841+0000)\n>\n> At the risk of pressing my point to obsurdity, I would gladly give up 5 more movespeed if I could see that number go directly into his armor.\n\nFor me Riot has 2 options  either give him cc which can allow him to lock down one mobile opponent ( and still be out ran).  Or bring his base Movement speed back up to a respectable level\n\nThe reason is  simply because of how it feels to move such a large hitbox character with such low movement speed.    \n\nMy preference would be the 1st option keep him slow but suddenly hyper Mobile champions have to feel the inevitablity of death closing in as this slow moving threat runs them down","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-04-27T14:14:22.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see your point about giving him a CC, though I worry it would come with some heavy restrictions.

To this end I am still in the mindset of the summoner bringing those two spells while the champion works with the base stats and spells set to their kit.  I do see the benefit you point out with the Grounded debuff and very much agree he could use the bump to feel better.
