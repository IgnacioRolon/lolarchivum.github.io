Frankly i would be extremely disappointed if that is the Case.\r\n\r\nAfter years of  neglect i kinda hope for more.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong, but i have become a pessimist  due to Years of mistreatment of my Favorite character.","replies":[{"poster":"PrÃ¸ Sense","date":"2019-03-30T19:00:17.566+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep your expectations low and you'll never be disappointed {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-03-30T20:46:34.568+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have kept them low  and have still been dissapointed","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2019-03-30T22:39:20.573+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree.
