I wouldnt be surprised if fiddlesticks and amumu got one too.\n\nher W isnt offensive or team-powerful utility, its personal utility that doesnt even last very long. At best its a juke tool for outplays. \nShe isnt mobile for the most part, her damage is loaded in her Q and synergizes with her E, she doesnt synergize outwardly (others synergize with her) i think, her ultimate is basically a zyra ultimate with her at the center. \n\nReally, youre over reacting. Take off the sunglasses and try to look at the world with a little less rancor.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-11-19T19:39:36.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your accusation of Rancor is unfounded. \nIm just highlighting  what i see as problematic  in this new champ design.
