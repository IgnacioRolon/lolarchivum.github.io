Did his Rework have the desired affect of establishing him a home in bot lane.  \nWhat the data  shows  while giving a basis for my hypothesis isn&#039;t 100% reliable. Regardless an argument can be made that Mordekaiser&#039;s true home is Toplane and the Jungle. \n\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/mordekaiser/adc\n\nI was researching my favorite Metallic Maestro on league of graphs and looking at the data presented I noticed some very obvious patterns emerge.\n\nMordekaiser per role per rank.\n\nADC role:   the noticeable trend being the lower the elo the higher the winrate( which dips below 50% somewhere in Gold)\n\nThe obvious take away  higher skilled teams can exploit his obvious weaknesses (no shocker there)  \n\nSupport role:  45% in bronze and gold, dips down to 40% in silver.  Platinum+  they have the thematically good sense not to play him.\n\nMidlane: the trend show  a peak of 42% in silver with  a rather consistent poor performance of -40% across all elos.\n\nThe take away:  this probably is his worst role overall perhaps  should focus on other avenues.\n\nToplane:  there is a definite upward trend as you climb elo.  44% in bronze and silver, 50% in Gold, 63% peak in platinum.\n\nThe take away it:  not being a platinum player myself I can&#039;t speculate on meta factors. I can note the obvious inverse relationship between Toplane and ADC roles.  But there are to many variables to form a conclusion.\n\nJungler:  Of all the roles this one is the Most Consistent hovering around 53%  across all elos\n(80% in Diamond+ with 0% pick rate a anomaly I believe)\n\nSo based upon Consistency across all elos.\nI will put forth that Mordekaiser is better suited to the Jungle. \nSuits the &quot;too toxic for solo lane&quot; mindset- Riot\nSuits the &quot; he&#039;s More Toxic in a Duo Lane&quot; Mindset - the Community\n\n\nShould he be retweaked with this in mind?\n\n\nThis Question I leave for you Riot.\n\n\n\n A red response would be greatly appreciated, although entirely unexpected.\n\nSincerely S1 Mordekaiser Main","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-11-14T00:23:13.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bad changes honestly  not sure what the (W changes are at all)\n  I hope they increase his base Armor scaling.  \nOr Movement speed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-11-13T22:33:45.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found the best results in jungle surprisingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-11-13T22:56:18.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you jungle him if I might ask?

Start relic shield, its a great buy now that it gives gold per 5, darius sould do the same.  Based on your opponent you must weigh the benifits of getting more defences or getting alittle offence with HP.  Damage & Hp is a must for Morde and i found that if you plan on fetting any kills before 15 min without your opponant DCing on you then you have to get both.  \n\nWith a smart darius you can insta clear the wave after level 2-4.  This gives you enough room to roam into the jungle(yours if you need to be safe or enemy for a surprise gank of your own).  Stay smart and dont linger so you can come back to lane for the next wave of minions.  Once you both have a bit of movespeed consider sweeping into jungle to surprise midlane.\n\nRunes are ment for late game with Morde.  You can play safe with flat but i find scaling AD marks, scaling armor seals, scaling MR glyphs and flat armor quints are actually safer than you might think when you gain levels as fast as you do.  They even cradle you past a bad start if you can find enough gold to catch up.\n\nHowever, I'm planing to try my luck with a 2v1 midlane build taking smite.  This will leave our team without a jungler but with ward and trinket changes i think a flexible team can get it to work.  Midlane lets you contest dragon and herald as well as move to any buff to smite it from an invade.  2v1 mid will also foil the enemy mid if not prepared forcing jungle pressure to your lane to even the score.  But like i said, i still need to test this extensively before i can recomend it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-11-13T16:26:54.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where my mains at\n\nI posted late late night I may have to repost this thread to get some more exposure","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-11-13T19:21:08.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morde is in an interesting position right now with far more people willing to copy paste why they hate the rework over having a theory session on what his new optimal build/role should be.  Honestly, i think the answer might be a change of meta at this point and with all the little things going on around the rift now seems the best time to test that sort of thing.  Since its preseason I'll be testing some builds to the dismay of a handful of normals players but I'll try to queue with friends so that dismay is limited to the enemy team as much as can be helped.","replies":[]}]}]}
