All the casters have to do is say the name of the team... they don't always say TSM or C9 or TIP, they sometimes of course use the whole team name such as Team Solo Mid or Cloud 9 and Team Impulse.  So this kid now hears \"team YouPorn\" (because they will not always say just team YP).  And THAT alone has now mentioned their affiliate and sponsors website, which you agree (in your post) is something that should NOT happen.  And as for their name/jersey/gadgets... I again shake my head... please scroll up to the top of the page... the logo you see there \"YP\" would of course be bradned on all their gear, same as any other LCS team.  I truly don't understand how you fail to connect those 2 dots...","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-12-19T10:09:09.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Man, YP won't be just an abbreviation used by casters while the name is the complete YouPorn, the complete name of the team would be Team YP or something similar...team name clearly it can't include the term YouPorn or other term directly associated with pornography on team name, the rules are clear\n\nThere is no risk for kids when looking directly at Riot sites/vods/official media because surely they would avoid to allow to put any reference to the YouPorn site on their official media channels\n\nThe exposure the site could receive, would be from the external sites/sources that would refer to team YP as the team sponsorized by YouPorn, not by any Riot affiliated thing\n The logo YP as long as it is neutral and has no connections to the activity of the site is fine\n\nI truly don't understand how you fail to connect 2 dots\nRiot has total control on his leagues and can easily detect even the slightest risk for their brand to be damaged by pornoghraphic advertising, so they can just double check everything the team does and punish them at the slightest risk of them doing any porno advertising\nThe problem are the external people like you that would look at the team purely referencing it to the YouPorn team even if they don't do anything that goes against the rule in managing the pro team","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Camba4ever","date":"2015-12-17T22:49:54.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wow... the grammar of this post is the perfect example of what pornography does to your brain and another reason Riot is absolutely doing the right thing not allowing them to compete.

I meant no personal disrespect, simply making my point.  I stand by my reasoning afterwards, which is that nothing even remotely affiliated with porn should be anywhere near the LCS and Riot is 100% in the right not to allow them access.\n\n@Cunctor - \"They have said that they are not advertising their namesake website...\"  I'm not sure if you are serious or trolling... truthfully... The team name IS the advertisement.  I think you are confusing \"advertising\" with \"advocating.\"  Just because they don't advocate (actively endorse or promote) porn doesn't mean they aren't in fact _advertising_ it by literally naming the team after the organization or website, whatever YP is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cunctor","date":"2015-12-17T23:28:27.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Camba4ever,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=7gmJqB4g,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-17T22:49:54.064+0000)\n>\n> Wow... the grammar of this post is the perfect example of what pornography does to your brain and another reason Riot is absolutely doing the right thing not allowing them to compete.
