I'm at a total loss. I have tried everything listed on the game crash page for windows. I have even tried other ways  found by players. I have even Hard reset my computer, and re restored it. Minus this bad boy running much better, I still am unable to play a game with out seeing screen of black misery. \r\n\r\nMy directx is up to date. \r\n\r\nI have tried renaming the system files. \r\n\r\nbut after some extensive reading I found this.

I have started reading everything and anything when it come to code and this game seeing what the issue or inference could be. I have disabled my firewalls, reinstalled network3.5, updated my AMD Catalyst center, verified correct driver update and driver locates, and driver command prompts. I thought is was the internet, but I tried someone elses, same service, and got same bugsplat issue. I have had only one ray of hope, and that in a custom match it loaded a game with nidalee, so I thought I was good, loaded another custom, it worked. But when I went into play a match with people it freaked and strted to load and splat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oreo Catz","date":"2015-11-05T00:48:44.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you, I've been dealing with this for WEEKS. Seems the outage lasts anywhere from 8 to 10 hours. It's been crashing after champ select all day. I test it with a custom game so no leaver status. I tried everything too, and all the support team says is that it is MY network or computer. Extremely frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T22:17:30.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Irdnecros, \n\nIf you have tried everything under the sun and can't get your game to stop crashing, it's probably best to reach out to RIot through ticket.
