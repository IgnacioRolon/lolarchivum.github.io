It&#039;s a very powerful spell, and the spell that I would say defines her.\r\nHer R, on the other hand, is basically just a glorified basic ability. As it is, it&#039;s just a blink and a blink back. To compare, Leblanc has a very similar ability as a basic ability, only with her she not only does a ridiculously high amount of damage with it, her blink-back is optional.\r\n\r\nI think if Zoe&#039;s portal jump was moved to her W, and her spell thief was moved to her R, it would make things a lot better. It would make her weaker pre-6, at least in the &quot;get ignite/protobelt/redemption as a free drop and win&quot; department. It would also allow the ability to be budgeted more towards an ultimate ability.\r\n\r\nJust as an example, here is how I would change them:\r\n\r\nW: Portal Jump\r\nCost: 50 Mana\r\nCooldown: 11/9.5//8/6.5/5\r\nACTIVE: After a brief delay, Zoe dives into a portal that she opens beneath her, blinking to the target location.\r\nZoe remains able to attack and cast abilities during Portal Jump, but is unable to move. After 1 second, she falls back through the portal and blinks back to her cast location.\r\n\r\nR: Spell Thief\r\nCost: 1 Mana (like Taliyah Q on worked ground)\r\nCooldown: 0.75/0.5/0.25 seconds\r\n...(same as current W)...\r\nPASSIVE - WHEEEEE: Casting Spell Thief or one of her own summoner spells grants Zoe 30/50/70% bonus movement speed for the next 2/3/4 seconds, and summons three bubbles that orbit her for the next 10 seconds. The bubbles autonomously hurl themselves at the nearest enemy in range, prioritizing her attack target, dealing 30/50/70 +15% AP magic damage each. NOTE: Bubbles no longer apply her passive.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think.\r\n{{champion:142}} {{item:3681}}","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2018-09-02T21:13:05.855+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Would be a lot better designed, tbh.\n\nStill not good design, but better.

Especially have an ultimate ability that you can't really control, it's less reliable than Yasuo's.\n\nOverall this would likely just be another nerf to her, pushing her strength back another couple levels.  I really don't see how this would make her more fun as you'd be portal jumping less throughout the game due to the higher cooldown between levels 11 and 18.\n\nBTW this is an alt, right?

The intent here was to make her spell thief deal more damage, but force her to max it last in favor of her skillshots.\n\nThe change doesn't really change anything in terms of what her abilities do. Her W would be just as reliable as it is now, just moved to a different slot. It would be like if they swapped Kogmaw or Teemo's R and W. Nothing would change outside of the way they rank up.\n\nI don't see this as a nerf to her, but if that happens to be the case I think it puts her in a much better place in terms of balance levers. Her spell thief being the powerful ability it is could be budgeted as an ultimate, or her portal jump could be changed to make it more fluid to use.

Even if you were to only put one point into the new spell thief ult and put the extra point into portal jump, you'd need another point into portal jump for it to reach its old cooldown at level 11.\n\nBy alt I meant basically a smurf, because it looked like you almost only play bot games on this account?  I just wanted to make sure you do play Zoe because I've seen posts from non-Zoe players with suggested changes that are almost strictly nerfs.\n\nWhile yours isn't strictly a nerf (more damage on spell thief), I don't think it would really help her.  I'd rather just lose W damage for more Q/E damage (and a teensy bit more passive damage, not much).","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-09-03T18:48:09.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I'm Rather Dashing welcome to my ~~pawn shop~~ boards post.\n\nI'm not trying to discount the cost of putting a rank into her jump instead of her spell thief, I'm just saying that the tradeoff still exists and it's a choice you can still make. Currently if Zoe is comfortable with her R cooldown, she can delay getting it to rank 2 or 3 in favor of more power in her other abilities. Depending on how you max abilities, you'd have slightly different playstyles, which all my favourite champions have (Sona, Rakan, Morgana, Soraka, etc.)\n\nNah, this is my main account. I don't play a lot of normals these days because I prefer to play with my friends rather than Solo Q, and that's harder to do now that I have a full-time job. I'm definitely a Zoe player, though, when she first came out I had a lot of free time and managed to get to 100% playrate on her for a while.  Haven't been playing her recently because she just feels really bad after that last patch gutted her (though I did just have a lot of fun with her so I might change that).\nI also tend to just play other games a lot, really into point and clicks right now (Sam & Max is freaking great) and I just play bot games when my friends invite me.

That 80 damage can make all the difference in many scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand having ult still at 11 seconds rather than 8 means that your combo is much less consistent.  It would also hurt her waveclear as she'd take longer to get a second long ranged Q off.  Currently it takes long ranged Qs to kill melee minions (caster too early on), so upping that cooldown hurts waveclear.\n\nIt isn't necessarily bad for champions to have one-point-wonder abilities, plenty of champions currently have them (Xerath E and Lissandra W come to mind for me).  The only playstyle your change would open up is early W max, which would only make sense for a support Zoe using it for vision.  Every other playstyle would simply be weaker than before at most levels (except for the W damage boost, but neither of us seem to really like that anyways).","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-09-03T19:16:02.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, this isn't a final draft. If it's determined that 11/9.5//8/6.5/5 is too high, they could always change it to something like 9/8/7/6/5, or have its cost change per rank or something.\nYou're also ignoring the fact that as it is, her ult stays at 11 until she chooses to rank it up. She could choose to put a rank in E for that extra 80 damage (and really negligible CD reduction now that the refund is gone) and it would be the same as it is here. If her ult being on a higher cooldown is hurting her waveclear, she could get a couple ranks in it before maxing her E, which doesn't help with waveclear at all. Or you could just invest in tier 2 boots, which allow you to essentially get the maximum range off a Q anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-09-03T19:23:33.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here I'll explain, let's say Zoe is level 11.\n\nYour version: 5Q, 3W, 2E, 1R\n\nCurrent: 5Q, 1W, 3E, 2R\n\nThat was the point I was trying to make with how your current draft works.  Perhaps it would work better to swap W and R, but I think it would require a bit more tinkering.  So I guess I agree with your general idea as a possibility and just disagree with the execution of your change.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-09-03T19:51:05.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well with that change you're ignoring the large increase in spell thief damage that comes with it, the 15+5% AP extra damage on the active would certainly help out, and getting a second rank in it would likely outweigh the slightly better cooldown on the ultimate.\n\nSo my 5Q, 2W, 2E, 2R would have a net change over live's 5Q, 1W, 3E, 2R of:\n\nPortal jump's cooldown is 1.5 seconds longer.\nSleepy Trouble Bubble's cooldown is 0.5 seconds longer, and deals a maximum of 80 less damage.\nSpell thief, when activated, deal 75+5% AP more damage total. Her movement speed gained would be increased to 50% from 30%, and would last 1 second longer.\n\nSo, as you can see, as long as you're patient, and have at least 100 AP, you come out on top with this change.

Most of the time when Ignite is used in my experience it means I'm dead and don't have any time to pick it up, meanwhile when Flash is used it's either used aggressively (which leaves no way to pick it up as all the spells drop towards the enemy side) or they use it to Flash under turret, where even if you do pick it up and Flash you can't really do anything if your EQR is on cooldown. \n\nNow obviously can't say for sure what kind of effect this would have without it actually being implemented (it would at least lessen the RNG for more time at least), but IMO it would just make Zoe stronger.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-09-02T22:24:03.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do think her W damage is gutted right now, and if you'll notice I slightly increased it when I moved it to her ultimate (I even made the bubbles have nice round numbers on AP scaling because that always bothered me). It was a very powerful skill and the reliability of this damage was what made people hate her so much.\n\nI don't think swapping her R and W gives her any more access to Nimbus Cloak,  because as it is there is already a 1.5 second delay on activation, meaning it works perfectly with her existing ultimate, and just barely lining up with her W movement speed unless she's chaining together several W's in a row, which even then would only activate once per 60-33 seconds. Not to mention she's giving up mana sustain from or anti-AP safety shield to take that rune, or other things if she goes sorcery secondary.\n\nHer W being great or not-so-great early is not what i was trying to show, it's the RNG that people hate. If Zoe gets lucky and gets protobelt+ignite, she's killed you before you got a chance to react, or now she has two flashes because you had to use yours. \n\nAlso, just a quick copy-paste from something I wrote a while ago on how I would deal with the RNG nature of the W.\n\n> First, only cannon minions should drop shards. This would stabilize her laning pattern, and give her opponents more consistent windows of power to deal with the ability. It would also reduce the RNG slightly. In addition, this shard should drop regardless of whether or not she gets the last hit on the minion. This would help her out in the support role, which I personally enjoy, and it would make up for the fact she's getting less opportunities to get shards, AND it would help in the case of dick teammates who take your balloon minions (or non-dicks who don't know any better).\n> \n> Second, her drops should be based around which summoners she initially took. While I don't know 100% how this would be mapped out, the basic premise is that she should be much more likely to get shards for the spell she already has, or similar ones. If she took heal, she would be more likely to get heal, redemption, etc. while less likely to get ignite. This would make the drops she gets slightly less RNG based, and a knowledgeable player will know what to expect Zoe will get from a minion. Also, item actives should not be made available as drops until at LEAST the 10 minute mark, perhaps even 12 or 15 depending on the item (protobelt vs. redemption vs. GLP).","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2018-09-03T00:11:11.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nimbus Cloak does not work well with the current ultimate. It CC's her in place which defeats the entire purpose of being able to use your ultimate for a movement speed boost, it's anti synergy even if Nimbus Cloak only comes into affect after it ends. Not to say it can't work, there are situations in which it is useful(R to E over a long wall then use the MS to close the gap with Q), however from my own experience her ultimate has so many applications that Nimbus Cloak is going to constantly go on cooldown and won't be active when you could actually need it. Ult to pick up a drop just to be safe? Increasing Q damage for waveclear? Just overall making sure you can Q the cannon in time when coming back to lane? Safe warding in the fog of war? Nimbus Cloak will proc and go on cooldown.\n\nMeanwhile using your W does not impair your movement, instead it amplifies it, and Nimbus Cloak would amplify it even further. Think of it like Singed ult + Nimbus Cloak, it doubles up on a strength he already has. Also most of the time you are only going to be using W versus champions so it won't be going off prematurely, and in combat MS is never bad if you know how to use it. And I'm sure if you play Zoe you have had plenty of times where you used your W proc purely for the MS part of it. Overall W would have a much bigger synergy than her R does.\n\nWhen it comes to other runes. Nullifying Orb is situational and Manaflow Band is in my opinion really unecessary. I never take Manaflow Band and have no mana issues when I play Zoe. So if you are going Sorcery primary and don't think they have a big AP threat, then Nimbus would be a perfectly good choice.\n\n>Her W being great or not-so-great early is not what i was trying to show, it's the RNG that people hate. If Zoe gets lucky and gets protobelt+ignite\n\nI didn't mean to come across as being against reducing situations like this. I'm all for toning this down, but this solution would really just bandaid delay the problem as opposed to actually fixing it.\n\n>or now she has two flashes because you had to use yours.\n\nI disagree with this. Unless you are using your Flash prematurely, then you should either be recalling and going back to base because you were going to die, or Zoe herself is dead because you used it to help finish her off(or got ganked by a jungle but I'm keeping this to a 1v1 situation).  In the first scenario, between your recall and walking back to lane, most of Zoe's Flash duration is going to be gone, if you just play more cautiously for about 10-20 seconds after coming back to lane(which you are most likely going to be spending farming a shoved in wave anyway) then there is no big free advantage on Zoe's part besides you being a Flash down. And that's not including that Zoe can shove in > recall as well and basically reducing Flash to a mobility tool to get back to lane slightly faster. In the second scenario where she died, Zoe cannot pick up Flash and she gains nothing.\n\n>First, only cannon minions should drop shards. This would stabilize her laning pattern, and give her opponents more consistent windows of power to deal with the ability. It would also reduce the RNG slightly.\n\nI agree with this. It's a change I have tried suggesting multiple times.\n\n>In addition, this shard should drop regardless of whether or not she gets the last hit on the minion. This would help her out in the support role, which I personally enjoy, and it would make up for the fact she's getting less opportunities to get shards, AND it would help in the case of dick teammates who take your balloon minions (or non-dicks who don't know any better).\n\nI disagree that it should drop if she doesn't get a last hit. Unless you mean only when an allied champion last hits it(so her laning phase is unaffected), then I agree with that as well, it would make mid-late game a lot less frustrating since most teammates apparently don't know that minions drop shards.\n\n>Second, her drops should be based around which summoners she initially took. While I don't know 100% how this would be mapped out, the basic premise is that she should be much more likely to get shards for the spell she already has, or similar ones.\n\nI don't know how to feel about this, but mostly I don't like the idea. Most of the time you would want to pick Heal/Barrier to protect yourself from pre 6 all ins a decent amount of mids(mainly assassins) can do, being restricted and \"punished\" for that choice when you could be switching up to a more aggressive playstyle doesn't sound good. Ignite, Exhaust, Protobelt and somewhat GLP are also all stupidly powerful and getting them consistently because you picked Ignite would definitely make her kill pressure in lane skyrocket.\n\n>Also, item actives should not be made available as drops until at LEAST the 10 minute mark, perhaps even 12 or 15 depending on the item (protobelt vs. redemption vs. GLP).\n\nI agree with this. They are already really rare drops (though GLP seems more common in my experience)but that just makes it feel even worse when Zoe gets them since they are all really powerful. I'm actually surprised she can use items at all through W (both minions and from enemy champions) since the main gimmick is meant to be summoner spell stealing. But whenever it's okay, balanced or simply can't be taken away because it would remove way too much power from her is something I can't really judge.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-09-03T00:29:53.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see anything wrong with giving her incentive to take Nimbus Cloak over other runes. Seems like a fine adjustment to me. Even if it turns out to have some incredible synergy with Celerity, you can always just tone down the movespeed the ability itself gives you. That's one of the points of moving the spell thief to the ultimate, because it's such a high-impact ability it deserves to be balanced like one. \n\nAs for Zoe's double flash, you're ignoring the existence of a jungler. If Zoe has two flashes, she is basically immune to a gank no matter where she is. By pushing her extra flash +MS boost to her R, she will be more vulnerable to ganks pre-6, and even after it she will still have to deal with the slightly increased cooldown as I suggested.\n\nI think getting the shard regardless of who kills the minion would be fine, but again it would put the onus on her allies to actually CS the cannon minion in order for her to get her spell. One of the huge seldom-talked-about disparities between low and high ELO is the CS, and by adding this you help reduce the huge differences between her players.\n\nFor the altering drop chances based on your starting summoners, I agree that that idea does have some problems, but if done right could really help her out in terms of consistency. However, a Zoe taking ignite +exhaust would face the problem of getting fewer chances to escape a situation, since she has no dash, or spell she can use without a target, whereas a Zoe taking heal/barrier would be safer but with less kill pressure. Again, not a perfect idea, but one I had at the time, and one that I feel would benefit Zoe in the support role I so desperately wish was viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2018-09-03T01:11:27.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like the idea of balancing abilities around runes, especially because eventually the runes will be reworked again and the nerfs will stay. And I didn't mean it as being against Nimbus Cloak being a viable choice, I just meant it could create another abuse case with runes (like how for example Jhin is abusing HoB right now).\n\nSaying Zoe is immune to ganks because she has 2 Flashes is stupid. Just because somebody did not die does not mean a gank is not successful. If you can waste enemy's resource (in this case at least 1 Flash) then the gank is a success as it relives pressure from your laner, after all a Zoe with only 1 Flash or no Flashes at all  is a lot less safe and threatening than a Zoe with 2 Flashes. \n\nAnd I don't think delaying her W makes her any more vulnerable to ganks. Obviously if you have Flash it's a night and day difference but 99% of the time you wont actually have Flash, and sometimes will not have a W at all unless you burn your own spell. Her ultimate definitely has uses with dodging ganks as well, like dodging CC abilities and displacing targeted gapclosers so having it earlier would help, and  if you have E most ganks are a non issue. Overall  still think Zoe would be better off with the swap than without since it gives her level 6 powerspike at level without much of a trade off. \n\nWhen it comes to the RNG consistency, IMO they should just streamline it into Heal/Barrier/Ignite and maybe Exhaust and Cleanse as well(Exhaust is really powerful and Cleanse can either be useless or really good depending on matchup, so I'm not sure about them). That way you only have a few possible drops and know what to expect, and also no items. Ghost is excluded because it's really gimmicky IMO and not something that helps in lane most of the time or a lot of players know how to use well either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2018-09-03T21:32:04.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a really shitty ult though since it's dependant on drops\nThe picking up enemy shards + minion drops would have to be a passive that works in conjunction with a more proper ult otherwise the uptime on it would be extremely unreliable","replies":[]}]}
