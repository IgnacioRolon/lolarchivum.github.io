If they make her shit, she won't be played, and skins won't sell. Pure fact$. As for your stats, Ahri most definitely has a 53% winrate in Plat+ where players are at their best mechanically and game knowledge wise. This is according to Champion.gg and also https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/ahri. OH, and she has also reached OVER 20% pickrate at several points in her existence.
