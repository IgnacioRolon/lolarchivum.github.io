Also, Sona's base rigging and her older skins are simply atrocious in terms of how poorly they've aged. The rigging part applies to every skin except DJ, and because of this awful rigging, it makes her skins seem much older than they actually are, even newer ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-01-25T15:11:42.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To also also be fair, Sona is one of the very few champions who already owns an ultimate skin, so I kinda understand why people might prefer to serve other champions with high quality skins first over her. ^^\n\nFor example, Quinn still doesn't have a single skin above 975 RP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-01-24T21:13:59.340+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Odyssey had great particles and effects to it, but the base model was super ugly and the colour scheme to it just didn't work for me.
