I can no longer view the ticket, however I have received responses via email and have been responding to those and that seems to be working fine.\r\nAfter I sent in a ticket, Magistrate Tempus asked for some information, and I provided him with all the information I could (via email), and then 2 days later he sent me another response saying \"Rest assured, good news is on the way!.\"\r\nThat response was sent to me on 1/28. I have sent him another response via email telling him that I am looking forward to the news, but I have not gotten any response with any \"news.\" I am getting worried because I do NOT have access to the email that I used for that account anymore(it is so old!). I'm just wondering if anyone else has any experience with this? I am just getting really nervous and am paranoid that the hackers somehow got to Riot support and cancelled out the tickets or something (since I cannot view the ticket/responses on this account on the \"Support\" page, I can only view responses on the email associated with this account).\r\n\r\nPlease respond. My anxiety is extremely high...\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-03T04:20:26.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry Carrot, we'll get this sorted out!
