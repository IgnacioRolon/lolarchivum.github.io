I had 500 stacks on it. Then I accidentally bought another tear and then when I clicked undo, it would undo the 1st tear I had and not the 2nd one i had. So I had to sell the new one with 0 stacks just to get rid of it instead of undoing it. And I would have to buy the tear again just to get the tear back with the 500 stacks. \r\n\r\nFirst I just had the tear. Then i bought another, then tried to undo it and then it would undo my current tear with stacks. So then when I buy the tear again the tear I had stacks on came back. Then I would have to sell the one without any stacks to get rid of it instead of undoing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryzing2Diamond","date":"2016-07-19T14:57:19.314+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this happened to {{champion:13}} he would cry.","replies":[{"poster":"Amasa Delano","date":"2016-07-19T15:11:13.829+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2016-07-19T22:12:47.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although it would not be the end of the world if this happened to Ryze.
