I also tried logging into EUW with it and it said that the account had been moved so sign into the proper region. Also, I have waited a day assuming maybe the transfer may have taken a while.  I've tried logging into all the servers just to see if maybe I moved it to the wrong account, but it tells me the same thing. I wouldn't care had I not spent $1,500 on my account.  Rito y u steal monies from me? \r\n\r\nsidenote: I've already filled out a ticket, but with no response.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T04:53:51.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already submitted a ticket, I recommend sitting tight until an account specialist gets back to you.
