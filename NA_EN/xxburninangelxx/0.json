I think a thematic concept with that in mind (only when releasing them together) could turn out pretty interesting since the thought behind it would then make sense.

If you want to bring them together you should name them Courtship Diana and Courtship Leona. Courtship is another way of saying eclipse, and I feel like it would be a better thematic name altogether.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2015-02-11T17:57:52.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I sit here already brainstorming I realize that the sun has an extremely strong gravitational force, but not only that an extremely powerful magnetic field..

As a comparison, look at Defender Leona. The difference is, if you'll forgive me, night and day. The helmet in the Eclipse concept obscures vision (ignoring any mystical magical second sight silliness) and has two uselessly decorative protrusions that serve no purpose and in a worst case scenario could be used by an enemy to grapple poor Leona's head.
