Using a VPN as MC suggested might be able to help, since using a VPN can route your connection in a different way to hopefully get a more solid link. I'd also recommend going through and updating your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as well in case something is a little odd there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeusVulting","date":"2017-07-07T00:29:21.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else still having this problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niwatoko","date":"2017-07-06T15:26:37.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the exact same issue. I even contacted support. I have great internet connection to the servers and have never had this problem in the year I have been playing league. I've heard a lot of people saying they have had issues with this, therefore making me think it's the patch we are currently in. \n\nIf you don't want to wait until next patch, I can tell you what I have found through reading many, many comments other people have posted on here having the same issue. You can connect to league through a VPN if you would like to. I use \"Hotspot Shield\" because it was the most recommended, but I in particular have super high ping on the VPN which isn't the best, but at least I can play in the meantime, before the next patch.\n\nGood Luck. I hope this gets fixed soon as I would love to be able to play ranked again, but I am way too afraid to do so since my ping randomly spikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"W Tile","date":"2017-07-06T00:03:08.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue, I went through the troubleshooting connection issues guide, but I still have this problem","replies":[]}]}
