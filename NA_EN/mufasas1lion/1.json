That part was never removed. What was removed was the ability to knock up champions with his E. So Azir getting a shield on his E is definitely intentional.\n\nAlso, for the Alacrity not actually giving 20 movespeed, movespeed has a few soft caps. When you reach these soft caps for MS, every additional point of MS has reduced effectiveness. So if you're not getting the full 20 MS from Alacrity, then it's very likely because you've reached one of the soft caps.","replies":[]}]}
