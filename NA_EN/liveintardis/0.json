Is it during the loading screen, champion select, or elsewhere?  As a first step, I suggesting using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up anything that might be blocking your connection specifically to the game servers.  Try those steps and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"LiveinTardis","date":"2016-12-01T05:55:31.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you a lot! but i did try those method it recommend, and it still didnt work.... The crash occurred in two situations, one is during the loading screen which is like whole black in the screen and shows' cant connect to server,please check your net work connection'. Another is during the game,my champion cant be moved and shows reconnecting, then when i was trying to reconnect by restart the client, it turned out to be situation one again.\nsometimes it works as normal, i can play as usual and there is no lag or something. So i was wondering if it is caused by the internet of the region i live or some sort of internet plans issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-01T16:18:54.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow up!  The black screen is due to a connection failure that can't download any assets, and the input delays you see in-game further affirms that.
