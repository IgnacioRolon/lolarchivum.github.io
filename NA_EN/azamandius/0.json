A history written by the rightful heirs of time...you may read any book you wish but do not wonder if we have any history of losing.\" The old man smiles, showing his rotting teeth \"Every battle is yet to be won\"\n\nThe candles flickered in the night as the the only sound that broke the still air was the rasp of turning pages. After hours of constant silence a figure stepped out of the shadows from the corner of the room. Leblanc{{champion:7}} , or maybe even an illusion of her, called out to the old man sitting at his desk “Morain...what have you gathered?” The old man flinched in surprise and let out a cough as he turned around. His molted skin illuminated in the candlelight “Ahhhhh” *cough* “Matron...He has been very active these days..” The old man gives out a wicked smile “Our network in the lower section of the city is almost completely scattered.” The visage of Leblanc doesnt seem to be affected by those words, she already knew. “And what of him{{champion:50}} ?”\n\nMorain shakes his head “I fear he suspects me...our conversations have stopped completely” The old man stands and closes his book as he cackles “I do think this old man will need a new cover soon.” He says...blood dripping from the seams of his book\n \n\n\n\n\nSupport\nMage\n\n\n\n\nPassive    (30 sec Cooldown)\nA book with many covers: Morain's additional AP and AD are instead converted to adaptive power at a ratio of 3 -1\nAt the fountain Morain may change the leading damage type of his abilities to AD or AP\n\n------------------------------------\nQ\nPast of Violence \nPassive: Whenever a friendly unit dies near Morain he gains one Memory. At 10 memories this ability does an extra 50/85/120/160 + 25% AP/AD magic damage and stuns for 1 sec\n\nActive: Morain rips out the pages of his living book and tosses them into the air. after 0.5 secs the pages shoot forward and hit the first 5 enemies in a wide line dealing 50/85/125/180 + 40% AP as magic damage \n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\nW\nMake History\nActive: Morain chooses an ally and begins recording their accomplishments\n\nPassive:  Whenever your selected ally kills a unit with an ability you may record it into your book and refresh their ability by clicking on them. You can only hold records equal to to 40/60/80/100% of the abilities original cooldown\n\nUltimate abilities cannot be recorded\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nE\nA Dark Future\nMorain marks an enemy champion for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds the mark expires and they are slowed for 40% movement speed and take 6/8/10/12% increased Damage for 1.5 seconds\n\nIf that champion dies before the mark expires then the mark refunds half of it mana cost\n\n------------------------------\n\nR\nHistory in the making\n\nMorain throws his living book into the air and channels for 0.75 seconds. After channeling he sends the book to a location, dealing 200/265/350 +35% AP/AD as Physical damage. If a marked enemy champion is hit they are silenced and slowed for 2.5 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSo i didnt get into the numbers with this concept, Vre'kia wasnt very popular so i wanna make sure y'all are interested in seeing this idea grow.\n\nLike always please, i love feedback and tell me your thoughts on something like this\n\n(Edit) So alot of changes have been made to Morain and ive ended up with this. A damage support who can thrive in communicated plays. His adaptive power is good for slithering through enemy defense.  I know Noxian characters have high damage output so i tried to have him live up to that.

His lore is also severely lacking. For instance, at what point did he start serving Noxus? Under Darkwill? Under Swain? What exactly is his function in the empire's machine?","replies":[{"poster":"Azamandius","date":"2019-08-26T08:16:22.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lore is going to be something of a later task, i wanted to see how the concept vibes with people first and then i would post the history. This is my second attempt with a concept and compared to the first i'll admit its very lackluster in the back story.

I'll do more research into Noxus if more is needed (And it always is) But hopefully these changes will satisfy what y'all were suggesting. Along with the lore change ve made a bit of a kit change as well.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-27T00:29:50.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah he's part of the Black Rose.
