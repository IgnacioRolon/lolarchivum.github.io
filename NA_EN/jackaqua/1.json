Unlike champions who are just 118 or so icons, Items which are a around 250 or so? Champion skills would number **500+**. \n\n\"But it's only 5 skills per champion an-\" We're not even counting stuff like icons that change (Such as {{champion:74}}'s ult looks or {{champion:266}}'s W toggle) and others.\n\nPossible, yeah, but it'll be a while before we get -that- many options.","replies":[{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-02-27T18:27:15.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"590 icons in the scenario where you dont use secondary icons, say Kha's evolved icons.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2014-02-27T18:42:07.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not like adding secondaries adds much, as a percent.

It'd take an hour, tops.\n\nIt's just a giant lookup table by names, which we have, and icon, which we also have. New button, drop down list, contents, {THIS} done.\n\nSeriously, from a programming PoV it's a trivial change. Sure, it's a lot of code, but a walk way is a lot of paving stones, it's still not complex.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-02-28T01:40:26.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, alright.
