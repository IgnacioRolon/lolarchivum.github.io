I wanted to check up on what might have gone wrong, so I've got your account pulled up now.\n\nIt looks like you've been getting plenty of key fragments in the past week. I see that you got one just earlier today actually! I went a little further back, and you also got 4 key frags at the end of last month as well. Let me know if you aren't seeing your fragments in your hextech loot though!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MIAKHALIFAOOOOHH","date":"2017-06-10T01:34:14.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to own the champion you playing with in order to earn any keys.\nAs you get the keys the chance of getting them will eventually decrease over time, also you should play champions that you are good with, keep trying.\nYou dont earn any keys in Bot games.","replies":[]}]}
