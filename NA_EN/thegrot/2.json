He just happens to require a lot of games to be good at. In order to play him at a high level, you have to be reliably consistent with him, but he has a really good payoff. I think if you guys try to buff his damage too much or buff him in general too much, he&#039;s going to be broken and toxic to play against. If you feel he needs a buff, I think give him a smaller buff than a 40% ad scaling on auto. He does not need that big of a buff. Either reduce the scaling by a good margin, or pick a different, smaller buff.\r\n\r\nAlso good call on reverted the 4second cd on his R. That would&#039;ve been busted. \r\nI don&#039;t want to see a high skill champ with high pay off get ruined because he ends up getting over nerfed from over buffs. You can&#039;t look at play rates with Jayce because he requires such a high amount of skill to play.
