Why are we making these huge changes with the new season? \n -Is it just for the sake of changing it? Is it because it&#039;s &quot;tradition&quot;?\n\n2). Are these changes actually necessary to promote game health, and is there any way of knowing some of these changes won&#039;t be a giant step backwards for game health?\n\n\nIf you guys don't feel you could announce your answers to these questions, without feeling the need to justify yourself, then something is wrong with the way you're changing the game (most likely). \n\nAnalogy: A teacher calls on you in class and asks you to answer a question. You answer but he/she gives no response. You either A). start to justify yourself and explain why you chose what you did, or B). continue to wait for him/her to say something because you know you're answer is right. If you guys are option A, then you need to rethink the way you're changing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-26T23:05:26.788+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"We make changes to the game because we believe we can make it better by either solving current problems or with valuable additions to it.
