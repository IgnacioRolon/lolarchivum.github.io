I&#039;ve been a mid main for 3 years and playing this game since release. This is pretty much the only game I have played in the past few years. Riot used to make smart changes. Now I feel like they just randomly rework stuff when they run out of ideas. I don&#039;t even know what the balance team is like anymore, or whoever is coming up with these ideas. But simply put, this isn&#039;t fun anymore. These changes aren&#039;t fun anymore. I don&#039;t care so much that solo queue has been butchered. I don&#039;t care so much that ranked 5&#039;s has been butchered. I do care when workers are so short sighted that they don&#039;t even realize the impact the changes have on the game. Do they even do their research? Re-working a champion might be an okay idea if they have been unplayed in competitive for a significant amount of time. But do you not see that cassiopeia has been playing in competitive throughout this entire season? Granted she hasn&#039;t been spammed, but she has seen a good more amount of play than other champions in this game. And when she&#039;s making the re-emergence, you guys are going to randomly re-work her? Why? For what purpose? What is expected to be gained out of this?\r\n\r\nSeriously, just for reference, look at Dota 2. I like league of legends more for many reasons, but there is one thing being done right about that game. They don&#039;t randomly change a ton of things on a regular basis. They get to a point where there are a lot of viable heros and combinations that can be run, and they leave it that way. Sometimes I feel like Riot just changes things for the sake of changing things. And that is how you start the destruction of the best game in all of eSports.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-04-19T21:14:15.568+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I hear you. It can be scary to have things changed, especially on champions you love.  Will say that during our testing and player labs, Cassio players really enjoyed these changes. I really enjoyed them.  I hope you do as well.\n\n In terms of research and her competitive viability: It's really been cool to see her be picked up these past few weeks.  A project of this size takes significantly longer to complete than a few weeks, so those data points weren't available at the outset.  However, even accounting for her recent spike in popularity, I still think these changes are big wins from a gameplay and thematic standpoint. Right now the main reason to pick her is to counter Ryze. While I appreciate that soft counter in a vacuum, I don't think that's what her viability should be tied to.","replies":[{"poster":"Tidecaller Nami","date":"2016-04-19T21:15:23.773+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sotere,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s72y9sLu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-19T21:14:15.568+0000)\n>\n> I hear you.

The meta we are in right now is a tank meta. In this meta we can think of it as Azir > Cassio > Ryze < Azir. It happens that all of these champions are very good right now because of their teamfighting abilities and incredibly high damage output. The main reason she's not played as much right now is because of Azir. Azir is strictly better than ryze or cassiopeia right now because he counters them and has insanely high damage output in extended fights. Cassiopeia and Ryze have similar damage output but they dont beat azir. I don't really have a problem with the rest of the mages, but the cassiopeia one irritates me. Because it is unnecessary, and it seems to take away from the skill involved in playing the champion.\n\nNow here's the list\nLCK:\nSKT T1 vs Jin Air week1 game 2\nSamsung vs AFs week1 game2\nSamsung vs LZ week2 game3\nJin Air vs AFs week2 game2\nSamsung vs KT week3 game2\nROXT vs Samsung week9 game2\nAFs vs Samsung week10 game2\nPlayoffs:\nSKT T1 vs Jin Air game3\n\n\nNA LCS:\nEFX vs Liquid week2\n\nLPL:\nLGD vs Snake week1 game2\nLGD vs Snake week1 game3\nSnake vs WE week3 game3\n\nEU LCS:\nOrigen vs UOL week2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-04-19T21:58:32.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the fixed range on her W is really a mistake... it takes so many outplay pontential she can do with it, in laning phase it will be really useless, specially against meeles, it lasts now just 4 seconds (from 7) and its cd is too big imo.
