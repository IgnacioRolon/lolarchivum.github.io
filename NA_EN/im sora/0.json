I'm level 5 mastery with Teemo, he's one of my favorite champions. I can't wait for him to get fixed. \n\nBut that ward bug is a bug with the ward debris, not the shrooms. Ward debris becomes target-able for a split second when it first appears. Anything can hit it, including Thresh. Lol he can actually use his hook to pull himself to a dying ward if he times it right. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLsT3BNZ7mY","replies":[]}]}
