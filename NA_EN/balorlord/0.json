I for example used Avast for years across 3 computers before realizing it caused packet loss in LoL. Try for yourself:\r\n1) install Avast\r\n2) try playing Co-op vs. AI\r\n3) try disabling everything in Avast\r\n4) try playing Co-op vs. AI again (if you're like me, you'll still have packet loss just by having it installed)\r\n5) uninstall Avast, have no lag","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T01:55:59.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Avast probably wouldn't cause packet loss, but it could absolutely block your network from being able to reach our servers. It's best to add exceptions for League into Avast so you can keep it running with League going.","replies":[]}]}
