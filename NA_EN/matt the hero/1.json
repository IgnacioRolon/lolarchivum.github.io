Don&#039;t have a fully-fleshed out kit, but a ranger of sorts commanding a dog/wolf/lion/dragon/dinosaur would be great. The pet would function similar to Azir&#039;s soldiers, auto-attacking for the champion. If out of range of the pet, the autoattack would be carried out by the champion herself.\n\nThe abilities would be similar to Ori, moving and attacking with the pet (and possibly something for positioning).\n\nIt&#039;d be cool if the ult would have buff the pet, growing immensely in size (similar to Mega Gnar) and maybe having the champion ride on it.\n\nI just would like to see the role of a pet champ filled.\n\nIf this drummed up some interest, I'd consider filling out an entire champion concept.

These examples are not what I mean at all. I mean more along the lines of Orianna, with a living pet minion. These 3 have pets as part of their design, but not necessarily their gameplay. Nunu's kit could essentially just be Willump himself and he'd be exactly the same. Pix is not integral to Lulu's gameplay, just her character design. Same with Sejuani. Pix and Bristle could both be ditched for anything (Sej could ride in a go-kart for all that matters) and they'd still be the same.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Partholonian,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=2PEYYK8s,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-04-04T17:09:36.495+0000)\n>\n> What happens if it gets killed?  Does that make the champion useless, or can they resummon it immediately and make the effort of killing it useless (and let it tank towers for free, etc.)?\n\nBeen thinking this over. My idea was having the pet be something respawnable (so not literally a living dog, but more like a spirit wolf or something). Maybe the passive would include a cooldown. Nothing too short/long, but just long enough that the pet is not killed at the beginning of a teamfight and then reappears to cleanup the same fight.\n\nAlso, if need be, the champion himself could have a different kit without the animal. Maybe his R spawns the pet? He would start with R like Jayce, Nid, etc, and toggling it would spawn/despawn the pet. His kit without the animal would have to be kind of weak though, perhaps offering escapes and stuff to get out of sticky situations?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whimsy Spook","date":"2015-04-04T05:42:46.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a champion concept once about a Girl and her Poro companion.

This is a weak spell that puts Cynthia at risk of being attacked if in range and can be used if Roop is dead.\n\n_This ability will go on cooldown, but Q can be used freely to make Roop simply auto-attack the target. If there is no target, Roop can move to the target location. This specific effect may be used if unranked or manaless and only serves to command Poro easier._\n\n**W - LICK! **\n**Active:** Roop makes it's tongue an intense blue and licks the target.

This specific effect may be used if unranked or manaless and only serves to command Roop easier._\n\n**R - GIANT PORO-SNAX!**\nRoop gains 100% of Cynthia's stats, instead of 20% and gains bonus armor and magic resistance. Roop also increases in size over-time until he finally explodes doing (+% AP) - (+% AD) physical damage. As Roop grows larger, the amount of armor and magic resist increases but his movement-speed depletes.  This effect lasts over 30 seconds.\n_____________________________________________","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Necron","date":"2015-04-08T03:32:31.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"puppeteer champ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"VioletRaine","date":"2015-04-08T04:37:41.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was thinking a champion  that could tame a jungle monster would be cool (and depending on which they give a different buff) and it will respawn at base when backing if killed","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-04-08T04:47:07.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your idea is the best\nIt would be a bit like Chen in DOTA1.
