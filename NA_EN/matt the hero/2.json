There&#039;s no interaction, no interesting gameplay, to be had from his Eternal Thirst. It&#039;s pretty boring.\n\nBlood Scent is dumb. It&#039;s essentially a second passive that again requires little to no interaction, besides turning it off to sneak up on people. \n\nMy friend  came up with a new passive that would essentially replace the passive and E with something a bit more interesting. His idea is as follows: whenever Warwick damages an enemy, they spill blood on the ground, leaving a trail of bloody footprints as they flee (think the Elixir of Iron path, or Nocturne&#039;s trails). Warwick can follow this trail, gaining a minor decelerating speed buff, allowing him to catch up to prey, damage them again, and gain another speed buff. They would bleed out for a good amount of time, allowing Warwick to track them a short distance for the kill.\n\nA good amount of balance levels exist (how long enemies bleed, how long blood trail stays, % of speed buff, length of speed buff, deceleration rate) that would allow a passive like this to be powerful, but not overbearing. Recently Riot has really pushed for strategic diversity, and tried to push champions into niches that fit their character. Warwick is the Blood Hunter. Him tracking enemies through the fog of war by bloody footprints that excite him and speed him up is pretty much the most \"Warwick\"-style passive you can think of.\n\nWill reply to any questions on the idea in case I am unclear, and my friend and I will continue spitballing the thing to fine tune what I personally think could add some engaging play to an otherwise afk champion. I understand that this only hits on one of Warwick's many challenges, but I hope this is a start.","replies":[{"poster":"Matt The Hero","date":"2015-04-10T19:15:44.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If ZenonTheStoic's kit isn't being worked on, I sure wish Riot would read this.

To me, hearing \"The Blood Hunter\", I hear tracker--a tracker whose heightened scent allows him to hunt prey.\n\nI disagree that that is interactivity. Well, good, meaningful activity. Sure, it makes the opponent play differently, but it offers Warwick no actual oppurtinities for doing anything, besides of course seeing his opponents.\n\nFor your final paragraph, I never said there was no room for the healing in his passive, just that where it is now is boring. No reason his healing/damage can't be tied to something else in his kit. However, as it is now, his current passive only offers a single angle for Riot balance, and the change would add dynamics to it. As for E, I didn't suggest any replacement for it (my OP would have the new Blood Scent replace Eternal Thirst), but my friend and i, as well as commenters on Reddit, have brainstormed. I'm all for a gapcloser, my friend would like to see WW shed his own blood for a massive movement speed buff, for example.","replies":[]}]}]}
