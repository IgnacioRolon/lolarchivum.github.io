I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.15 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-715-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\r\n\r\n7.15 brings a reworked Urgot to the Rift!  In addition to our new shot-gun knee monstrosity, we&#039;ve also made a number of smaller changes to some champions: Akali, Azir, Cho&#039;Gath, Mundo, Ekko, Elise, Ezreal, Gangplank, Grags, Irelia, Jinx, Kayn, Lissandra, Lux, Nami, Nautilus, Shyvana, Singed, Sivir, Twisted Fate, Xerath, Zac, and Ziggs. Nasus has received a relatively interesting change to his ultimate and E too!\r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\r\nChristopher &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson","replies":[{"poster":"Report Evelynn","date":"2017-07-27T11:47:23.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts on Janna?

What she brings to a game is constant mitigation of mistakes at the cost of Janna's mana pool (not much of a cost if you ask me). It's okay that you took that skillshot because Janna shielded you. It's okay you were way out of position and got dived on because Janna R'd them away. It's okay that the enemy team dogpiled on your tank line because Janna knocked them all up with Q. It's okay that Janna got totally caught out warding by herself because she used each of these tools to self-peel an entire team of champions away from her. \n\nIn addition, E's AD+ is a bit of a win-more tool. So while she's mitigating all these mistakes she's also empowering her carries. Pretty powerful combo. With tools like that, even when she's not very powerful she will win a lot of games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Never FF Boy","date":"2017-07-27T02:53:58.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"What is your thoughts about {{champion:11}} ?\n\nHe really need a rework.

I hope we give Kindred some love sometime soon- Jungle Marksmen is a super cool idea- I just wish her success was less tied to her Marks (just to be clear I would not be asking for a full removal, just less marks required to be useful at the cost of less scaling via marks).","replies":[{"poster":"Scopé","date":"2017-07-27T18:22:38.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What kind of buffs do you think could help? Better base stats? More early damage on Kindred's abilities?

Also you break buildings and kill baron real fast.\n\nThat type of champion feels fair to play against most of the time because the marksman is in a lane. You are given tons of opportunities to stop them from reaching that fantasy- you can outplay/out trade them in lane, you can counterpick them, you can assassinate them and prevent them from getting farm, you can push them off their turrets while they're weak and so on.\n\nBut when that type of a champion is in the jungle a few problems emerge. First, it can feel like you have no opportunities to stop this champion from scaling because you have to commit to a dangerous invade to try and stop them, and if they're ahead for whatever reason and you can't invade them then it can feel like you're actually out of options to stop this champion from scaling to their power fantasy. Second, when you're playing WITH that champion it can feel like you don't have a jungler. This guy spends all game just farming the fucking jungle, when is he gonna gank my lane??\n\nKindred attempts to solve those problems by removing a portion of her scaling power into marks, and then puts those marks into the enemy jungle and onto enemy champions in an attempt to force Kindred to interact with champions in the game instead of power farming her jungle forever. The marks are a good solution to a really complicated problem, but by moving her scaling onto marks that are obtainable at different rates it means she can have a lot of variance in her power level at any given point in a game, given any Kindred game. One kindred at 15 minutes could be MUCH more powerful than another Kindred at 15 minutes even if they have similar items due to the power of marks.\n\nI think the solution is to reduce the frequency at which you can attain marks. There's too much variance in how many marks a Kindred can have- I think if we cut down on the number of marks Kindred can realistically get in a game (like let's say she can only get 1 mark every 5 minutes) then we can still keep her important scalings attached to marks, but reduce the variance. When there's less variance I think we can start to actually assess her power level and begin to balance her for all elos. But this is a super complicated problem with a bunch of potential answers, this one is just my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Scopé","date":"2017-07-27T19:02:05.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit! Thanks for such a reply!\n\nBasically, Kindred's passive could be more like Rengar's one, right? Also, i find RNG character of marks in the jungle is pretty difficult to balance. If there was some kind of pattern in it, both Kindred and their enemies could adapt their playstyles to it and then, it should be easier to balance stats from jungle marks.","replies":[{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2017-07-27T19:07:56.621+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of a Rengar style passive! I'm all for reducing the variance of her marks. As long as it's paced a little better than Rengar's. That guy can get a ton of stacks really fast because he's an assassin, but since Kindred is a marksman and we want to try to have this extended marksman style power curve we'd probably want to put a cooldown on mark acquisition or something (unlike Rengar).\n\nI'm also not a fan of the RNG marks- but I like that they encourage Kindred to interact with the opponent's jungle to access her scaling. Maybe it's less about RNG and more about taking a camp with a longer cooldown, like the enemy Red/Blue or an epic neutral Dragon/Herald/Baron?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2017-07-26T23:25:36.117+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with a lot of those changes, but I don't really get why Lux needed a Q buff.\nI would have been happier if you just reverted the crappy W speed nerf, right now my team puts more effort in dodging it than enemy skillshots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evil Yasuo","date":"2017-07-26T23:17:44.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Will Talon ever get some love again?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-07-27T17:57:01.269+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon feels plenty good to play right now IMO with Lethality being strong","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiteUpSketchers","date":"2017-07-27T00:41:43.433+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PB4Nby2Ai-g&autoplay=1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-07-27T13:43:15.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what's ur though about {{item:3814}} ?\n\nstill weak IMO","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-07-27T17:15:40.733+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed that it feels underwhelming compared to other Lethality items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2017-07-27T17:15:00.128+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also feel like it's too weak, most champions seem better served with {{item:3155}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LyingOnLine","date":"2017-07-27T08:21:58.910+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, so this finally showed up.\n\nGuess I might as well ask the obvious questions.

I wouldn't say it's a \"Riot\" vs \"the Playtesters\" situation. =p  But to clarify and provide more insight to our inner workings, the Live Gameplay team ultimately makes the call on balance decisions. The Playtest team provides information to them and the other dev teams like Champion and Gamesystems. Our core responsibility is to provide as valuable and actionable feedback regarding their changes as we can in regards to the goals of them. Whether they heed that feedback is up to them in the end. \n\nIn regards to Akali, our team generally felt that she was performing at an acceptable power level in the previous patch and that buffs were unnecessary. We delivered that feedback (in a much more in depth manner) to Live Gameplay and they decided the buffs were warranted and that they wanted to go through with them. LGP's viewpoint was that there was room to give Akali more power that didn't significantly increase frustration in playing against her. Additionally, while she had matchups that she excelled in, she still struggled to close out the games where she got herself a lead. By upping the power on her passive slightly and lowering the CD on her Twilight Shroud, their hope is that she can more reliably close out the games where she starts snowballing on somebody.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-07-28T00:18:48.971+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It certainly feels like a number of highly questionable changes have gone through recently, validated by the sheer number of hotfixes.

Did we test it improperly? Was something changed at the last minute and we didn't get ENOUGH testing? Did we fail at the theorycrafting phase? (Sivir is an example of that, we should have raised clear red flags over a 30 base damage increase on a doublehitting, level 1 ability) etc.\n\nWe're currently exploring some new techniques to try to avoid causing more live gameplay balancing issues. Previously we had a lot of single point-of-failure on our live gameplay changes (meaning we didn't get enough differing opinions/eyes on them) and we're working towards solving that by having better, systematic group discussions/theorycrafting each patch cycle so that we aren't blindsided.\n\nWe also have to spend a good amount of time working with Game Systems on Runes Reforged as that is one of the most massive changes to LoL that we've ever worked on, which naturally takes some of our bandwidth. Luckily we've recently hired a bunch of smart guys and should be better able to handle our workload.
