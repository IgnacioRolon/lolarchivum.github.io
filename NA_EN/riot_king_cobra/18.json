We&rsquo;re here with a visual update to some of our older item effects in League.\r\n\r\nThere are new VFX for the Spellblade passive on Sheen, Iceborn Gauntlet, Trinity Force, and Lich Bane on PBE. We want to maintain the current readability, but get these effects to better match League&rsquo;s current art style.\r\n\r\nYou can check them out in some images below! (Old on left and new on right)\r\n\r\n**Sheen / Trinity Force**\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zRNJPJY.png\r\n\r\n**Lich Bane**\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kZbf5Su.png\r\n\r\n**Iceborn Gauntlet**\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5vM72nf.png\r\n\r\nDo these still read as the same buffs to you? Are the new buffs as noticeable as the ones on Live? Do they feel cleaner and clearer than the Live versions? We&#039;d love to hear your thoughts!","replies":[{"poster":"Battalion","date":"2018-06-27T02:02:11.768+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't agree that the new spellblade particle is better, I believe that detail is lost when removing the white highlighting starburst. I would, however, use the smokey crimson colour instead of the original. Basically: Take the dark red from the right picture, keep the white starburst from the first, keep the ray effect from the first. \n\nThe others seem great.  \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Futsunushi","date":"2018-06-27T08:51:24.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also think the white starburst should stay (or something different but with similar effect) especially since the new approach seems a bit blurry.

For instance, look at sheen/trinity force. The red over the hand above her body blends in pretty significantly. The old version is much easier to make out due to the shine it provides.

The others are definitely not as noticeable due to the softer colors and greater diffusion at the edges, although they are cleaner. **Lichbane** would also probably be *entirely* invisible in Singed's poison, which worries me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtaxiChaos","date":"2018-06-27T11:34:25.422+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"From a VFX perspective, they look nice; there's definitely a concern of readability though.\n\nChecking just in gray-scale, Sheen/Trinity Force doesn't stand out much and Lich Bane is basically invisible.\n\nPutting them through some Color Blind filters, Iceborn looks great, Lich Bane is difficult to see with tritanopia, and Sheen/Trinity Force is questionable with protanopia and deutanopia.\n\nThe takeaways here are that the bright white aspects of the current ones help them stand out, especially for Sheen/Trinity Force. For Lich Bane, the visibility is primarily in the harsh edge distinction of the starburst effect between its brighter interior and darker exterior colors. If you wanted to achieve a similar effect for that, the lighter parts could possibly be swapped out to something like a darker black, maybe making it look a bit void-y?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-06-27T01:18:44.533+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"They look great, but the one for Sheen/Trinity is a little dull.

Orange if worried about color blindness.\n\n- Red for lich works out because there are no AP items that also give red effects, AP typically doesn't get ardent censor focused on them, so it stands out better rather then purple meshing with dark blue sorcery (and purple just seems strange, why purple?)\n\n- Blue for ice born works out for most tanks since visually tanks don't get a lot of particles or sorcery elixirs. Only case I can think of is ice born skarner with W but its such a niche scenario. \n\nAnd friendly reminder to address colorblindness if you haven't already. Usually this kind of stuff ships and it gets assessed later.
