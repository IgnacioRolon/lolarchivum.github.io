I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.19 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-719-notes).\n\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\n\n7.19 premiers the updated Azir and Xin Zhao! We&#039;ve also changed Aatrox, Caitlyn, Janna, Malphite, Orianna, Ornn, Vayne, and Veigar! We finally nerfed Ardent Censer and Bramble Vest and adjusted a few other items as well. Ask us questions about the patch, or anything else you&#039;re interested for that matter. We&#039;d love to talk with you guys. :) \n\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nAdam \"Afic\" Cohen\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\nChristy &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson\nChris &quot;Auberaun&quot; Roberts\nNick &quot;Endstep&quot; Frijia\nNabi &quot;Novalas&quot; Barak\nSigmundur &quot;GangIeri&quot; Helgason","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2017-09-26T22:47:18.953+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ekko buffs when?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2017-09-26T22:47:45.637+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woops wrong account","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bluup","date":"2017-09-26T23:32:32.073+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":11,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2017-09-26T23:46:50.768+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheBossVeigar","date":"2017-09-27T01:07:13.619+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Afic,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=f8hp6yG8,comment-id=000f0000,timestamp=2017-09-26T23:46:50.768+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:45}}\n\nYou made my day with that reply Afic.

Is it to limit early snowballing?\n\nBecause the way I see it, the downside of that scaling ratio is that it forces you to max that ability ASAP, both impacting her build variety and her viability in the bot lane (because you want as much XP as possible).\n\nIn light of the preseason changes to runes (reduction of starting AD and starting Lethality), would it be plausible to flatten the ratio to the same at all ranks and adjust the base damage accordingly?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-09-27T07:17:57.114+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not Afic, but I am also a pretty big Quinn player on the Playtest team. As far as why Quinn has a scaling AD ratio on Q, there's a variety of reasons, including the ones you mention - there's others as well, like discouraging E max and allowing her to have high potential damage lategame (especially in combination with the large W steroid), both burst and sustained. \n\nI'd say the main argument against having a fixed AD ratio on Q is that Quinn is already a champion that is extraordinarily strong 1v1 and very difficult to actually engage on, especially as a melee. Making the AD ratio on Q fixed is a substantial buff to E max, which would make Quinn even more miserable to lane against than she already is, since it punishes interaction so hard (she's already one of the most undesirable champions to lane against toplane, for good reason). If E max is then discouraged (e.g. by making E a fixed cooldown that doesn't scale down with ranks), then suddenly Quinn has no skill to max that is impactful in the earlygame, which likely means Quinn doesn't function as a champion.\n\nHaving a scaling ratio on the Q does limit Quinn's viability botlane since it ties her power pretty hard into levels, but I'd say it's the best solution to an unfortunate problem. Quinn's scaling AD ratio on Q is there because of her kit, not because of any rune choices or other out-of-game optimization, and I think it's very unlikely to change.","replies":[{"poster":"Corvid","date":"2017-09-27T08:19:57.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any chance Quinn could get another pass at an update? I just recently gave her up after 200k mastery points not including before that system came out. Ive played her 5x more then any other champion in the game... i just had to give her up. She doesnt fit anywhere anymore.. tanks are just plain more useful, assassains have better burst and in combat mobility, other marksmen outperform her... She doesn't have a place anymore on the rift. Picking her top sacrefices a fighter with more teamfight potential, picking her jungle is mediocre at best. Mid has too many bad matchups. Other marksmen are much more useful so she cant go adc. Support is not an option due to lack of utility... \n\nI love Quinn to death, but she needs work. She only has two combative abilities in q and vault. Sure you can pop vision mid fight for various reasons, but I hardly count that as combative. Her ult is canceled by nondamaging slows like karthus wall and wither... dont get me started on the slow that is applied when minions hit her. Her channel is canceled by everything under the sun including minion damage... All these little things are annoying at best and are needless limitiations to the champion as she is. These couls be changed woth a simple QoL patch.\n\nHer skill cealing was lowered with the rework, with her two mechanics remaining being vision manipulation and vault timing. Thats it. Theres nothing else. Target management is simple, without much depth.\n\nHer thematic is butchered ever since Valor was shot and replaced by Taxi. They no longer feel like they work in tandom, all Taxi is now is a mount. She is supposed to be Quinn and Valor, but she plays as Quinn. She was two champions, but was mashed into one and had her abilities butchered.\n\nI love and will always love Quinn, but I cant main her in her current state. Shes a shell of a champion, and she is forgotten for the second time. This is probably not the place to ask, but please, please look into something for her. This is the first time I have heard her name on the boards since the period after her rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-09-28T08:10:06.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing stopping us from updating Quinn but it's not something that's being looked into at the moment.

It is possible that it is bugged.  As to her losing damage from lack of MPen, all mages actually have their damage down despite everyone having base MR reduced.

She has access to a _lot_ of movement speed early on, as well as stronger autoattacks and Zephyr damage that scales based off of that movement speed. If you play Janna as an aggressive harass support I think you'll find pretty significant power, you can probably even try a W max now. On the flipside because you're interacting more you're also putting yourself at greater risk to retaliation or being caught out. Later on you won't be able to do as much offensively with autoattacks and Zephyr just because the risk of being caught out is much greater, and you're still vulnerable to being blown up, but she's still pretty good at playing backline peeler after the early game. \n\nThe Ardent Censer change is definitely a power down for the ADC buff case, and it probably shouldn't be a mandatory first item anymore. Having the buff on the support too can be useful situationally but as a support you're often trying to do other things in a teamfight besides autoattack a lot, so you have to be careful that you're not neglecting your other supportly duties and putting yourself in too much danger for some autos.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-09-26T22:51:27.667+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will Riot be willing to do follow up work on Orianna if her changes to dissonance and shockwave end up causing her playstyle and reliability to dive off a cliff again?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-09-26T23:05:23.603+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
