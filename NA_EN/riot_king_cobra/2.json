I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.8 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-78-notes).\n\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\n\nPatch 7.8 is largely a preparation patch for the upcoming midseason changes and features changes to some dominant picks such as Ivern, Nautilus, and Shen. There&#039;s also some changes for Karthus and Ryze aimed at helping players who are playing on higher latency. Udyr, Amumu, Lissandra, and Aatrox also got some attention in this patch. Additionally, this is the patch our new champions Rakan and Xayah debut! \n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players! \n\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\nBrian \"AurionKratos\" Pressior","replies":[{"poster":"Doonyster","date":"2017-04-19T22:28:22.370+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was #1 on the report a bug boards for a week with high views and comments about a quality of life bug concerning {{champion:45}} , but the filter system on the boards got me buried 6 days later and no response from the bug team!!

I think with time where players have builds and mechanical experience, we'll see Xayah a lot more on the strong side since her poke+E feather pressure in lane is really tough to deal with. Good Rakan's might be super irritating but who knows, we might get used to what he does, but to me he seems like support ahri with her ult sooner. \n\nI just wish Rakan's ult had some clarity, played a game as him and vs. him, when I was playing him, I had no idea if I was actually charming anybody, and when I was playing vs. him, I had no idea if he was even ulting and I didn't even notice I was charmed half the time in the heat of the battle. \n\nAlso Xayah was nerfed on the PBE before release (feather duration reduced).","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-04-20T12:28:59.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What makes Xayah particularly good against tower?

To elaborate a bit, his play pattern of essentially mindlessly shoving midlane without interacting with his lane opponent and then disappearing to possibly gank a side lane isn't super fun to play against, his matchups are really polarizing (IhateFizz), and for a champion with such a grand thematic (EPIC SPACE DRAGON!?) he has a really small playerbase because of his super niche playstyle.\n\nWe were exploring ways to preserve what current Aurelion Sol players like about him while making his gameplay more interactive and less polarizing, but none of them really hit the mark and we didn't have the resources available to make something that was a true win for everybody so we decided to hold off. \n\nPersonally, I think it would be cool if he could freely fly around when using his E and shoot Starfire at people while doing so...like a dragon typically does.

However I feel that the latest patch, even though its vision was good, has ruined the gamemode. It has taken the worst parts about ARAM and made them worse. The things in ARAM that have always been a problem are: a game being decided in champion select; someone missing the beginning of the game (it is a casual gamemode so fine), and people quitting in champion select.\n\nYour patch to make the game faster has made it a lot harder to come back into the game and a slight advantage at the beginning of the game is now all it takes to decide it. So if the opponent's team comp is more early game than yours, game over. Someone goes afk at the beginning, game over. Someone makes a mistake at the begining, gameover. The point is that the game is decided in the first 5-10 minutes. You then have to sit there until 15 mins, trying your hardest to get back in but always behind and always losing. Now that the games are decided based on team comps there is almost no point staying in the champ select if your champion is a late game champ as your chances of getting there are almost nothing. \n\nAs I said I don't have much time to game and with these changes you have made it almost pointless for me to play league. If you wanted to improve ARAM then you should add things like: remake for an afk player; the ability to lock in a champion in champion select, it could take both your rerolls to lock a champion and then even if someone quits at champion select you will be able to play that champion; a different summoner spell or item for squishy champions to counter tanks.\n\nYou need ways to make it so the game isn't decided before it even loads and to also not punish players who have been sitting through a silly number of champion selects each time getting a champion they haven't played for ages but then someone quits everytime and the game they then play is a champion that they have had many times before. The enjoyment of ARAM for me is being able to play a variety of champions that I haven't played for a while in weird combinations and feeling that each champion has an impact on the game. Your recent patch has taken the enjoyment out of ARAM and I feel that that is a massive loss for your game","replies":[]},{"poster":" Jar Jar binks l","date":"2017-04-19T20:41:45.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will the Item changes effect  Volibear?
