I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.11 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-711-notes).\n\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\n\nIn Patch 7.11, we&#039;ve introduced updates to Rek&#039;Sai, Kindred, and Malzahar! We also used this patch as an opportunity to follow up on midseason with changes to some struggling tanks and Maokai and Zac. Beyond this, we also are toning down some champions like Ahri, Caitlyn, Lucian, Syndra, and Yasuo. There&#039;s other changes as well, be sure to read the patch notes! :)\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir","replies":[{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2017-06-01T23:11:41.622+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a good amount of clips of Rek'Sai's ultimate ability missing.

I love Rakan, and I've been doing pretty well on him since his release. However, he doesn't seem to be having much success in solo queue: his win rate has been significantly below-average, even as his play rate tanks. Some related questions:\n\n1. How do you feel about Rakan's laning right now? Personally, playing him into a ranged bully like Sona borders on impossible, since Rakan has neither range nor durability. \n2. Is it okay that none of the support starting items are perfect fits for him? At least Thresh gets the auto attack damage bonus for last-hitting with Relic Shield. \n3. He seems to be one of the weakest supports in the game early (perhaps the weakest), and one of the strongest late (perhaps the strongest). Is this an intentional part of his identity, or something that will be addressed later?\n4.
