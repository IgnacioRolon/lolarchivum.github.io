I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.9 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-79-notes).\n\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\n\nPatch 7.9 is our big midseason patch.  There&#039;s a ton of stuff to talk about this time around. We&#039;ve updated our tank roster with changes to Maokai, Sejuani, and Zac. We&#039;ve also made some changes to durability items and added a few more! Support items now have quests and there&#039;s more detailed stat-tracking post game. Rift Herald got a makeover and some new mechanics as well.\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players! \n\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-05-03T23:04:53.978+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:113}} \nShe's hella fun and actually feels like a Barbarian warleader, she's probably my favorite of the three tank reworks.\nThough people seem to think she's a tad overpowered.\n\n{{champion:57}} \nAh, I'm nostalgic about that one as I played a ton of Maokai Jungle back when I started playing.\nHe's more of a vanguard now and I'll miss Vengeful Maelstrom but I think it's a step in the right direction as it makes him less of a generalist.\n\n{{champion:154}} \nThe change to his voice made me drop him, it gets old really fast and I wished it only kicked in when he's low HP\n\n\nOverall I think these updates are more moderate than the prior ones and they don't seem hilariously overpowered like some other reworks.\n\nand this\n<{{item:1054}} >\nThis is one of the best changes as it makes it a legitimate starting item for heavy poke lanes, especially for my Mid lane Mordekaiser.\n\nAnd since we're already talking about items:\n\nThoughts on {{item:3146}} being built on mages like Leblanc, Ahri and some times even Orianna?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-05-03T23:16:20.898+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're looking at {{item:3146}} .

Is it because they're ranged and not Melee and thus use it as additional poke instead of All-in??\n\ncan you please extrapolate on why you feel that way and what the target champions/roles ARE for this item? I think the main problem with the item is clarity. Its not really obvious who its really for. Everyone can take advantage of the omnivamp and it has both AP AND AD making it \"workable\" on just about any champion.\n\nI guess its supposed to be a sustain item for AP champions  and a relegation item post- will of the Ancients removal but that doesn't really explain the AD nor the psuedo-lifesteal.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-05-04T04:01:48.994+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure! And just to put it out there again, this is just my own personal opinion on it. I think it's an item that should be bought by champions like Jax, Kayle, Evelynn, Morde, Katarina, and to an extent Akali. They largely deal hybrid damage and in an ideal world, want the vamp so they can stay in fights longer and use the active to stick to people better.\n\nI don't like the item on LeBlanc and Ahri because I personally think the active slow removes gameplay from their kits by allowing them to confirm their skill shots (Ethereal Chains and Charm mostly) that set up their full combos easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Monotachi","date":"2017-05-04T04:09:21.008+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot King Cobra,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=pEaw7YEv,comment-id=0001000100040000,timestamp=2017-05-04T04:01:48.994+0000)\n>\n> to an extent Akali. They largely deal hybrid damage and in an ideal world, want the vamp so they can stay in fights longer and use the active to stick to people better.\n\n\"To an extent\"? Akali, out of all of the champions you listed, has been going Gunblade as a solid core first item since season 1 due to her insane synergy with everything Gunblade is about. She makes far better use of how Gunblade is suppose to work compared to any other 'intended' champion. Sorry if this maybe due to wording, but how it is written as 'to an extent', it makes it seem like you think Akali is not suppose to go for this item when history has shown otherwise...\n\nApart from that, it isn't just the slow on Gunblade's active that's making it a problem. There's the high damage on it as well. If it was purely the slow, GLP gives more relevant stats (same 80 AP, but HP/MP with a decent passive) with a slow as well (both have dashes to easily hit enemies with active). But Ahri and LB are not building GLP over Gunblade. The only difference here is the damage of the actives making them lend towards to always picking Gunblade up over GLP.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-05-04T05:32:40.405+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woops, my bad.

I mean, the item could be overtuned, but the concept of them having some level of omnivamp is really not all that bad, especially in the case of Leblanc. I think leblanc right now is punished very hard when she gets pushed out of teamfights, and is on her own a relatively poor splitpusher because she has no sustain. This new build gives her some depth. Ahri is in a similar state, though less so. Also note that the new banshees implementation is definitely going to warp the use cases of this item. Gunblade is going to become an banshees clearer in short order on these assassins, which devalues its use as just an active when compared to the cheaper options of GLP-900 and Protobelt.\n\nAll in all, I hope you guys aren't to hasty eliminating this relatively novel build entirely like you are postulating. It definitely adds some variety into these champions builds; a variety that frankly this game has been lacking for too long. I think that it is healthy that people debate whether to go gunblade,  protobelt, morellos, or even abyssal (now banshees) first item, and then tailor their builds accordingly to their playstyle. Dont take that away please. \n\nIf gunblade active is overpowered in terms of damage or utility, nerf it, sure. But dont gut the item please. As you pointed out, its very unclear who this item is even for, so I fail to understand how adding new users, especially short range assassins which are already risky to play and strictly gated by cooldowns, is verboten.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-05-04T17:06:08.664+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Akali being a user is a bad thing. But to address your concern, we aren't going to jump to conclusions - and you're right that it does add variety into these champion builds - after all not everybody does build it.

You can choose who picks up the trinket to summon Herald so it isn't too difficult to put it on someone who will go catch/push out a side wave at some point if you're worried about not getting to drop it in a vulnerable location when teams start grouping. Also keep in mind this despawns by 20 minutes so you generally won't be using this too far past the normal laning phase.\n\nThere are also a lot of different ways to play around it once you summon it. As a split-pusher you can use it in the side lane 1v1 and force multiple enemies to defend you or your lane opponent will likely have a difficult time killing it quickly solo with you there to defend it.\n\nYou can also look to use it as a straight up siege tool in team situations, as it will be quite difficult for the enemies to hit the eye without being punished when you have multiple people pushing with the herald. It will take a fair amount of ambient damage from waveclear spells etc. though.\n\nIf you manage to take Herald close to 20 minutes you can even setup sweet plays where you use the Herald as a split pusher to make your opponents respond to it while your team pressures Baron.\n\nThere's a lot of ways to use it and I'm interested to see what people come up with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PeepingPeafowl","date":"2017-05-03T23:36:48.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened to coin drops on champion take downs?\n\n I was really looking forward to the high risk high reward play-style of the new coin that was encouraged in the patch notes \n\"_We want to make Ancient Coin’s rewards less consistently safe, allowing users more ways to show off skillful aggression while giving opponents more opportunity to punish mistakes._\"\n\nand Riot Limely telling me that \n\"_As far gold generation, the Coin Line is tuned to have rough parity with the other two, excluding the coins generated by takedowns._\"\ngot me all excited. \n\nWas it decided to just make the coin more risky and still give around the same rewards as the others?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hjarta","date":"2017-05-04T00:58:41.778+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there PeepingPeafowl!\n\nIn regards to your coin drops on champion takedowns: \n\nThey are still technically there and if you get a takedown, the coin automatically goes to you (Even applies to long range redemption takedowns and even in death!) -- If you're not really noticing it visually then no worries; we are currently working on a way to make this more visible.\n\nHope I addressed your question!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-05-03T23:17:39.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please share funny / fustrating stories with the 3 major rework tanks. \n\nPlease share funny / fustrating stories with rift herald.\n\nplease share funny / fustrating stories with itemizations.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-05-03T23:24:08.333+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brian \"Riot Madness Heroo\" is our newest hire and he mains mid.

Cassio wants so much stuff and I'm not sure it's worth giving up CDR/Rylais/Seraphs for Gunblade.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
