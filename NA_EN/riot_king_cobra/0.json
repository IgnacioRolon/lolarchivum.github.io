You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.7 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-77-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Feel free to ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can! \r\n\r\nPatch 7.7 has a number of buffs/nerfs to different champions such as Amumu, Bard, Graves, and Kassadin along with a number of other changes. I would definitely recommend checking them out! \r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;TheLastAirbender&quot; Halldorsson","replies":[{"poster":"KairosR17","date":"2017-04-05T20:26:58.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why not just remove one of the small raptors rather than increasing hp/lowering dmg?","replies":[{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2017-04-05T22:26:31.794+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't want to break up their tightly knit family","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zakhar the Wise","date":"2017-04-05T20:29:39.640+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That would reduce gold and exp income.

It feels like there's a disconnect between where it starts with Ancient Coin (play super passive in lane) and Talisman of Ascension (Playmaking & hard engage). The armor and active just seem out of place. Wouldnt something else like +heal/shield power and a new active or some other mix of stats make more sense. Something just seems off no matter how strong the stats are on that line. ","replies":[{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2017-04-05T21:32:18.839+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah we can talk about other stuff too. Coin is a great one and I'd love to talk about it. As a support player **coin always feels like the wrong choice** (unless you're Soraka) because it's the only truly selfish support item (again, unless you're Soraka and can donate away the HP it gives you).  Coin does not help your marksman- coin gives you health that you probably won't need as a regular support (you already have 3 biscuits). To compare, Spellthief is able to match the gold generation of Coin without optimizing the procs, and it also gives you pressure by buffing your ability to trade or all-in, and lane pressure is invaluable as a support. Relic shield heals your marksman and helps push the wave, both of which in some way give power to your buddy. Coin does neither- it doesn't assist your marksman in trades and it doesn't give you lane pressure or help push. It gives you lots of health that you likely don't need as a regular support.\n\nTo add to your point, post lane phase it feels torn between a selfish item still (Raptor MS passive) and a teamplay item (Shurelia's Reverie MS buff). It's quite expensive as it gives a lot of selfish stats to the support, but at the same time has an expensive active teamplay tool. It's super weird and at its current price point it's hard to give a good enough reason for why I should buy Talisman over pretty much any other support item.\n\nHope that helps describe a little bit of the item's weirdness","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-04-05T22:36:49.820+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coin does give early cdr, so I would argue theres a case for it helping your marksman on most enchanters, not just raka.

I don't play ADC or support, but I they're both capable of doing some awesome stuff, and experiencing those things as their teammate and enemy was super exciting. Personally, I don't think the perks they gain when played together are super huge (except maybe that recall). In my opinion, Rakan has better synergy with Kalista/Lucian than he does with Xayah. There are some really neat combos you can set up with them. Like if Lucian is in front of Rakan, Rakan can dash to him, Lucian can dash forward, Rakan can dash to him again, and then dash in for an engage. :o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-04-06T04:28:40.006+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELPPPPPPPPPPP","replies":[]},{"poster":"S0bey","date":"2017-04-05T21:37:38.493+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah we took him out back and had him drawn an quartered so Cobra could start his hostile take over of patch chat \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nAs for Xayah and Rakan they are DOPE. I've played both of them quite a bit and they're exciting additions to bot lane. When played together they're strong but in particular the shared back is INSANE (you can do some crazy stuff with it, just saving 8s of back time is already crazy but you can also do some fun stuff like backing over a short wall and pulling your buddy with you). They're good champions individually and fit most teams/comps, but my two honorable mentions for these guys is the Kalista+Rakan combo and the Xayah+Thresh combo. The Kalista+Rakan combo is particularly fun, partially because their synergies are nutty for engage, partially because you get to make relationship jokes the entire time (you're married to ME now forget that Xayah person). Xayah Thresh is the \"you will never kill this marksman\" combo- lantern + Xayah R is pretty strong and the hook+flay is often enough delay for Xayah to stack 3 feathers for the root on E.

I think everyone would acknowledge that Rammus has a pretty bad/slow jungle clear just in general.  The one camp though where he could kind of \"catch up\" was the Raptor camp.  This \"nerf\" to the Raptors I think is going to really hurt Rammus.  Standard technique at level 2 was to Q (powerball) and then activate his W (Defensive Ball Curl).  If you did it right, the little raptors would all die just as his W wore off, or maybe one or two auto attacks later.  Basically his W allowed him to clear the little raptors because of the reflected damage back.  But lowering the Raptors damage means less reflected damage going back to them.  And then you increase their HP to boot, which means his super slow auto attacks (once his W wears off) will be all he has left to go after all the little Raptors and the big one as well.  Honestly, I'm not sure he'll even be able to clear the Raptor camp any more at low levels.  Did anyone test Rammus specifically with this change?  Wouldn't be a big deal normally, as I know different champs have different camps they can clear well, except that this was his one camp he could actually take early game.  Any insights thoughts appreciated.  Many thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blutrot","date":"2017-04-05T20:46:54.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wanted to buff some junglers in there early clear but why dont use this to buff even more chmaps like sejuani her clear speed is realy bad in my opinion","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-04-05T21:33:35.433+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sejuani is getting some changes in our mid season tank update!

This means spending a _significant _ 950 gold to upgrade your longsword into a Last Whisper doesn't give any AD at all, which means unless you know you are going to be attacking a target that has a lot of bonus armor (not armor), its very risky to spend that much gold on stats that could be useless. a 1300 gold longsword.\n\nMeanwhile, Black Cleaver shreds almost as much armor, and shreds ALL armor and not just bonus armor, so it is way more useful than LW when fighting squishies, has useful stats such as CDR, health and way more AD for your ability scalings; and also has a much smoother build path than the Last Whisper items (also Giant Slayer suffers from the same dilemma as LW, its useful against health stackers but not against people who have the same health as you). This is why Lucian loves Black Cleaver 2nd item- the armor pen is much less situational than LW.\n\nLate game as a hypercarry ADC you become much more dependent on auto attacks and don't care about your spells as much (see Caitlyn) so the 20% CDR from BC is a waste of gold. Late game when everyone has all the armor they've decided to get, LW is great with a massive 45% bonus pen since it's more trustworthy. But it's been intentionally balanced so that it is drastically less effective on targets with low amounts of bonus armor. This is why a Lucian can get a BC pre 15 minutes, but if he got a LW it is practically useless against the other adc and support.\n\nhope this helps and if im wrong about something feel free to imput, Rito staff.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2017-04-05T21:24:10.131+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"'Sup dudes.
