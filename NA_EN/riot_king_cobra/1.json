I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.12 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-712-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\r\n\r\nPatch 7.12 features buffs to Camille, Corki, Jax, Jhin, Kindred, and Rek&#039;Sai. Additionally, we made a number of adjustments to champions that seemed to be overperforming a bit like Zac, Rumble, Ivern, and Malzahar. We  also preemptively toned down Karma&#039;s shield values due to her crazy synergy with the updated support items that debut with this patch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir","replies":[{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2017-06-15T01:26:11.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does the playtest team feel about Quinn?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-06-15T17:49:07.379+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn is fun to play as but not very fun to play against seems to be the general sentiment","replies":[{"poster":"SILVERAMMO","date":"2017-06-16T16:56:53.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I think Quinn is currently a really balanced champion and in the right spot.

He’s a champion that I’ve mained since season 1 pre-level 30.  He’s an extremely fun champion with a unique kit, great damage, and some type of versatility.  First of all, I do agree that Rumble has grounds to be nerfed.  His lane presence is rather overwhelming and there aren’t many optimal ways to get in on him, unless you have great mobility (to avoid the ult and close the gap) or great ranged burst.  But I feel that with the changes of 7.12, **a decent chunk of Rumble’s identity has been lost.**\n \n**Low CDs and micro-managing them helped identify him- ** He’s a crazy mechanized menace who goes overboard on what he needs to do, at which point he overheats.  Not many champions imitate that style, especially since he operates on heat rather than mana.  He was that champion that, if you first picked him up, you’d button mash until your mech malfunctions and you accidentally scrap shield overheat when the enemy champion gets away with 1HP.  And then once you got used to him, you’d be able to tactically abuse his overheat.  But you’d still overheat.  And the constant button pressing, micro-managing the key presses,... It felt you were commanding a janky ass robot and fiddling with all your buttons and levers and contraptions.  It felt like you were playing as him.\n \nThe flamespitter CD changes don’t agree with that.  Charging your flamespitter provided a bit of uniqueness to him, as you’d already be playing your champion before the 1 minute mark hits.  It’s like getting your charges level 1 w/ incinerate as Annie (at least in much earlier seasons, since nowadays it’s mostly Q start).  It’s an incredibly basic champion-specific technique, but **small things like that reward the player with at least a little satisfaction of personal mastery**.  And it also helps establish, “Well hey, this is my kit.  This is my passive. This is what you’re going to deal with for the rest of the game.”  And ofc, it was a strong introduction to lane.  You had more choices.  If you want, you could push lane to get your level 2, at risk of being level 3 ganked by a jungler.  Or keep it even.  Current Rumble gives very little option.  Unless you’re vs. a passive champion, he’ll be forced to be pushed to his tower regardless of whether or not he starts Q, W, or E.  This is a huge crutch- not just for Rumble the “lane bully”, but also for the ally jungler.  2v1s in the jungle have always been a legitimate strat vs. him since Rumble’s noticeable power spike happens at level 4.  But this hurts even moreso.\n(Also on another note, that is a huge nerf to jungle Rumble as well-  He CAN still jungle, but why _should_ you jungle him now?)\n \n**Rumble has always been a lane bully and a mid-game monster.**  The current build seems to compensate his nerfed early game into upping the damage in mid-late (though ofc, because it’s harder to snowball as him early now, damage may actually be less).  I believe his identity was **moreso of the lane bully side, as well as a relatively safe pick.**  Renekton and Riven matchups could go either way, and he could deal with (most) top lane champions.  As a consequence, early game shut downs could mess him up entirely, vs. gap closer and/or high bursters like Irelia, Renekton, Riven, Jayce, Fiora, Kled.  At which that point, he’ll mainly be using his ultimate to stay in the game.  So there was a bit of a risk.  If his damage was nerfed, I wouldn’t see much of a problem because he can still micromanage himself to deal with other lane bullies.  But, right now as I see it, current build hinders his early game a bit too much for him to get control of the lane.\n \nThis is such a QQ post and I’m sorry for it, but I just feel like maybe more damage nerfs, or an extension on his self-silence/overheat, or perhaps removing the scaled AP on his overheat auto after the first hit (making overheat a VERY tactical choice, using overheat as a last hit type of thing),... IDK, just spitballing ideas here.  Balancing Rumble without losing his identity as the lane bully/mechanized menace that we know him as!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-06-14T23:56:40.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you guys feel about the Rek'Sai and Kindred buffs after the reworks, do you think they were necessary or do you feel players needed to relearn then","replies":[{"poster":"RiotMadnessHeroo","date":"2017-06-15T03:01:26.767+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the Kindred buffs were definitely necessary.\nRek'Sai certainly needed the QOL buffs for the ultimate, but I think there was a significant learning curve to her new playstyle as well and after these buffs she is likely quite strong in the hands of a skilled player.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrik","date":"2017-06-16T13:42:28.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a long time Rek'Sai main I can confirm.

I am sure you folks have considered it, but what about making Cho's Q radius grow with his size, representing the magnitude of the tremors his bulk can generate.  That way he has greater consistency.\n\nThe other option he mentioned was if the zone produced some sort of ambient effect for a short while.  He had mentioned it would be very interesting if the q opened a portal to the void that drained life force and fed it to cho, meaning the initial damage went down, but he would have increased sustain even if he misses the champ as long as their were minions.\n\nJust a few friendly thoughts!

This seems like a nerf to tank supports since redemption is less viable without continued investment, and locket while at cast is greater because of both the full decay, and the required health scaling, it will probably block less damage for the entire team. Sure the shield will be decent with stoneplate, but that's a lot of gold to wait on for a tank support. Are you counting on zeke's to pick up the slack? Honestly looks like a decent nerf to tank supports overall. Is there any internal data to that should negate my worries?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotMadnessHeroo","date":"2017-06-15T03:16:10.919+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it's certainly not the intention it's very possible that overall these changes are a nerf to tank Supports. One of the primary goals however is to separate Tank vs Ranged support itemization, so that should we determine for example that Tanks indeed are underpowered, we have the option to buff their items specifically instead of inadvertently buffing all supports because they are building the same items. Hopefully this will give us the levers to properly balance supports going forward, even if that isn't the case right out of the gate.","replies":[{"poster":"Merbstrom","date":"2017-06-15T06:19:40.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, thanks for the clarification.

I've played roughly 500 games with him and I feel Im qualified to comment on his new state. Regarding his changes this patch, I can understand the intention but the execution of said intention has many oversights that arent noticeable to anyone who doesnt live and breathe the champ. Last I heard on PBE these were the extreme changes but the numbers were supposed to be made less severe. To my knowledge these numbers are unchanged from the initial PBE offering. The changes to heat decay are butchery at best. He isn't just nerfed in lane, this affects him negatively at every point in the game. He casts a lot less spells as a whole now. There is this horrible idle time where you're waiting for heat to decay and you're not doing anything, that wasn't present before. It's not just the front loaded decay but the ending rate of his heat used to be twice as fast. Yes you'd have to micro more but it was also more opportunities for damage, plays, etc. Technicalities aside, spamming a bunch of spells and micro'ing his heat is what makes Rumble fun imo. The small buffs to his spells damage dont get close to mitigating the heat decay nerf. I'd gladly trade the new 10% ap on q for the old heat decay system back. The heat change makes no sense to me or any Rumble main ive talked to. It feels so tacked on and negligibly calculated. I want to know why you guys deemed it so necessary.\n\nSure theoretically his heat is easier to manage for newer players but the skill ceiling and play potential is lowered as well. Its not just the cooldown increase. Rumble's heat is like energy for ninjas. With the lowered decay you essentially increased his Q cooldown, you increased his energy cost , and you reduced its damage to minions. That's a triple nerf! Less spells due to a virtual energy cost over a long timeline means less dps. I feel like there's this misconception among you guys that because Q reverts back to a 6 second cd at level 9 that all is right with him afterward. No! There's such a thing as opportunity cost, its not the same at all. Small things like removing the 5 tick decay also severely affects his most precise trades. Heat Zone 55-75 is pretty important when you're pre planning an overheat all in. That precision is now gone and it separated the good Rumbles from the great ones. Also you hit Rumble indirectly this patch with the nerfs to dorans shield not to mention Adaptive helm which is specifically used to counter him. And then you buff the assassins that prey on him like Camille and leave Galio and Gragas' waveclear with only a small slap on the wrist?  You guys are taking a slow, iterative, and correct process with Galio/Gragas and dorans ring but why such a ham handed and drastic change on a champion like Rumble who isnt even that oppressive or popular?  He's not even doing that great in competitive though he does see regular play.\n\nThis isnt even a \"Oh woe is me, they nerfed my main champion\" post. I've been a Rumble main since Season 3 and I've never been so personally offended by a change to him. Every Rumble change was manageable but this heat one. Even though his damage and ult cooldowns were altered in previous patches he maintained his essence because the heat mechanic was unchanged. You could still do Rumble things even if your damage was lacking. You've not only made him weaker but you've robbed him of his identity. He's not supposed to be an easy champ to play. Why are you guys trying to make him so with the heat decay changes? Who's going to want to pick up a champion who gets outpushed by all the dorans ring tanks and outdueled by the assassins? I think you're going to achieve the opposite of what you want. Most newer players will find it too difficult to play him because of his now very poor laning and him still having his former vulnerability to ganks/dives. When someone starts to play top I always recommend Renekton because he has a large margin of error. He's a good example of a beginner friendly champ. By substantially reducing Rumble's margin of error you've made him more frustrating for beginners. Not only that but you've managed to annoy all us Rumble vets who tick his heat by memory. Memory that's only established over tons of Rumble games. By the patch description you guys make it seem he has no weaknesses in lane and trades with impunity. He is by definition a lane bully, they're supposed to trade favorably. I think of him like an AP version of Darius. His old pushing power was a double edged sword that made him more susceptible to ganks. He has a lot of answers in today's top meta. Im confused by the desperation of the changes as if he were this unrivaled monster of top lane. That i can see, his win rate is at a cool 48%. Hardly what I'd consider relentless.\n\nOne can argue he's too oppressive in lane under controlled circumstances but he was not without weakness or counterplay. If you feel compelled to dial back his greatest strengths, nerf his laning and only that. The heat decay nerf is a multidimensional nerf that is present the whole game and I dont think you guys are fully taking into account how it changes Rumble's dynamics completely and for the worst. To a lot of us, the constant micro of heat and spamming of spells is what makes the champ such a blast to play. Please don't remove the aspects that drew his fans to him the most.  If you insist on removing him from competitive viability at least have the courtesy to keep what made him fun intact.
