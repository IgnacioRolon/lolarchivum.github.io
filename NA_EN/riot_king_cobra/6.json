I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.17 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-717-notes).\n\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\n\n7.17 brings Ornn to the Rift! We also buffed a number of champions including Ezreal, Hecarim, Leona, Urgot, and Zed. Ardent Censer took a hit as well. \n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\nChristy &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson\nChris &quot;Auberaun&quot; Roberts\nNick &quot;Endstep&quot; Frijia\nNabi &quot;Novalas&quot; Barak","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-08-23T22:34:35.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you still think aatrox is in no need of buffs? \nDid he really need a nerf last patch, regardless of how large?","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2017-08-23T22:56:40.954+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're actually looking at potentially buffing Aatrox for 7.18.

In most cases, there's some number of test points in each game and some number of controls. For example, when we were testing Ornn, we would run tests with him in different lanes and also into various different matchups, but it doesn't usually come down to saying \"here are the 9 other champions we want to test with Ornn today.\" We might set up a specific lane matchup (especially a control matchup to verify specific points - this is particularly useful when certain things are changed like waveclear breakpoints or combat patterns), but that doesn't stop there from being test points on the rest of the map - one test point does not invalidate any others in the same game, although for specific balance feedback we do try to get the number of test points as low as possible.\n\nMost of the time we try to get players in roles and on champions that they are comfortable on, but sometimes that is deliberately avoided in order to verify test points. As an example, if we think a set of changes we're playtesting overbuff an ADC, we might put a player who rarely plays ADC on it to see how they perform, or pair an ADC player with a less experienced support player.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Auberaun","date":"2017-08-24T04:30:04.884+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your reply is sniped while you're writing it {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-08-24T04:44:20.362+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Auberaun","date":"2017-08-24T04:28:46.031+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends. We try to fit in as many test points as we can while giving everyone maximum value for what they're trying to test. For example, something like the Taliyah mana cost increases from last patch don't require too much input from the other mid laner to assess their impact, just like the LeBlanc Q damage reduction to minions (also from last patch), and so it's probably fine to put them against each other in the same test. On the other hand, when doing something like final balance tuning on Ornn, you don't want a whole lot of variables in the top lane, so you might want his opponent to play something standard. When that's the case, what champ the standard top laner will be is up to the tester unless Ornn requests a specific matchup. Meanwhile, having Leona buffs in the bot lane and Ornn in the top lane aren't likely to conflict with each other very much and so it's fine if they're in the same test.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beats29","date":"2017-08-23T23:55:25.598+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi guys hope you're doing fine.\n\nI just wondered after seeing last Leona changes, had you ever thought of letting Leona proc her passive on monsters? It would able her to play on another role, would give more game diversity, and even as support, would be able to gain more presence on drake fights.\n  \nI don't think it's healthy to let her proc on minions, due to the abuse in laning, specially after the damage buffs on last patch. However, it wouldn't be much abusable on jungle due the reduced timer to proc the passive on the same patch.\n  \nI don't play much Leo, but I think her combo pattern would be fun when jungling, and I would be whiling to try it as well. Also she's a beast when teamfighting, which goes along with the current tank jungle meta. Sure it can be a scary option, but I think it's worth of testing on PBE at least. But I don't think her clears would be an overbalance issue due her attack speed growth.\n\nSpeaking of attack speed, give Volibear a bit of love until he gets rework. It's sad some champions are let in the dumpster until the rework is completed. Increasing his attack speed to use Frenzy or even reducing it's W a bit would be a nice switch to give some attention at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Auberaun","date":"2017-08-24T23:16:20.362+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just my opinion on what would happen if we let Leona proc her passive on monsters (read: made her a viable jungler). I think that she would almost certainly be too oppressive. With the ability to operate outside of lanes and accumulate selfish tank items more quickly and easily than as a support, she would be running around the map ganking lanes and ulting from the fog of war while being able to farm. It would also be awkward when she ran into the enemy jungler, since she isn't able to proc her own passive on enemy champions. Right now as a support, she's confined to bot lane to an extent to generate gold and play with her ADC, and there's tradeoffs to her roaming around the map. If she could operate independently we'd probably have to make nerfs to compensate, which would then end up hurting her in the support position. At this point, you now have support Leona mains asking why their champion was nerfed to make room for a playstyle they didn't ask for, so I think keeping the status quo of Leona support is good. I think that in the past we've discouraged jungle Alistar (remember season 2?) and Blitzcrank for similar reasons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Glory to God","date":"2017-08-28T05:28:37.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Has there been any talk about {{champion:133}} ?\nI'm asking because i've been playing her a lot lately ane I don't recall losing lane, ever.

While she's performing well statistically in toplane, it's within expected ranges for a champion that's mostly played by dedicated mains. Anecdotally, as a Quinn player myself, I find she's strong at the moment but I don't think she's super out of line. While her laning phase is quite good in a lot of matchups, she loses lane to most tanks, and even when she wins lane hard she doesn't necessarily always have the tools to end the game with the advantage. \n\nThere's a good comparison here with Pantheon: Quinn is kind of like a worse Pantheon at the moment where she's picked to win lane and transition that advantage elsewhere, except Pantheon wins lane so much harder in almost all cases. Even if Pantheon gets some shifts out of his laning power (changes are likely coming in the next few patches for him), I think Quinn is in a significantly better spot in regards to balance - Quinn's reliability is just lower than Pantheon's from a kit perspective, which makes her less of a problem even with how strong the lethality build is.\n\nI'd be surprised if Quinn receives any changes in the near future.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-08-28T13:22:59.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Quinn's reliability is just lower than Pantheon's from a kit perspective, which makes her less of a problem even with how strong the lethality build is.\n\nIs lethality so strong ? i mean we are in tank meta since a few patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-08-28T16:24:46.947+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions that can abuse lethality are broadly much higher winrate than they were before the lethality changes in 7.14: Pantheon, Quinn, Jayce, Talon, Wukong, etc. Some of them (mostly Pantheon) are strong enough that they may need changes, although at the moment current thinking is that he's a lone outlier and the others can be left as they are. \n\nWhile I'd agree this is a tank-centric meta, tanks are pretty much present in every metagame no matter what it's oriented around. Tanks don't necessarily make lethality worse - in some ways they increase its value since the squishy targets on the enemy team have higher value to kill when you have tanks on your team. Lethality is probably better (or at the very least not worse) against Maokai-Kha'zix-Cassio-Trist-Kench than it is against Jax-Graves-Orianna-Lucian-Braum, for example, despite the fact that the first comp has two tanks and the second comp has one, because it's usually much higher value to assassinate one squishy against a double or triple tank comp than it is against a one or zero tank comp. Even if you can't necessarily 100-0 a squishy, the pressure onto the backline is also more relevant the more tanks the enemy team has.\n\nYou might notice that one of the things the lethality champions share almost universally is good target access, which is why they don't necessarily have to go through the front line (the tanks) to get to the back line and use their lethality stats to get a kill (or pressure that you will kill them if they position aggressively). With the exception of Jayce (who has other viable build paths to deal with tanks), every champion I listed here has strong flanking potential or very reliable backline access, which is why these champions are so strong with lethality and not other AD champions. \n\nLethality isn't as present in competitive play for a variety of reasons, but it is very strong in soloqueue. Even though the next patch is the Worlds patch, it doesn't mean we're not thinking about soloqueue as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-08-30T01:29:33.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think maybe Quinn, Talon and Pantheon share too many similarities? They all occupy this niche of \"roaming assassins\" who also have strong lane presence and target selection tools. I feel even though their kits have individual differences, strategically they might be sharing the same space, which seems like it could create scenarios where \"why pick Quinn or Talon when Pantheon can do their jobs better\".","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-09-01T21:11:03.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that they're too similar. They have some significant differences in execution even if they are strategically close - for example, Quinn has the lowest risk roams because it only costs mana (from ult), Talon typically burns walls to roam (medium cost), and Pantheon's roaming is tied to his ult cooldown (high cost). Just those differences in the roaming play pattern are a lot to differentiate them, even if they're looking to accomplish the same goal.\n\nThere are a lot of champions that share the same or very similar strategic space (e.g. Fiora and Camille) that don't cause issues because their play patterns are different enough that the strategic overlap doesn't cause a problem. The best example of this causing issues is the siege mages (Lux, Ziggs, Xerath, Vel'koz), especially before the many changes on those champions over time, where they were simply too similar in execution and in strategy, but I don't think Quinn/Talon/Pantheon are close enough to be problematic.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ddoA","date":"2017-08-24T07:24:42.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts about upcoming {{champion:107}} changes ?

Poppy's ultimate is probably her biggest selling point lategame, but her W is also quite strong against many champions and zoning enemy champions away from walls with E is a lot of \"invisible\" power, especially in competitive play. \n\nHer laning phase right now is pretty polarized - she bullies certain champions like Camille that rely on a telegraphed dash, but she gets bullied by a lot of other popular champions that can ignore her W like Maokai. \n\nAt the moment, Poppy is just a situational pick into certain champions or certain compositions where the effects of her W and/or her R are high-impact. She's not a \"generalist\" strong pick, so she's not seeing a lot of play - but I think if she's seeing a consistently high pickrate, especially in competitive play, she's either overtuned or the meta is oriented towards the types of champions that she counters. Poppy is definitely a champion with narrowly defined power, so the fact that she doesn't see a lot of play doesn't mean she's weak, I think it's more that she doesn't work great in most meta matchups right now and most popular types of teamcomps can deal with Poppy just fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M00ndanc3","date":"2017-08-24T20:42:23.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally whenever i play jg and i see a zac on the enemy team is when i choose poppy just to completely shut him down","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-08-24T01:23:12.091+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think Caitlyn may need some buffs right now?

In general, using armor/MR (or health, for that matter) as a scaling on damage abilities for tanks lets their ability damage be gated by normal tank itemization. It's an easier way to say \"this tank's damage is higher with more gold\" or \"at this item breakpoint this ability should do X extra damage\" without causing situations where tanks are encouraged to build damage items to have higher game impact when ahead, as that can be problematic. Not to say that there will never again be a tank that can build damage items, but that's not the style of a tank like Ornn (for example). It also allows for abilities to have a smoother damage curve throughout the game rather than scaling only with offensive itemization and levels - there are a lot of nice features to scaling damage off tank stats, although there are some tradeoffs as well, like allowing tanks to snowball harder even while building pure tank. All of that said, this is more of a design question than a playtest one, so I can't really say if it's something that will be more prominent in future tanks. \n\nAs far as Malphite goes, there has been a designer looking into doing short-term work on him that was on the PBE last cycle (mostly looking to put him in a better state against AD champions in and out of lane), as well as in playtests, but the designer ended up being unsatisfied with the iteration and pulled the changes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aaravos","date":"2017-08-24T09:05:09.892+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apparently Fizz's ultimate doesn't connect to cc immune target since 7.15, while previously it connected, but didn't apply it's cc effects.
