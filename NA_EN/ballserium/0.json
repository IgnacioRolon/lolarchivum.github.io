So the COMMUNITY that consists of GD gets rekt whenever cooties are involved but champion skin design has free reign? Kay.\nOn a side note mods I wouldn't put an interest in Vespas as \"having a rebel streak\". Riding a Vespa is like announcing you're into Barbie Dolls. Why not giant muscle cars or Japanese imports? Or if you're financially strapped for cash, a simple skateboard works just fine.","replies":[]}
