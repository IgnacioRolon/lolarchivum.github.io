No-one wants to be one.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":170,"down_votes":11,"body":"First, credit for this idea goes to Cynicatt. May all of those A+ games be proof that Riot needs to change things.\r\n\r\nOk, so, we&#039;ve all had that bomb-ass Taric or Karma or Lulu or Thresh take a team or just a single player that was about to be dominated and completely turn things around and pull through with everyone alive, or even a stack of team kills. And we all know that even tho the adc and the mage were pounding away, it was because of the actions of that support that the teamfight actually worked. And yet none of this HUGELY useful play is actually counted by Riot. It&#039;s just smooshed into the assists tab, which for all intents and purposes can be achieved by dealing literally 1 damage or healing an ally for 1 hp. And as a result the support can feel momentary satisfaction, but it doesn&#039;t last, and when the mastery grading comes out for the game, its lost in a haze of that 25/2/5 Zed getting an S+....again. And getting an A- when you should have easily gotten an S if the game counted these &quot;livesaver&quot; moments. Think of Overwatch when some random gets POTG because of that little &quot;lifesaver&quot; tag coming up when you kill an enemy about to kill an ally at 2 hp. Except its 4 people and u press R on taric.\r\n\r\nAnyway. The initial concept is this. Phantom Dancer currently has some sort of code or w/e that will keep a count of how many times you would have died had you not purchased it. And while its sorta off, this is still a super cool stat to have. I can&#039;t imagine its much more than simple math and &quot;Would their old hp be negative&quot; or w/e. SO. Why can&#039;t this same bit of code be applied every time someone gets shielded or healed right before they were about to die? And why can&rsquo;t people playing supports get a little buff icon of sorts, similar to how Cait, Jinx, and Vi interact, telling them how many people they&rsquo;ve saved? And why can&rsquo;t this little stat be included in the final mastery calculation?\r\nThe way I see it this solves three problems at once. \r\nOne: Playing support doesn&rsquo;t feel&hellip;rewarding, most of the time. It&rsquo;s like tagging along, working at half mast, not getting the full joy of playing and winning. Having even this small thing, and a big &ldquo;You saved everyone X times&rdquo; in your buffs bar would be a step towards fixing that.\r\nTwo: Riot have admitted that support scoring is up and down and they&rsquo;re trying to fix it so its more standardized. This tied into the above point because again, supports are usually sort of there in the game. And for most people this would be that little push that gets them those sweet S ranks for Mastery 6 and 7 (and maybe more in the future?)\r\n\r\nThree: Queue times. Everyone notices it. Everyone doesn&rsquo;t like it. Everyone knows that support is usually the last spot to fill. If you add incentives to play support more, then queue times for everyone drops. And this can be more than just a lifesaver medal. Let&rsquo;s say you get, idk, 150 Lives Saved. This would unlock for you a special ward that can&rsquo;t be bought, to show off your accomplishments. Again, the aim is to reduce queue times and make those playing support happier.\r\n\r\nFor those of you too lazy to read.\r\nTl;dr &ndash; Apply the &ldquo;Deaths avoided&rdquo; mechanic from Phantom Dancer to all supports to make the support role more enjoyable and make getting S&rsquo;s on them a bit better.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading if you read it all again.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-06-26T18:48:06.216+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact...

This usually ends with me having to turn and run in order to try and not die while my ADC promptly dies because they're now in range of the enemy laners. This whole situation could've been easily avoided if they had engaged with me rather than delaying until the fight was already lost.\n\nThe only tank support I can really play without having to worry about my ADC being incompetent is Braum because with Braum I am literally doing everything myself and I never need input or assistance from my ADC. If I'm playing someone like Blitz, Thresh, Leona, Malphite, Volibear, Tahm Kench, Taric, Nautilus, or J4, I have to have my ADC be on point and able to read and understand what I'm doing without me having to sit there and explain everything. A quick targeting ping should be all I need to convey the message of \"I'm going to do everything I can to kill them dead. You need to help me.\" but more often that not it isn't, and then frustration happens.\n\nWhen I play a mage support, on the other hand, I have a much more fulfilling gameplay experience. With champions like Xerath, Nidalee, Annie, and Vel'Koz I can constantly poke at the enemy laners and keep their health down to a minimum. With people like Soraka and Sona I can keep pumping my ADC with buffs and hope they live long enough. Plus, if I'm playing someone like Xerath, Annie, or Vel'Koz I could easily pick up the slack of my ADC by buying a few AP items, and since I put forth the time to build up a full page of scaling mana regen runes, past level 6 mana is no object and I can easily spam all day.\n\nBut every time I go and pick a more fun and more useful mage support, I'm harassed constantly into picking a tank support. When I *do* succumb to the whines of my team, I'm greeted with a boring and unrewarding game that usually ends in a loss with me carting around the most deaths on the team because nobody knows how to properly use a tank support, or a tank in general.\n\nI'm going to be bold, and say that this is why a lot of people don't play support, or don't play it a lot, and it's also why queue times are long: Supports want to be useful, but they require the ADC and the rest of the team to be on point, and when they aren't they want to bring along a support that can pick up the slack, but since everyone wants a particular type of support, they can't even play who they want to play, or play who they KNOW will be better.\n\nOh, and everyone still thinks it's season 2, so I'm the only one warding.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-06-26T18:39:52.656+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"you should learn utility supports like Janna or Lulu.

That usually is all that's needed to warrant a moment of my attention. :P I just like straight forward people, not silly tactics. \n\nSome of the ideas have merits. Anything calculating what supports already do in their role, sweeping wards, shielding, healing, cc-ing, etc, would be welcomed. For me at least it would be more for me to pinpoint my areas of weakness and where to improve upon. Getting a shiny chest or higher mastery is just a tasty bonus.\n\nI still think that adding in a reward will drag in less desirable types who will not take the role seriously. We've all been in the game where you can just **tell** who is not a support main. They're rude, unkind, and potentially even arrogant to both teams. While not always the case, it will drag in more of those types.

It's about getting that guy that's not the best Leona in the world but had some good games to pursue that ability with that champion, rather than deciding not to play it because it can be a singularly unrewarding experience.\n\nI'm also really tired of seeing support mains say \"well I have no problems getting S rank\" (from your post above) - I am a support main and yes, I do get S ranks fairly regularly. And I also have games where I go 1/2/30 and get an A- because I died 1 more times than I killed someone. I shouldn't have to avoid death like crazy or steal kills to get an S rank - it should be based on how I play my game, and KDA is a really poor indicator of that, especially since assists basically count for nothing at the moment (I've had games with 0/0/20 or 0/0/25 scores and gotten B+ and lower for them cause I didn't get any kills... on Soraka.)\n\nIf nothing else, the system needs to take into account what champion you're playing. I know that it's not a hard this many kills/assists/deaths equals an S rank, but seeing a Zed or Fiora with 5-6-7 deaths getting an S while I have 1-2 with 30 assists and get a B or A is pretty frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Utility Backline","date":"2016-06-27T03:18:39.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sheldonbunny,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tAbjAvE4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-26T16:24:47.820+0000)\n>\n> Misleading title drenched in hyperbole because while rarer than other roles, support mains do exist, making your declaration that &quot;no one&quot; wants to false. \n> \n> Besides your obvious click bait attempts, your idea is one of many others have already suggested.

Why did you main a role to begin with? Because the role fit the way you wanted to play a MOBA. Even if the rewards exist and unique labels are given to each role based on their skill. It won't change the overall job each role does. If you do not want to sacrifice gold, xp, strong hard hitting items and kits, then you don't want to support (vice versa). I play MOBAs with one objective in mind. Save ally. This game and all MOBAs are about ego stroking that ePeen to the max. Like sex, everyone have different ways to get their rocks off. If you need penta's then assassins/aoe mages/marksman are for you, but they are not for me. That clutch save gives me the same feeling as the guy who wants a penta. The rewards are meaningless. In fact I feel the very personality of a support is one who does not seek an announcer telling him about his sick \"penta save\" the very nature of supports are these humbler players who love saving someone who overjoyously tells them how amazing they are. The amount of times my last shield or raka ult saved a player who then proclaims in all chat \"BEST SUPPORT EVER HOLY FUCK\" is equal to the penta kill announcement.

When you're playing, you have to resign yourself to the fact that most, if not all, of your final tier items are going to be 2400-2600 gold buys with very little in the way of stats.

You don't know how many times I could've killed the enemy was I a top/jungler (I play primarily tank supports), but since I'm a support I can't because I have to work around incredibly low gold income and exp so I will always be underlevelled and will never have items that are on par with others. Also I get no rewards for doing 90% of the job in every fight, for blocking the whole enemy team while my team takes baron/dragon and for literally everything I do.\nWhat I dislike about it the most though is sightstone: it's the worst designed item of the game, and I'm not talking about it being useless, on the contrary, but the fact that it's so unrewarding and so inefficient as a buy (most times if you buy a sightstone before upgrading the support item you will not receive ANYTHING other than 3 wards since the hp is so low, while the enemy adc will probably be back with more damage you won't be able to tank) that only the support role is forced to build it since it's cheap and no one wants it.\nQuite a while ago I suggested an idea for a top/jungle (if you don't want to get green upgrade) sightstone item, which would be awesome for supports too since sometimes you just want to get that early damage and then go tanky, but since there are no valid options to do so (since they cost way too much and by the time you managed to finishthem you would be way too much behind to make actual use of them) you just have to go full tank and hope you will be able to buy a sunfire/iceborn (which is extremely rare ince they cost a lot for a support).\n\nSo tl;dr the support role is too abused not only by teammates but by the game itself, they're constantly behind, have to work around a gold income so low that theyr items will always be subpar and are forced to buy an item that gives them no actual stats even when fully upgraded so they will always be an item short.","replies":[{"poster":"RobinRobout","date":"2016-06-28T12:30:41.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one thing that keeps me sane as a support is the moments where I can 1 v 1 the enemy ADC.

Become a bunch of elitist hipsters that think the support role is too sophisticated for the common folks is not an option for Riot if they want to solve the issue with queue times.

I in no way endorse elitism in any role, especially support. I think most who main the role would love a steady flow of new players, but not ones only looking for glorified epeen. When I say it takes a certain type of person, that's not me attempting a hipster attitude. As others have stated, it's the people who get that thrill/drive to save and protect their team.  I enjoy the ranking system, the chests, the mastery badges, but take *all* of that away and i'll still be maining support. Why? Because it's just in me to want to protect people.
