Sure, there are some match ups which aren't too easy for Wukong, but saying that you \"literally can't lane him anywhere\" is a bit of a stretch.","replies":[{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-02-08T14:37:27.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Condottiero,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WpEMtJVI,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-02-08T01:50:19.733+0000)\n>\n> I do just fine as Wukong top and mid most of the time.
