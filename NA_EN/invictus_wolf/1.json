Did you report them in the post-game lobby as well? That's always a good move if they were toxic in-game to you or others in the game.\n\nI'd recommend not accepting invites from players who were toxic in the previous match, as they are unlikely to suddenly turn a new leaf. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
