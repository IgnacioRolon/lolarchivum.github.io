They do not respect the jungle&#039;s legally-binding contracts and instead treat the river as a public utility while actively working to thieve the spoils of our hardworking champions. Just the other day, I was tending to my honeyfruit as per the legal agreement I had reached with my jungler - when a scuttle crab revealed itself, seeking to violate the non-aggression principle. I had yet to return to the local merchant to purchase a sunfire cape through rightful capitalistic means, and this scuttle crab&#039;s sole intention was to harm my lawful possessions. I took action and physically removed the perpetrator.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/cS6JU3t\n\nReminder to report criminal scuttles to your local jungler or communist removal agent wherever you may see them. Do not allow scuttle crabs to forcibly interfere with any individual&#039;s private property, physically remove them if necessary. Scuttles are frequently found in violation of the NAP, and do not receive the legal protections akin to that of other jungle inhabitants due to their recurrent, systematic breaches of Rift principles.","replies":[]}
