Of course you have to go through some effort to obtain BE to earn it. Or, you can purchase RP and pay for it.\n\nWith this freely obtainable skin, you don't even have to put nearly as much effort to obtain them, but you still have to put some effort to do so. If you don't feel like going through that minimal effort, you have the option to purchase it.\n\nIf you think about all the things that are freely obtainable one way or another that is also being sold, the list goes on and on, and when put to extremes, you can argue almost anything to be freely obtainable in one sense or another. There's always something being spent though, whether it's time, putting in some effort, or money. If someone decided to do some research before they purchased the bundle, learned about the free skin, and went about obtaining it, more power to them. It's not like it's a huge secret that there are a few freely obtainable skins. It's pretty much the top few pages of results when looked up. If they decided they just wanted it and were willing to pay for it, that's their choice.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I believe I purchased this skin during a sale, or possibly rolled it out of a chest. Personally, I didn't care to check whether or not it was free, and later realizing it was freely obtainable, now, it makes no difference to me. I happily redeemed the Riot Girl Tristana and Unchained Alistar skins for free, but those weren't purchasable. I probably would have paid for those too without so much as a second thought to check if it was free had they been available.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-19T02:58:22.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it is now free, it was also purchasable before being made freely obtainable. I believe now you're able to do either - purchase it, or obtain it for free. If you plan on getting that bundle and don't already own it, I would suggest redeeming him or requesting the skin for free if the link doesn't work, as I do not know how he would affect the bundle price. If there's a chance you can get a better discount, you might as well put the effort to getting it!","replies":[]}]}
