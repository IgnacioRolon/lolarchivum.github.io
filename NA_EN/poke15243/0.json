I can't see 0/9/11 in your match history, so I assume you are playing on a different account, or you are bored and complaining about something a couple of games back.\n\n0/9/11 in 21 minutes? Um... I think he is upset at you because you weren't actually supporting him. \"Suppport.\" The role name speaks for itself. You \"support\", or help, the ADC. When I see scores like 0/9/11 or something similar (like 0/7/8, 0/9/12, 1/12/15), I tend to assume you were not actually supporting. Now of course there is a possibility your ADC kept getting caught out, but 9 deaths in 21 minutes? You had to die 9 times to pick up 11 assists? As a support, you are supposed to help the ADC, not run headlong, die, and then pick up an assist. Also 0/9/11 is not a positive support score. It is a KDA over 1, but IMO, KDA = K - D + .5A. \n\nSo 0 - 9 + .5 x 11\n-9 + 5.5\num.... -3.5 score.","replies":[{"poster":"Poke15243","date":"2015-06-24T00:22:30.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dumb Monster,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zOuAFuHR,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-06-24T00:10:44.154+0000)\n>\n> Dude, chill with the caps.

That's dumb.\n\nAs a support, gameplay is what really matters, not score. In general, you never want to measure by KDA scoring or anything like that. It's what's **behind**the numbers that matter. However, you did not provide many details on how the game actually went. You just told us about your raging adc and your 0/9/11 score. \n\n0/8/15\n\n8 deaths: How did you get 8 deaths? Did you save your teammates 7 times? How long did the game last? Did you die too many times in lane?\n15 assists: Did you just heal your 95% health teammate as he was getting a kill? Or were you {{champion:25}} snaring an enemy to secure a kill for the team? \n\nNow again, 0/9/11 in 21 minutes? 9 deaths in 21 minutes with only 11 assists. That makes me think you just ran headlong, die, and then pick up 1 or 2 assists after.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-06-24T00:17:44.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"9 deaths is unacceptable, especially if you only had 11 assists.

But it's not the best way. There is no difference between being 15/8/0 and 0/8/15. A KDA of 4 could be you going 0/1/4 because you were J4 tossing a couple of flags near teammates, then going AFK at 0/1/4. Or it could be you carrying the match going 33/9/3.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-06-24T00:10:50.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Poke12345,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zOuAFuHR,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-24T00:03:24.507+0000)\n>\n> SO I WAS PLAYING SUPPORT AND THIS ADC (DRAVEN I THINK) GETS MAD AND SAYS OMG NOOB U 0/9 FEEDER GO UNINSTALL.
