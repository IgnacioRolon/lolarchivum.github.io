Once I finally get through log in screen -sometimes gives me the error there- I get disconnected and cant navigate the launcher, nor will anything load like my mastery with champions. I played just fine on 12-26-16, and have not changed any of my settings. So I'm unsure even to where to start.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T03:44:23.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different servers and services (the sites you listed) reside in different geolocations, therefore you may encounter routing issues to one server, but not another. Before we take a close look at your network routing, we'll first need to ensure your local settings are not incompatible with League, so I encourage you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet me know if this fixed your issue or not.","replies":[{"poster":"ÉrÉbos","date":"2017-01-04T22:38:59.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got done reinstalling league, and did the direct porting and firewall allowing.

Your network routing then sees a huge spike in packet loss at 77% on the **76.213.0.40** hop and a peak latency of 1556ms along your entire route.
