In the case of sweepers, I don&#039;t believe it is fair that a 0 gold level 1 item should completely ruin the experience. Red trinket interactions with every other hidden trap are completely different, with Teemo shrooms it reveals them but you can still walk on them and take damage and the slow, same with Nidalee traps. When it comes to Shaco the damage is not what is important but the fear is, on offensive and defensive. I believe red trinket should reveal his boxes and remove the vision but not activate the fear similar to how shrooms react when spotted by the red trinket. Pink wards and duskblade can remain the same for the reason that gold has to be spent accordingly to have their passives. It&#039;s just not fair that a 0 gold item will completely counter Shaco both with the deactivation of his boxes including ult, and his one escape Q which shows which direction he went. My two solutions are making red trinket a level 9 item again so at least there is some wiggle room or adjusting it so the fear is still active but it shows the location of the boxes and removes the vision given by boxes this allows for ranged champions to still remove boxes, but give Shaco some utility and escapability. There are 3 items in the game that actively remove his fear and one is completely free at lvl 1 so if your a shaco that&#039;s doing well all they have to do is build sweepers get pinks and have a duskbaled and shaco whole kit is completely useless including half of the ult who places 3 boxes and almost never procs fear due to one of the aforementioned items.","replies":[{"poster":"Famix","date":"2018-12-02T04:34:11.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who plays AP shaco and has to rely on them not buying that, I agree immensely. Just have duskblade and control wards reveal them, that way theres either some counterplay or not every champion can get one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-30T23:46:45.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shaco is in a pretty good state with Dark Harvest. Also other champions Teemo for example are countered by the same item.

That said, I wouldn't say no to making it a level 9 item again. Being able to drop it at level 1 basically negates 80% of his ganking usefulness.","replies":[{"poster":"ZaColombian","date":"2018-11-30T23:31:24.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree the only issue I have is red trinket activating his boxes, and I feel like it should only reveal it no activate them.
