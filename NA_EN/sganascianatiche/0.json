Yeah, I never played the jungle so I thought I was going to have fun in a role that is \"new\" to me (even if I'm been playing for 2 years now).\nI played with friends, tried Warwick, Sejuani, Xin Zhao and a bunch of other champions. I felt like I was getting better and I choose Sejuani as jungler for a blind pick in normals. I've played my match, trying my best, and in early game we were ahead of 2-3 kills.\nI left all the kills to the midlaner (Karthus) and to the toplaner (lulu). Something apparently went wrong when, while I was ganking top and assuring the kill for lulu, my adc (vayne) got killed for the first time by the enemy adc, Sivir. Our support (Nautilus) started complaining while standing still in base and actually gave up when I didn't succeed in stealing a dragon.\n\"omg sej first time sure\", \"go back in bronze V\", \"pls play tetris\", \"delete lol\" and everything you always find in a blind pick. We had basically the same score (0/5/15 me, he was 0/5/12) and started spamming the surrender vote without actually doing anything neither in teamfights nor in lane. I lost the match and felt like... I didn't have fun, and I even got a report for myself: \"negative attitude\", for some reason.\nNow, I no more want to play jungle, and you can guess why. \nSo now I'm addressing all the ones who mostly join normals:\nPlease, be nice. You're not losing anything, you're just having fun with people you don't know, but that's the point of a videogame, am I right?\nRuining the experience for everyone else doesn't make you the best player: it only makes you a rager.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-04-22T01:54:52.516+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people in this game have no clue about social standards. You can only guess the reasons but you shouldn't feel bothered by it. If you can't just ignore their childish comments you have the option to mute these guys. At the end of the day you should focus on yourself and not get demotivated to play a role again because your teammates try to cover their own bad play by putting the blame on you. You shouldn't care less about them, if it makes them feel better let them be childish and keep on playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitty Darkstar","date":"2015-04-22T08:42:05.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people try to cover their own bad play by putting the blame on others....\n\n\nBut when my team loses a game, I usually say \"My bad\"","replies":[{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-04-22T23:01:23.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is only human nature to try to hide our own insecurities by redirecting attention towards others, even if they aren't necessarily doing a bad job.  Entry-level jobs and unhealthy relationships are notorious for this type of conduct.

I used to talk more ingame and be nice to everyone, now I mostly just ping when I want to do something and mute someone after the second line of garbage they say.  If what you have to say isn't constructive at all and completely rude, just keep it to yourself and play the game.  This is probably the biggest reason I haven't solo queued for a game outside of bots for win of the day in years.

I understand that: it will be hard for me to play Blitzcrank again. I am, not by choice, a support main because I was stuck in that role before teambuilder. I have other supports that I can play pretty well like be god as Thresh. ^^ But I am scare too now playing Blitzcrank again. It's the same after an horrible game as Bard. That game I just didn't want to play anymore because of all  the hate.\n\nI know we should just do it and don't think about those we encounters on these bad games.
