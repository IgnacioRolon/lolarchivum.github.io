If it was just an indicator for Azir like a little sun disk icon over the soldiers that slowly vanished over time in a clock like fashion I would be ok with that just to help some of the newer people pick him up but at the same time I like that he's not too popular cuz I love to play him and love not having to compete in lobby for him lol","replies":[{"poster":"KICK OUT AT 2","date":"2014-10-08T00:49:16.531+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"So just make it so only azir can see the time bar, like Udyr's stun refresh timer and Nautilus root refresh timer.

I have difficulty noticing if my soldiers are near enough to attack (they change their stance) and when soldiers are about to time out (they start to crumble). \n\nIt might partly be because the soldiers themselves do not stand out enough on the live version of summoners rift or because there are a lot of other things that you also have to pay attention to; but since the soldiers are so integral to his kit, I think that everything about them should be VERY obvious at least to the Azir player.

Also just for usefulness sake can we please make it so you can fling a soldier right up until it is about to expire and have it still arrive at its location then immediately melt?

The soldiers start to deteriorate and their AA circles slowly fade away. Plenty of indication for Azir he doesn't need more to help the enemy team abuse him. The ult \"bug-fixes\" really nerfed him hard. He doesn't need people able to see his soldiers timers.\n\nPlus he got little to no compensation for said bug fixes. Bouncing somebody multiple times is a huge part of his kit and he's still sub-40%. Now I want to say about 5%-8% of that WR is due to noobs playing him. That will put him at a 40-45% WR. \n\nPinning people to walls is a huge design over look not a bug. And half the time it didn't even pin people. It would bounce them on the same soldier over and over again until they gained enough speed to break onto the other side of the wall (takes about .5s in most scenarios that I've seen). That would apply damage one time (each soldier was applying damage up to 1 time per soldier). Taking away damage on multiple hits with the wall was probably the dumb part. So someone jumps into my wall like an idiot after I put it up and doesn't get damaged for it? Why would you take that away? Especially when the wall is notorious for not pushing people away a good 25% of the time. \n\nI can go on and on about all the meaningful bugs to Azir's kit all day but Riot addresses some of the most frequent but least harmful ones. You know how annoying it is using an ult to shove an ulting Nasus away just to have him stand there like \"nice wall imma Q stack you now\"?
