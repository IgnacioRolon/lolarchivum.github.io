I&#039;m not sure where these skins will be priced (Either 975 or 1350) but my main question was how much do skins get discounted for? Is it discounted by one tier (I noticed the recent releases of Demon Vi and Spiritfire Brand were around 975 or something)? Do these discounts only apply for 1350 skins and legendary skins that are released, or are they also applied to lower priced skins? I know they still release budget cost skins like the Warden and Marauder lines, but I have no idea how the sales work.\n\nEDIT: I mean the temporary discounts on release, that encourage people to buy the skins after they are released.\n\nEither way, thanks, and I&#039;m super hyped up about the new skins. They look cool!\n{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}
