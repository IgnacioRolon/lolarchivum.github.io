I am here to talk about {{champion:127}} &#039;s ultimate. When cast it on yourself, it acts as {{item:3157}} &#039;s active : she becomes invulnerable and untargetable for 2.5s, but is unable to take any action. Yet, there is something different from how  {{item:3157}}&#039;s active works. \r\n\r\nIndeed, when you&#039;re in stasis, the last command you will cast will be instantly executed as soon as the stasis effect ends. Meaning you can flash during  {{item:3157}}, and you will flash right when the effect ends. However, {{champion:127}}&#039;s ultimate, yet being a stasis, doesn&#039;t work like this : there won&#039;t be anything done at the end of the stasis effect. \r\n\r\nI know this can seem very little, but I do think it should be added, for the sake of consistency, and cause this is a little buff to {{champion:127}} . It shouldn&#039;t be hard to add anyway, as it already exists.\r\n\r\nthanks!{{sticker:garen-swing}} \r\n\r\n(Can&#039;t wait for her new passive to be out by the way)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-09-17T16:57:38.237+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gave this a look now that it's Monday and I'm in the office. Saw this over the weekend and was a bit surprised to see a difference described, given the starting point for Liss R was just to copy/paste the Zhonya's logic. Figured something might have changed over time though.\n\nWhat I found testing this out was:\n\n* Both Liss R and Zhonya's will buffer movement commands regardless of when during the stasis effect they're entered.\n* Neither seems to buffer Flash at all, if you're able to do so with Zhonya's let me know how, I'm not seeing it.\n* Liss R will let you buffer Q and W, but only if you cast it right before the R wears off. E can't be buffered\n* Zhonya's will let you buffer Q, W and E, provided you cast them at least (roughly) halfway through the Zhonya's duration.\n* Liss R will let you buffer Zhonya's, with a pretty generous cast window (second half of the duration again?)\n* Zhonya's will not let you buffer Liss R at all on Liss herself (didn't test on enemy cast)\n\nNow, that's the result of 10 minutes testing things out, so won't necessarily be fully comprehensive. If you're seeing different results in practice tool, would love to hear about it (I'm just using an internal environment with no CDs for this, which should be the same, but is very occasionally different). \n\nIn terms of possible steps forward here, when time permits I'll do some poking around, see if I can identify what's causing the inconsistencies here. Might be possible to get some of the buffering cases that aren't working in both cases at present to work and ship those changes with the other upcoming Lissandra stuff. Can't make any specific promises though at present.\n\nETA on the changes is sometime this year. Main issue recently was that the visual effects for the passive were reading as too similar to the ult, leading to confusion over whether her R was on CD or not. That seems mainly fixed with recent iterations, so next step will be looking at skin effects. \n\nOnly slightly related, but since I'm talking about Lissandra anyway, will also have some slight tweaks to her AAs in that package as well. Speeding them up slightly and making the animation better synced with when you'd expect it to launch the missile, which should also make things feel better even if it doesn't technically change gameplay (makes it easier to read/feel more natural).","replies":[{"poster":"0 Hogapu","date":"2018-09-17T17:28:03.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it is really strange. I have been using Katarina and Zhonya 1 month ago, and I swear Flash would always be buffered while in stasis. And now I try it, it doesn't work anymore... I am really surprised about it. Could it possibly change over the patch ..? I don't think this is specific to Lissandra.\n\nStill strange that her R doesn't work exactly the way Zhonya does, if it is the same code. Might be a bug over there.. \n\n* Her R never buffers Q, W, E nor Zhonya to me... (on practice tool)\n\n* Zhonya buffers Q, W and E, but not her R. \n\nEDIT : Her spells are being blocked by a red X when she uses Zhonya, but are only getting shadowed when using R. It shows it isn't working the same way, and doesn't count as the same effect.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the feedback and the good news on the work going on for her.
