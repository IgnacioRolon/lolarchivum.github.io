This went on, tried to disconnect/reconnect about 2-3 times before it was fixed and then my game began crashing in between 40 seconds to a minute of being connected.\r\n\r\nAfter a while it seemed to stabilize, also I usually get around 87-93ms during a match but my ping was frozen at 103ms every time on connecting.  FPS was always 100+.\r\n\r\nInternet was working fine throughout the game, no problems connecting to any other services.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\ni7-4790\r\n8gb RAM\r\nGeForce GTX 760","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T17:11:35.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Delays like that could be caused by packet loss, but it shouldn't be crashing your game.  To specify though, what do you mean by crash?  Are you getting a bugsplat error?  Also, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for an overview to see what exactly what's going on.

The log reader came up with varying amounts of packet loss for every log.  The log reader wouldn't accept some of them but here are the ones it did accept.  \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/BEMyR\n\nAs for the crashing, no bugsplat, the game would just close very quickly and the client would be there with the reconnect button.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T20:25:13.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow-up and details.  It looks like you've got some pretty big connection issues reaching the game server, ranging from instability to simply getting kicked off.  You should start off with the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tighten up your connection and help rule out possibilities.
