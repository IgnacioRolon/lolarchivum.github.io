It seems like that message you were getting before might have been a corruption message and not a connection error. Since this is the case, your best bet would be to let the client fully repair itself instead of stopping it midway. Once you let it finish, you should then have a stable game installation and should be able to play again. \n\nI don't want you to get any more low priority queues, so let's be sure to test these changes in custom games to be sure everything is in order before trying pvp matches again!","replies":[{"poster":"NiNiO McTavich","date":"2017-04-04T04:14:25.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes bro, everytime time i let it finish the repair and still get the bug, and everytime i test it on a custom game, and lets say i play  2 games or 3 normaly, and than i still get the bug, without even restarting the client, sometimes it happen in the middel of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-04T04:20:28.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whelp, that's no good....\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nSince this issue is a little out of my range of knowledge, your best bet would be to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can get some more in depth help!","replies":[{"poster":"NiNiO McTavich","date":"2017-04-04T12:41:11.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay, ty so much bro, u da best. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
