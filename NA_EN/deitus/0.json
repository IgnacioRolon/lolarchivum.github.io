WIth that in consideration All 3 of the games contributed to my PERMANENT ban first one I cannot say it wasnt deserved. But in these 2 I sure as hell did not deserve it. _**Which means i wouldnt have gotten a permanent ban if i didnt get reported in the last 2 games**_.Clarification of the thing i said to Sion ( He was the enemy toplaner with a girly name like Kawaii Girl , to which i said  \"_20$ that sion is a 350 pound male that lives in his parents basement_\" which wasnt in a hurtfull maner. FOR COMEDIC PURPOSES ONLY, and ty everyone who took their time to reply and discuss this topic even if it isnt so interesting","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2018-11-13T16:28:19.388+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have game 2 and 3, where is game 1?","replies":[{"poster":"Deitus","date":"2018-11-18T23:18:46.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I admit game 1 was kind of negative basically was spamming to ff because i obviously knew i deserved a report for that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jezter King","date":"2018-11-13T16:19:46.726+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Deitus: 20$ that sion is a 350 pound male that lives in his parents basement\"\n\n\"Deitus: fucking pussies\"\n\n\"Deitus: report nocturne\"\n\n\"Deitus: but hey nocturne said kys just report him hell get a insta ban\"\n\nAll of the above quotes are reportable offenses in the eye of Riot.

Calling someone a 350 pound male living in their parent's basement is neither of these. \n\n I seriously doubt you went from a 10-game chat restriction to a permaban off this game, even with you saying 'kys'. You deserved a punishment because you were insanely toxic all throughout the game and most players wouldn't want you on their team. You most likely had a 7-day or 14-day ban beforehand, and this punishment escalated that to permanent.\n\n If that wasn't the case, you simply didn't have to repeat 'kys' in chat. You should also have been aware of the fact that 9 reports weigh the same as 1 report. You reporting Nocturne for hate speech is enough, you don't need to get the entire game against him for a punishment to occur. One and done, that's all it takes.\n\n If Twitch streamers have said worse with evidence then that's messed up. I haven't seen any streamer or content creators do this, so I can't speak on the matter. Even so, that's not justification for you to be toxic in game, because other people are doing it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SonicAF","date":"2018-11-13T18:11:51.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"High chance that he got picked up b y ifs for \n\nDeitus: but hey nocturne said kys just report him hell get a insta ban\n\nAnd he wouldn't receive a punishment if he didn't parrot the word.
