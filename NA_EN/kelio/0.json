Will this affect my elo when i do placements when season 7 starts or no?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T04:44:33.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is simply a display bug, since it's the preseason and you're unable to play Solo/Duo queue until it launches later down the road. This will not affect your LP or ranked standing.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Spi√ßy","date":"2016-11-18T01:46:41.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this answer, I'm not really the person asking the question above, but could you explain how gaining rank during the preseason help coming into season 7, how \"much\" does it influence if that makes sense. Thanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-20T22:52:47.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your placing and climb during the preseason only *slightly impacts* your eventual 2017 Season standing, but I'd imagine your performance in your placement matches will play a larger role than anything.\n\nI hope that helps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
