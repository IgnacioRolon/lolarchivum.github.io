I said it.\r\nHalf of the games are over in champ select, it&#039;s nearly impossible to play on patchy internet or on lower-end computers, and there is a fundamental disconnect in whether or not it is meant to be silly or just fast-paced (half of people are playing to do goofy things with low cooldowns, the other are trying to abuse things that are broken by having low cooldowns) \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a neat idea, but poorly implemented.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy it, that&#039;s understandable.  I don&#039;t, and would like to see some different gamemodes getting as much attention as URF.","replies":[]}
