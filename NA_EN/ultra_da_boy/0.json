I&#039;ve played for a little over 3 1/2 years. Over this past year, I was actually accepted into Robert Morris University in Chicago, and I received the League of Legends scholarship to play on one of their teams.\r\n\r\nNow, I understand the premise of playing for fun, trying to enjoy the game and relaxing while playing, I understand that. But with my understanding, I also expect equal reciprocation of respect for the people that take the game a lot more seriously than others do. This isn&#039;t just a joke anymore. People LIVE off this game, and it is a very real job, and a very real thing in the present times. \r\n\r\nWith being accepted into the college, I also received one of the scholarships for playing on the team. I am currently Platinum 3.\r\n\r\nBut there&#039;s the thing, Platinum 3.\r\n\r\nClimbing is hard man, and not in the good way. And you can say it&#039;s because I&#039;m bad, and you can tell me I need to work on my mechanics and not pay attention to my teammates, but what do I do when that&#039;s not enough? \r\n\r\nI try, man. I really, really try. All I want to do is win, and get better, and prosper. That&#039;s all I&#039;m trying to do. But how am I supposed to climb if no one gives a shit? And why do I have to get punished with people that don&#039;t give a shit. I&#039;ve had countless AFKs, countless feeders, COUNTLESS people that just **_DO. NOT. CARE. _** \r\n\r\nAnd that&#039;s not fair, man.\r\n\r\nNow people are saying, oh well they&#039;re just your feelings, right? No, this isn&#039;t just my feelings.\r\n\r\nI can forward my scholarship amount greatly, just by breaking diamond, but I can&#039;t do that on my own. When I can only, at most, influence a game by 20%, while the other 80% runs rampant, there&#039;s only so much I can do. If you want to put it in a literal point of view, every day, 80% of the people i play with are the deciding factors of how much money my family has to pay for me to go to college, and where I end up. That&#039;s a pathetic argument though, it&#039;s cheap, and I&#039;m not going to legitimately ever say that. **It&#039;s not _fair_ for me to say that.**\r\n\r\nI&#039;m trying riot. And this isn&#039;t a demand, this isn&#039;t a rage post, this is me, pleading with you. Please do something about Solo Queue. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a problem when getting into my promos causes my stomach to literally knot up, and make me feel sick, just because I know how great the chance is that I&#039;m going to be paired with people who couldn&#039;t care less if I jumped off a bridge and died, let alone people who want to win this Solo Q game, and I&#039;m just going to have to start from square 1 all over again. All my work and stress, for absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot, something has to be done about the match making system. I believe in your company. I really do. You have the most played game in the WORLD. THE WORLD. That&#039;s incredible. How many of you thought you were going to be working for THE most played game of our lifetime? No one could have predicted that.\r\n\r\nBut you have the tools to fix this. I&#039;m watching players drop left and right from this game, just because of how much they can&#039;t stand playing ranked. Sooner or later, if this problem isn&#039;t addressed, you&#039;re going to find yourselves in a deep pit.\r\n\r\nNow, I&#039;m all for eSports. I mean, that&#039;s technically the drive behind why i would even write this post. I love it. But Riot seriously needs to  at least try to focus some of that eSports energy towards Solo Queue, and the game&#039;s ranking system. There&#039;s a seriously problem within it  and until that problem is addressed, this game will continue to lose players, and revenue. \r\n\r\n_** I want to be a pro.**_ From the moment I saw Str8 Rippin win the 2008 MLG Championships for Halo 3, I knew right then I wanted to be a pro gamer. And I know I can do it, too. I have the drive and the passion and I have striven for nothing more than to be on that main stage for almost 7 years now. I don&#039;t have much else. I&#039;m not tall or muscular, I can&#039;t jump high, I&#039;m not even that great at school. But I am great at games, especially this one, and I know I am, and I _**know**_ I can make it.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is, every day when I try to further myself and achieve that goal, I&#039;m only responsible for 20% of it. 40% if I support, maybe. Even then, might as well be a 0% chance. And that beats down on players every day. Knowing whether or not they try their best, whether or not they care, whether or not they&#039;re polite to people, it&#039;s going to get thrown right back in their face by some (excuse my language) fucking jagoff who is only worried about his own agenda, and ruining yours. \r\n\r\nAnd that&#039;s **toxic.**","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2015-07-28T20:13:24.816+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":5,"body":"The amount of ranked games I have lost because of an AFK for someone who intentionally throws the game, etc, is so high its stupid.\n\nI would say near 40% of lost ranked games are due to someone going afk.

I feel like I've been cheated out of so many wins that solo queue is more-so just rolling a dice to see if your team is going to feed all game or be half decent. Currently I'm Silver, but to be honest, from spectating and playing face-to-face with Silver players, it feels like I have to single handedly carry all of my games, or just lose them all and it feels like playing in low elo is much harder than playing in higher elo, because if I don't get fed, then the game is immediately over with the enemy Katarina some how going 20-0 within the first 10 minutes of the game and everyone on my team saying \"gg kat op\" or blaming each other, or just simply not caring at all.\n\nI don't like how feeders or people who don't care negatively effect me, I don't like how AFK'ers negatively effect me, and I don't like how trolls negatively effect me. I can go 10-0 and literally 1v3 and get a triple at 4 minutes into the game (this has actually happened) but because my team does nothing but feed, rage at each other, and mess around, I still lose and despite me playing very well for the most part, it doesn't matter at all because at the end of the day wins dictate much more than your performance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"steampig","date":"2015-07-29T03:46:13.358+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MarkedOfKane,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bEbdJ2dI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-28T20:13:24.816+0000)\n>\n> The amount of ranked games I have lost because of an AFK for someone who intentionally throws the game, etc, is so high its stupid.\n> \n> I would say near 40% of lost ranked games are due to someone going afk.

In an evenly matched game, just 1 person AFK or not playing seriously can throw the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-07-30T17:16:42.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*The Count Playing Solo Queue LoL*\n(The Count from Sesame Street Voice): One AFK hahahah Two AFKs hahaha\nTHREE afks hahaha","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Whoregy","date":"2015-07-28T20:29:47.376+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree i believe Solo que is asinine i'm tired of trolls and feeders","replies":[{"poster":"Joquan","date":"2015-07-29T15:28:35.557+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Trolls and feeders are frequently less common than people think.","replies":[{"poster":"JAGMAG","date":"2015-07-29T16:33:28.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"depends what you mean by a troll\n\nfor example we had a daruis jungle that's pretty troll to start but then the other team gets baron so he decides to clear red side raptors...of course he gets caught stands there and dies to me that's trolling  \n\nanother example is the same game jinx decides hey they have baron and are taking an inhib great time for me to get the t1 bot tower so she just split pushes letting them take our tower inhib and then nexus so she could get the t1 bot...i also consider that trolling\n\n\nstuff like that happens almost every game if your ahead dose not matter to much if your behind its pretty much gg ","replies":[{"poster":"Joquan","date":"2015-07-29T18:06:57.633+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"that's not trolling, that's one of the downside to being in low elo: your teammates are very, very, dumb.\nTheres nothing you can do to fix that except duo Q or being better than your enemies.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"cloudbreaker99","date":"2015-07-29T00:49:27.511+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":26,"body":"You want to become LCS material.\nYou're Plat 3.\nIf people can climb with this system, you can too, stop making excuses.\n\nEDIT: Keep the downvotes coming goldies, someday you'll learn that hard work gives results, not shameless whining.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicalGirlRosel","date":"2015-07-29T01:21:03.327+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, don't laugh, but I came here from competitive Super Smash Bros. I can tell you that one of the big differences between the Smash community and the League community is that the Smash community has a much better \"can-do\" attitude. Everyone makes an attempt at recovering, no matter how futile, and there's a lot less whining about \"OP\" characters and tactics. This has made it pretty difficult for me to adjust to League of Legends, especially as a person who believes very strongly in not giving up, and finds it frustrating when a teammate says \"GG\" when we're six kills down.\n\nThe thing is that in Super Smash Bros, it's all you. If you lose your match, it's on you, and if you win, it's on you. Even if the matchup was bad, that's on you for your character choice. You don't have anyone or anything else to blame, and if you have the passion, you have the potential. In fact, there's slang for it: No Johns. It means no excuses.\n\nIn League, that doesn't happen. You can lose a game through no fault of your own, not because your top lane did poorly and you couldn't carry hard enough – that's the enemy team outplaying yours – but because someone afked, trolled, fed intentionally. That's not the enemy team outplaying yours, that's just you getting screwed over by someone who has, by selecting Ranked Play, agreed to actually try to win.\n\nThe problem is not that this holds you back, because you can climb through that. You can learn to carry games even when 80% of your team has the potential to totally suck. **The problem is that this holds you back on terms you have not agreed to.** The enemy team could have a feeder just as much as yours, but it still ruins the game because this isn't outplay, it's just getting lucky.\n\nThis post isn't \"Riot, fix solo queue so I can climb the ranks like I deserve.\" This post is \"Riot, fix solo queue so that it doesn't suck to play.\" Think of it like a huge bug fix, where the bugs are toxic players. It affects everyone, and it always sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-07-29T03:11:37.912+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of the better responses I've seen on this thread. I didn't address it in the post I made (wanted to focus on scholarship issues rather than solo que), but if we are just talking solo que and not scholarships, then this is probably the only reasoning that has ever convinced me a legitimate revamp would be useful.\n\nMy undergrad was in psych (after switching from econ because I wanted something that interested me more), and my masters was in educational psych (research on how people learn, I specifically focused on addiction and recovery patterns and treatment modalities). One thing I can speak to with a modicum of authority is that human learning is significantly impacted by environment and emotional state. You could probably argue (and maybe even back it up with research if you did it) that the ability of players to improve at league and actually get better is harmed by the negative experience of some ranked games. People are risk averse so the negative games stick out more (avoiding bad things is more important to survival than finding good things because you can be mediocre and still be alive). This leads to people being frustrated in games even where there isn't an issue on their teams some times because they have an overall view of ranked as a bad experience. When people are emotionally engaged in a subject it is easier to persist in learning despite adversity because the enjoyment makes you want to stick with it and overcome difficulty. Therefore, if ranked becomes an overall bad experience for someone, their ability to focus on improving at the game will actually be reduced whether or not they intend to take a different approach (ie be less serious about it) to the game.\n\nI had thought of the issue of disengaging in negative games, but the issue of generalizing bad experiences hadn't really occurred to me in quite as articulate a manner as you put it forward. Essentially in Smash you can always try to get better and improve because you feel that you have a way out, a means to winning if you can just find the solution/skill. However, the negative experience in ranked can sometimes not be avoided, and if people don't take steps to counteract the possibility of generalization, then that experience can create symptoms of learned helplessness (the research on that is depressing, I'd suggest not looking it up) where people stop trying to find a way out even when there is one because they feel trapped.","replies":[{"poster":"Iamawalrus","date":"2015-07-29T09:25:26.677+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what you say is the only real reason (that I've seen so far at least) to complain about ranked, as everything else is explained away by \"it happens on their team as much as yours\":","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-07-29T01:49:06.425+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"The game is a PvP game, I'm not expecting to win 60%+ of my games.  Hitting a promo series and knowing that the game expects me to win 60%+ of my games is just ridiculous.\n\nSeries really need to go. \n\nAlso team builder needs to take over ranked.  It's the only way to really let people shine in their best roles.  When I play in a ranked game and I can't be adc or support, I know right there I'm in over my head.  My skills in top and mid just don't hold up...  Yet the best way to excel is to focus on a single role, and sometimes even a single champ, and just master it.\n\nYou see this if you look at the top players and teams.  You have to become a master at what you're doing.  Every game on a team everyone has the same role.  If they all had to switch roles you're damn right they wouldn't be as great.  They even have their familiar champion pools they dip into.  Broadening this champ pool is important, but we're talking 5-7 champs all in a single role, not 20+ champs across any role at any given time.\n\nTeamBuilder for Ranked needs to have people queue up for their role, select maybe 6 champs as their pool going into that game, and have the banning come out of that pool only.  Reduce bans down to 2 per team again since we don't have as many champions to worry about, and everyone can pick out of their pool after the ban phase for their champs.\n\nIt lets the team have a chance to dodge people who won't cooperate, or overlap for roles, and ensure a solid team before finalizing the queue.  It also lets people have a reasonable expectation when someone calls a role of what they're going to bring to that lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-07-28T22:21:02.197+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Here's the thing, though:  80% of those games will have a 50% win/loss rate.\n\nBy the way, this whole 20%//80% ONLY APPLIES IF YOU ARE WHERE YOU NEED TO BE.\n\nIf you belong higher, you'll climb faster, you'll be influencing 30%, 40% of your games.\n\nIf you play 50 games without climbing, it doesn't mean you are being matched with feeders, trolls, etc. it means you need to improve.  Statistically, you would have climbed a division higher in much fewer than 50 games if you deserve to.\n\nThere is no real reason to complain; you'll never break enough barriers and get it through to the idiots who are ruining your experience.  Of course you'll get people who don't take it super seriously, but what else can you expect from a game like league of legends?  The game is competitive by nature, but not everyone takes competition seriously in games.\n\nIf you want to improve in this game, grinding ladder might not be the best way to do so, honestly, and it's for the very reason you're complaining.

Avoid frequently playing supports, fights need damage to be won and you clearly can't always rely on your team to deal it. If you can't get ADC, get jungle or mid. Both roles have huge lane and objective influence through their roam capability.

I get there are issues with solo que and I get that there is only so much you can do to increase your rank, and it has a very real impact on not just your emotional well being, but also on your livelihood (as your scholarship influences how much you can spend on things other than school). However, that is a choice you made (please hear me out and read the rest).\n\nThere are 3 things I will break down that I think are important influences on the argument you are making here 1) how other scholarships share similar issues that aren't necessarily ever going to be addressed, 2) issues withing game that are controllable to a degree and you may be overlooking (maybe not though) 3) how other players may be in similarly unfair situations. I'll address them in that order, because if I can't establish the first, there is no reason to even consider the other 2.\n\n1) Other scholarships have similar issues, and no one is going to solve the problem for those students. To some degree you accept any unfair conditions that hold you back within your scholarship by nature of accepting the scholarship. You can say I don't understand, but I can give you a first hand example from my own life. I was accepted to university on a full ride academic scholarship. I also struggle with mental health issues that I have dealt with since adolescence. I was able to not lose my scholarship even though I struggled in high school due to apathy and other issues related to my depression because my SAT scores were pretty good (missed one question on the math section), and I graduated on time passing all my classes except multi-variable calculus (college cal 3 most places) despite a 20% absence rate my senior year. However, my academic scholarship was conditional upon maintaining a 3.6 or something, and taking 15 credit hours a semester at minimum. I had accommodations for my learning disabilities (dyslexia and adhd, so difficulty reading and focusing, didn't finish part of the verbal on my SAT because I couldn't read fast enough and didn't have accommodations due to not filling out the proper forms), but not for depression. It's pretty difficult to meet strict attendance policies when some days you struggle to get out of bed, and my psychologist and others had recommended I not take more than 12 hours a semester because it would be difficult for me. The deck is stacked against someone in that situation, but not paying tuition, a stipend for books and food, and 100 of rent each month on campus is hard to turn down, so I had to adjust if I wanted the money. It might not be fair, but it was part of the contract I signed in exchange for the money and I knew it going in. No one was going to change it, and it's that way for others. Traditional sports players often face the same issues. Sometimes their scholarships are conditional on them being able to play, and if they are physically injured and no longer able to, then they lose their scholarship. TLDR; most scholarships have conditions that may be unfair, it's the school's right to do this. In agreeing to the terms of the scholarship you sometimes just have to overcome the unfair nature in order to keep the money.\n\n2) You can certainly have more than a 20% influence in the game. If we dropped you (a plat 3 player) into a bronze level game, you would have more influence than your teammates because the skill difference would be so wide. I'm not saying it's your fault, but there are ways to increase your skill difference. For instance duo que with a strong player and you will bring their MMR down and they may have enough influence to help you climb. Additionally, later in the season you have more people who are in division 5 of a tier and have relaxed and stopped playing as seriously because they can drop to division 2 or 3 of the tier below their current one and not lose their tier. It's not fair, but you may have an easier time getting diamond early in the season rather than now, because more people are climbing.\n\n 3) Any student at a school other than yours (not sure if anywhere other than robert morris offers lol scholarships) who is your level or higher, has an equal or greater complaint that for them the money isn't even available. Not sure if RM is a state school or private, but if there is out of state tuition, some students may not be able to attend due to that, and if it is private, need based financial aid may be a factor for some students not being able to afford it. Additionally, some students may have families that require them to go to particular schools. All these are factors that may make a diamond player ineligible for the money you are making from the same game they are playing. While it may be unpleasant, I think it would be difficult to argue that someone who cannot make money from the same activity should be required to take the game as serious as you do. It is unfortunate, but at the same time it is part of reality. It's an obstacle, that if removed, would shift skill representation (because you would have a different environment) and thus might justify the school shifting the requirements of your scholarship. Just the way the school I attended might have stricter requirements for my scholarship if they had been forced to give me different treatment due to my issues (it would make less sense to them to offer it to me because I would be less prestigious for them and wouldn't count toward their 4 year graduation rate, so they would expect more from my entering stats to off set that).\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as antagonistic, but I wanted to point out that your scholarship is not the only one with these issues. Also there are considerations to be made that if the issue was dealt with from riot's side, it might shift your school's approach to the matter as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-07-28T20:17:25.165+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Duo?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-07-28T22:40:40.331+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why are you so concered about your college League team and yet you talk about Solo-que?\n\nAre you not playing for their team or something?
