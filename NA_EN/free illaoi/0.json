Is there any way to do this now? I can't find anywhere to edit the settings.\r\n\r\nIf there is no current way; can one be added?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nFree {{champion:420}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T21:06:11.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to do a little digging for this one, but right now it seems like once that profile image is set it's set for good.","replies":[{"poster":"Free Illaoi","date":"2017-07-03T03:11:08.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know how to set it?
