People don't play because riot won't upkeep, and Riot won't upkeep if people don't play. And then on top of that, they are finding it harder to make map specific balance changes, as the system simply keeps changing. \n\nGiven their statement, I wouldn't be too bummed if they brought it back as a featured game mode from time to time. At the very least, it would generate some hype that would get people to play, and they can then do specific balance changes in that instant. (instead of maintaining balance over time.) But if they were going to do that, It should have some reasonable up time. (perhaps more featured game modes in general.) As well as significant rewards for playing.

How can I believe that what was said is true? All you guys did was add a mode, and just left it there. It didn't even take me a year before I started branching off from Summoner's Rift. I never knew how boring it was on Summoner's Rift until I found more fun in all three of the other modes. \n\nBut, there are even **greater** reasons why people more than likely played Summoner's Rift more than Crystal Scar.\n\nFirst, there are (or was) 4 modes of play on Summoner's Rift; Blind Pick, Draft Pick, Team Builder, and Ranked. So, primarily, a good half the community will be playing Ranked. Another huge portion would be using Team Builder due to its ability to give auto locks with no rage. And then two other abilities that probably match up with, or equal, how many people play the other modes. So, if we just used Blind and Draft picks, it might even the playing field by just that much.\n\nSecond, new players don't start off with bots matches in any other mode but Summoner's Rift. (Which is yet another mode for Summoner's Rift.) This also means that it makes other modes feel all the more unnatural to play at first.\n\nThird, Summoner's Rift got a **ton** of added features. Not only a completely new look, but it is the **only mode** to allow **Mastery**. Something we have asked to be branched out for a year now.\n\nAnd lastly, you pretty much are messing up Summoner's Rift as it is. People are more likely actually going to Dominion rather than Summoner's Rift. I've seen countless Threads on here speak of people having more fun in the Crystal Scar and how its more balanced there than it is in Summoner's Rift. How can a mode that gets barely any changes at all be more balanced than Summoner's Rift? Maybe because you really do put too much time and effort into a mode that could use **gradual** changes rather than forced ones.\n\nYou think people were mad, sad, and alienated when Team Builder was taken away? Think again when this mode is removed. I'm starting to think its not worth it spending my next few months trying to collect all of the champions you guys released. And I'm only 37 away. I want to play something other than Summoner's Rift, and the only one now that is fun is ARAM.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf possible, a quick, fast and painless game mode you once upon a time let out was none other than **Showdown**. You also have a new version of a ARAM map, Butcher's Bridge. People want a fast paced mode, right? Why not just put this one in the game? Put it under ARAM, and have people be given random Champions to face off in a 1 on 1 (or 2 on 2) face-off.

If you want it gone, leave it gone, don't give us another Aoi Shin.\nI would move to play Twisted Treeline, but with evidence supporting the fact that you really couldn't care less about maps other than Rift it isn't arguing slippery slope anymore, and it will become a reality when Twisted Treeline gets removed since there are hardly any updates to it.\n\nA perfect example rests in ARAM. A fan-made game mode that was once played with non-official games in The Rift. A game mode that receives updates along with Rift, and a game mode that people continue to play **even though you can't choose your own champion!**. A mode that got an event tied to it and it was transformed into Butcher's Bridge. I don't believe you can say \"players still just wanted to play SR\" right now, no new players are going to want to touch something that is 4 years old and abandoned.\n\nI've seen Riot's decision as simply giving up on a project and trying to disguise it behind friendly words and a-no-immediate-rewards perspective. There are no recent updates or talks about dominion, there was no rising to the occasion that the public could see. \n\nNow a year and five months later_\"Fancy Wolf's\"_ wish is finally coming true. I hope to join him soon.

You would not do Dominion as a Featured Game Mode. Unless you mean adding a few Crystal Spires to Summoner's Rift and calling it a day, which you'll probably do in the future and then use it as \"proof\" that Dominion would never work when no one plays it.\n\nURF, Ascension, One For All, Hexakill, Doombots, Snowdown... What do these have in common? No new art assets were required, besides the sandstorms in Ascension. It was all gameplay changes, and I'm not arguing if they were intensive or not, but I highly doubt even a single, lonely percentage of the art team's salary was earned through work on the Featured Game Modes.\n\nNo, you wouldn't do it because Dominion is the result of a time Riot still had some heart, which I'm say, as a long, LONG time player, is getting smaller and smaller by the year. Guess it's another way lore gets completely separated from gameplay.

I had felt good when Riot said they had no plans of removing Dominion because of the small but strong community it had.\n\nI played League since Maokai's release years ago. The game as nice as I continued to play but the long matches were unattractive for me as was the speed of the game. When I saw Dominion was coming out I had very high hopes and wasn't disappointed. I sincerely enjoyed the pace of the game and how quick to action everything was. Even now, I been playing again a lot (check match history) and remembering how much I loved it. Then, I heard from a friend this news and hoped it was wrong...\n\nI knew Dominion always was on the backburner as far as Riot was concerned but the very least it wasn't removed made me feel better. Yes, they rarely wanted to put any hype into it as to avoid taking people from SR away. I was already saddened when they removed the Dominion section of the board thus making it even harder to communicate with others. I made various friends from Dominion nonetheless and even got to play with a Riot member for my 1000th win (Davin, fellow Thresh lover) and hoped to for 2000th win again or even 1500th win which is very near.\n\nIn the end, the small community is pushed aside... with all the hours and $ (to support, though I guess it was pretty much just for SR and other things not related to Dominion) into it. While the icon is a nice touch, it really is just a tombstone for players like me who primarily played Dominion with the odd ARAM thrown in. Now, this is will be gone. To be honest, part of me doesn't want to even go on League at all for the sadness that this brings and to remember. Sure, I can go on for a last hurrah but what is the point? There is always Heroes of the Storm for the speed but I really enjoyed Dominion more and the transparency that Riot gives as well as the speed it does updates even if Dominion was, again, on the backburner. And no, there were no long queues. Waiting 1-7 min isn't considered a long queue to me.\n\nIt is a very sad day... I really don't want to stop playing League but for the small community that loved Dominion where else is there for us to go? I suppose it doesn't matter, the money lost for maintaining Dominion doesn't really make up for how much that small community spent.\n\nI suppose I will have to consider if League just becomes, just like ARAM, that odd match I may play. I will certainly miss everyone I met in that game. I will definitely miss the game style itself. I know players will make fun of us for caring but if they can imagine their SR being taken away maybe they'd understand. Nothing short of a miracle can save this but I really have my doubts as far as money is concerned when comparing to SR.\nBut I will try anyway...\nPlease don't remove my Dominion...\n---Sincerely, a Dominion player since launch, Torenia.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't mind a rework really if the pace was kept...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-02-10T20:35:00.992+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like to get ask any red : What does it cost to let dominion how it is?

The only things I want are more people playing it (shorter queue times), the new champ select, and an updated map.  All of the mechanics in it are really cool.  They have absolutely no reason to remove it other than the fact that their neglect of it has left it much less played than Summoner's Rift.  Riot needs to change that, and I know that once they do, more people will play it.  ARAM is pretty successful because it actually has a decent amount of support.  If Dominion gets it, people will play it.  Once people play it, the queue times will be better.  Once that happens, more people play, etc, etc.  I don't really care about the BS Riot was giving about not fracturing player bases.

I don't even like the meta or the pro play anymore, I honestly play 2 roles and only use about 5 champions all together.

People say this game will die soon if Riot keeps the way they are going, I never believed it but now it's really coming clear. The loyal fans will fall off, move on and it won't be hip anymore because the loyal fans are the ones keeping this game popular and bring in new players (especially streamers/YouTubers).
