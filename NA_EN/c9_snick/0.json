One of your last messages included you stating that you had muted him, which you should have done the moment he started getting toxic. Instead, you had started snapping back and spouting insults like \"Bronzie\" and \"garbage ass\" towards him. \nWhile I don't believe you've done anything worthy of a permanent ban from this game alone, you've neglected to state your history with punishments. I do wholly believe that you deserve some form of punishment from your toxicity. You may have just been on that step of the punishment ladder. \nThe best thing I can tell you now is to submit a ticket to Riot asking about your history with negative activity, and if they could repeal the ban, but the chances of them doing so are very VERY slim.

In reality, the rules work like this;\n\n- Players punished for gameplay related offences (intentional feeding, trolling, etc.) or zero-tolerance chat (hate speech, encouragements of self-harm, etc.) are given a 14-day ban, with the next punishment being a permaban.\n- Players punished for chat related offences (harassment, overbearing negativity, verbal abuse, etc.) are given a 10-game chat restriction, followed by a 25-game chat restriction, then 14-day ban, and ultimately a permaban. \n- Players can skip punishment tiers if their behavior is proven to be severe enough to warrant such a skip.\n\nUltimately, players who go through the tiers of punishment for moderate chat-related offences are ultimately treated as they should be. They're eventually treated much the same as people who go out of their way to ruin games, because that is exactly what they're doing.\n\nAnd if you go out of your way to ruin the game - whether it's through chat or through trolling - you're going to get kicked out.\n\nFull stop.\n\n---\n\nAs for the rest of what you said, I'm not gonna bother with.
