The Bot Lucian was called &quot;Prime Lucian&quot;, but had a large blue block as no artwork existed for whatever this &quot;skin&quot; was. Though, it does look like it was just supposed to be the name for his Red Chroma Skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LoveStrut","date":"2015-05-01T19:19:12.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo, Azure KayZ! Thanks for the report! I suspect that this is part of Blucian's plot to turn everything [blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9RePc). Nonetheless, we are aware of his plot and this bug, so this should be fixed in the future--barring that nothing crazy happens on our end. In the meantime, hold off against Blucian's Bluepocalypse plan while we get our counter-plan out to stop it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shirei Spirit","date":"2015-05-01T02:01:47.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've seen this. I'm not sure if it's a bug with Lucian Chroma or supposed to be there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yaknose","date":"2015-04-30T18:42:44.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing happen to me this morning. There might have been a change since that was before the Chroma packs were available in the store,  but I kind of doubt it.","replies":[]}]}
