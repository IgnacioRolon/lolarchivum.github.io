I&#039;m not sure if this was a feature before as I haven&#039;t played Azir in a while.\r\n\r\nThe second bug is with he W, his Soldier Summon. It no longer has a range indicator of his soldier, instead showing a target indicator with text at the bottom that reads &#039;This is an invalid target.&#039; The skill itself works normally.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-09-01T22:04:15.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should be fix with the upcoming patch.
