I have never accessed to any boosting sites or anything, and the worst part is that I'm supposed to get an email from Riot asking for a passcode if someone tries to change my password, but I didn't get anything. Password changed, account banned, and no email explanations. Even if they changed the email linked to that account I shoulda still gotten a confirmation passcode to my email. I don't understand what's going on and I need help ASAP. Sent Riot support an email but no answers yet.\r\nHelp!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T00:13:32.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitting a ticket was the best move here since you'll need to reach an account recovery specialist in order to sort this out. A specialist will reach back out as soon as possible. Given the context in your OP, I strongly recommend changing the password associated with your email in case the person who compromised your account also compromised your email.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
