And then see what you can do better individually next game, compared to your last one. Its hard to do, but it works.\n\nSource: Been there b4.","replies":[{"poster":"You Are Useless","date":"2015-07-20T22:54:14.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok i will try this one stil losing tho 9 games now LOL :D riot please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-20T21:43:14.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that mindset is way to hard to fall into.

But at least look at your own a lot more. Its easy to find faults in other peoples gameplay, but hardest to find it in your own. And at the end of the day, you are going to go through thousands of different teams, but the only player who will be the same in all those games is yourself. So you might as well focus on self-improvement.","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-20T22:11:27.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is just frustrating to watch, and makes playing the game even harder.  by the end of the game even if i can identify the mistakes i made, i'm to upset to focus.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tryhard Mittens","date":"2015-07-20T21:56:30.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know it sounds silly, but play to learn, not to win.
