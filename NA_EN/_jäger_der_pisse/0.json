Go for early power spikes and start looking to use that early pressure to taking towers, objectives, and jungle skirmishes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-30T04:22:12.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is all counterplay. Avoid his basic abilities and kill him. If he can't land a hit on you with at least Q or W there's no point in him ulting you, so if you can manage that, he's dead. You can even negate his ult with untargetability, a spell shield, an intercept, etc.","replies":[]}]}
