Like his q was basically worthless before, paired with his w which is fairly situational, and an ult that had a high fail rate, he really only had one working ability. The old q was giving him different buffs for eating different jungle monsters, and if the one you needed to match your play style was already dead you would be put behind, if laning you would fall behind trying to go to the right camp to get the buff you needed, it was just not worth it. Now it doesnt matter which you get it from, and the stacks last longer. Also having it be one stat increase rather than 5 small ones, gives a clearer build path. The increase in base AD and AD scaling made w a little less situational, and having the way the slow in his ult works made it so that if you used it when standing right next to someone they could no longer escape, and you wouldnt have to interupt early for less damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-12-04T05:23:10.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O.o I mean I agree, the gameplay change on nunu was huge for the champion but his visuals were untouched :P until that happens he'll be meme material","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anth895","date":"2016-12-04T04:50:15.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't mean people won't meme about them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2016-12-03T22:32:10.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Ezreal fit in somewhere along this timeline?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2016-12-05T05:38:48.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about Irelia? :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShaolinToilet","date":"2016-12-02T08:39:46.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":10,"body":"Can someone at riot tell me why runes are so expensive?

Or are you making numbers up and passing them off as fact because it sounds correct to you?\nRunes are bought using the numerical incentivization of play portion of the game known as IP, it is as such inherently linked to the business model of Freemium games like this.  Champions are bought with RP and IP.  Rune Pages, which you even mention yourself, are bought with RP and IP.

At higher rank it might not matter as much in terms of having infinite smurfs because they are making it harder to maintain alot of smurfs. \n\nI also think another reason why they dont allow RP purchases of runes (even tho smurfs would probably buy them to make life so much easier).
