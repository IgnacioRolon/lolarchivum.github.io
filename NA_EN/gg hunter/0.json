Here&rsquo;s a guide on how you can sign-up for a chance to compete in the Open Qualifiers. \n\n[Last week](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/all-star/articles/2016-challenger-series-qualifiers) we announced our upcoming changes to the Challenger Series qualification process and the TL;DR is we&rsquo;re moving away from Ranked Teams and introducing Qualification Tournaments to determine eligible teams. \n\n**How do I sign up? **\n\nWell first you need to gather a team of eligible members ranked Diamond III or above in [NA](https://battlegrounds.leagueoflegends.com/?current_circuit=na), [EUW](https://battlegrounds.leagueoflegends.com/?current_circuit=euw) or [EUNE](https://battlegrounds.leagueoflegends.com/?current_circuit=eun). Head over to Battlegrounds on NA, EUW and EUNE and your nominated team captain can begin the signup process (note: the links for each will go live  on December 1) \n\n**So aside from being in D3, who&rsquo;s eligible?**\n \nTeam members must be aged 17 or above with the exception of 2 members being aged 16\nAnyone under the age of 18 must provide signed permission from a legal guardian &ndash; this form will be downloadable at signup\nThese qualifiers are restricted to players that live in NA or in EUW/EUNE, but your team can have a maximum of 2 players who are non-residents \nYou must have an active League of Legends account in the respective region that is Diamond 3 or above and is not banned\n\n**How do I actually sign up?**\n \nIf you&rsquo;re a team captain, head to Battlegrounds and at the top of the page you&rsquo;ll find a section to create a new team. Enter a name for your team and press Create. In the new page you will find a link to share with your teammates. They&rsquo;ll be able to click the link to join your team. \nIf you don&rsquo;t have a team then no problem, just create a lobby and look for other teammates through battlegrounds, or share the signup link out for people to join. Remember you only have 8 slots. \n\nOnce you have a team created and the sign ups are open, make sure to follow the regional links above to sign your team up for the Open Qualifier.\n\n**I made a mistake on my team roster!**\n\nYou can register up to 9 players on your roster as team captain, but once signups are closed then you will be unable to make further changes. Double check with everyone on your team before you submit!\n\n**Ok we&rsquo;re signed up. What now?**\n\nThe team captain will receive information about your scheduled games. They&rsquo;ll next receive a tournament code which corresponds to each custom game. That can be shared with the rest of the team or the Captain can join the lobby and invite the rest of their team to join. \n\nGames will be 5v5 best of three on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift \n\n\nFor any other questions, myself, J.T. &ldquo;Riot Tiza&rdquo; Vandenbree (NA) and Piotr &ldquo;Riot Oxy&rdquo; Pilich (EU) will be around. We&rsquo;ll release the ruleset tomorrow alongside an FAQ.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-12-01T00:17:56.660+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"hell yea. sign me up\n\nis what i wish i could say, too bad im silver 5","replies":[{"poster":"MeleeNuke","date":"2015-12-01T02:16:53.029+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll never escape silver...{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"AbsorbedHorizon","date":"2015-12-17T07:37:47.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MeleeNuke,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=blhUQ1JO,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-01T02:16:53.029+0000)\n>\n> We'll never escape silver...{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}\n\nyou and me both","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"6xNiTy0vA9","date":"2015-12-01T01:19:02.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!

What if a team imports players from another region and they can't get diamond 3 before the deadline but they are d3+ in their own regions already?\n\nRegional residency is a key part of the LCS and CS, which is why we have the restrictions in the first place.  The system isn't designed _for_ foreign players, so teams who want to use foreign players will have some extra hoops to jump through.  Some players may be able to transfer their accounts from their main region (e.g. EUW, LAS, TR).  They'll keep their MMR, so they'll be placed close to their rank on their home server and won't have to make the full grind.  That isn't a solution for everyone (e.g. Garena and Tencent regions can't transfer), but that's unfortunately something we're stuck with until next split.\n\nThis is a consistent policy for the Open Qualifiers, so for players looking to play in a region they can't transfer to, they'll know to get an account and get it up to D3 for the Summer CS Open Qualifier.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-01T00:32:07.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put me in coach!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\nI only require that nobody bans Nami.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gods Gunslinger","date":"2015-12-05T07:15:19.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, having issues with team members adding on to team.

With a high MMR EUW account (or one transferred from EUNE) your friend maybe could have reached that if he started ranking up right after the announcement, but now it's a little late.. :-/\n\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Zankren,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=blhUQ1JO,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2015-12-05T23:53:32.592+0000)\n>\n> Would these games possibly be available for viewing to the general public? I certainly wouldn't expect them to be put in the VoDs section of the website, but possibly highlight these as games available for viewing in spectator mode from the LoL home screen.  May have used the wrong terminology there, but you know what I mean.  I just think it would be cool to see some of the teams that will be competing for the Challenger Series next season.\n> \n> Edit: To be clear, I only meant for them to be viewable in spectator mode as they were going on.  I certainly wouldn't expect Riot to spend additional resources on recording these games.\n\nTournament games are a little more restrictive about who can spectate than normal games. In the client, you can't spectate unless you have a participating player on your friend list, and (afaik) op.gg's spectating tool does not work either. replay.gg does work, though, so if any of the participants records their game there, you can use that to rewatch it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Plantie","date":"2015-12-05T23:10:02.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I have a team, all above diamond 3, but one of them are playing challenger team on EUNE when we aren't practicing. His EUW accounts are therefore unranked or just demoted to diamond 3 due to inactivity, but have been in master last season and challenger in season 3. He is, however, diamond 2 in solo-Q on EUNE and can provide proof of ownership of that account. Are there any way for him to participate, or does the account he signs up with has to be diamond 3?\n\nSayks Elite","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dardoch","date":"2015-12-05T15:19:14.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this going to be played on live or tournament realm?
