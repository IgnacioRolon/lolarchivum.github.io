However, there are also a multitude of other programs that can be used with Photoshop to achieve a whole lotta stuff. For example, there's Painter which might suit you if you're expressly looking to replicate real-media. Photoshop's brush engine has kinda caught up a bit more than it used to be, but some people still prefer Painter's brush tools.\n\nThen, there's free/cheaper programs like Paint Tool Sai, Manga Studio, or Sketchbook Pro. If you're new, some of these programs are a pretty good value and get a lot done. \n\nThere are alternative programs like Mischief, which lets you scale indefinitely (so you can start doodling and the canvas will just keep expanding), and Alchemy, which you can use to explore different shapes and effects. \n\nSekai is right though -- it's mainly about how you use the program as a tool!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-27T12:07:17.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZnRG_fSh3A\n\nIt's all about how well you use your tools, instead of how well your tools are.\n\n#Paintmasterrace\n\nI think people just use photoshop for artworks these days though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-08-27T12:02:24.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ms paint?\n\nOk... jokes aside.\n\nI use adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator as well as adobe flash.\nI got a hefty price reduction cause I'm a student. They are great if you have a drawing table.\n\nI also used to draw with the free demo version of ArtRage 4. The full version costs $50 and doesn't have a monthly subscription payment.\n\nIf you have an android tablet with a stylus, you could buy sketchbookpro for only $5. ArtRage also has an android (and Ipad) app which also costs $5.","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-27T21:24:03.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
