Kat and Kalista bot teammates would stay back by minions and then after everyone on our team dies they go in to solo turret and 1v5 every time. Enemy had varus and jhinn easily picked us off, free win for them. The enemy had a Gragas bot but at least he acted as a meat shield, while our Kat and Kalista were mostly useless staying behind minions not poking at all, ended with something like 2K damage dealt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"quatrence","date":"2016-07-28T01:31:40.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I really hate getting bots in ARAM.

Then the Soraka and Sona bots that aren't healing at all the entire game.","replies":[]}]}
