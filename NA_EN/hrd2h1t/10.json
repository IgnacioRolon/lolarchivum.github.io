Instead of having just Doran&#039;s shield, blade, and ring, and the corrupting potion as starting items, what if we had more diverse items? For example, there would be a Doran&#039;s type item for melee damage, melee tank stats, ranged damage, ranged tank stats, a defensive mage item, and an offensive mage item? This would not only make the first items often actually dynamic, but it might make certain classes easier to damage. For example, marksmen would be able to be nerfed without nerfing assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-10-30T19:21:49.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not like you have to buy a Doran's item, you know.
