What if this guy is the emperor of China? He would have 100 children, probably around 100 siblings, and if he's old he may even have grandchildren, and if each of his children have as many children... And I only mentioned his   direct bloodline. What about his aunts, his cousins, his second cousins. Why go against a whole dynasty and a country, because of one person? And what if Noxus has given one of their princesses to marry a foreign prince? This would mean that you aren't only threatening a Noxian princess, you are also challenging the throne of you country! Imagine if they too have children! And well, who gave birth to YOU anyway? Do you realize you've just said you'll kill yourself and your _own_ family?? Now you'll say, I'm a yordle, I was given birth by a human. But according to evolution, we all come from one single-celled organism, so even if the connection is loose, they STILL are your family! So congratulations, you've just publicly announced that you're going to commit suicide after killing every organism on earth including your family. And all of that for your private land, for your self interest, for your USELESS feelings, you dirty evil capitalist! Communism needs to save us before your blindness kills us all! So remember, the Capital has no nationality, no party line, (no religious) morality and owes nothing to anybody except its owners and shareholders. It was built from violence and intends to retain itself through violence. So go forth to the streets, workers, men and women, overturn their ways, free yourselves from the chains of greed!","replies":[{"poster":"ShovelShepherd","date":"2016-11-27T22:10:54.249+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:240}} :CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!","replies":[]},{"poster":"japan hate acc","date":"2016-11-28T03:28:55.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found my new best friend.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-11-27T17:44:26.803+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:240}} \"I said I'm gonna do it, and I NEVER BACK DOWN FROM A THREAT!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2016-11-27T17:32:30.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe not.
