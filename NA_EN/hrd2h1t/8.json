Heimer and actually pull off decent ganks on top if you're on blue side by going around behind and placing turrets between them and their tower.\nIf they try to kill your turrets as soon as possible, wait for them to start going for your turret and throw your grenade and rockets at them.\nIf they use their spells to kill your turrets from long range, accept the trade because they'll run out of mana way faster than you will, and likely miss cs at the same time.  When they're forced to recall, you can use your ulted turret to take the tower if the enemy jungler doesn't cover the lane.  If the jungler does cover the lane, steal his raptors while he's csing under tower.\n\nI'll admit that he does get weaker as your opponents become more and more skilled, but you can still play around that to a point.  I haven't played Heimer in plat though as I got too annoyed with his turret ai for a while.  I imagine he can still work, but it would require more precise planning and jungler coordination to be really successful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-11-10T23:46:16.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\n\nI tried that once..he just walks up to you and autoattacks you back.
