I like the idea of a champion that confuses your enemies and blinks around a lot but I think the does too much damage to make it fair. I think fights against her would be way more fun and balanced if your main concern was hitting the real LeBlanc before she chips away your health instead of running away from LeBlanc as fast as you can so you don&#039;t get killed in one burst.\r\nYasuo is just too tanky for an assassin. Usually assassins are made squishy to compensate for how much damage they do. Yasuo&#039;s passive and W just simply give him too much safety to be a healthy assassin.\r\nMaybe I&#039;m just biased because I like playing squishy mages, but tell me what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-07-08T06:29:22.899+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo isn't an assassin. He's a skirmisher. Assassins are defined by their one job of killing priority targets and then getting right out before the tanks CC them and take them down. Skimishers one: have a few defensive tools in their kits in order to make up for their relatively low health and defenses and lack of escapes, and two: have the ability to fight everyone and everything exactly because they can't escape once they go in. Would you call Fiora or Riven an assassin? No, right?\n\nI mean, yes Yasuo can be built full damage \"assassin\", but that shit usually isn't going to work outside of normals. Yasuo has to build defensively so that he won't be blown up once he goes in just because he can't escape and any smart team with CC won't let him escape. \n\nLeBlanc's one job is to kill people in the early game. Particularly those dumb enough to stray too far from where they're supposed to be. She falls off hard in the late game where people group up and build MR to not be bursted down.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2016-07-08T06:51:23.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlamingEnemy13,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wKfXEp6O,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-08T06:29:22.899+0000)\n>\n> Yasuo isn&#x27;t an assassin.\n\nSecondary role.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Yasuo\n\nk.\n\nNow, in general it is usually a bad idea to build him assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-07-08T09:46:01.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That tag system is outdated and Riot has said so themselves.

Both assassins and skirmishers belong to the bigger class called Slayers. Slayers are generally on the squishy side stats wise, but have unrivaled mobility and nearly-as-unrivaled kill potential. Assassins are made to kill priority targets and then get out, skirmishers on the other hand can potentially fight with anyone that they face (still, focusing the ADC or fed mage takes priority) and have a few defensive tools that help them stay around: Yasuo's shield and windwall, Fiora's vital heal, ult, and parry for example. Maybe a simpler term would be a light fighter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hrd2H1t","date":"2016-07-08T06:50:59.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think that LeBlanc having so much early game killing potential is a problem because if she gets a couple early kills in lane and then roams a lot she can help other lanes snowball fairly hard.

Almost as much as I despise Fizz.\n\nNow moving on, again, it's kinda her one job. If the other team can turtle it out, she's going to become dead weight for the rest of her team, even if she helps kickstart a hypercarry's snowball like say Jinx. Her winrate goes down the longer games last.\n\nRiot said it when they \"nerfed\" Zed's shadow for clarity not to long ago: Zed--and by extension, other assassins and even skirmishers; basically those that fall under Slayers-- are supposed to be frustrating to play against; it is no fun being dead after all. They're the killers, one class kills in unrivaled time but only against squishies, and the other class can deal sustained damage to anyone that crosses their path. Take away something that helps them do so and they become near useless.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-07-08T06:30:34.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just an FYI: {{champion:157}} is a primary Fighter with Assassin as his secondary classification.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/43841864e36eb006f50ba1b4ef0767f1.png\n\nHis Windwall is the LAST skill he puts points into after only putting one point into it.
