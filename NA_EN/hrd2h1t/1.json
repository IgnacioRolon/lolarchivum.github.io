Seriously though, the early game has WAY too much influence over late game. At this point First Tower might as well mean First Nexus.

The only way to beat them is to end the game before they get their 3rd or 4th item if you let them get that item you lose. You making the game not as snowbally just buffs these champions and that is the last thing I wanna see personally.\nEdit* And it also puts early game champs to shit because if the early game isn't rewarding then they are useless so champs like {{champion:80}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:35}} are all going to be useless since you are making the game late game oriented.","replies":[]}]}
