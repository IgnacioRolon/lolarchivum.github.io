Also, Using nothing but pings is like speaking in nothing but metaphors. Sure it can work, but there is always a chance something can be lost in translation. Sure when you blank pinged Yasuo and then pinged assist top Yasuo went top, but so did the rest of your team.\n\nBesides, when did lower Elo teammates ever pay attention to pings?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Surr20plz","date":"2016-09-25T07:49:52.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry kid when the new client comes out people will be yelling at each other on voice chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Townsa","date":"2016-09-25T07:36:29.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like those messages you think can't be communicated by pings only show how:\nA) You don't use pings yourself, therefore, you don't know what they could be used for\nB) You're unaware of the ping changes, and the larger versatility being added (Ex: Pinging amounts of gold, Timers, etc.)\nC) You shouldn't mute everyone if it's such an issue, only specifically toxic individuals.
