I'm guessing you're asking this because you're using the hotspot to play League of Legends.\n\nLuckily, I use Verizon Wireless too so I know a little bit about what technology they've implemented (I did some research when I was looking for a mobile network provider), but first of all I'd like to point out that playing via hotspot has its own challenges. If wi-fi can be prone to packet loss and higher latency, then hotspots definitely increases the riskiness. The reason being you're using a wireless connection that is also wireless connected to cell towers instead of wirelessly connecting to a router which is physically connected to a modem that's hard wired. So even if you fix the dropped data when calls come in, you might still experience network problems that will cause frustration on the Fields of Justice.\n\nWith that out of the way, a short history on Verizon Wireless' technology. There's two type of wireless technologies for mobile phones back in the day, CDMA and GSM. CDMA was used by Sprint and Verizon and one of the limitations of it is the inability to transmit both data and handle voice calls.\n\nFast forward to now and we're basically all using LTE technology for our mobile phones now and it can handle both voice and data, so... why is your hotspot still dropping when you receive a phone call? Well it's because--as a fail over--it has to go to their CDMA-based network when their LTE-based network has a hiccup or the coverage isn't as good. So it elects to use the legacy voice technology by default.\n\nHowever, you can use their VoLTE (Voice over LTE) technology which they call \"HD Voice.\" More information can be found on their website here: \nhttp://www.verizonwireless.com/support/hd-voice-for-android-faqs/\n\nDefinitely check it out if you want to know more about simultaneous voice and data on Verizon Wireless' network and keep in mind the warning I mentioned earlier because you definitely don't want to find yourself with high packet loss, rubberbanding throughout Summoner's Rift.\n\nAs for the legality of it... I don't know enough about our legal system to know one way or the other, but I imagine a some people would be miffed if their 3G network went down prematurely lowering their overall coverage or making older mobile phones obsolete.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Greencard l","date":"2016-07-02T04:55:16.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You hit the nail on the head. Since it is the exact situation  I am in.  i get such extreme packet loss during champ select using hot spot it lags me out of it. Forcing dodge penalties constantly.\n\nIt is fairly annoying because I live in barracks. I HAVE TO answer my cell phone because i'm legally obligated too.\n\nI wish i would have posted months ago because i switch duty stations in a few weeks anyways! If i am in the same situation at my next residence I will be sure to try out some of the options you listed.\n\nThank you for the reply. At the time i made this I got crushed in a ranked game because I got a 10 second call. Hate posts are never the answer!\n\ntl;dr knowledge is power!","replies":[]}]}
