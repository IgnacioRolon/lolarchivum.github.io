You may choose Jungle as primary and support as secondary. Then you get adc... Say that you suck at adc and you don't want to dodge the champion select. If you do horrible as adc in a ranked game, you might get reported for possibly inting. I feel like when you don't get primary role or support role, you should get a warning or if you dodge, you don't get the temporary priority queue. I really hate being in other roles other than what I choose, and I feel like other people do too.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T04:14:20.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh boy, as sort-of a one trick pony I feel you. It feels pretty bad to queue up as top/adc and then end up with jungler....which I've NEVER done -_-.....\n\nRegardless of how uncomfortable it might be to get autofilled, it's a system that we really need to have in place. Most players know that there's a smaller group who prefer support as opposed to things like junglers or adc, and if you were to only get the roles you chose it would likely make queue times unbearable due to nobody queueing as support.","replies":[]}]}
