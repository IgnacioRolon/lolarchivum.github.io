My first recommendation would be to play on Ethernet if you're playing on Wifi. Wifi can be finicky and can be affected by a whole bunch of other factors such as other people's wifi, microwaves, etc. My next recommendation would be to reset your modem/router. I reset my modem and router about every month just to keep things running smooth.  Finally, check to see if you can enable QoS on your router. This should help if you or someone else is downloading or streaming stuff while you're playing League. If you take those steps and continue to be disconnected or see the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message, I'd recommend submitting a ticket to Player Support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), where they can help troubleshoot the source of your issues.","replies":[]}]}
