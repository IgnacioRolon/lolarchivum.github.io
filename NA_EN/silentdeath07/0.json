I recommend working through the following steps to resolve this.\n\nFirst, I suggest going into your [resolution settings](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4910-screen-resolution-display-change-windows-10-a.html) and ensuring the resolution you're running is set to what Windows recommends. After you've done that, we'll want to ensure your League settings are refreshed to grab the right resolution. \n\nFirst, log into League, then navigate to your installation directory for League, which should be in this directory:\n\n>C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named *Config*, then hop into a custom match to confirm the changes went through. Let me know if this helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-02T13:02:11.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, please have a look at these threads:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/gdEazY7E-fps-at-like-2-or-3-recently-all-game-need-help-ever-scince-a-windows-update?comment=0000\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/KFxcVtYK-my-computer-is-randomly-freeezing-mid-game?comment=0000\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/il5Qxm2w-if-you-are-still-having-the-bugsplat-bug-after-champ-select-read-this","replies":[]}]}
