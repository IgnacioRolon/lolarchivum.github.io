These aren&#039;t balance suggestion but little mechanical Quality of life change that will make Quinn a little bit smoother.\r\n\r\n**0) Harrier**\r\n\r\nI was about to say some words about Quinn&#039;s passive. But since RiotRepertoir said he is working on its relaiability  all I have to suggest now is a tooltip that states how long it will take for Harrier to come up again. Is it 6 seconds all the time or does it scale with level? We don&#039;t know!\r\n\r\n**1) Sling Shot SFX Fix**\r\n\r\nMany Quinn players have begged for a better attack animation. However i believe the problem with Quinn&#039;s autoattack lies in the soundeffect you can hear. Its a sling sound you expect from a crossbow. Before a projectile leaves Quinn modell this sling shot can be heard for the full duration. For someone that is trained to listen to this audiosignal this has caused me to cancel my autoattack before any shot was fired. Now, normal attack are handable, the problem lies in the harrier sound which shares the same sound and animation for critcal strikes. Its a very loud an discreet sound. I believe if Riot would work on this Quinns autoattacks would be much smoother.\r\n\r\n**2) Activation time of Tagteam\r\n**\r\n\r\nIs it just me or does it seem like Quinn/Valor is unable to autoattack for a short time when activating  tagteam?\r\n\r\n**3) Make Vault like Tristana&#039;s Rocketjump**\r\n\r\nVault is probably my favourite Quinn abililty. However right now every disable will stop Quinn mid dash. This is a problem because unlike a Caitlyn dash Quinn has to move towards its target first in order to get away from it. Every random binding, every queued up Irelia stun will stop Quinn. An ability meant to create distance now left you right in front of the threat.  However making her untargatable like Maokai is not the solution. This is why I suggest the Tristana rocketjump treatment:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Tristana is **still targetable while jumping** and can be hit by skillshots such as&nbsp;Ashe&#039;s&nbsp;nchanted Crystal Arrow&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ezreal&#039;s&nbsp;Mystic Shot.\r\n&gt; Non-airborne crowd control effects, such as&nbsp;stuns&nbsp;and&nbsp;snares,** will take effect upon landing and will&nbsp;not&nbsp;cancel the jump**.\r\n&gt; All airborne crowd control effects, such as&nbsp;knockups&nbsp;and&nbsp;**knockbacks,will&nbsp;cancel the jump** and then complete their effects as normal.\r\n\r\n**4) Bugfixes**\r\n\r\nYes there are sill some Bugs that still plague Quinn. Just to name the most important ones:\r\n\r\n* Blind Bug: There have been reports that this still hasnt been eradicated.\r\n* Vaulting to a target in a dash or blink motion can cause Quinn to leap off 90&deg; away.\r\n* A bug that causes Quinn to not be able to move or autoattack after vaulting\r\n* A bug that makes Quinn vault behave like Valor vault and the other way around","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T05:59:01.902+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good stuff. To Vault specifically, there's may be a good argument to be made that it isn't interrupted by disables applied on the way in. I'd have to think about that before pulling the trigger on it. It's a little odd because Quinn is technically kicking off her target, and it seems like something that would be difficult while stunned, but getting bound to the ground during Rocket Jump would seemingly have a similar weirdness to it, and we all know that exists.\n\nOh, and I also think her AA animation/effects could use some work, for what that's worth.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-08-13T07:59:20.085+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's another change that Quinn really needs: her ultimate's cooldown presently doesn't cycle until AFTER she uses Skystrike (the second activation of her ult). This leads to people being discouraged from keeping Valor out for long, as it just means it'll take longer until you get your ultimate back. As a result, you don't see people using Tag Team for map-crossings or stuff like that, and Tag Team's early ranks already have a nasty cooldown.\n\nIt'd be great if the cooldown started cycling the moment you activated Tag Team, rather than once you're finished with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adalore","date":"2015-08-13T18:51:37.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the vault interactions should stay but Quinn gets priority when dealing with things like vaulting into \"queued\" actions. Thresh should still be able to flay you to keep you from going back but in no way should singed fling you after you bounce off him. (not completely sure about these interactions as of right now.)\n\nThe biggest things that need to be fixed is most the auto attack stuff with her passive. I am not even sure at this point but the AA feel between a normal attack and passive proc is wide. A change that probably would fix a lot of the strange edge cases would be having Quinn's attacks check \"On hit\" rather than \"On attack\" for the passive activation. Now we would lose the cool \"Burst\" fire bolt attack but you wouldn't lose damage if you attacked not even half a moment too early as Valor puts the passive mark on the target.","replies":[{"poster":"Phanron","date":"2015-08-13T23:29:01.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Tristanas rocketjump gets canceled by all displacements. So a Volibear fling would go through while an irelia stun won't. Honestly in the case of Quinn I'd like to see both cases gone. Vaulting into a fling feels just as bullshit as any other randum binding/stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Adalore","date":"2015-08-15T02:06:06.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well depending on WHEN you fling Trist she flies off into the distance.\nLike she starts the animation is flung right at afterwards she will still jump off. It's really stupid when you grab them as blitz and she flies off just due to timing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moulin Rouge","date":"2015-08-12T23:30:55.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why people are against an untargetable vault","replies":[{"poster":"Phanron","date":"2015-08-12T23:38:37.563+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Untargatability is a very powerfull tool.

The cost was that it's his only escape tool but he can usually kill you with it so he won't be needing an escape after that anyway. Yi's outplaying is hard to do because you need good concentration which is good and I have nothing against it. Fiora's ult had 0 counterplay unless you're Jax. You just had to stay and take all that damage without the ability to do anything which was annoying when fiora is fed. Vlad's health cost doesn't bother him too much because he can health it up again while he is in the pool or by using Q after that. Quinn's E is her only escape tool which is **targeted** and lands away 525 range from the target. And because she dashes to the enemy champion first she makes herself vulnerable which makes it a very shitty escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moulin Rouge","date":"2015-08-13T00:02:40.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Phanron,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8LLf39xe,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-12T23:38:37.563+0000)\n>\n> Untargatability is a very powerfull tool.

I don't think it would be any different then it just being a skill shot and her bouncing off whatever she hits, but if it needs to be a point and click for that part, it can be.\n\nSomething cool I'd like to see on vault would be Quinn rapid firing arrows into the enemy she kicked off of while she's still in the air. Making her land and then auto just makes her feel really stationary in my experience. This could be achieved by just changing her passive to do two things. One, any target she vaults off of is immediately ready to be hit with her passive, so she could shoot the arrows while descending. Two, change her passive to do some crazy ass rapid fire shit. It made Ashe feel crisp as hell to play, and a similar change would have a similar effect to quinn. \n\nOne last idea I have that goes with my new vault idea is one I thought of while thinking about Fiora's new Q. If Quinn uses the skill shot form of E and it doesn't hit anyone, she would do some acrobatic flip to anyone near her and just spray arrows around that target, possibly proc'ing on hit effects. Think Fiora's new q, so when Quinn uses vault, it would first have her dash in a hi-jump-kick motion, and then if she doesn't hit anyone she could cast it again and spray towards anyone in the circle part. The ending part is a little different than Fiora's new q, but being able to reactivate would give her some freedom so she doesn't fly into the enemy's face when she doesn't want to. Both ideas wouldn't have to be incorporated together, but one or the other, since I think they might conflict with each other. \n\nAlltogether, Quinn as she is now feels slightly immobile unless in bird form, and I think Quinn is capable of some more vayne-esque acrobatics on her own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-13T00:06:52.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it so that her Q consumes the passive proc.\n\nEZ she's viable now.","replies":[]}]}
