This just start happening recently where my Computer will freeze in game and I would have to turn off and back on again. It only happens when I have a Voice Chat open. I also just start using my HyperX Cloud II headset if that has anything to do with it. But when I don't have any voice chat open the game won't crash. I usually use Curse or Discord the most lately.","replies":[{"poster":"XSlashDashX","date":"2016-09-10T23:12:54.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, guys. I've come down to the Headset being the problem. I can have my Corsair headset on with Discord/Curse overlay on and the game/pc won't crash at all. Then when I hook up my cloud 2 headset and hop into game, pc freezes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T18:24:14.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the overlays for either of these VOIP programmes may be causing the issue. I strongly recommend disabling the overlay feature if you've had it enabled, to see if it causing the crashes to cease. Be sure to test these changes in a custom match to prevent a negative experience for everyone, in the event the crashing continues.\n\nLet me know if anything changed.","replies":[{"poster":"XSlashDashX","date":"2016-09-05T06:40:29.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool deal.
