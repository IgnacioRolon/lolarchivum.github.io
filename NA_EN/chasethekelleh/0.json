I have never had a game that was fun with an enemy nasus in game. If you don't stop him early game from farming, you can't stop him. If you do manage to stop him, he just stays in top lane forever, farming his q and creating constant pressure. On top of all that, he has a massive slow to movespeed and attkspeed, an armor shred, and his ult adds HP. Why does riot just turn their heads to some things but completely butcher others? It's f*cking stupid. Get your sh*t together, Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-03-19T17:05:03.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides the infinite scaling, Nasus aren't similar in the slightest.

And, barring trolls and intentional feeders, they are correct: losing sucks. But that is not sufficient reason for any balance change or rework, as a player's ability to win or lose is more a measure of the respective abilities of the two (for mid lane, in this example) players in question. If I, who play support and jungle more than anything, were to run into a Veigar main on a champ I am less familiar with, but have to play because mid is the only unclaimed lane, then I will probably lose. if, however, I come across a player who is similarly displaced from his or her preferred role, then I would have around a 50% chance of beating that Veigar. In the second case, one of us is guaranteed to lose, depending on the relative skill between the enemy Veigar and my Karthus, for example, as well as the contribution to our respective lanes from our junglers, supports, etc. \n\nI especially hate playing against support Zyra or Blitzcrank, as a second example, because she usually gives me trouble in lane with her free harass from her plants, and Blitz hooks are a terror, or something I have to be constantly aware of, at least (speaking from my own play experience, of course, not as an objective statement). The point is, I don't have fun playing against either support because I am focused on countering their high-pressure play. My own fun, in this case, is not a relevant condition, though, as the Zyra or the Blitzcrank, or the Veigar who is crushing my Karthus, is surely having fun, since fun is a consequence of victory, and thus should not be the excuse for a nerf or rework.\n\nSo please, Riot, don't take the fun away from players on account of the ones who are losing, as the defeated will never have fun regardless of how many nerfs or reworks you apply to any champion. All your nerfs have accomplished, in short, is to turn the winners into losers, and thereby decrease the amount of fun to be had.\n\nThe short short version is that Riot is, in essence, punishing players for their proficiency on a champion using this, \"It makes the game unfun to people playing against it,\" guideline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-03-19T17:47:52.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I hate the Veigar changes (till URF comes then we'll see how fun he is ;D) nasus doesn't even get into range to use his Q on anybody being so easily kited/peeled off","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-03-19T17:33:53.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because all he can do is split push, unless he's seriously fed, his team presence is not the greatest, mind you, there's a difference between HAVING a presence and LOOKING like you have a presence, he looks scary, but honestly, he does very little in a teamfight. \n\nAlbeit if anyone can get a kill in a 1v3, its definitely him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-03-19T17:16:33.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus has to farm all game to be relevant, and leaves his team in a 4v5.
