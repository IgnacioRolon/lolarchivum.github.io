Each of them are a nightmare to walk into a bush and have the two innate passives every Demacian needs (Being in every bush ever and being immune to turret damage), but none of them have the True Demacian epicness...\n\nDEMACIA. Yes. Screaming DEMACIA. Lux does it when she&#039;s about to explode some one, Garen does it when he&#039;s calling upon a sword from the Heavens to crush his foe, J4 screams it when he&#039;s shattering some one&#039;s skull so hard it leaves a crater around him, yet Xin, Fiora, Quinn, and Galio do not. THEY MUST SCREAM DEMACIA! It would make them all viable in ProPlay and Quinn&#039;s Ultimate would feel so right. Galio should go &#039;Deeeemaaaaa&#039; when charging, then as he explodes, &#039;CIIIIAAAAA&#039;. Fiora should scream it at the top of her lungs when she either hits the 4th vital or the person dies after she lands one, which is when ever the healing ends up proc&#039;ing. \n\nWe can ignore Sona and Vayne though since Sona doesn't speak and Vayne isn't all to... Demacian-feeling.\n\nI DEMAND DEMACIA! Who else wants more DEMACIA? One can not survive with only three of our Demacians screaming DEMACIA.\n\nEdit: Since a couple people have mentioned it.
