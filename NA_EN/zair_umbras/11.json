Rylai&#039;s was always explainable because it was such a powerful item, yet Riot recently buffed it and many champions are able to keep enemies permaslowed at a range with the item. Like Kog with his R or simply managing his CD&#039;s well, Kayle&#039;s AA&#039;s, Ahri, Malz&#039;s E, Zyra throwing down plants, etc. So why do we keep things like Teemo&#039;s E, Kog&#039;s W, Varus&#039;s W, and other magic damage on-hits from proc&#039;ing these things? Kayle&#039;s E has always proc&#039;d the spell damage items and still does and it&#039;s conceptually the same thing, an on-hit. There&#039;s also Fizz&#039;s W. The initial hit of Fizz&#039;s W, the activation, doesn&#039;t proc the spell effects, yet the DoT on the passive DOES proc Liandry&#039;s and Rylai&#039;s as well as Luden&#039;s, kind of an oddity. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the whole on-hit thing changed so it wouldn&#039;t feel so silly and backwards. I mean, Kayle is pretty much the only one who gets the proc these things doing the same exact thing as the others. Auto-Attacking.","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-09-01T04:44:10.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So why do we keep things like Teemo's E, Kog's W, Varus's W, and other magic damage on-hits from proc'ing these things?\n\nKayle's Damage enhancement on E (the AoE component) applies spell effects to the aoe component, not to the on-hit on her autos (but since the target is in the AoE, they get affected anyways.)\n\nBecause they would be too good with that interaction and it'd be Frozen Mallet all over again: Perma-slows on auto attacks (Kayle's E probably shouldn't be applying spell effects either, she honestly could use a rework.) Frozen Mallet isn't built often because it has an awful awful build path.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-09-01T04:50:13.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's more because it's not a very good item to begin with. Unlike Rylai's, it's damage component is pretty damn low to compensate for the fact it's the 2nd highest HP item in the game. Most AD's also don't really need the slow since they've got a slow or other form of CC in their kit to begin with unless you're ranged, in which case it's a 30% slow and gives almost no damage when you need to be building as much damage as possible. This is on top of the fact it's only on AA's rather than on physical damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-09-01T07:57:43.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"700 HP, 30 AD, 40% slow on-hit, nothing about that screams bad item. You land a hit once and they will most likely be slowed forever. **There is no such thing as too much CC**. It used to be built all the time when it built out of Phage, it was an extremely good item for any bruiser: Tons of HP, good enough AD, and something to stick to squishies extremely well.\n\nIt's still an amazing item, but again, Frozen Mallet intentionally has an awful build path because perma slow is ridiculous (although considering recent trends, wouldn't be surprised if it gets looked at.) Unless you are snowballing really well or can stomach the high cost and build path, it's generally not worth buying (Black Cleaver rework didn't help either.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cosmic Cocaine","date":"2015-09-01T03:43:20.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo would turn into Ashe.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-09-01T03:49:46.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle already is.
