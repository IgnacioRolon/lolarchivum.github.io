Again...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Okay, so WHY is Ezreal getting the short end of the stick with this preseason change to Marksmen? All of them are getting buffed to what they do best, but Ezreal is getting smacked in the face and completely ignored...\r\n\r\nWith this new patch, Marksmen are getting more reliant on the Crit stat and their items as well as their kits are getting boosts affected by crits, but EZREAL DOESN&#039;T USE CRIT. Yet again we overlook Ezreal for the millionth time when it comes the ADC role. Not long ago, Riot was looking at ways to buff Ezreal in the ADC position and even upped the AP ratio on the Q to make the Trinity a better item, but now the AP is being removed, so that early AP it used to give is no longer going to be part of his kit. He&#039;s a poke-based ADC that gets outclassed late game, and even more-so with how powerful this patch is going to make the other ADC&#039;s.\r\n\r\nCan we please stop gutting ADC Ezreal every single time there&#039;s talk of buffs for him? It&#039;s getting a bit annoying. He got his deserved nerfs during Preseason of Season 3 and he was then taken a whole new build that got nerfed into the floor, so he&#039;s been back to the old build... But now his items are being changed. Trinity is being changed to more crit-using champions plus the AP removed and now even Essence Reaver is being changed so that he can&#039;t even use it properly. It only procs off of crits! Seriously! \r\n\r\nEvery season Ezreal gets a new item and then it gets ripped out of his hands. S3 gave him blue build, they made sure he couldn&#039;t. He went with Statikk Shiv, then that only crit if the thing that proc&#039;d it crit.... Then Trinity got buffed so him and Corki could make a come back and in reality, only Corki was able to come back with it. We had Essence added and it was meant for champs like him, Jayce, and other AA&#039;ing champs who use a lot of mana, but now he can&#039;t even use it.\r\n\r\nCan we please make crit affect Ezreal&#039;s Q or something or revert some of these changes so Ezreal can at least cling to the small bit of life he still has? :(","replies":[{"poster":"Streeton","date":"2015-10-31T03:44:58.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really have no idea what riot was thinking when they nerfed him, even when they buffed him by making his e 7.5 ad ratio it really did nothing to him, i think he should have a rework instead of freaking kogmaw having one","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-10-31T03:50:01.929+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Streeton,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KA9knJKK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-31T03:44:58.644+0000)\n>\n> i really have no idea what riot was thinking when they nerfed him, even when they buffed him by making his e 7.5 ad ratio it really did nothing to him, i think he should have a rework instead of freaking kogmaw having one\n\nKoggy got a remake because Vayne did the Tank Buster thing better than him while Jinx did the long range auto-attacker thing while having a much better early game in addition to better control and safty.  He needed a niche that Jinx didn't trample on and now he's got one.\n\nEz already had a well defined champion niche pretty much due to his Q alone.  The new Reaver combined with Trinity will net him 40% CDR on top of a respectable degree of sustain, raw AD, and crit chance.  He's going to be amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-31T03:58:18.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, the new Ez is going to be horrible.\n\nEssence Reaver ONLY procs off of crits, his Q never crits.\n\nTrinity doesn't give AP, gives less AD, and less AS, but has 10% crit, a stat that's near wasted on him.\n\nHonestly, crit doesn't help Ezreal. You're almost never AA'ing and the entire thing about Ezreal is to poke with Q and use it as a main source of your damage. Now we'll have to use crit and his Q is going to be near worthless since you'll never have the mana to really use it unless you get a Manamune, which damage-wise is a HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2015-10-31T04:20:24.877+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KA9knJKK,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-10-31T03:58:18.383+0000)\n>\n> No, the new Ez is going to be horrible.\n> \n> Essence Reaver ONLY procs off of crits, his Q never crits.\n> \n> Trinity doesn't give AP, gives less AD, and less AS, but has 10% crit, a stat that's near wasted on him.\n> \n> Honestly, crit doesn't help Ezreal.
