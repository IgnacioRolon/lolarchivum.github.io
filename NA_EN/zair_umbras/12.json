I mean... Who picks up a Trinity Force anymore?\r\n\r\nLooking at all the champions who used to rush it first, all of them have either thrown it into the trash can and moved onto a Rageblade+Gunblade rush or their winrates have gone down by a couple percent. Just looking at Ezreal, we&#039;ve seen him go from 49% in 5.21 to about 47% in 5.22. Everyone had huge hype for Ez to be the king of the ADC&#039;s with 40% CDR in just two items, but in reality, this item isn&#039;t even worth getting anymore and this board is full of people telling others to go with Blue Build again. Blue Build was designed for heavy kiting, not for the most damage but right now blue is doing more damage and it&#039;s not because it got buffs to any of its core items, in fact Iceborn lost AP, BotRK was nerfed, and the like... but none of them were nerfed as hard as Trinity. Even Corki has gone down with Trinity (Though that&#039;s likely because Trinity isn&#039;t being affected by Corki&#039;s passive like the original Corki post had told us it would, plus Corki&#039;s new W isn&#039;t the easiest to use). Jax and Irelia are facerolling with Rageblade and Gunblade.\r\n\r\nHeck, the one champion who got the most out of these item changes and even got a buff with the new Trinity Force has gone down in win rate... Gangplank, who has been dying for crit chance and CDR can now get 40% crit and 40% CDR in 2 items on top of mana, lots of AD, and mana return on crits... is doing -worse-?!\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s up with this new Trinity. Why&#039;s it still cost the same outrageous cost for 25 AD, 15% AS, 20% crit, 250 mana, 10% CDR, 250 health, and 5% MS? It used to give 30 AD, 30AP, 30% AS (TriForce. Tri. Tri. Tri is 3. 30. 3 in 30....), 10% crit, 250 health, 8% MS, and 250 mana. So we lost 30 AP, 15% AS, 5 AD, and 3% MS to gain 10% CDR and 10% crit. 4 stat deductions for two stat increases?\r\n\r\nThis it is not only having an identity crisis, it&#039;s a 3800g item that gives some of the worst stats in the game. What is this item supposed to be good at anymore? The extra 100-200 of uncritable damage isn&#039;t worth 3800g. A normal Crit/AS item gives more overall damage to champs who used to get Trinity Force and the AS/Crit items had their AS NERFED too... so what&#039;s up with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2015-11-17T02:56:41.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Blue build is now too strong because if you fully tack muramana plus full crit you won't loose mana per hit like you did before, so you can get an onhit that can grant 75-150 physical damage on-hit.

Even just a cost reduction to make it combine for free would be a start. It no longer deserves to be the most expensive item in the game.\n\nThe second problem is Rageblade is absurdly OP right now. I mean when global gold income went up and most items were made more costly to compensate, we have the following changes to rageblade:\n\nBuffs:\nPrice down 90g\nMelee attacks stack twice as fast\nAS per stack doubled from 4% to 8%\n3 AD per stack added\nGuinsoo's Rage at 8 stacks = 20 + 15% AD + 7.5% AP on hit in AOE\n\nNerfs:\nAbilities no longer grant stacks\nPassive: Falling below 50% health grants you 20% attack speed, 10% life steal and 10% spell vamp until you exit combat - 30 second cooldown.\n\nLike SERIOUSLY? WHO IN THE WORLD THOUGHT OF THIS???\n\nYes, the item was undertuned before. The double stacks per melee attack and unique passive alone would have been a sufficient buff though. No need to add on a potential 32% AS, 24AD, and make it cheaper while gold income increased and other costs went up! \n\nWITHOUT the passive when fully stacked it's over 200% gold efficient (235?) and again double stacks on melee so anyone with an auto attack reset can get it fully stacked in a matter of less than 2 seconds (oh, and stacks count up on minions too...).","replies":[{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-11-17T03:06:26.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerfs you forgot:\n\nLoses\n>Unique Passive: Falling below 50% health grants you 20% attack speed, 10% life steal and 10% spell vamp until you exit combat - 30 second cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-11-17T03:26:59.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, that wasn't on the Wiki :( I felt like something was missing.

The removal of stacks-on-spells makes it quite a bit harder for some champions to get the bonuses in a reasonable time-frame to affect an engagement that they weren't already preparing for.

Replace 10% of the CDR on IBG with 5% movement speed and problem solved for it's stats. replace zeal with recurve bow and make it do 30 on hit magic damage and have 30% attack speed again and something that after rageblade is nerfed be it stats or cost will be worth calling the goo to item for the likes of most of the champs who have classically gotten trinity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-11-17T03:07:43.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've only seen Corki with TF so far.
