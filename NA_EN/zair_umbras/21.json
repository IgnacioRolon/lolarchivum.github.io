She had this exact same problem in the old jungle, having issues during her first clear, but being able to get her spirit stone kept her able to sustain in the jungle, especially mana-wise. They are giving her a minor buff to that passive to ease the jungle-to-lane mana regen by giving her an extra 1% of her missing mana per sec, meaning 2% of missing per second, while in her stealth, but that doesn't help her health. The jungle item really doesn't provide real sustain. Most champions have noticed that the jungle REALLY hurts and have adapted builds around it, usually by increasing burst, smiting the red buff, getting a Ranger's, but where does Evelynn sit when she has to start on blue side, which means Gromp or blue start then to blue or Wolves afterwards? I mean, starting E and smiting the Krugs can help a lot since Riot is adding in the ability for her E to apply on-hit effects, making it count as 2 extra AA's when it comes to the Krug buff, BUT.... That means she's SoL when it comes to mana. Thanks to that incredible nerf at the beginning of S4 that turned her into an AD Jungler rather than AP, her Q now costs a LOT of mana to use and it's her main clearing. With items, she can SCALE well into late, but she requires blue buff non-stop now due to the mana issue. \n\nTo cut it short, she's ungodly squishy in the current jungle, has incredible mana issues since the new jungle items don't provide mana regen for her to spam her Q to clear. Her clear speeds are incredibly slow, especially since they're BUFFING the health on the smaller minions in camps. Slow clear speeds, mana issues, low damage early on, and since her Q does magic and her E does physical, she has no real AD or AP identification.\n\nWhat would you guys LOGICALLY say would help without breaking her? She can scale into the late game as both AP and AD, but she requires items, something that's in low supply in the jungle, but she's got far too many mana issues, no gap closer, incredibly low burst potential early on, and very squishy, so much so that she can't lane.\n\nPersonally, I say making her E do magic damage would make her completely viable again. Her Q is a lot of a damage, but her was a huge amount of AP Eve's burst and AD Eve is just a kitable wall, much like AD Sion pre-rework.","replies":[]}
