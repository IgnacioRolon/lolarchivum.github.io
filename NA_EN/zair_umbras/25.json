Figured I&#039;d go ahead and ask what Riot actually has planned for Rek&#039;Sai. Whether she&#039;s supposed to be the Land Shark (Involves doing DAMAGE and being BRUISERISH) or simply just a Mole Rat (AKA Fallout series. Irritating, does no damage, but keeps you from doing what you need to do, yet doesn&#039;t really do anything.). \r\n\r\nI may not be the one to talk the most about her as I don&#039;t play her often anymore, ever since her nerfs she&#039;s been declining and I&#039;ve had to work on builds to make that work, but they don&#039;t feel right, like having to get heavy sustain items like a Bloodthirster to keep her fury up long enough to be able to get off that E before you die and I&#039;ll get into why I say that!\r\n\r\nOkay, Rek&#039;Sai in a nut shell... Her Q is the equivalent of Xin&#039;s without a knock up. Xin&#039;s Q is 15-75 on the next 3 AA&#039;s ability and Rek&#039;s is the same concept, but doesn&#039;t have the knock up, is AoE and does 25-55, a good trade off overall. Her borrowed Q is a good last hitter on an escaping champion and it&#039;s great for fishing out enemies in bushes or getting vision in general. Her W lets her borrow down to reduce her rage by 20% per sec to heal for 25xRek&#039;Sai&#039;s level, which isn&#039;t a whole hell of a lot but can be useful early on and this ability also lets her unborrow for a decent base damage and decent AD ratio plus it knocks enemies up, only able to be proc once every 6s. Her E is a HUGE hitting ability that, when maxed fury, does 240% of her AD as TRUE DAMAGE. This ratio sounds scary and that&#039;s because it IS. It&#039;s of her TOTAL AD, so with only a Hydra, you can have about 200 AD to do 240 base damage, going up to 480 TRUE DAMAGE with ONLY a Hydra. In comparison, Darius&#039;s R does 100-300 base true damage plus 75% of BONUS AD, going up to 200-600 true damage plus 150% of bonus AD. That&#039;s on an immobile Juggernaut compared to Rek&#039;Sai who&#039;s a high mobility land shark on top of the fact Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s E is a 12s CD (Down to 7.2s with maxed CDR) with the only requirement being her Fury. The other half of her E is her tunnels that keep her clear speeds up there on top of making her own jungle one big trap. Her R gives her a good passive AS boost since the other half is a map-pressure based ability that is cancelled upon taking _**ANY**_ damage.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s kit. Now that we&#039;re familiar with it and what it does, let&#039;s go ahead and see where she&#039;s been nerfed as a whole. Her Q has been nerfed twice, once from a 40% ratio to 30% on the next 3 AA&#039;s, then down to 20%. Her W has been nerfed from 50% to 40%. Her health has been nerfed from 611 to 570. She&#039;s also had the bases on her Q and W tweaked, which was all fine and dandy. Her tunnels kept her clear speeds up and her W was a ton of burst damage that you kept on CD to maximize CC. What part of her base 3 abilities hasn&#039;t been touched though? The one that does TRUE damage, where most of her damage sits. Weird, isn&#039;t it? The ability that&#039;s so reliant on her fury, which has been nerfed this patch is the only one that hasn&#039;t been touched because it&#039;s &#039;situational&#039;. I... I don&#039;t get it. Why can&#039;t we nerf this ability. When it&#039;s gotten off, it&#039;s way too damn good and because of that, her power has been shaved off of everything else, so much so that her original design of getting a Devourer and Hydra, then a couple of tanky items and maybe a last damage item has been completely demolished in favor of just being super tanky and pressing E for undodgeable, unignorable damage that will hurt unless you build health. You won&#039;t see Cho or Darius losing power in their normal abilities because their R hits too hard. You won&#039;t see Twitch&#039;s damage nerfed because his passive does 300 true damage over the course of the poison with max stacks. You won&#039;t see Corki&#039;s kit nerfed because his passive did too much damage (In fact, it was DIRECTLY nerfed back in the day because it used to do 10% of the ENTIRE AA, meaning it did more if you crit)... But Rek&#039;Sai suffers time and time again...\r\n\r\nWhy must Rek&#039;Sai be a mole rat rather than a land shark? She&#039;s supposed to be a threat at all times of the fight, not just when she has 100 fury. If she doesn&#039;t have 100% fury, she&#039;s almost completely ignorable after the knock up. Seriously. Her Q does 55 damage plus 20% of her bonus AD, which is usually around 100 bonus AD with just the Hydra, so it does 75 extra damage... 3 times. That&#039;s 225 extra damage in total added to three AA&#039;s. Her Q is about the same concept at Xin, yet Xin&#039;s Q does 20% of his **_total_** AD rather than bonus. Her W is a 6s CD knock up not affected by CDR that does a max of 200 (It&#039;s maxed last, so it&#039;s not oftenly used for damage) and its base at level 1 is 40 plus 50% of bonus, so it does 90 damage for a while. Her E has no base, but it does 120% of her AD when maxed, 240% with maxed fury and does true damage at max fury. When you look at her kit, her damage is thrown into her E. Nearly ALL of it, &#039;cause I&#039;ll run the numbers rather quickly. Q makes her AA&#039;s do about 225 extra damage (All 3 of them in total) on a 4s CD, so you can do this 3 times in the time your E takes to recharge. Your E, with the same items and everything, will do about 480 TRUE DAMAGE. So, that&#039;s 675 compared to 480. The Q does more in concept... but the average carry has about 50 armor at max level. 50 armor is about (50/150 since the formula is armor/armor+100) 1/3 reduction. So 675 is actually 550. That&#039;s on an ADC. Your Q will do 70 damage more damage... That&#039;s if it worked like that. Her Q&#039;s CD starts after the 3rd hit, not before. She has .667 base AS and gains up to 34% from base leveling and 60% from her R, so that&#039;s 94%, which means she has a total of 1.3ish attacks per second. So for 3 attacks, it&#039;ll take about 2.3ish seconds to get off all 3. Needless to say, she can get her E off in about 2 Q&#039;s rather than 3, which is a lot less damage. \r\n\r\nSo.... Yeah. There&#039;s the math and stuff... So! Do you guys agree that she seems like she&#039;s just a mole rat since she doesn&#039;t do damage outside of when she unborrows for the &#039;surprise&#039; or do you think her E being all of her damage still seem fitting to being a Land Shark?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I hope her E takes a proper nerf rather than her fury gains getting nerfed like they were this patch so that her other abilities can be properly balanced around her kit. I mean, she&#039;s an AA-based champion with an AA reset that affects her next 3 AA&#039;s and an AS steroid, but her damage is loaded into a single, long CD nom. I think we can all be fine with squishy Rek&#039;Sais running around than knock up bot cinderhulks facetanking and doing relatively nothing else.","replies":[{"poster":"Juicyman","date":"2015-09-23T12:56:22.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't want her doing damage so we nerfed her damage.\nWe don't want her being a CC bot because we want her as a bruiser, so we nerfed her CC.\nBut we didn't buff her damage, we nerfed it again.\n\nMole Rat","replies":[]}]}
