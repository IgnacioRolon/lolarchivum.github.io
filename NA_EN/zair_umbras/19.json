And a total kick in the balls for the people who play him. It is good to see things that lead players to try champions that they weren't attracted to before (I might buy Fiora now), but Riot should listen first to the people who have played and cared and experimented and known the Champion for years.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-08-04T22:06:24.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played him quite a bit, actually. I haven't used him lately, no. My last couple of games I've used him, but that was before I even saw anything. I have a build on Warframe using a Magister because I love Morde and one of the songs I've listened to repeatedly for the last couple years is 6v4 by AoD. lol. Just because I don't main him doesn't mean much. I don't main any one champion. I player everything.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-08-04T21:28:18.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many simple minded people getting hyped up over the gimmicky as hell novelty of being able to control a dragon for 30 seconds.\n\nBlind to the fact that every other part of Mordekaiser is getting gutted.","replies":[]}]}
