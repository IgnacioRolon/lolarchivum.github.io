You finally get three people to agree on something fun like Brand or Yasuo and you&#039;ll end up with the person who chose something boring like Zed and then when you&#039;re trying to pick something interesting, you get three people who chose Tahm fricken Kench because they think 5 YOLO-Qers will be able to do the Tahm eating Tahm eating Tahm, etc. combo just to surrender at 20 because it was a stupid idea. It&#039;s bad enough the picks always seem to favor some of the more boring champions like Nunu, Blitz, and Tahm, but the fact it&#039;s not even static in choosing random or choosing the majority is just... seriously. &gt;.&lt;\r\n\r\nAlso, I vote for Blitz, Veigar, Tahm, Nunu, and Heimerdinger to be removed from One For All like Karthus and Teemo are. At least Teemo and Karthus, you&#039;re having fun making your enemies unhappy while when you&#039;ve got 15 heimer turrets pushing down a lane, you&#039;re just sitting there waiting for the game to end because you can&#039;t do anything to it and when you&#039;re playing it, you can&#039;t really do anything because the enemies can&#039;t do anything. Blitz and Tahm of course are just trolly with people trying to do funny combos and failing to do such... constantly until there&#039;s finally a surrender vote at 20, lol. Nunu is just painful for everyone. When you use him, you snowball and that&#039;s it. When you&#039;re playing against him, you get snowballed and cry.","replies":[]}
