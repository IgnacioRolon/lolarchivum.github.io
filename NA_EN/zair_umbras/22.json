So far, we all know it&#039;s pretty much a full rework, Sion-level kinda stuff... but...\r\n\r\nIs she going to be AD or AP? The current Poppy can do AP Assassin or go Bruiser-ish. Her choice in TrinityPhreak or Lichbane has never really been a problem, but most champions that get reworked end up one or the other, much like Sion can&#039;t really go AP without it being overly trolly since his E doesn&#039;t have much of a ratio and his W now takes 3 seconds before it pops. AD Nid took a slap in the face with that mini-rework. AP Taric got smashed, pun intended, and his wasn&#039;t even much of a rework, just his W losing its ratio. AP Yi (THANK GOD) got removed. AP Trist just isn&#039;t the same and never will be. \r\n\r\nSo what will be the focus of our Demacian Smurf? Will she be screaming DEMACIA as her Hammer pummels them into the ground or will she scream DEMACIA as she smashes them into the wall for half their health bar with a Luden&#039;s Echo?\r\n\r\nAlso! If she keeps an Auto-Reset in her kit, will it be Physical or Magical? THERE&#039;S JUST SO LITTLE BEING SAID ABOUT THE BEST SMURF IN THE GAME. QQ","replies":[]}
