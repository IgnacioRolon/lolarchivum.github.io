It&#039;s preseason, I expect that.\r\n\r\nWith all these changes, I can&#039;t seem to get through even one game without the ungodly negativity coming out of at least 1 or 2 of my teammates unless I&#039;m playing Brand and going 5/0 in the first 4 minutes. I&#039;m tempted to just move onto another game until we get some hotfixes not because the imbalances need to be fixed, but because of my allies being so damn negative about everything because &#039;So op!&#039; &#039;Such a worthless champ&#039; &#039;Mages are so useless&#039; etc. People are going from &#039;Damn, I messed up.&#039; to &#039;SCREW PRESEASON, THIS IS STUPID.&#039; when in fact it wasn&#039;t anything preseason did, it&#039;s the mistakes people are making BECAUSE of the changes from preseason. \r\n\r\nThis is just some insane stuff. Heck, last game I asked our Udyr jungle to gank bot since we were against a Sona and MF bot as Nami and Sivir. MF and Sona is really oppressive, but that&#039;s fine. That&#039;s their -role-. What isn&#039;t fine is instead of a gank, I get &#039;lol this Sivir&#039; and &#039;/all Report Nami and Sivir for being toxic&#039; and crap. Our Nami was nearly silent all game and my only words to Udyr were &#039;GANK UDYR&#039; followed by more pings for help since he was farming scuttle while we had Sona and MF at the turret. x.x \r\n\r\nNever, ever experienced this sort of toxicity before and I&#039;ve played every preseason from S3 to now S6. I&#039;ve been in Bronze and I&#039;ve been up to plat (Where I am now) and until this preseason, the worse I&#039;ve seen is the usual BoxBox wanna-be Rivens, Blue Build Pulsefire Ezreals, and Faker wanna-be Zeds talking like they&#039;re big. That&#039;s all of one person usually in a game, but now it&#039;s entire teams just insulting each other because of the chaos this preseason has brought. I almost don&#039;t want to play until this is all fixed just because I&#039;d rather not hear it from my teammates.\r\n\r\nWhat about you guys? How are you holdin&#039; up this preseason?","replies":[]}
