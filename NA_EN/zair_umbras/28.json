I was playing fine earlier today and the PBE was even working fine for me, but tonight, I randomly kept having my game freeze up. It was like a ping lag, like when it flashes attempting to reconnect where everything just stops moving and stands in place doing the idle animations. I really have no idea what was up since each time it did this, I switched to my browser to check if I was having issues, but it was always perfectly fine. I had to exit the game then reconnect everytime it froze up. I don't know what was causing it to do this though. I know in the same game, the enemy Kalista wasn't ever able to connect.\r\n\r\nI'll note, this was on Hexakill and I want to try another game, but I don't want to cost my teammates a fun game if I'm going to be DC'ing left and right all game long.","replies":[]}
