I normally sit around 50ish latency, but about a weekish ago, I started sitting in the 80's. Normally I'd be fine with this, but unlike my old 50 latency, I don't sit at one standard number. When I had about 50 latency, I went from 49-52 and that was it. Now I'm sitting at 83 and jumping to into the 90's, which is a huuuuuuuge difference. I went ahead and tried literally everything that was explained anywhere I could find it. I disabled IPv6, did the ipconfig flushes, restarted my router and modem, went ahead and forwarded all the ports, disabled my own anti-virus, and everything. What made this all worse is the fact that when I ping the server from Command prompt? IT SAYS I'M IN THE 50'S. WTF? It says my latency should be COMPLETELY normal when I ping the server. I also have done repeated speedtests, which shows my net as completely stable, so I'm at a complete loss as to why my ping is sitting at an abnormal number. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, before anyone complains about having 100-300 ping constantly, I know 80-90 isn't horrible, but I'm just completely at a loss as to what happened to my once good ping. I even talked to my friend who also lives in California, though they're closer to San Francisco while I sit in the Mojave desert area of California, but they've noted their ping being less than usual, sitting closer to the 20's when they once sat closer to the 80's. I don't know if the server was randomly moved and nothing was mentioned or what, but I'm completely confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-16T07:19:30.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumps?","replies":[]}]}
