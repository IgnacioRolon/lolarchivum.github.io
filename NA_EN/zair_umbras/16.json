And yes, I know, there's many that are going to defend her incredibly heavily, but... Why is she allowed to have such instantaneous stunning power? I mean, Veigar used to have the same, but they changed his because they felt their wasn't any counterplay to it, so instead of nerfing the range, they gave it a delay. Annie has two abilities that are both AoE and have less than .2s of delay. Her W is completely instance while her R has about a .2ish delay for her to throw the bear. \r\n\r\nI should also note the only other AoE stuns are all delayed or can be dodged in some sort of way due to some kind of indicator. Leona's R has a small delay and her Q lights her shield up. Braums R has him jump up into the air, pointing at the direction of where he's going to toss it and his passive shows when you're going to get stunned to a certain degree. Sona's R shows her strum the cords and you even see the wave of light go at you. Zyra's E is like Sona's R and her own R is delayed just to do damage and further delayed before it actually knocks up. Malphite's and Hecarim's R have them charging at a location....\r\n\r\nAll in all, every form of AoE CC has a delay, long cooldown, low damage, or any of the combination of those. Annie's stun only has one indicator and that's the swirling smoke around her, but that doesn't tell you that it's coming, it simply says she can use it. She has no delays or any true indicators while having huge base damages.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Should Annie get some delays of SOME kind or some travel time with her R to make her not so incredibly Dominant as a support?","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-03-15T20:16:17.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie is totally getting an \"Annie throws Tibbers to a target point\", with an animation like the one from that cinematic.

That's like the whole point of being Annie.  If you make her have to hit stuff every 6-8 seconds, she'll be Qing baron randomly, her team will make sure the crab stays alive, etc.  \n\nIt's a hack that produces weird gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-03-15T21:11:53.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"True. But still better than everlasting zoning passive if you ask me.\n\nAnother option would be to just give her ult a built in stun and give her a different passive. I quite like her identity as a spellslinger so maybe something like \"casting spells increase spell damage by 5% for 6 seconds (stacking up to 5 times)\" or something to her cdr or spell cooldowns.\nBut I'm sure people would not be ready to lose her early game stuns.","replies":[{"poster":"Snake Town","date":"2015-04-11T01:00:01.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vonler,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8QopFA9O,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-15T21:11:53.704+0000)\n>\n> Another option would be to just give her ult a built in stun and give her a different passive. \n\nI actually like that idea alot, maybe give her passive something like a ramping speed buff with spell casts and maybe give her q or w a slow so she can still compete in lane","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-03-15T20:35:49.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem is they need to stop nerfing champs who dont need nerfs.
