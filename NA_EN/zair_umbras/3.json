My computer isn't known to have issues. It's about a two year old computer, runs everything fine, even runs the PBE fine and ran this current patch on the PBE perfectly fine, but for some odd reason it lags my computer to hell and back at certain points. These points are when I first open up the launcher, my computer freezes up and I can't do anything but sit there for a good, 10-30s waiting for just the launcher to properly load up. Then the same issue happens when I click Launch and I have to wait for the Login to pop up, then it sorta lags while logging in. All of this seems to be graphical and it's a bit annoying to say the least.\r\n\r\nI dunno what's happening. I know my computer isn't top tier, but it's been doing wonderfully on medium graphics for so long.","replies":[{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2015-07-27T00:34:47.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nTry [reinstalling the Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/318378) aswell as Adobe AIr and Adobe Flash.\n\nRegards Rkoturdo","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-27T01:19:28.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently it was my Adobe Air.
