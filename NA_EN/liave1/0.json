I never really asked for compensation or anything of that sort because I felt that it was my fault, I should have been more careful. This game I was at the enemy nexus about to end the game however I lagged out for 5-6 minutes (enough for leaver buster). After I came back we quickly ended the game and it was over however my 5 leaver buster games refreshed and I did not gain LP. I am not making this forum post to get LP but simply to remove 1 leaver buster game. I know I left for a couple minutes and the team could have lost because I was not there. But because I was there initially I gave the team hope that we could win the game, I never asked for many things but the one small thing I ask for is for 1 leaver buster game to be removed from my account. I am not asking for LP or any compensation for all the times I lagged out (it was my fault) but just for 1 leaver buster. Thank you for taking your time to read this.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nI left a league game for 5 minutes and am asking to remove 1 leaver buster game from my previous queue. The only reason why I am asking is that one of my teammates even said that it was dumb that I got the leaver buster for being away from a couple minutes in spite of being crucial in winning the game.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with this, please don't go hard and say something like \"no you absolutely deserve that leaver buster, and you do not deserve any reward and in fact should be granted a harsher penalty\". It was my internet. I'd appreciate if you disagree with me \"gently\", thank you.\r\n\r\n-Liave1","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T01:10:49.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, I kinda feel you here. I definitely understand your point, but I can't directly alter those in-game 'punishments' like leaverbusters nor do we have the ability to only remove 1 leaverbuster game. I'd like to have you go ahead and update a couple network settings juuuuust to try and make sure this doesn't happen again. Update your Port Forwarding and DNS settings with the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), and then test it in a custom game.","replies":[]}]}
