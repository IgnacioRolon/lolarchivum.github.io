I often queue as bot/support and get placed as jungle (always jungle), sometimes several times in a row, after dodges.  This is really tilting because it's so unexpected.  I double checked my selected roles every time someone dodged, just because maybe I mistakenly chose incorrectly, but neither was jungle.\r\n\r\nHave I misunderstood the way the system works?  Are they both just preferred roles, and you can still be stuck in any role?  \r\n\r\nIf so, why is this even a thing, and why is there a fill option if you're technically required to fill anyway...??\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I primarily play on the Japan server, and it is annoyingly neglected and outdated in many ways, so maybe that's relevant?  I'd still say it's something to be looked into, if this isn't an intentional outcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T18:25:19.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your preferred roles are not guaranteed if auto-fill is enabled, which happens if not enough players of a certain role around your tier are queuing up.  The only time you are truly guaranteed your preferred roles are if you're in your promos.
