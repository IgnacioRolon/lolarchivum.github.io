I can buy it on the NA site with this account, and I've used it here as well.  The card is a Visa that I got in Japan.\n\nI've tried to send support tickets to Riot Japan, but NOBODY responds to my issues on the Japan server.  I can't buy prepaid cards here, even, as I can't redeem NA ones on the Japanese client.  \n\nI'm assuming it's an issue that I'm physically in the US, but trying to use the store on the Japan-only client.  Still, it's getting frustrating. What can I do?\n\nEDIT: Additionally, I've tried using a proxy, with no luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-24T15:48:23.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a particularly sticky situation you're left in.
