She&#x27;s got one of the least reliable CCs as a result (skillshot that stops on first target, giving a lot of counterplay in lane especially).\n\nBut many of the champions I listed have the range to compensate the lack of mobility. Ahri even happens to have both. Yasuo's mobility has no CD if he has multiple target at his disposal. Annie, Veigar and Zyra have their hard CC disable on a very large AoE. Annie's Tibbers stun is near impossible to avoid without stellar ping and burning Flash. I would gladly face pre-rework Kass or LB with her old silence rather than Annie in her current state (which incidentally is the state where she has been forever, since apparently you guys think she should be immune to nerfs despite standing for everything you're supposed to hate about champion design, her kit's more binary than any champion's, past or present, that I can think of).\n\nWhen I look at Kassadin especially, I see the shadow of a great champion, everything he had was nerfed for the sake of his mobility, then the mobility got nerfed to the point where Kassadin is extremely underwhelming until he's almost fully geared, at which point everyone is powerful anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-06-30T22:55:01.776+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except Annie, Veigar, and Zyra have no way of getting on to you.

They don't need to GET to you because they have RANGE. Being outside of Annie's range, especially, means you're outside of xp range.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-07-01T03:12:51.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...What?
