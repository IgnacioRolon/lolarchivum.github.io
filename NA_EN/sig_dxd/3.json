Flat being 0.4 and % was 0.5 ratio. Along with a nerf to change the flat heal lower, but with a better to ap for more focus toward ap build rather than tank.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-11-22T01:32:49.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Making the burst better suited for mage karma and the sustained healing better for tank karma is an actually quite neat idea. I will keep it in the back of my mind.\n\n2) Scaling the heal with basic-ability levels is what I don't like. If the mantra effect isn't dependent on the level of mantra itself, it favours one ability over the other, making choosing between mantras a non-factor; you always mantra the ability you level.\nTo give karma free choices and make the decision a skillcheck, mantras need to stay comparable and thus should level equally.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-11-22T01:55:03.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no. we dont want that slu- champion at mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-21T16:46:04.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Swain is meant to be durable.
