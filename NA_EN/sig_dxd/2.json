[Check for yourself.](http://champion.gg/champion/Kindred/Jungle) She's not a warrior jungle and Warrior actually is god awful on her considering her AD ratios are pure crap. 20% on Q, 40% on W (That's the highest since it's the only one that attacks often, but it'll spaz the hell out if any walls are around or if you switch targets), and 20% on E. Complete. And. Utter. Garbage ratios. She scales with Attack Speed and that's really it.","replies":[{"poster":"Beuhlakor","date":"2015-10-24T22:24:58.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually building Devourer on her is crap.\n\nWarrior is ten times stronger if you play Kindred with a lot of armor pen. You are right to say her abilities scaling is god awful.\n\nBut her passive and her AA are her main source of damages. And building a shitload of armor pen through runes and items (flat and %) on her is ten times stronger than any build with Devourer, in fact, armor pen gives her huge damages against both squishies and tanky targets.\n\nIf Devourer had not been nerfed, I would agree with you that Devourer > Warrior on Kindred. Unfortunately, Devourer is now simply garbage for ranged champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-24T23:34:05.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You.... you don't use Devourer for the extra AA, you use it for the AS. o.o The damage and such is just a bonus, really. Kindred has a base of .625 and gains 42.5% AS by level 18. Considering if you get rid of the Devourer, you only have 40% from BotRK and 10% from Trinity unless you're going to add in some random as heck AS item. Crit is near worthless on her since she's all about her passive's damage, which is why AS is her best stat. Plus her base AD at max is only 86, so PD without an IE is, again, worthless. Honestly, Trinity is almost worthless on her because it only gives a maximum of 172 damage compared to the usual 200+ on every other ADC. \n\nYou're best off with a Devourer just because of the AS. Warrior gives 45 AD and 10 ArP, which against a squishy, that's not bad. That's 45 extra damage per AA and then 10 ArP (Which honestly doesn't add much against a big beefy tank and even falls off against squishies unless you stack it with the 19 max from runes). Devourer gives about .3125 extra attacks per sec plus 30 base per AA and at Sated, it gives 50 damage per AA on top of an extra attack every 4th AA. So in 4 attacks with a Warrior, you'll have 1 extra attack via the AS and 1 extra shot of your passive instead with the devourer. So that's 6 passive and BotRK hits as well as 6 shots of the 50 magic damage, totaling (We'll say you only have your base 6 camps) 300 magic damage and 6 shots of 15.5%(7.5% from passive, 8% from BotRK) current health. So in the same time as 4 shots of 15.5% and 180 (4 times 45 AD) physical damage, you'll have done the 300 magic damage, 5 AA's worth of damage and 6 shots of your 15.5%.\n\nI dunno about you, but the DPS boost from a Devourer just seems so much better in every form of the word and I'll prove to you that the ArP is actually worthless.\n\nSay you're attacking a level 9 ADC with your Warrior enchant. We'll say it's Vayne since she's the most common. At level 9, Vayne has about 42 base armor, plus 9 from her runes for a total of 51. 51 is about 33.33% (About a third since the equation is Armor divided by Armor+100, so 51/151, which is about 1/3rd) where as with a Warrior, that 51 is now a 41. 41/141 is about 29%. That's a 4% difference in damage. Almost negligible.\n\nNow, we'll say you're maxed off in levels, you've got your your Warrior, BotRK, LW, and a Trinity Force. Vayne won't have any bonus armor, just for easy stuff. She'll have 77 base with 9 from runes, so 86 armor in total. LW makes you ignore about 40% of that, so you're at about 42 armor. GUESS WHAT? NUMBERS ARE THE SAME AT LEVEL 9 PRE-LW! Hah. Yeah. 4% difference. Seriously. You're pretty much trading DPS that helps with Baron, Dragon, jungling, and against tanks to do 4% more to a squishy. Wanna know what it does to a tank with 200 armor? Well, 40% off of 200 is 120. 120 is about 54.5% and 110 is 52.3%. That's 2.2% difference. I'd rather have an extra attack every 3s and an extra shot of passive and BotRK every 4th hit, which with Devourer and BotRK alone at max level is... 42% from levels, 40% from BotRK, 50% from Devourer, so that's 132% bonus, meaning you do around 1.45 attacks per second, which is around 3 attacks per 2s. In 3s, you'll do 4 attacks for 5 procs of your passive and BotRK whereas with a Warrior enchant, you'll only have 82%, though with a Trinity you could have 92%. That's about 1.19 attacks per sec. It'd take about 5s before that .19 turns into a full attack gained where-as the .45 will be noticed about every 2s. \n\nSo... Yeah... Devourer on her is... a ton better. A lot more DPS in comparison to... 4% bonus to squishy... Like... lulz....\n\nAlso, Wolf, your W, scales off of 50% of your bonus attack speed... and he's got the same base as you.. So Devourer gives him 25% boosted AS.","replies":[{"poster":"Jacht","date":"2015-10-25T14:40:52.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RT0JIY2B,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-10-24T23:34:05.546+0000)\n>\n> You.... you don't use Devourer for the extra AA, you use it for the AS. o.o The damage and such is just a bonus, really.
