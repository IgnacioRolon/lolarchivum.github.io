There have been too many games where I get harassed as the jungler because one of my laners has had to wait 10 or so minutes for a gank, then they proceed to troll. It&#039;s really annoying when you are trying to stay ahead in gold and xp so that you are strong enough that a gank will be a guaranteed kill or flash burned. I&#039;m not claiming to be a perfect or even a good jungler, but sometimes people can be unreasonable. This should also be true for any other lane, I personally used to think all adcs are trash but after playing adc a few times in team builder I realized it was harder than I thought. So basically play every role, especially jungle or support, before you start playing ranked so you know how patient you have to be with your teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"SeductiveGrandpa","date":"2015-03-29T01:46:34.071+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before you start playing ranked:\nDON'T F(Censored by Rito Games)ING TEST OUT THE NEWEST CHAMPION YOU JUST BOUGHT.","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-03-29T06:02:56.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}} \"Calm down I gotta learn this guy somehow\"","replies":[{"poster":"DswujRrrKh","date":"2015-03-29T14:48:05.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ravoria,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=f8GR5Mzc,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-03-29T06:02:56.676+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:412}} \"Calm down I gotta learn this guy somehow\"\n\nOr {{champion:432}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Kill Commies","date":"2015-03-28T18:23:39.746+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"10 minutes is pretty long for 0 ganks...","replies":[{"poster":"Wint3rSoldi3r","date":"2015-03-28T19:45:57.160+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you farm the jungle, if nearby laners have pushed their lanes far up, there might not be ganks for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-03-28T22:46:51.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's this little thing called an \"in-lane gank\" ;)","replies":[{"poster":"50CrazyOwnz","date":"2015-03-29T15:24:27.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"don't talk like you know how to do it. you spent 2 much time waiting for a in-lane gank and how about mid you gonna inlane gank that too? you wait too much and becomea lower lvl which means you fall down like a rock go and do some study bitch before you go and blame more junglers","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-03-29T20:25:19.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so a couple of things.  First off, I'm a jungle main, so yes I \"know how to do it\".  Secondly, you can't in lane gank mid, unless you count someone like rammus trying to go in through the front.  That it just a pointless straw-man fallacy you have constructed.  Thirdly, you do gain experience while you do an in-lane gank since the minions will be dying around you.  Now this obviously won't be nearly as much as if you were farming you jungle since it's split with 2/3 people, but it isn't negligible.  Fourthly, in-lane ganks are in my opinion the riskiest type of gank as they are the most time consuming, but are often the most powerful if one gives them time to go off.  Fifthly, why would you assume that I'm blaming junglers, when I main it myself?  What I'm instead doing is pointing out to an alternate technique that is specifically made for when the lane is normally ungankable because of how far up it is pushed.  And on a Sixth and more minor note, you may wish to \"do some study\" on how to form the present-progressive tense before you try to use a phrase that necessitates it to try to form your flimsy and meaningless ad hominem attack. ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-28T23:51:39.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't help if you have to dive a full HP enemy under tower.\n\nWhat you really look for when they are pushed up is a countergank.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-03-29T20:27:01.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I would definitely agree that counter-ganking is probably the best kind of gank, I would also question why you would try to dive someone if you're doing an in-lane gank?

I used to just think that ADC mains were just always mad for no reason, but they legit get so much abuse, and I play jungle. Laning phase is okay as long as you don't die or feed, but after that is where it gets hard. Your team wants you to be with them all the time in the team deathmatch that is bronze, but it's also kind of important to not lose that bot turret. My last game as Vayne I got fed, but my mid laner (who was feeding) felt there was a need to roam bot all game, even when I just backed, and fed our Draven. Long story short Draven got fed, I couldn't do anything, and the blame got put on me. You know why? I wasn't helping Katarina feed Draven because I just backed. I get a double kill in team fight and start clearing the waves to push while team gets ambushed chasing a kill, next thing you know you got the Taric writing in chat \"F**king idiot vayne farming instead of team fighting\" I got reported by him post game for unskilled.  I even asked the enemy Draven post match how I was throughout the game.
