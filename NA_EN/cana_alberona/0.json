Then I saw I had a low priority queue. I was confused before checking my match history and realizing there were games I didn't play. I feel it's unfair I have to wait 20 minutes to play a game for something I didn't even do. I changed my password and everything now, but I still have to wait through these queues and it pisses me off. Please help. Because a lot of times, I don't have the time to play off these queues. What I find weirdest is that I didn't get the queue until I actually closed my client and went back in. The other games I didn't have to wait. For anyone who wants to check my match history, it's the {{champion:77}}   game and the ARAM {{champion:432}}  game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T18:32:36.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you've played through the rest of the LPQ's on your account, so that's good. It was definitely a good move to change your password, and I recommend also checking out [this article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) about account security as well. It's important to keep your account really secure so stuff like this doesn't happen in the future.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
