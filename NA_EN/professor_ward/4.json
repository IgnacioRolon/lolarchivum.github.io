(Or maybe it was reworked/buffed/new) The FoTM isn't necessarily easy to win with, for instance right now Ryze is kind of FoTM because a pro player won a game with a good realm warp. That doesn't mean realm warp is good in randoms, as people aren't coordinated enough to monopolize on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-10T21:27:32.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're not alone in thinking it meant freelo","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-10T21:02:56.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"FotM means popular; Flavor of the Month.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-02-10T21:03:57.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being FOTM doesn't not mean it is a means of climbing out or OP, it means it is popular (which doesn't always mean the champion is OP, sometimes they are just a new addition, or had a skin recently, etc).","replies":[]}]}
