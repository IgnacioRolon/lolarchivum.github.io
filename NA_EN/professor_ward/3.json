The work that goes into them has to take a the interaction of a bunch of different gameplay needs into consideration. Whenever that's true, tradeoffs are almost always involved. It sucks taking away things players probably like, and in a game with a bunch of players, some number of players could surely be attached to pretty much anything in the game you could point at.  Those tradeoffs are difficult and painful to make. In this case, we trade off Bandit being something that many players likely enjoy as an incentive to reduce item bloat and cut off abuse cases. If you really don't like the tradeoff we've made in this case, and you continue to feel this way moving forward, I do encourage you to keep expressing that sentiment.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-03-10T04:17:01.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it really the items, or the role you're trying to force people into playing?

Pros always 90% of the time the combined sightstone already instead of these &quot;powerfull actives&quot;. cause it gives space in the inveontory for farther, more powerfull items and controlwards, they costed less as going rubys and an active supportitem while you had most time more impact. Face of the mountain was a little bit diffrent cause it allowed tanksupports to do the same as shieldsupports.\n> And to upgrade targosn is realy worth cause you need the hp considering your next items on a tanksupport don&#x27;t give that much health ({{item:3109}} -&gt; {{item:3190}} /{{item:3060}} -&gt; {{item:3050}} , only knights vow gives a little bit of health).\n> \n> And about your active items, {{item:3905}} returned, shureliyahs reverie comes 8.6 too so only items removed are literaly now face of the mountain and rubys sigthstone (but probably you don&#x27;t miss rubys cause it just were boring wards or do you wanna tell me you went that item for the itemcdr ?). Fotm probably gets not an direct equa replacement but a new tanksupp item could come 8.8 or later maybe. ALso locket gets an rework to be less generalize but stronger in the right situations.\n> So stop your whining please, upgrading for 550 Gold to get cdr, health and healthreg while geting wards for free is still far more better as spending 800 gold just on a ward/health item. And for people who critisice that they got their shieldbattery and movementspeed removed from the quests for wards: pre 7.9 quests not even existed. Seeing that you still can earn something with generating your gold, even if they are &quot;just wards&quot;, is still an improvement. and no longer 800 goldpaytax for sightstone.\n\nproblem with this, is that literally over 90% of the games at my elo dont reach full build, completely countering any argument for an item slot.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-03-09T23:35:42.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It allows for more components as well. You may not hit full build of \"completed items\" but items with garbage build paths like Rylais on mage supports were actually awkward to buy with FQC+SS+Boots since it had 3 components and if you wanted all 3 you lost out entirely on control wards. I would much rather be able to carry 5 items of decent value throughout the game and hold control wards than shoehorn a relatively low power active item in solo queue and lose out on control wards or potentially stats down the line (I could keep control wards in the Rylais example but then I lose out on 20 AP or some health).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-03-09T12:12:15.423+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":40,"body":"woah woah woah hold up there bud!\n\nBandit used to be one of GPs things not supports!\n\nYou took it away from him and he did the GP special and burned it all down\n\n\"I will burn it all down if I can't have it!\" {{champion:41}} \n\nOn a more serious note, supports are getting too much gold stuffed up their arse for doing nigh nothing so this is a good change.","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-03-09T12:20:57.742+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":">On a more serious note, supports are getting too much gold stuffed up their arse for doing nigh nothing so this is a good change.\n\nBut removing bandit from these items is even the opposite of your argument isn't it?\n\nAs OP said, removing the bandit causes supports to passively stay around even more.","replies":[]}]}]}
