A sort of, if you dont want to play support unless youre getting kills, dont play support at all, type of thing.

I don't expect Pyke will shake up the Support roster too awful much, but, I think some of the main issues regarding Pyke is that people have some strict views about what Supports do. From the way I understand it, the largest point of conflict comes from the fact that people expect Supports to allow their Carries/Bot lanes/whomever to get the majority of the kills and live vicariously through their carries.\n\nAnd, as it stands, an Assassin playstyle undermines that expectation by a large margin. I think the \"Supports allowing kills\" mindset may wind up reinforced due to the Shutdown Gold changes soon, but, I personally think (especially in some cases) that Supports getting their fair share of kill gold and XP can be beneficial. (it sucks to always be one or two items behind your team, after all).\n\n---\n\nAll that community supposition aside, though, I think it'd also help to do some supposition of Riot's possible motives for this. I mentioned in my initial response to your post that I felt Riot wanted to diversify Support playstyles by adding an Assassin, much like how they added Rakan as a Diver - but, there's another potential reason for it.\n\nOpening everyone up to new playstyles. Whether it's helping introduce Supports to Assassins/Divers whatever other role, or giving people from various other parts of the map (like top lane, jungle, mid) an opportunity to squeeze their way into a role they otherwise wouldn't want to play.\n\nI can understand frustration when your favorite role gets shaken up by new releases or new content, but, hopefully things will unfold in a good way, if not in the way Riot (may) expect it to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2018-05-15T00:51:12.996+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who has hit level 7 on every support in the game outside of Lulu and Braum, I welcome this new champ with open arms.

I personally don't see this as an attempt to make people come play support, but as an attempt to make a unique champion unlike any other for the role. Let's face it, lots of supports have kits that fulfill very similar goals and the ones who are super unique (Bard, Rakan, Thresh to a lesser extent) are all super utility based.\n\nI've been wanting an AD support since season 1 and this is a dream come true for me. The reason Riot has made all the supports either supertanks or AP damage is because an AD support would make the enemy bot just build armor to counter both players, so it makes sense the damage types were split. Pyke on the other hand builds full damage instead of stopping for support item purchases, allowing him to snowball him and his AD way ahead to stay ahead of the armor. I think the design is great and any AD support would have to be a full damage assassin for the reasons I just explained, plus it just puts a unique spin on the game.
