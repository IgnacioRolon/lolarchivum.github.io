With Riots terrible soft resets with the new seasons they force everyone into the same pool. Prior to the wipe 27% of ranked players are bronze and 42% were silver. You dont have to be a rocket scientist to do a little match and realize that it is almost guaranteed in every match a bronze player is in, they will be playing against golds and higher. \n\nForget the problem with Riot using the season as a way of trying to resolve the discrepancy between your rank and your MMR and all the people QQing about having to climb again. The issue Riot should be concerned about is all the players they lost who get incredibly frustrated being ROFL stomped in ranked for 9-10 games because of Riots terrible system. Every person that quits is the loss of potential revenue. I have a really hard time believing Riot is not losing people because their system is matching very low skill players with high skill players. \n\nRiot no longer cares about anything other than money. They are under new ownership, their founders sold out. Riot has sold 7% of their company shares to Tencent Holdings (China conglomerate company) to give them complete ownership. The company and their founders used to care about the players, but they have sold out. The only language Riot speaks now is money. So if you are going to make an argument about something you have to put it in dollars and cents. \n\nTL:DR - Riot has sold out to a Chinese company. They no longer care about the players. They care about money. Riot's system forces 27% of its population to play against much better players. Riot has to be losing people who get fed up with getting owned for 9-10 games in placements. Ignore every other change and you opinion on it their placement system itself has to cause Riot to lose players and money.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2016-01-26T15:03:38.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude you do realise you dont face people just because of your division you face people who have similar MMR","replies":[{"poster":"magic pole","date":"2016-01-26T18:43:39.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"then why bother showing us our division. why bother with divisions at all if it's mmr based.\n\njust show us the fucking mmr of ourself and everyone in our match then and everyone would be much happier and better mentally situated.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2016-01-26T19:26:04.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what silver 3 is, diamond, plat.

However, I do see the issue with  plats being in silver, golds being in bronze, etc. Normally, I would just say play some matches and you'll climb naturally if you're really at that MMR. However, so many people are so far off their MMR that it's going to take a decent chunk of time for that to happen. Instead of being gold with 4 bronze on your team and 5 bronze on their team, you're more likely to have 1 or 2 gold players on the other team as well. It then comes down to luck of which team has more higher-than-expected MMR players instead of skill. Things will stabilize, but it's pain for people in the meantime. I can't even imagine how hard it will be for the legitimately bronze and silver players who are going to eventually get repeatedly stomped because they aren't playing against their own MMR yet.\n\nAs for me, I learned to stay away from ranked at the start and end of a season. The start is a mess with this issue (made worse this year by a harsher reset), and the end is full of people trying to rush rewards and oh-so-many MMR boosters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-01-26T03:55:17.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was plat 1, now im gold 3.
