Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) so we can get an overview of what's happening, and if there's any packet loss.  Let me know what your results are, and we can take a deeper look.","replies":[{"poster":"yougeIIy","date":"2017-07-20T16:23:47.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have also experienced a ping increase of approximately 20. \nhttps://gyazo.com/cd1e8784bbed5ddebf95d8ab4c7b2156\nThe log reader says there is no problem but an increase of 20 ping is huge. From what I can tell, it's not my service provider.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T16:42:58.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, thanks for the logs!  There's always a chance that your ISP is routing you a long way to reach riot direct.  Most commonly, though, your network might be struggling by a more local source.  My recommendation would be to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your settings and strength of your network is solid.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"yougeIIy","date":"2017-07-20T16:57:01.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would this have anything to do with riot updating their routers 2 days ago and players having to re-route? If the answer is yes, is this a permanent ping increase?

There's always a chance though that your routing can change regardless, and sometimes configuring your DNS via the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide can help update that.\n\nYou can also run a traceroute to 104.160.131.1 via [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to see how exactly you're routing.","replies":[{"poster":"yougeIIy","date":"2017-07-20T18:02:32.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already tried configuring my DNS. Is there anything I can ask my service provider to get this fixed? I'm losing games because of high ping and probably getting reported by team for it. I love the game but if I'm going to lose hundreds of lp and get flamed, the game isn't worth playing at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T18:10:03.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't recommend playing anything other than customs while troubleshootings, otherwise you do run the risk of losing more LP.
