I had a previous team, but due to disputes involving schedules two members have parted ways leaving us to fill their spots. \n\n**What is expected from Top Lane:**\nWe want you to play Meta picks like:{{champion:57}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:68}}    , but you can have pocket picks like:{{champion:58}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:24}}    . We are looking for a person that is confident in their position and knows how to handle themselves in tough situations as well as cooperate and talk with fellow team members. We would like someone who enjoys the top lane and does not want to switch positions since top lane is the only one we are looking to fill at the moment. We like to joke and have fun while playing and would love if you were funny and have a sense of humor to help the team communicate and stay close to work as best together as we can. I know these are a lot, but if you meet these prerequisites we would love for you to tryout.\n\n**Support**\nLooking for a dedicated player that knows a lot about warding, shot-calling, and laning. Also looking for an experienced players and can adjust to an ADCs play.\n\n**Also comment down below/tell me in game:**\nWhat are your strengths:\nWhat are your weaknesses:\nWhat your champion pool is\nWhy you are interested in Ranked 5's:\nWill you be dedicated to a Team:\nWhat you can bring to a Team:\n\n**Practice Times and Voice Comms**\nThe schedule for practice is: Monday-Friday: 8pm-12am EST. Saturday and Sunday we will play if everyone is on for a few hours, but we may have a tournament on Saturdays also. \n\n**Skype is required**\n\n**Closing**\nI really hope to hear from anyone that can fit in with these practice times. Thank you for reading this long post. I just want to make sure I gave you a feel for what our team is looking for and what we expect from a potential Top Laner.
