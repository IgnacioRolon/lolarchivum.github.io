I had a previous team, but due to disputes involving schedules two members have parted ways leaving us to fill their spots. We have filled one spot but are still on the lookout for a Top Laner.\n\n**About the Team** \nI started a team last November and being new to team building I lacked a strict practice schedule. I worked with the members of my team set up certain times for us to practice together and build together and learn how we all synergize. This team did fine for a few weeks, but later our synergy fell apart making me have to get rid of two of the starters and moving my old Top Laner to the current jungle. My personal goal is to unify a hard working team that can be confident enough to try out for NACS. Im hoping that I will find the perfect fit and complete my rooster.\n\n**What is expected from Top Lane:**\nWe want you to play Meta picks like:{{champion:150}} {{champion:39}}{{champion:14}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:127}}{{champion:68}}  , but you can have pocket picks like: {{champion:84}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:268}}{{champion:58}} {{champion:421}}      . We are looking for a person that is confident in their position and knows how to handle themselves in tough situations as well as cooperate and talk with fellow team members. We would like someone who enjoys the top lane and does not want to switch positions since top lane is the only one we are looking to fill at the moment. We like to joke and have fun while playing and would love if you were funny and have a sense of humor to help the team communicate and stay close to work as best together as we can. I know these are a lot, but if you meet these prerequisites we would love for you to tryout. \n\n**Also comment down below/tell me in game:**\nWhat are your strengths:\nWhat are your weaknesses:\nWhat your champion pool is\nWhy you are interested in Ranked 5's:\nWill you be dedicated to a Team:\nWhat you can bring to a Team:\n\n**Practice Times and Voice Comms**\nThe schedule for practice is: Monday-Friday: 8pm-12am EST. Saturday and Sunday we will play if everyone is on for a few hours, but we may have a tournament on Saturdays also. Currently our schedule reflects when our Jungler gets home. He is getting his schedule fixed next week so until then we will start around 9/10.\n\n***Skype is required***\n\n**Tryouts**\nIf  you  are alright with the practice times and Voice comms listed above then you are ready for tryouts.I really am looking for anyone that is serious about learning from their mistakes, and looking to improve a lot together as a team. This job can't be done single-handedly so we all must work together. With tryouts, we will play several games together just so we can grasp your play-style and your personality. After the first two or so games we play we will play with voice comms, and see how your communication with the team is.\n\n**Closing **\nI really hope to hear from anyone that can fit in with these practice times. Thank you for reading this long post. I just want to make sure I gave you a feel for what our team is looking for and what we expect from a potential Top Laner. Thank you!\n\n**(Also add me if you are interested, tell me the role you are applying for and your champ pool for said role.)**","replies":[{"poster":"UkuleleJay","date":"2015-03-10T06:36:18.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you strengths: Lane bullying (win lane most of the time), warding and deep warding, teamplay, objective control (especially dragons).\nWhat are your weaknesses: I can tunnel vision hard sometimes, rumble ults, over extending just a bit (especially on tanks and when i'm ahead), and starting fights that probably shouldn't be started\nWhat your champion pool is: Top: Gnar, Maokai, Sion, Lissandra, I can also play Rumble just not extremely good with ults, Lulu, Mundo, Gragas, J4\nWhy are you interested in Ranked 5's: I'm a much better player when I play with friends vs playing with strangers.
