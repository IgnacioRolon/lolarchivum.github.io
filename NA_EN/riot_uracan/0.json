The tool’s new look and functionality will go live on **May 4**. We’re also looking to integrate collegiate and local sponsored events into the tool, though live dates for these features are still TBD._\n\nHey folks,\n\nMany of you are doubtless thinking “event finder...what the heck is that?” Well, that’s part of what we’re trying to address. We created the tool years ago with the goal of helping players meet up for live events as well as giving them a workable way to organize and obtain prize support for online tournaments. Unfortunately, the tool hasn’t scaled well over the years - it’s only very sparingly used for live events, and the online prizing support feature is almost equally unknown while being heavily and repeatedly used by an extremely small minority of players (less than 1% of the NA player base). \n\nWe’re obviously to blame for a lot of these problems, as we haven’t very well promoted the tool or guided usage. We’re hoping to change that this year (in line with our wider 2016 live event efforts) by refocusing event finder around promotion, support, and prizing for live gatherings and events. Simultaneously, we’ll be transitioning the tool away from support and prizing for online-only tournaments. Although event finder will no longer support online-only tournament setup, mixed events that begin online and culminate in a live component will still be supported and eligible for prizing. \n\nOnline tournament prize support is something we may want to re-explore in the future, but based on current use we don’t believe the event finder tool is the way to make it work. Instead, we’ll refocus those resources on supporting live events across North America that can hopefully offer awesome experiences to a greater variety and number of players. We know these changes will significantly impact the small number of players currently using the tool for online prizing support, so we’re giving advance notice in order to give affected players time to prep for the change. \n\nWe’ll roll out these changes and the tool’s new look on May 4. Beyond that, we want to continue building up the tool as a way for local communities to get together and share their passion for League. To that end, we’re working to integrate collegiate events into the tool, and more tentatively exploring the potential for sponsored partner events. More details to come!\n\nFeel free to leave any questions you may have in the comments for us to address, otherwise we’ll have more details to share once the changes take effect next month.\n\nEdit for clarity :  this change is only happening in NA at this moment. Other regions are at their own discretion for how they want to support these the tournaments.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-04-04T19:18:08.840+0000","up_votes":107,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, I guess I better win an online tournament before these changes (for Triumphant Ryze).

This move by Riot is really terrible. \n\nOnline tournaments have a distinct place in the community. I understand that <1% player base plays in the online tournaments means there isn't enough exposure but how does dropping it all together help Riots plan on moving forward? If Riots plan is to bring people together and form communities having online tournaments is the most convenient way to do it. The \n\nWhen I started playing league I had no friends on here that played league with me I was told about the game from a friend in another state. As League grew and some of my friends started to play it I had around 6 people on my friends list. As you already know making friends on league is different from other games. Here is a Reddit post taken from a  day ago: [Making friends on League](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4d5zjq/league_is_the_probably_biggest_game_out_there_why/)\nThere are comments such as it's harder due to no voice chat or the fact that you only add people when you do well with them and if you lose another game with them you are inclined to just delete or never really talk to them. This is solved by online tournaments where we have voice communication and we have online hangouts after the games are done. We connect with people outside of that one tournament we lost and then enjoy beating them in the tournament the next day. I have made more friends on league from the HKG community in 3 months than I had for 2 years playing this game alone. \n\nPlaying online tournaments means you never have to leave the comfort of your home. For someone who is not 18 yet which a pretty big part of the League community going to a live event is next to impossible. Let's be real if I am anything below Diamond or even just a casual gamer that's not into hardcore competition I am not going to be looking to drive an hour away just to see if I can win some live event. \n\nIf Riot's problem is that there isn't exposure of these online tournaments  then maybe you should focus on getting the knowledge out there that you do support this kind of thing. I dropped that I was part of HKG on Reddit once and within an hour I had 10 PMs asking me how they could join.\n\n\nWhen this goes through there will be a lot of players (<1% :P ) that will be disappointed and have nothing similar to turn to but at least I will have my friends that I made from HKG which more than what I can say for people who missed out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thats Frosty","date":"2016-04-04T20:55:55.663+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really horrible and late April Fools Day joke","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Star Cho","date":"2016-04-04T21:00:51.175+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thats Frosty,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=6c2OrJEA,comment-id=0041,timestamp=2016-04-04T20:55:55.663+0000)\n>\n> This is a really horrible and late April Fools Day joke\n\nStill better then Draven?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telepoof","date":"2016-04-04T21:02:59.448+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sad days, as a community admin I cry some tears {{champion:32}} for our cute little community members <3 Shame Rito \n\nIf HKG and sad upvote here for tele hug o(^_^)o\n\n- Phoenix Admin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rayman","date":"2016-04-04T19:44:52.406+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"There go the many wonderful communities built by RP tourneys","replies":[]},{"poster":"imabossman22","date":"2016-04-04T19:44:11.622+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing that will happen from taking these Prized online tournaments away will lead to a decrease in communities in league of legends and less and less people getting to know other players.","replies":[{"poster":"KnuckleBorg","date":"2016-04-04T19:46:14.766+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah Riot It will make so many people will quit because they are not rich and can't purchase this RP like me so i do this and it helps me to make friends","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fowlkin","date":"2016-04-07T20:01:54.617+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just throwing this out here to our friends at Riot.

I have been a previous online tournament event organizer for over a year as well as running live lan events for closer to a year and a half. I wanted to mention a couple things about each side and my personal experience and thoughts on them as well as the impact the prizing changes may have going forward imo.\n\nI completely understand how there is a lack of scaling with the event finder tool and the prize support system as it only reaches a small percentage of players for online events. It is also a model that has failed for individual organizers to continue to scale larger in terms of growing the player base of the events. This is often due to the fact the finder tool can often be flooded and overwhelming with organizers who run multiple events to accommodate players (I myself had to do this as well) and or having a difficult time searching/filtering.\n\nThe thing with the online tournaments though is they provide players who would otherwise play solo or quit after a few months a home and setting to grow. Players come and compete every night to the communities they bond with. I know I saw players 90% of the days out of the year since again the tournaments being run were daily and I was so fortunate to get to be a part of their player development climbing ranked and finding this internal drive to get better. I know I was an active player for a number of tournaments before I wanted to help run them. Through my involvement I found this motivation to grind as a player and become better. For me organizing the online tournaments helped me discover my love for running competitive events as well as helping players and people in general, which was a huge deviation from studying physics, and really changed the path I was on for the better. These types of events and player support experiences have become a passion of mine and I would have never had the opportunities to pursue running competitive events as a consultant and getting involved with live events without the exposure I had to online events.  I truly believe the prizing support to the online scene is something that is instrumental in not just maintaining a home for the players and communities that are active but continuing to provide a home for organizers like me, that volunteer hours and really put their life behind the events and the communities in addition to their day jobs. I am however 100% in agreeance that currently the program in place is not effective however I implore you and your team at Riot to try and find a system that works as I know how tight knit not just my community was but the others that still exist. The loss of prizing may be detrimental to some of them and their future. \n\nFor live events I am super hyped that there is going to be more of a focus on them even though I feel it could be accomplished without getting rid of the online aspect in the meantime. For live events it seems many organizers including the individuals who apply for the prizing, as someone other than myself would apply for events I ran, that there was a lot of confusion with the prizing and what to apply for since there was online and live.  The other issue is that because the event is live and sometimes requires a ticket to be purchased it is hard to turn to an attendee who earned prizing fair and square that we cannot get prizing to them because they did not register. While I understand the purpose behind this system, I also recognize that no matter how many reminders you give a customer to register on the community event page there are going to be players who just don’t. Especially when platforms like Battlefy and Challonge are being utilizedfor structure and they cannot facilitate the communication between their platform and your registration through an api. Double registration is a challenge live or online however the largest complications I have faced have been at my live events and I would like to see a solution to this ESPECIALLY with viewing parties 300+ and LAN events with 100+ this registration structure can become a nightmare for everyone in my experience.   As for live event support there is one more area I would be interested in seeing supported which is noncompetitive community centered events. While you support tournaments (teams) and viewing parties, there is a huge opportunity to have communities that want to run casual LAN events with in-house match making and no bracket structure as well as 1v1 tournaments which are always fun and exciting. I know that there are times where I would have been interested in running a non-competitive LAN with balanced teams and no prizing so that it’s about meeting new people and relaxing without that undertone of you have to win to get the RP. There are also events where I would have loved to set-up a 1v1 tournament in addition to other things going on. I really believe there needs to be a balance in that aspect to include different structured events into this support system that even allows for skin support or RP giveaways in a similar tiered structure to the tournaments. \n\nLastly for the larger events there were a number of times I would have loved to provide more swag to attendees however it is expensive to rent a venue for xhours and provide swag. What I suggest isn’t free swag but instead a way for organizers to provide swag at their events whether it being able to order 100 poro stress balls or wrist bands to give out (for free), or apply for some sort of swag support, I would make the use be free giveaways/handouts so it isn’t abused for reselling. I would strongly suggest a program for this that requires a “verified event host” feature so that it can’t just be purchased by some kids in their house. I really believe this would go a long way to attract more attendees and open more doors for organizers to give back in ways they may not have been able to before. \n\nNow I know some of the things I mentioned may be unreasonable but overall I am really glad that the whole event support system is being looked at. I really hope everything in the future works out and you find a way to continue to support online events as well as live events. I know I truly appreciate the support I have been receiving and hope to see what’s on the horizon! \n\nCheers!!! ^_^\nArray","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrisTaLLize","date":"2016-04-04T19:45:28.569+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Closing this tournaments its not gonna solve the problem , but putting more ads and getting more people participating its a great idea .I've been playing on highkoalitygaming for over 2 weeks now and i made a lot of friends there and i keep doing it so ,in my opinion closing this tournaments not gonna help the cause !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snipinginunition","date":"2016-04-04T19:47:38.628+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all honesty, the tournaments are a great way of bringing the league of legends community together.

These tournaments bring people together and form friends ships that would never happen without them. You want all tournaments to end in a live event, but that is just not possible for an extremely large portion of your player base sue to geographic locations. I cannot stress enough how much of a poorly thought out plan this is that was decided on with little to no regard to the actual logistics of your players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Overfeels","date":"2016-04-04T22:01:14.805+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is an April Fools joke, it's a pretty sick one.\n\nIf you're being serious about completely removing online tourney support, I'm not even sure what to say, I've heard of greed, but this is something new.\n\nDon't ruin what makes communities like VG/HKG/EVG so great, the chance to play with others towards a common goal that we would never have been brought together for otherwise.\n\nAnd before a Rioter basically says tough luck, this'll turn off so many of the staff, players, and supporters of those communities from league, permanently alienating a large part of your playerbase.\n\nProbably the worst decision I've ever seen from Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirNex","date":"2016-04-04T21:49:10.224+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this may not do much, and Riot may not heed our prayers but alas, we can try.

People myself included find tournaments a fun alternative to pressure that ranked gives (I know that I honestly stress myself out whenever I play ranked). Its nice to have an alternative competition that doesn't necessarily state how good or bad I am at the game.\n2.) Voice chatting with people is super fun most of the time, and has lead me to have many extremely fun games. One that comes to mind was during an aram tournament we had 5 melee fighters (with no clear)  into a team with anivia tf and tham (can't remeber the other two). Despite what seemed like a guaranteed loss a combination of coordination we almost won the game if not for a bad fight. For those curious 5 targon's braces works really well in this situation for wave clear and sustain.\n3.) Where I live there aren't of people who play league. I remember during the bilgewater event which STRONGLY emphasized live events the closest ones were like 200+ mi away or several states away. As a student there was literally no chance I would ever be able to participate in these events. Furthermore with the current prizing from Riot would probably cost less to buy than the gas money it would take to get to the event.( Ergo financially and time wise it now becomes impossible to participate in a prized tournament ... impossible to get triumphant ryze (still trying to get this).)\n4.) To all the people who say well if you like online tournaments so much the prizing removal won't get rid of the tournament .. true. The prizing support removal won't get rid of the tournaments as many are volunteer run. However, consider this with the new crafting system requires play in matchmade ques. So participating in the custom game tournaments you not only lose out on ip (as the ip rewards are much smaller in customs), but also chests dropping and keys dropping. As someone who relied on the ip boosts from the tournaments to help make up for the ip lost playing the customs it kind of removes the \"economy\" in playing tournaments. I still want several 6300 ip champs, and I could honestly probably get more ip playing the normal/aram over the customs.\n5.) Lets be totally honest here if less than 1% play in tournaments, if they go to live only tournaments then only a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of players will actually be able to participate (and possibly get triumphant ryze).\n6.) Now if the real reason behind this is to stop shady online tournaments wouldn't a better solution be to have Riot sponsor certain organizers with x amount of RP/ip for prizes a month and advertise the tournaments on the homepage? \n\nI don't know I just feel like this would honestly alienate more people from playing with each other in a competitive fashion than bring them together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its Yuu and Mi","date":"2016-04-05T22:58:10.920+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Hey you know what'd be really funny?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Let's tear up a few communities because we're tired of giving out free stuff.\"\n\n\"...Doesn't that free stuff lead to people feeling better about Riot and buying more of their stuff if they're able to?

Over 1000 characters. Pressed backspace, accidentally went back a page and deleted the entire contents of the article. So I'll try to recompile some of what I had written here. I apologize if some of this seems a bit more pointed, it's just me being as clear-cut and concise as possible with my replies in order to shorten writing time.\n\nDear Uracan and other Riot employees,\nPlease, for once, listen to the community's outcry and don't implement this update.\nWe know what we're asking is a lot. To put in however much effort you've done prior,\nonly to have a massive rejection to it. I feel like there should be some compromise.\nSpecifically, leaving the online-only RP tournaments active in their current form.\n\nIt was pretty easy to tell you wanted to phase these out, what with lowering the prize pool by half and all. But I don't think you know how much good these online tournaments do.\nHow much they impact the community. How much they matter. So I'll detail it a bit.\n\nOnline tournaments are entirely accessible. There are many hosted out there entirely for free, entirely community-driven, entirely community-run. So not only is the point made\nregarding accessibility moot, it's also a bit silly if you look at it for about 5 seconds.\n\n\"People can't access online tournaments, so we're going to make all tournaments require meeting up in-person in order to make them easier to access.\"\n\nSeems a little silly, doesn't it?\n\nContinuing on. The importance of these communities- They bring together large groups of League of Legends players for a common goal. Having fun with other players and gaining something through their hard work. These gatherings only exist because we want these two things. But these communities don't just disintegrate after the game's over. Many people continue interacting. The community becomes more tightly-knit. People get to know each other's names, personalities, and the like. They interact amongst themselves. Bonds are inevitably formed. Teammates and friendships on and off the field meet through these communities. Many people have even entered relationships that turned into something more. I can personally say that I've borne witness to two people forming a couple and becoming officially engaged, all because they met through League, interacting on a Facebook community page run by the administrators of one community hosting these tournaments. These people would never have met if the restrictions you're intending to impose are allowed to proceed. Doesn't that show the value of these community-driven events? Is removing these interactions really going to help attain the goals you state you're looking for with this change? \n\nI just really hope you take some time to listen to your community and reconsider this.\nWe all care. We're the ones who feel the outcome most. Please, listen to us just this once.\n\nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LtFeonir","date":"2016-04-04T21:18:43.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot is single-handedly killing small community events, where either people don't have the commitment, intelligence, or ability to travel to a live event.

Also it doesnt help people who live far away from cities (like me), so this is just a straight up nerf to players like me, who would love to attend these but cant so i play on this community sites to make friends and RP.
