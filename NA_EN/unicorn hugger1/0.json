Starting realize its not my problem but Riot. \nI am confused as the game was running fine yesterday. The only difference is that windows 10 had a antivirus patch which is not affecting any of my other games or programs. As I said earlier I ahve also turned off anything that can potentially be related to the antivirus patch.","replies":[]}]}
