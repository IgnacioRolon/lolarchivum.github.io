A lot of times people have some weird [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in place which make it hard for your network to get a solid connection with our servers.

I'm experiencing it a lot myself. Ever since we changed to a new ISP, they claimed to be the best where I live at, but it's nothing but extreme bullshit. The ping can stay at 39, but then it'll spike me up to 14-30k ping and stay there for an entire game, unless I change to my 5Ghz net. (Note both spike either way.) My upload speed goes from 20 to 0.85 mbps so. Upload speed is my best bet on what's causing you to lag. I'm not sure how you can fix it, give your ISP a call and see if there's something they can fix on their end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HardStuckIndian","date":"2017-07-01T14:19:16.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same, i only lag in league i play on wifi, and every other game works fine","replies":[{"poster":"Xonvereher","date":"2017-07-01T14:21:12.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can play every other game just fine.
