Hypocrisy, that's how.\n>\nthe thing is that the shroud gives Akali so much more utility than Zed's W. You can't argue between two different spells that are used in completely different ways. The reason Akali's shroud is so oppresive is because of the fact that it gives extra movement speed to Akali, and allows her to weave inbetween opponents and get close without them knowing where you are. She pops out, Q's, goes into shadow, pops out again to auto, then disappears again, all within the span of 2 seconds. Zed's W doesn't offer that kind of trading. Zed's W is used more for squirmishes while Akali's is used more for teamfights.\n\n> If you put any other assassin on the back foot, they can't engage, Zed's engage range is 1325.

All in doesn't mean to go 100-0 one shot, it means to throw everything on the table and go for the kill, the enemy doesn't have to have full hp.\n>\n\nZed's basic combo uses a lot of energy. Early on, W duration is long enough to sustain simply one E and one Q press. After that, his W becomes essentially useless and now Zed can't fight back besides autoing for the next 5 seconds. Also Zed's engage range? What does that even mean? His W only goes forward 650 units. A lot less that 1350. I don't even see how you got 1350. Thats longer that a fully charged Xerath Q. The rest of your argument doesn't even make sense. If the reason you're finding Zed so bad because he has jungle help, then thats not the champions fault lmao.\n\n> Talon needs to get close to you to proc his passive.

The old \"ZEds bRoKEN bECaUSE hE cAn dEAL dAMaGE FROM FAr\"\n\nWell in Talon's case, the champion itself is a lot easier to play than Zed first of all. And Talon isn't a poke assassin. He's an all in assassin that does it very well. And you can dodge W yes. Just like how you can dodge Zed's Q's. And a Talon that constantly W's the wave means his trading is going to be really bad. If Fizz R hits, he doesn't have to go in.\n\nZed once again has 900 range on a Q that is a narrow hit box. Easy to dodge. Low cooldown only happens in late game and unlike mana champions, energy bar doesn't get bigger. So after a basic w-e-q, he has no energy now. And yeah he does have to choose. If a Q hits a minion before a champion, the damage is reduced drastically. And Zed often farms with Q because he is poked down, so yeah, he does actually have to choose. Just like Talon. Weird how that works huh? \n\n> Also his poke range is 1600 and his Q alone is longer than many other abilities and auto attack ranges and throwing it when people go to last hit forces them to either lose the cs or take the damage.\n\nDon't try to defend Zed at the moment saying he's weak, as every stat we currently have contradict you.\n> \nhis poke range first of all at ,max range is 1550. Secondly, that doesn't factor in the fact that if you do throw your Q at max range with a W, only one will hit as you'll be too far back. This only is used to secure a kill. Normally, you don;t poke like this cause it wastes your W and Q as well as half your energy bar.\n\nDon't try to prove Zed's broken if you haven't even played him and are only using stats to determine a champion's strength.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2019-04-05T03:14:39.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, I posted in gameplay because there are people who actually think that about items.\n\nHad a co-worker who was B5 for 5 seasons straight and now is Iron 4 who thinks that way as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-04-04T09:50:28.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well.
