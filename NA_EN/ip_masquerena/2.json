If Yasuo or Akali get cc'd, they dead unless they buy QSS to escape, if Trynda gets hit by cc, he R and kill your team.\n\nSomething is toxic if it has no counter play, like Trynda R, the only counter play to that skill is to nuke him 100-0 before he can react. CT's champs have the counter play, players just need to do it. You don't counter a CT champ as you do a normal one, and that's what makes them important to the game, it is the fact that they force you to understand mechanics and aspects. If you can't control the wave, you are screwed by a Zoe since she can do whatever she wants.\n\nJust because some champs can't play around a skill, like most adc's against Akali's W for example doesn't mean it lacks counter play. Counter picks are a thing and some champs can't do stuff against others, that's normal. Toxic means that no champion can do anything, like against Udyr or Pantheon or Jax.\n\nWhat can you do against Udyr? If he's half decent and has a kill, what can you do? You can't duel him, you can't run away from him unless you're Talon or one of the camo champs so he can't know where you went, as 1 wall is many times not enough to get enough space between you two, and if you do get an upper hand, you can't chase him either, where's the counter play?\n\nSame goes for Jax, he's hard to duel, he can burst, sustained damage, strong early, strong lane, strong jungle impact even from level 2, super strong late game, good and healthy clears in the jungle, good chase, good escape since it has barely any cooldown.\n\nThose 2 are toxic champs, as barely any champ can do something against them, as unlike Akali or Yasuo, you can't really play around them, if they get close to you, youz ded, but if Yasuo or Akali get close, you can outplay them.\n\nToxic doesn't mean \"OMFGBBQCT my champ doesn't have too many tools against these champs\" but \"who the Shaco can do something against those champs?\".\n\nNumber tuning can be an issue, but that doesn't mean toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"King Lego","date":"2018-10-15T22:16:28.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know much about Udyr i rarely see him.\nTryndamere's weakness is heavy CC.

Oriana and Garen do not have the CT feel to them. Not enough mobility for sure and no broken gameplay like Akali True Stealth, or Yasuo ult takes him out of tower aggro whenever possible. He made a lot of bad for the game champions and its not the champs themselves its something they added to the game that was not there before that no one asked for or thought would be a good idea. True Stealth is one of them, Yasuo double passive, windwall, ultimate mechanics. Orianna is not even close to one of the safest champions out there. sure she is oppressive against melee mid laners, but that is about it. also people already complain about garen and his braindead gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-15T15:38:21.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2018-10-15T12:16:46.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally anyone people care more about the name than what the design actually is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheini","date":"2018-10-15T09:32:17.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably {{champion:555}} or {{champion:35}} tbh..\n\nPyke **must** be killed before the end of the fight or he will execute you and add 2/5 to the gold pool per kill\n\nShaco has that ridiculous stealth (not camo!) so there isnt much you can do if he gets enough dh stacks or items.. a thing a player cant always prevent happening.\n\np.s. shaco has been designed by him? oh what a surprise.. :d","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2018-10-15T09:05:07.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Camille\nUrgot\nIrelia\n\nAbsolutely no doubt in my mind on that","replies":[]}]}
