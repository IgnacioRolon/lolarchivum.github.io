The test is super easy as well.  Just let one spawn, prefferably near minions so you dont miss much exp/gold, then dodge it and sit as close as possible after you dodged.  It won't swing again and won't spawn any other tentacles if you are too close to one already.  Just hit it once during the duration and again as it ends to get rid of it without needing to dodge 3-4 of them.","replies":[]}]}
