It says \"Your account is in the process of transferring. Please try again in a few minutes. If this issue persists, contact player support.\" **I can't.** Yes I'm logged in on the boards somehow, but when I go to the page where I want to submit the ticket, I'm logged out and it wont let me log in.

If it does seem to take a bit, though, reach out to our support team.  I know you can't submit a ticket, but we can be reached via support@riotgames.com as well.  We'll see you there!","replies":[]}]}
