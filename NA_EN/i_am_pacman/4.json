Its pretty obvious riot is not planning on making any illaoi skins in the near future as she is not popular enough. (If Aurelion Sol manages to get a second skin before her with a lower play rate then riot wouldn&#039;t even be following their own business strategy)\r\n\r\nIf skins aren&#039;t in the pipeline how about you give us some chromas then?  Not asking for anything fancy like chroma 2.0s or anything, you can be lazy and sloppy and give illaoi players 3 shitty recolours like the bard ones.  Probably wouldn&#039;t even take that long.","replies":[]}
