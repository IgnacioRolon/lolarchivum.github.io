It&#039;s like saying fish and dolphins are closely related because they both swim in the ocean and have fins. \r\n\r\nI go onto the skins and champions concepts to talk about and look at hypothetical kits and champ ideas. Think about the future. And when I post there I want like minded people to talk about it too, or at least have those people be the ones who decide whether or not it should be on the front page. But analyzing things takes time. What doesn&#039;t? Deciding whether or not you like a skin. Instant up vote or not. Simple comment saying you like it. WHatever. All champion concepts don&#039;t get enough attention, and therefore have maybe one person say something about it before it goes into the depths of obscurity. And those are the lucky ones.\r\n\r\nAs someone who likes talking about champion concepts, this really frustrates me. It&#039;s halting discussion. And didn&#039;t Riot create these boards so that we could have meaningful discussions?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-05-14T23:47:54.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this.  Skin threads (especially the \"wouldn't it be neat if...?\" ones) are always flooding out the Concept boards and drowning out Champion concepts that take infinitely more time and effort to devise.  Yes, every few days someone will post their personal artwork regarding a new concept and those are awesome to see, but each one of those leads to an eventual avalanche of duplicate threads from people who saw the picture on the internet and got the grand idea to share it on the boards, ignorant to the fact that we've already seen it 12 times this week.\n\nSeparating skins with entire character concepts would really be doing a huge favor to the small but well-meaning and vocal community of people who are genuinely interested in more design and story-driven concepts.","replies":[{"poster":"MajorMajora","date":"2015-06-25T18:46:13.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really makes the place a lot less welcoming.
