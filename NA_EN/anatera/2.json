At no point in my original post did I ever bring up ranked or \"high diamond.\" The only thing similar to my post and his is the word \"picks.\" Not all of us play the game because we're desperate to boost our ego.

Attitude and behavior of players change as well. How you don't know this is beyond me.\n\nYou say no one mentioned ranked and yet there is a post that you quoted from the first guy talking about ranks. I guess it's hard for you to remember things you wrote, so you gotta push that responsibility onto others whether they want to or not.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-24T01:08:43.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, i do know it.

And you saying you \"know what you wrote\" doesn't really mean much when you can't express yourself properly to others. It might be time for you to practice what you preach.
