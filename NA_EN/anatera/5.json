And when I say healing and shielding I don't mean just sona's w if that's what comes to mind. Lifesteal, innate champion sustain like that of kayn's red form or renektons Q need to be toned down.\n\ntanks and mages right now are balanced in a way that doesn't work around sustain metas. Mages don't have regen as a stat (it all got switched to max mana) and tanks rely on full utilization of their resists in all-in situations to win fights. In a sutain meta they both fall because having a replenish of health/mana is vital to drawn out battles when damage output is lower.\nSupports that focus on shielding (and not healing) also get crippled since lower damage means less threat from burst. because at best they use their shields on poke which is really inefficient and bad (which is why before season 4 shielders weren't played. yes, stuff like lulu and janna and karma were like .5-.1% pickrate champs back then)\n\nOh and Jhin and gangplank just straight up break. They're balanced around dealing specific amounts of burst and can't keep up if their burst isn't perfectly tuned to be threatening.\n\nReducing damage globally actually does have a much greater effect on how the game runs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2018-02-27T22:07:50.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Too bad that you can't get chunked for 1/3 your hp pre-6 (unless you are fighting an akali with an item lead).\n\nYou think you can just lower overall damage?
