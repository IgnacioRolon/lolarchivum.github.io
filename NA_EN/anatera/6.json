Riot won't admit that but other compaines with MMR system has admitted how the system really works. You can see same effects of matchmaking there like in lol. Same systems. Do you know how really it works? \n\nYou get matched based on team's average MMR. Not individual. Do you know why you skip divisions? Because there is a certain mmr range for certain division if you exceed it you either skip division of fall down immediately. If you win many games in a row your MMR is higher than average for certain division. So to make team's average the same to match enemy team you get people with lower mmr than average (usually titled people, on loss streaks, or simply bad players either boosted or carried by friend etc.). This is when you notice \"why is my team is boosted. they play like complete noobs. Making mistakes that you can see only in new and completely bad players gameplays\". This is the result of matchmaking trying to make average team's MMR equal. I will use fictional numbers to explain this. \n\nAverage MMR of division you are in is 1000. Enemy has 5 players each 1000 MMR. You won a lot of games lately. You have 2000 MMR. So to make your team's average MMR 1000 and match both team's average MMR, your team needs players with 750 MMR which is below average. both team's mmr average is the same, but your temamates are on lose streaks, bad or tilted and you have to carry even more than before. \n\nAfter loss streak your enemies are still the same decent skill level but your teammates suddenly play decently as well because your MMR dropped after loss streak so the average of all players in your team is the same. \n\nThis is the \"big\" mystery that Riot tried to hide which is dumb since it was revealed by other companies using exactly the same system. Unlike Riot, those companies try to fix the matchmaking and ranking points gains but improving the system with individual performance stats that are taken into account in ranking system. And I'm not talking excusively about KDA ratio, but a lot of other things that count in. Riot just want you to play the game. So they make it much longer and harder to climb.

That is simply false. \n\nMatches are made using MMR only, not division.\n\nThe only frustrating thing with the match making system is that mmr and rank don't evolve at the same pace, that's why you can be silver with gold mmr. And that's why varying LP gains and division skips exist, so that rank can catch up faster to mmr (upward or downward).","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-02-15T22:08:44.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"See.

You plateau because you reach a point where you&#x27;re about the same skill as everyone you&#x27;re playing with, and thus you can&#x27;t win as often.  Is it possible to &#x27;get lucky&#x27; and go on a streak?  Absolutely.  What happens when you go on a streak?  Your MMR goes up.  It may go WAY up because you were very lucky.  However, because it was only luck that got you there, you actually have a harder time keeping up, and so, you guessed it, you start losing.  Most likely you&#x27;ll lose a whole bunch in a row, with some wins sprinkled in, because you are not good enough to win consistently where you are.  And eventually you end up were you had started.  Or you might be tilted from losing so much, and you actually lose even more.  But then the exact same effect happens.  Suddenly you&#x27;re playing with people who are, again, not as good as you, and you start winning.\n> \n> This has everything to do with being matched with EQUALLY RATED PLAYERS, and nothing at all to do with Riot&#x27;s matchmaking wanting you to win 50% of your games.  What would the point of that even be?  How would it even be logistically accomplished.  Like I said, I asked you two simple questions:\n> \n> If you were correct about the game setting you up to lose, how does it select the 4 other players on your team to take the fall with you?  How does it select the 5 other players that get a free win?\n\nExcept, you can be matched with ANYONE, because the system picks from a general pool of players around the same MMR for both teams. That much is very obvious. What then looks intriguing is where often times the game separates teams into one really good player with a high win rate, with the lowest win percent players, and the rest of the players get to be on the enemy team. Does it happen every single time? Well, no but it happens quite frequently and is noticeable at all Tiers / Ranks. There are a lot of games in Viper's match history for instance, where you can see a full team of mid to high ranked Challengers against a team with one Challenger player and the rest Master Tier / D1, even D2's. That doesn't mean the team with Diamond 2 players cannot win, but from a statistical point of view, the team with 5 Challenger players definitely appears to have a high odds of winning the game.\n\nI highly disagree with the relative theories about \"MMR spikes\" causing you to lose, because it's simply not true. When my MMR goes up, I get matched against better enemies, however my teammates stay at my MMR instead. It's something that can factually be seen on OP.GG on any account where the player is winning many games in a row. A Silver IV player, playing with a team of Silver IV's, except his enemies are all Silver III or higher.. even Golds mixed in. Your teammates don't get any better, instead you are forced into more difficult games where they are going to feed their asses off against enemies they cannot handle, and you have to deal with it. That's the part where the \"team game\" comes into play. Is it impossible to win? Once again, no. Anything can happen, you could get 3 kills at level 1 and just hard carry the game solo.. your teammate could get fed and not be as useless as he / she normally is. There's no predicting games. The fact is however, that the game in general is not fairly matched.\n\nPlayers with low win rates, deserve to be matched with other players and against other players with low win rates. Even if both players are the same MMR, that doesn't make it a fair match. One guy on your team could be a Gold V player with a 15 win, 60 losses record, playing with a bunch of Silver V's.. That doesn't make it fair to the Silver V players who are sitting over a 50% win rate just because that Gold V is the same MMR as they are. Realistically, the players matched with that Gold V player are more likely to lose, even if someone on that team could carry it.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-02-15T18:16:48.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Ekko NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2Oa0z1Nu,comment-id=0003000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-15T17:39:21.061+0000)\n>\n> Except, you can be matched with ANYONE, because the system picks from a general pool of players around the same MMR for both teams.

Realistically, the players matched with that Gold V player are more likely to lose, even if someone on that team could carry it.\n\nWell, first of all, the very top of the ladder is pretty much the only place where you get massive differences in player skill.  This is because those players are the best of the best, and in order to match them with anyone, they have to be matched with people below them, as there are very few people at their level.  This does not apply anywhere else, because everywhere else there are plenty of people with similar MMRs.\n\nThat said, what you're describing doesn't happen, at least not in a way that is manufactured to make you lose.  There are a few key factors the screw up your observation:\n\n1. Most games aren't identically matched.  This is because it is very difficult to come up with 2 sets of 5 players within the same range that have exactly the same total MMR with reasonable queue times.  Instead the system decides that a matchup is 'close enough' and balances MMR gain/losses based on the difference.  For example, if your team's average MMR is 1400 and your opponent's average MMR is 1450, the system awards you more MMR if you win, and deducts less MMR if you lose.\n\n2. Op.gg's MMR ratings are an estimation and may or may not reflect the actual MMR of the players.\n \n3. Tier / Division are not always matched to MMR.  A player at Platinum 5 may have an MMR as low as a player at Gold 4, because you don't fall out of a Tier until you're a full Tier of MMR below it.  That means that a player who is playing statistically at a Gold 4 level could have a Platinum 5 badge.  Stuff like this can happen for any number of reasons, such as perhaps a player deciding to switch primary roles.\n\n4. Winrate is actually not indicative of anything outside of context.  Example: Would you rather have teammates with a 49% winrate in diamond or a 75% win Bronze?  A player that's had a string of unlucky games and fallen from Gold 2 MMR to Gold 5 MMR is likely still better than a player who has had a string of lucky games and ended up in Silver 1, even if their win rates don't reflect this.  This is why the system uses MMR rather than winrate, as MMR contains that context.\n\n5. Player tendencies and risk aversion differs across players.  Some players play very conservatively.  They have average scores, rarely feed, rarely go big on their own either.  Other players play very aggressively.  They take big risks, and sometimes those risks result in big wins, and others, big losses.  A conservative player playing with an aggressive player that's getting the big wins sees a player that's seems better than everyone else.  A conservative player playing with the same aggressive player that is getting the big losses sees a player that's worse than everyone else.  However, if you look at the overall performance of that player across a large number of games, you see that they win about as often as the conservative player with and against the same people the conservative player is playing with.  As a side note, if you're a conservative player it's often difficult to see this because conservative players will get dragged along with a winning aggressive player.  You get your assists in, you get the global gold from objectives, and you might even snag a few kills, which makes your score look really nice, when in reality you were getting carried.\n\n6. Plain old observation bias.  Players don't think twice about a match that went well, but will dwell extensively and remember matches that go poorly.  Such is human nature.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
