My display is set to turn off at 30 minutes and the LoL screensaver is set to turn on at 10 minutes, but from what I've seen the screensaver actually prevents the display from turning off at all. I know this because it turns off fine if the screensaver is off too. Is there a way to get around this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T23:21:40.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have too many tools to troubleshoot that screensaver actually, but I did some digging and was able to find a little something for you. I know you said you currently have your settings configured to turn off your display after 30 minutes, but I want to first double check that we're changing that setting in the right place. \n\nCheck the screenshot I posted below for where in control panel you can find it, and if it doesn't work shoot me a screenshot of what your version of that control panel looks like!\n\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/8f46bf1a52a0cd1608ecc79a45419dd7.png","replies":[{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2017-05-08T00:05:19.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Broporo, thanks for the response.

Like I said before we don't exactly have the ability to troubleshoot that screensaver too much since we all focus on the game itself, but I was able to find one more thing we could try. In that same screen you sent me, click on the advanced setting, scroll down to Multimedia Settings, open \"When sharing media\" and make sure it's set to \"Allow the computer to sleep\".\n\nLet me know if that does the trick ^_^!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/76fd62e9700c08cb37359913ee507a94.png","replies":[{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2017-05-08T02:17:57.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It did not work unfortunately.
