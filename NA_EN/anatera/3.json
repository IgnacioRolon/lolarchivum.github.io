It can also chase you. Lol.\r\n\r\nHer W allows her to dash however many times she wants as long as your teammates are close enough, making pickoffs hilariously easy. Don't even get me started on being untargetable.\r\n\r\nHer E has two charges for really no reason at all, making it one of the strongest burst heals in the game. Don't know why it isn't one charge with a lower cooldown.\r\n\r\nHer R has a gigantic area of influence making it functionally impossible to not catch at least 2 enemies in it, unless you messed it up big time.\r\n\r\nWhen I play Yuumi, I see a character that's designed to be idiot proof. From the games I've played on her, It is unbelievably hard to fail in your role as support with her. The only thing that could cause her to fail is her ADC being absolutely god awful, which is out of your control anyway. We shouldn't have to beg Riot to nerf this or nerf that when this kind of thing quite obviously needs a nerf. This isn't fun to play against. Get it?\r\n\r\nInb4 winrate that no one cares about anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Dorans Pants","date":"2019-09-04T18:10:17.892+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"remember how most people were dissatisfied with how the enchanter class played? Low interactivity, small room for error, powerful without much input?\nInstead of fixing any of that with the new enchanter Riot went: \"you know what? let´s take all of these things players hate, crank them up to eleven and merge them into one champ. \n\nand here we have it, the queen of enchanters, you can´t touch me, almost afk, just as strong as my numbers are, yuumi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T05:05:34.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Her winrate? one of the lowest in the game.

Akali has one of the lowest in the game yet is repeatedly getting nerfed because of how powerful her kit is in competitive and high elo. The same goes for Yuumi there is a reason she is pick or ban in competitive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gamma Sector","date":"2019-09-04T02:04:11.418+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, sort of. I don't like her poke chasing you. If you miss it, you should miss it. That's that. It shouldn't chase someone down. I cant stand that shes built to LITERALLY piggyback off of other peoples gameplay. She just attaches to the most fed person and gives them a stun every now and then. You just attach to someone, afk, and press r every now and then. \n\nHowever, shes not really relevant early on, giving you plenty of time to anally destroy her ADC and hopefully make her worthless, since she only scales off of her team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-09-04T03:09:53.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Kat main, I love Yuumi... \n\n...on MY team... \n\n...when I'm fed...","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-09-04T02:05:06.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Poorly balanced?\n\nI think you mean poorly designed.","replies":[]}]}
