I&#039;m thinking lee sin,  Diana,  naut  etc.  Who do you think I should get?","replies":[{"poster":"ArcingWind","date":"2015-10-05T19:15:33.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I'm a Volibear main myself. I personally love Diana and would recommend her if you like assassins. She's very easy and very fun to play. Nautilus is also very fun and has very strong ganks while being a tank so he can take some hits like voli. Zac is a champion I haven't tried jg with, but his play style was very cool and he has amazing initiate power. Amumu is just like the two prior.\nEkko, Lee Sin, and Hecarim are snowball reliant so picking them is up to whether you think you can have a good KDA that game (Not to say that they are worthless while behind, but they scale better if ahead.) Hecarim will be going down to 4800 after the champion AFTER kindred is released. With preseason coming, it might not be that far off.\nVi is a fun simple champion that works off of strong early ganks and with her ult, no one escapes alive. She typically goes warrior into off-tank but cinderhulk tank Vi can work if you need another tank. She is snowball reliant though.\nIn the end, the choice is up to you. There's lots of great jungle champs out there. Find the ones that you like and learn them. \n(Tahm Kench is sleeper OP jg. He is super tanky and has lots of good tools to gank with. Though he requires a special rune page.)\nAnd remember that Kindred is coming VERY soon. So you might want to pick her. What ever you do, good luck and I hope you have fun. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-10-05T19:57:21.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking for someone tanky enough to get kills, Ekko is a pretty solid choice, I don't know how strong he is with cinderhulk after his recent changes, but I think its still effective.\n\nWorst case scenario, you can still blow someone up, then ult out. \n\nSion is another good choice, very good damage, CC and tankiness, its a shame we don't see him more in the jungle since he's pretty good, his ganks are a tad bit lackluster until he hits 6, but when he hits 6, it becomes so much fun, subtly with ganking? Not with him! charge right down the damn lane with him.\n\nTextbook fighters in the jungle right now though would be Shyvana and Skarner.

If you master Lee Sin then you can do some amazing shit but before then (and he has a high skill cap) you're mostly just getting really really sick escapes. \n\nDiana is okay, but her ganks pre-6 are pretty terrible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-10-05T16:54:11.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play alot of shyvana, shes fun for me. i also played alot of volibear but since he sucks i got depressed for a while.","replies":[]}]}
