But before the upgrade, the HD 5770 didn't have these issues and it's worse than the GTX 660. On the old GPU I could run Very High settings with Vysnc on without the drops. But now I do get fps drops with better hardware, and the same settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Flygills","date":"2017-11-13T06:09:22.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have the latest drivers for the GTX 660, and I really don't think that it's my i5. I also have everything Xbox completely disabled on my Windows 10 Enterprise Edition. At one point I thought it was a heat problem, but that wasn't the case. Another thing, the GeForce 600 Series doesn't support G-sync, so that can't be it :(\n\nEdit: When I first installed the GTX 660, it was pressing down on the SATA HDD Cable so it might not have been pushed down in the slot all the way. So I went in and switched SATA ports for the HDD and reseated the GPU. So hopefully things will run better now. I'll get back to you on it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-13T00:59:42.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I know you might get frustrated with what I'm about to say but I need to just make sure.\n\nHave you made sure you have the latest Nvidia drivers? \n\nAlso, League isn't a GPU intensive game, it's a CPU based game. Make sure you have nothing causing your CPU to be overworked in the background. \nThere is zero fps difference between my old R9 270 and my 1060 6GB GTX. Even though the 1060 is over twice as powerful as the 270.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T02:56:07.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This covers most of the basics, but I'd also double check for the Windows Game DVR Feature that keeps turning back on after Windows Updates. It's been known to cause some issues with League so check for that and turn it off if needed. Do make sure you also check for those graphics card drivers as you might have missed one recently. \n\nOne other point on the note of graphics drivers, I've had some player mention that using V-Sync and Nvidia's G-Sync at the same time causes some heavy problems, so try disabling one or the other and test that. Make sure you're testing these changes in a custom or practice game to avoid any possible issues along the way!","replies":[]}]}]}
