I have followed the sticky about disabling the GAME DVR option on Microsoft but still get the same issue. I usually start the day off with an ARAM just to mitigate the issue of having to do it in a Ranked game. I've tried starting a custom game and logging out and reconnecting but this does not fix the issue, for whatever reason it needs to be a non-custom game. \n\nHas anyone else troubleshot this issue and been able to fix it? It's tedious to have to play an ARAM just to get the issue to go away safely.\n\nThanks, \nFlopsies\n\nEdit:// I've now noticed it must be a summoner's rift game, not sure how that helps but I tried relogging an aram and it didn't work.\nEdit2: Okay I've downloaded the Hextech repair and used that, as well as repatching. I've also done the compatibility test, and also note that i do play in Windows Borderless mode. We'll see what happens! Appreciate all the support thus far.\n\nEdit3: It's been a few days and for the first time ever, I restarted my client and the ping spikes DIDN'T go away. Usually the restart fixes it. I've ran that \"FPS Fix\" checklist as well and I have completely uninstalled/reinstalled League - still didn't fix the issue.\nI did get \"invited\" (I think everyone did?) to the League Alpha Client and have only played two games on the Alpha, to which the lag is still there, at this point I have run out of ideas on what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ozeantj","date":"2016-10-29T16:27:06.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so after win update right ?

There may be other factors as well, like hardware or bad game files.  There's also been a recent Windows 10 update that auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html), which has been causing fps issues for some players.
