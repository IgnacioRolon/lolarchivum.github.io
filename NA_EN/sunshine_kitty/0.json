Don&#039;t destroy the 2 champions above because of it. She will have the same problems as Sona and Nami if this change goes through. Needs a rework from the ground up.\n\n**Janna, Taric** -  You can argue the change made them too strong but it can easily be fixed with slight tweeks/nerfs.\n\n**Kayle, Bard** - Their heals are mainly for the move speed boost and are normally maxed last anyway so nothing really will change. \n\n**Nidalee** - I assume it will hurt her but not enough to kill her. I&#039;m not sure how she will be after the mid year mage update so its hard to say anything about her.\n\n**Alistar** - His heal is meh. Not a big part of his kit.\n\n**Fiora, Kindred** - Seems like a huge nerf to their team fighting for the same reason as Sona,Nami and Soraka.\n\nRiot even said the point of the change was to let healers do their job so either don&#039;t change it, remove executioners calling or heavily nerf it. Executioners calling should build into something that you have to go out of your way to build opposed to something that&#039;s common in every ad champions build (last whisper.)","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2016-04-22T00:32:36.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Fiora, Kindred - Seems like a huge nerf to their team fighting for the same reason as Sona,Nami and Soraka.\n\nAs if Fiora's Ult is used for the actual heal instead of just killing someone 9/10.\n\nThe heal from Kindred ult is negligeable. You are using it to not die. The heal is just a bonus on top of that to make the _not dying_ part stick.","replies":[{"poster":"sunshine kitty","date":"2016-04-22T00:57:36.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"FIora's team fighting is already bad but the healing is what makes her able to group once she has items. Fiora would just be complete garbage unless she could sit in a side lane for the entire game with the grievous wounds revert. As for the Kindred healing if the enemy team builds an executioners calling it puts her at a disadvantage and forces her to build her own executioners calling so she doesn't have to be at a disadvantage by using her own ability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-22T00:49:58.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nope","replies":[{"poster":"sunshine kitty","date":"2016-04-22T00:59:16.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You need to realize how much executioners calling will hurt Sona, Nami, Fiora and Kindred if they revert grievous wounds.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2016-04-22T10:26:59.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona actually won't be affected by it at all.

They are not primary sustainers, they typically use their heal as a trading tool. If anything, the strength of sustain I'd hurting Sona right now because she can't get her poke to stick.\n\nNami is a CC/Poke mage, and will still do her job just fine.\n\nSoraka is the only one this change will really hurt and that's fine because she's sitting at 54% winrate even after repeated nerfs, the highest of any support, along with a 17% ban rate which is pretty high. A support has to be really busted to draw bans over the other carry lanes out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-04-22T10:31:26.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healing/Sustain is too strong early game right now. It is totally invalidating poke bullies AND in some cases all in champs. Grevious wounds revert isn't going to help much on the poke end though because grievous wounds isn't actually applied that much.
