Not because he/she may want to, but Riot has a history of not meeting expectations, especially their own.\n\n(There's a reason why \"Soon™\" is still a meme around here.)\n\nIf they said \"Yes, we're working on a Yorick skin,\" the expectation would be that one would be announced in the coming weeks.  However, if someone higher up the food chain (like Hippalus or WizardCrab) said \"We can't sell this skin, so you need to start over,\" how would you (and millions of others) feel about the sudden change in plan?\n\nDo they just let expectations linger (like they've done in the past), or do they say \"we're sorry, but Yorick's skin was pulled for reasons and he's gone back to the idea pool\" and ignore the backlash (like they've done in the past).\n\nSo, instead, we get a Rioter who claims to empathize with the pain that Yorick players feel yet is part of the problem that is causing that pain.","replies":[{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2017-04-28T01:56:37.126+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the Ao Shin effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-04-28T23:48:34.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soon(tm) is used by multiple developers","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-04-29T01:10:32.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chicken Dynasty,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=mIea1ATN,comment-id=0005000200000002,timestamp=2017-04-28T23:48:34.042+0000)\n>\n> Soon(tm) is used by multiple developers\n\nFew bigger or more memeworthy than Rito.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Morgan le Fey","date":"2017-04-28T19:10:36.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TerraRising,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=mIea1ATN,comment-id=000500020000,timestamp=2017-04-28T01:00:23.585+0000)\n>\n> Kindlejack isn&#x27;t going to answer.  Not because he/she may want to, but Riot has a history of not meeting expectations, especially their own.\n\nNot necessarily even just a Riot thing. This is pretty standard for product development stuff in general. It's why a lot of times Kickstarters fail: not all projects make it through to the end. There are some legitimately awful things that sounded like a good idea at the time, but get nixed when people realize how terrible they are. Others might be good, but not profitable enough to fully develop, or not as high priority as other concepts. That's one of the reasons leaks are a problem. Other than corporate espionage issues, it sets expectations for things that may or may not actually end up being things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-04-28T01:20:16.499+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ought to make Shakespearean skinline.\nKhamlet'Zix\nOfelianna\nGangpolonius\nHeimerdingertrude\nClaudarius\nYorick Yorick","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Galvatron","date":"2017-04-28T05:53:39.789+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=mIea1ATN,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-04-27T23:21:20.447+0000)\n>\n> 417 years and still only two skins.\n\nAlas, poor Yorick.","replies":[{"poster":"Rude Name","date":"2017-04-28T07:05:04.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew him, Galvatronio!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-28T00:24:20.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having an amalgamation of mixed emotions about this that I am afraid to express for sheer terror of what may come out as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-04-28T00:45:52.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still not as long as a yorick skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sckullzz","date":"2017-04-28T08:37:50.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That just makes it even more sad lol...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2017-04-28T06:45:18.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the boards get really meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2017-04-28T01:22:54.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe do something about that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-04-28T03:03:31.607+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"playwright Yorick\" would make an amazing legendary skin.
