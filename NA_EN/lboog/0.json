This doesnt happen every game but when it does it usually results in a loss. I can hear the sound of the game looping over and over and i can move my cursor but the only way i've been able to get back into the game is by hitting Alt+tab a few times, Ctrl+alt+delete, or in the worst case, i have to reboot my computer by holding down the power button. I play with a friend and he says that while my screen is frozen, if i click anywhere on the screen my character will still move and if i try to recall it will actually work. this has been going on for about the last month and its very frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Demïgod","date":"2017-12-03T13:08:34.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me here!

It repeats the last sound that was heard over and over. These games say that I was connected also which made it so I don't back, causing a free kill with my afk. Since then I have stop playing ranked due to losing lp and going down in elo and am just playing norms. Although I still am freezing up.

Also, if you are on Windows 10, the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) auto enabled for some players which is causing freezing like this.
