Prior to this game I was at 96 lp, Bronze 5 and was playing this to reach into my promos.

I ended up losing lp despite the fact that I couldn't do anything to reconnect, I did spend time in the game of course playing as jungle but still it counted as a leaver game in general and I lost lp from that.

It's not fair for people to get losses when it's a riot problem.\n\nWhile there may not be \"any issues with the servers\", there are many other riot problems that make it impossible to connect, such as client bugs, updating client, two clients opening, etc. All of those have happened to me and I think it needs looking into how players can avoid penalties when they can't connect because of a riot issue, especially with 3 minute remake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kakeshi","date":"2017-02-12T02:48:21.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=gpqxxy37,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-11T17:55:45.327+0000)\n>\n> Sorry to hear about the loss, though I was unable to see any issues with the servers.
