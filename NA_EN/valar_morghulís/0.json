Lately (since after the new year started) I've been getting 90-100, sometimes even over 100. I have no idea what's causing this but I know it's not my internet. I'm only getting this problem when I play league of legends, all my other games are running smoothly. Help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T00:29:32.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP could have changed how you're routing to our servers which can cause an increased ping.  Your local network could also be having issues specifically with our game servers, even if your net is fine elsewhere.  Use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this towards a fix.  Let me know your results.","replies":[{"poster":"Valar Morghulís","date":"2017-01-14T23:22:24.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I went through that troubleshooting steps. It already has the exception in my firewall so that wasn't the problem. Tried putting my antivirus off as well. The last final thing I tried was flushing the DNS and changing it to 8.8.8.8 which did help for like 2 or 3 games but then it started doing it again the next day so that was possibly coincidental. So I guess it might be my ISP idk.","replies":[]}]}]}
