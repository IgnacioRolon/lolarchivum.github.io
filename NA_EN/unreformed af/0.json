i was already triggered and *mute* button doesn&#039;t do anything but reinforce the tilt. additionally, Game 1 had a mid feeder who went 0/14 under 20 mins, in Game 2, had a rammus mid who also fed with a side of a terrible blitz who afk'd at 11min, and finally Game 3 with a annie support, who was taking my CS because he didn&#039;t get his mid. and just like that, with the help of their &quot;clan&quot; they were able to outnumber my reports.\n\n2017 is the year that can finally change. i got SC2 for christmas so i can now avoid this cancerous game! it was fun while it lasted (although everything went downhill for this game since season 3). thanks riot, you have motivated me to move on! i hope your game becomes so engorged with toxicity that it explodes in your face. you are already losing many players who have been supporting you since the early seasons and i can already see your end :) now excuse me while i go HAM on SC2. bye!\n\nGame 1\nunreformed af: HOOK???\nunreformed af: what the fuck\nunreformed af: ffs\nunreformed af: thresh supports tilts me\nunreformed af: shitty gank by shitty jg\nunreformed af: tilting the fuck outta me\nunreformed af: can you stop being bad?\nunreformed af: and i had enough\nunreformed af: with this cancer community\nunreformed af: amazing\nunreformed af: 6/0 lux\nunreformed af: how the f uck\nunreformed af: are you autistic?\nunreformed af: good to know\nunreformed af: my god\nunreformed af: how the fuck do you give lux 9 kills\nunreformed af: under 15 min\nunreformed af: LMFAO\nunreformed af: lmfao\nunreformed af: this wu\nunreformed af: losing so bad\nunreformed af: you lost lane\nunreformed af: ?\nunreformed af: thanks to your shitty gank\nunreformed af: and shitty supp\nunreformed af: exactly\nunreformed af: report yourself\nunreformed af: for being autistic\nunreformed af: you think?\nunreformed af: easiest champ and still 0/5\nunreformed af: &quot;i guess ill be adc&quot; jhin 2017\nunreformed af: most deaths\nunreformed af: lol?

There are people in war zones which got horrible stories to tell or people getting raped for years by other people. Still these people wouldn't automatically walk around and shot or rape people. \n\nIn Batman The Dark Knight the Joker wants to show that everyone can lose his mind and go insane. \n\nYou can either transform into two face or stay as Harvey dent.
