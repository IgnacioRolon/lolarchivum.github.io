My duo partner is a consistant Tahm Kench player, and when he eats me while I'm stealthed it always seems to occur. For the rest of the game, even through death and respawn, Twitch will be glowing green with the huge AoE circle denoting his stealth range which makes him way too noticeable to the enemy team, even when I'm not in stealth mode.","replies":[]}]}
