IT started downloading the patch but it keeps scanning the files and its past 12k now. should I be worried.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T23:43:20.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope!  Sometimes it can take a long time to scan files as the patcher checks for possible corruption with previously downloaded files.  Just sit tight and let it scan.  As long as you don't get an error message, it will eventually stop and patch normally.\n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any other issues!","replies":[]},{"poster":"EdgeLord101","date":"2016-05-10T11:49:54.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, help me i had this problem (bug)from patch 6.4 to patch 6.7 ad it was fixed at patch 6.8 and now it returned AGAIN at patch 6.9.This problem is very big as it stops me from playing the game and i love this game.Whenever I am in the loading screen of the champions my ping goes from 80 ping to 300 and the game crashes and whenever I try to recconect the game crashes again.Please fix it.By the way sorry for my bad english .
