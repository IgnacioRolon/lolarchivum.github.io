It's not important but just a visual bug that does not need a fix. Also i made a post about Camille's Q bug vs baron empowered melee minions and im sure you have noticed it, true damage cant be reduced but in the case im talking about it does get reduced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drive My Soul","date":"2018-01-26T21:34:37.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"The \"first bug\" doesn't look like a bug to me. The enemy champion is clearly dodging Camille's dash. The indicator appears to be a false reading because it is showing where Camille will land, **if the enemy were not to move. ** But the enemy does move, making her landing location change. \nPlease, correct me if I'm wrong though.\n\nThe \"second bug\" looks legit though. It takes away a lot of control you have over the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"underscores222","date":"2018-01-26T23:15:44.258+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue is that she should go to the end of her range unless she collides with a champ.  If she does collide with a champ, she should get the rest of the effects, namely the stun and attack speed boost.  In the video, she does not travel to the end of her range and she does not trigger the on-collision effects either, indicating that something failed to work properly.\n\nMy read on it is that this has something to do with how the ability detects hits - if hitting triggers the ability to look for targets, then it can \"hit\" something but be unable to recognize it as a valid target to apply effects/damage to.  This can be caused by having a different collision radius, or there being enough delay between the two events that the target's dash has carried them out of range.\nAlternatively, looking at her power's description, it seems that she has double the range against champs.  If the power is failing to detect champs as they move, it might reduce the range she can travel, causing her to stop short.  Both clips seem to show her stopping at about halfway.","replies":[{"poster":"nikos pyridis2","date":"2018-02-21T15:06:11.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel like there's a short delay between Camille's E range ending and Camille's attack speed and stun. Maybe there are coded seperately and not together. The dash is something that moves non stop and even the shortest delay could stop this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nikos pyridis2","date":"2018-01-28T14:29:56.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Camille has a roll animation when the range is normal ( not doubled because of a champion ) and the range is determined in the start of the hookshot and not like in the middle of the hookshot because the animation is determined by the range.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Weeknd","date":"2018-01-26T23:43:29.383+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The enemy champion is not dodging, they are dashing in the same direction of the Camille Hookshot trajectory.\n\nIf Hookshot was coded correctly, it would work like a Gragas Bodyslam, it should travel the full distance until she collides with an enemy champion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Purejoyce","date":"2018-01-27T23:53:53.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clear bug and obvious solution that you've already suggested, so with that out of the way lets move to another pressing topic: \nWhat champ are you talking about in the chat of the 1st clip? :p (if that's full tank redemption camille, I'll be disappointed)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Weeknd","date":"2018-01-28T15:38:59.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was Adrian Riven's full tank Riven","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"your mÂºm","date":"2018-01-27T20:07:56.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed this bug for agessss its the most annoying bug on her","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2018-01-27T00:30:38.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol i just saw the bug on Shiphtur's stream.
