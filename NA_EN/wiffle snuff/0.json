I really would like to rank up in honor, but I only play 2 games a day, or even less. (played a little more after the system went online)\r\nDoes this mean someone who never gets honor but plays 5 games a day will get to lvl 3 faster? Doesn't seem fair and feels illogical, if you're an honorable player, and they're a player who isn't particularly nice but doesn't get reports, why would they be seen as more honorable? That makes grinding for honor even worse.\r\nOr do you get much more honor if you get it in a streak, from non-premades?\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong about this Riot &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T01:01:21.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're playing 2 games a day and getting 1 honor each match and someone else is playing 10 games a day without ever getting honored or reported, I believe you would still honor rank up faster since you are actually being honored. Getting honors gives more honor xp than just playing games. As long as you keep playing and don't get reports, you'll find yourself ranking up in no time. Regardless, if someone else is playing more games they're going to still be progressing simply because they are playing more games.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-08T21:08:15.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simurgh said in the honor mega thread that being honored makes it \"a little faster\", but \"not noticeably so that it's worth begging for honor\". So of course this is pretty vague and subject to interpretation, but I believe your example here is wrong, 'cause 1 Honor to get more 'honor XP' than 4 games, that does seem pretty noticeable to me...","replies":[]}]}]}
