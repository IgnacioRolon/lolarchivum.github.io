Ohm (i think there was more to the name...) was a youtuber who was one of leagues first \"influencers\", and used his  subscriber base to complete riots first \"referral\" program which allowed him to help design an item. \r\nIts a legacy item that has stayed BECAUSE of the circumstances surrounding its inception. To remove it feels like a slap in the face to the history of the game, like riot is once again denying the past ever happened. \r\n\r\nWhy cant we just rework it again? Id love a 300HP, 60armor, 60MR hybrid defense item regardless of its passive effects.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-10-23T18:26:52.930+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"The item bothers nobody.
