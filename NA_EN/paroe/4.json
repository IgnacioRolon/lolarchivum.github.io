Its aery levels of terrible. In order to make it viable it needs either a real base damage or it needs good scaling.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-10-05T11:12:11.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because in Riot's mind only source of sustained damage is basic attacks, that's why they'd devote entire tree for it, burst is done mostly just by Assasins with stealth or mobility, which is why they devouted entire tree for it and Mages have Sorcery which empowers spell-casting as If literally every class didn't use that with Sorcery hardly having specification that would make it class exclusive like Precision with aas, Domination with mobility etc.\n\nIf you're DPS Mage just move to another champion class, one that is spoiled with runes, 10/10 strategy.","replies":[]}]}
