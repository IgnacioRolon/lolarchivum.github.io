In my opinion, it's his ability to assassinate without necessitating his Q.  Honestly, a Zed can kill somebody purely with his E and auto-attacks if Death Mark is available.  The only times I find Zed needs to land his Q is before he has his core build, or if he needs to duel somebody tankier than himself.\n\nZed's bullying is also quite strong and them nerfing the base damage on it but making multiple Shurikens do more damage is a good design choice.\n\nI believe the reduction of the damage Death Mark did on it's lonesome was also a step in the right direction (and it is nonsensical that they cut the nerf).","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-05-25T22:17:21.597+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're concern is damage, zed has the least loaded all at once damage, but the highest potential between autos, bonus damage, and scaling (so much so that it is absurd, and using poke is quite damaging against enemies) zed rarely needs his full kit to kill someone, usually **his ultimate ability is routinely used to gap close onto the squishy, not as a direct or necessary source of damage** \n\n((what champion doesn't need their ultimate ability to pick someone off?)) (((but he is still technically using it to gap close, so sure, fine he does have to use his ultimate, but just think of how much damage zed has)))\n\nthe question always remains what is ok for zed to have and what isn't. what zed has is poke, ez handed to him farming, wave clear, escapes, gap closers, (mobility) in lane bulk, huge build path variety and counterbuild access while maintaining kill potential, (sustain pending build path) and of course damage. \n\nso whats zed lacking in? team fighting, damage variety (hes all ad), utility (just a slow). now you tell me is this justified?","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2016-05-26T00:02:06.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think a lot of what Zed does is justifiable for his champion.  His mobility, dueling, and laning seem proper to me.  The way he does it isn't quite as fair though.  Having a single Q do less damage, but landing more than one Q do heavy damage, should be the reward for Zed and ties his harass into a long early CD (his W).  This currently is not the case.\n\nAdditionally, he does extremely heavy damage without landing a single Shuriken because his death mark's damage increases from auto-attacks and spells.  If it increased only from spells, but by a greater amount, then his damage would be proper.  By adding the requirement of landing a skillshot to do high burst damage, Zed's counter-play becomes more clear rather than the previous \"lol build QSS against an ad champion\".\n\nBasically, I think he'd be more fair if he relied on his W more to bully (which they are doing) and if he relied on his Q for burst.  Otherwise, I have no gripes with him.  Perhaps he is a bit too safe early, but fixing his damage against minions won't change his gameplay patterns much.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-05-26T00:22:39.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure it would, it would force him to use abilities on minions like every other champion when farming under tower. he would have to choose poke or farm like everyone else.\n\nzed has the easiest time under tower as he is the only champion who can let a tower hit a caster minion once, auto once, and get the cs.
