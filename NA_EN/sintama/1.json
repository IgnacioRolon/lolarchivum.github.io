Obviously I am not a Diamond 1 player, but how am I supposed to enjoy Normals when all I&#039;m getting is people drastically more experienced and skilled? Playing is fun, sure, but getting slaughtered game after game where you team ALWAYS surrenders between 20-25 minutes? Maybe my expectations are too high thinking I can get one good game a day out of League.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2015-08-31T08:30:51.502+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"For anyone that doesn't understand what's going on in this thread\n\nThis is the norm, not the exception: http://puu.sh/jUP9K/872d39bd71.png","replies":[{"poster":"GroundRuleDouble","date":"2015-08-31T19:28:44.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What web site is that???

The more you win, the higher your MMR is.  This just means that your Normal MMR is the same as them.  If you keep losing, you'll eventually get matched up against lower ranked players.  The system tries to guess who your best match will be.  It can't use rank because someone people only play normal and some don't play normal at all.  After enough games, your MMR will level out and you'll play against players that are more your skill level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-08-31T19:23:54.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bronze, and i still win most of my games regardless of this issue, I think its more of a problem with the ranked system in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2015-08-31T18:13:43.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never ever ever listen to anyone who starts going on about how well they did last game.
