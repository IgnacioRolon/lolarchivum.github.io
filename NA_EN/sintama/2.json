If you're the type of dude  that flame in the  all chat,no wonder you get  camped everytime. If it's not the  case,you must be a pain in the  ass for the  jungler:either have a tanky champ with CC or a High mobility champ. Unless in premade,a jungler won't come  to a lane that is hard to camp. You can  also carry a game if the  jungler camps you:it consists of not dying,warding without him knowing so you give  him hopes about ganking you.don't let him know that you warded by landing a skillshot,just overextend a little so he  can  waste his time  so your jungler can  gank otherlanes/countergank","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2017-06-07T06:30:20.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina in the mid lane.
