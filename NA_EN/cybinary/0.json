I started talking to my friends about it and we all couldn&#039;t stop laughing when thinking about it.\r\n\r\nAND, His ULT could have him breaking through a brick wall as he TPs across the map, &#039;Hey Hey!&#039;\r\n\r\nAnyway, just a funny idea","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Brightmoon","date":"2015-11-13T18:08:53.843+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH YEAHHHH!!!!\n\nNow I can't stop laughing, thanks for the awesome idea @Cybinary!","replies":[{"poster":"Cybinary","date":"2015-11-16T13:51:19.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooo, maybe we'll see it in the future?

His ultimate would turn into juice and when it crashes into someone, an animation of walls breaking appears instead of his traditional red splash.
