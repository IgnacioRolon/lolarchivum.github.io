In organized play, wards are also kept at maximum uptime, or close to it, whenever they're made available, so even when their usage is capped, they can still force stalemates in certain important areas, particularly when Zombie Ward factors in as well. By contrast, plants and Scuttle act more as temporary power-ups, and so could allow for a vision system that could be more engaging to players, and that could allow for vision options that wards don't provide, while also limiting the amount of vision any team can have over a certain area.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-03-03T03:47:02.042+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would you feel about allowing players to be able to place up to 2 pink wards on the map at once?
