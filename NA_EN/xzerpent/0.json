Esentially, the bug can happen if you're playing a blind pick game, with a Sett{{champion:875}}  on both teams, aswell as a Sylas{{champion:517}}  on one of the teams. Sylas will then steal enemy Sett's ultimate, and Sylas and his allied Sett can then proceed to ult the same target at the exact same time, which triggers a bug that will make the ulted target stick to either Sylas or Sett (whoever ulted first). You can then procced to do this to every champion on the enemy team, making them stick to your model. No matter what happens, they cannot be removed from their new \"host\". Even if the \"host\" dies, they will teleport to his spawning location, and proceed to all be beamed down by the fountain tower. If the \"parasite\" champion dies, it will respawn at the \"host's\" current location. This bug is the definition of gamebreaking, since it can easily lead to your entire team being oneshot on respawn. Take a look at the video and see for yourself (the \"parasite\" champions will always stick to the \"host\", even while being dead they will follow him in a t-pose position stuck to the \"host's\" model)\r\n\r\n- xZerPenT","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-15T00:30:45.755+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"i swear to... whatever. \ndidnt vandiril make a video about this exact same bug like over a month ago?\n\nand if he did i'd like to raise this question: WHAT IS THE POINT IN THE RIOT YOUTUBER PARTNER PROGRAM IF RIOT IGNORES EVEN THEIR OWN PARTNERS!?\nWHAT WERE THEY THINKING????????","replies":[{"poster":"xZerPenT","date":"2020-01-15T07:12:34.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i just saw his video this morning, thought we we're the first ones to discover it.

They do plenty of playtesting, hell, thats what the PBE is for. You just physically cannot get the same data in years worth of playtesting that you get in 30 minutes of live gameplay.

They do not playtest. PBE is for other players to playtest for them but Ript doesnt listen to their players so the received feedback gets largely if not entirely ignored, making its existence useless.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2020-01-15T14:22:05.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why even put forth an hour of effort to even test edge cases eh?
