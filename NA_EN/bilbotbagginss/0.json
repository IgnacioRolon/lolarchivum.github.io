I just got done with 2 games. The first game I had a consistent 150+ fps, they dipped to 110 during team fights. The game after that the highest fps I had was 70, dipped to 30 just from me running around in the jungle planting wards. I've updated my drivers, and have a more than capable gaming PC. I don't know what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T22:34:55.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already updated your drivers, this might be some kind of bad interaction between you hardware/software, or it could just be some damaged game files. Check out the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) for some fixes, but hit me back if none of that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"BilboTbagginss","date":"2017-06-06T02:42:24.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, I just uninstalled overwolf and lulwiz because I saw that it was causing fps issues for some. About to play my first game without it. If it doesnt work I'll check out that guide and update you. Thank you again for the response.","replies":[]}]}]}
