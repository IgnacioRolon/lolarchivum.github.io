Is Rito still fixing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T22:41:56.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Shop wasn't loading for certain people at all, so we did a reset in order to make sure everyone could see their sales. That's already been done, and those skins won't be changing once you've open the shop. It sucks you aren't happy with the sales you have, but there is still an element of randomness involved with what skins you see.","replies":[{"poster":"BilboTbagginss","date":"2017-05-22T21:29:42.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I thought it was gonna be a complete reset for everyone, i shouldnt have opened lol.
