I am trying to sign up for one of the Internships for this summer, but when I went to fill out the application I found out that my college, Colorado Mountain College, isn't listed in their college drop down menu. Since this is a required field I have no idea what to do. I don't what to lie on my application but I also need to get my application in by today, and I have been working all week to get my cover letter and resume polished for this application. My best hope at this point is that a rioter sees this and helps me solve this problem.\r\nHelp Riot Games, you're my only hope.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T23:18:40.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, the application isn't the most intuitive.
