They release champions with the intention of diversifying the meta. They want you to use them.  Most new champs have some unique niche. Make it weak, then buff could discourage players from touching them all together. (Bard)\n\n3. $$$. They're a company. They need money to give us a free game.

Right?\n\nI think Taliyah is a good example for why your request doesn't work.\nWell in my opinion, Riot has no clue how to buff a champion without messing something up. This is pretty much apparent after seeing the Marksmen & Juggernaut updates.\nPersonally Taliyah was handled terribly. She's exactly what happens when you release a 'weak but playable' champion. Everyone says she needs a buff, so they hotfix her with buffs moments later, increase health and give her a new effects slowly over time reducing things here and there, then finally they start slowly nerfing her... The last update she got was on 6.24 and that was a Hotfix.\n\nTo me, that isn't a good patch history. Especially since her pick rate is around 1.92% (on OP.gg).\nIf a champion is good from the start, there is at least a chance they will still be played again later on if heavily nerfed. \n{{champion:421}} \n\nThis is how I see it at least. Please don't get me wrong, I'm totally for the idea of a champion being moderately weak but still playable, I just don't want another champion that falls off the face of the Earth because nobody liked the champion on release so they get a shit ton of buffs and Riot doesn't realize they over-buff them... Which can cause more problems. \nThis is a completely different game, remember. \n\nUnlike HotS, you have to take in consideration of why something needs to be looked at:\n\n* What level/rank are they?\n\n* What items were they using?\n\n* What lane were they in?\n\n* What Runes and Masteries did they use?\n\n* Were they just fed?\n\nI do remember watching a short video on how they handle buffs and nerfs and this was vaguely something like this list.","replies":[]}]}
