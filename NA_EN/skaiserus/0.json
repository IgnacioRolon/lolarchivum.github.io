Where she does not show the correct animations. In **death, sphere spawn, and throw or push.** I am sorry, but I was too lazy to check if this happened in the **Classic Syndra {{champion:134}} ** skin. I love playing with the **Snow Day Syndra** skin, but I get weirded out when I see the weird things that the skin now does. Hope this gets fixed soon.\n\nEDIT: Now, the comboing isn't as bad, but the death on Syndra is still very strange. I checked with Atlantean on a different computer as well, and her body seems figgity. Creep Blocked Syndra is back tho.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-04-04T19:21:16.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have problems Q --> E Comboing with that skin for some reason.
