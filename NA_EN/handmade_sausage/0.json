Same day. All of us. \nNow i cannot finish the \"Legendary pursuit\" mission. It says i have done 5/6 quest. \nI have completed ALL of the available quests, just like ALL of my friends. Still i did not complete the \"Legendary pursiut\" mission, UNLIKE MY FRIENDS, thus i cannot receive the World orb as a reward. \nI have paid in order to obtain the master pass, and now i have to wait another 7 days to get my rewards??? That sux really.....\nIf it was someting for free, i would not complain, but this really sux. \n\nI am not the only one with the same problem, but it seems that the support is too occupied - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/TmkWlskF-legendary-pursuit-mission\n\nFor more than 30-35 hours i cannot reach the support or submit a ticket, due to login issue. \n\nI hope the issue will be resolved in less than a week, or i would like to be compensated - what is the point of buying something with reall money?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T18:06:56.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can take a deeper look at your missions progress.

Finally the new world missions will come, i will complete the mission i was talking about, and the help Suport provides, will be....wait...what help? Ah yeah, its not like i paid in order to get some content, so i better shut up and just wait patiently for someone from your support to tell me \"did you restart your client yet? please, submit a ticket so we can help you\"  - 100%\nit seems i get attention or help only when i say im done spending money on RP - this usually speeds up the reply of your support.","replies":[{"poster":"Handmade Sausage","date":"2017-10-07T06:56:07.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=demonical rage,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ucl8cjyL,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-10-06T08:16:57.788+0000)\n>\n> hey, thanks god i had to wait 24 hours for u to reply here, in order to submit a ticket (i have waited ~48 hours to submit a ticket, due to problem with ticket submission) so i have to wait another 48-72 hours for someone to reply to my ticket.
