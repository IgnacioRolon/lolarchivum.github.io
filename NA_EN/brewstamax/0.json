Also, most of my friends play on ~28-30 ping on different isps when connecting to the Chicago servers. So, I figured this must be a routing issue with TWC and found out I'm being routed through Texas first, to get to Chicago. I was wondering how I could get this resolved, or if a rioter could help me notify twc of the issue, thanks! \r\n\r\nHere is the trace route:\r\nTracing route to 104.160.131.1 over a maximum of 30 hops\r\n\r\n  1    10 ms     1 ms     5 ms  192.168.0.1\r\n  2    30 ms    28 ms    28 ms  cpe-97-98-224-1.neb.res.rr.com [97.98.224.1]\r\n  3    32 ms    30 ms    37 ms  tge0-0-13.lnclnebt01h.neb.rr.com [76.85.221.65]\r\n  4    24 ms    28 ms    28 ms  agg20.lnclnebt01r.neb.rr.com [24.169.242.20]\r\n  5    44 ms    37 ms    38 ms  agg31.dllatxl301r.texas.rr.com [24.169.242.0]\r\n  6    39 ms    42 ms    48 ms  bu-ether14.dllstx976iw-bcr00.tbone.rr.com [66.109.6.88]\r\n  7    34 ms    38 ms    38 ms  0.ae0.pr1.dfw10.tbone.rr.com [107.14.17.232]\r\n  8    39 ms    36 ms    40 ms  24.27.236.233\r\n  9    32 ms    38 ms    35 ms  104.160.134.35\r\n 10    65 ms    67 ms    58 ms  ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.24]\r\n 11    56 ms    58 ms    58 ms  ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.8]\r\n 12    67 ms    53 ms    61 ms  104.160.131.1\r\n\r\nTrace complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T16:21:58.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds weird that your network would be routing in the opposite direction just to get back to the game server.  I recommend contacting your ISP ans sharing the insight you've found through the traceroute.  Specifically, I recommend using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) instead, which will paint a better picture of what's happening.  They should be able to investigate this further and help!  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
