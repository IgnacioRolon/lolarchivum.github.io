I think that her early game isn't great, her mid game is decent, and her late game is beast mode. It's essentially how a late game champ should be made.  In my opinion, she's one of the hardest champions to play in League of Legends, but taking the time to master her, is definitely worth it. Also, she really excels with teamplay .. so if your team isn't grouping or playing together (mainly solo queue) then she will definitely not be as strong.","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2017-04-28T17:55:56.709+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":5,"body":"I think {{champion:14}} is basically perfect right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2017-04-28T17:56:43.464+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RenownedWheat42,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hoXyjoyH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-28T17:55:56.709+0000)\n>\n> I think {{champion:14}} is basically perfect right now.\n\nHe could use a little base stat love, but yea, I'd agree he's in a great spot","replies":[{"poster":"Gary PC","date":"2017-04-28T18:46:23.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"agreed his early game is really bad","replies":[{"poster":"JVP15","date":"2017-04-28T18:58:09.879+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think he has a decent early game, although mostly against melee opponents.

It's like 10x easier to carry with her when her team has a vanguard/diver to put the ball on. If she falls behind, Ori does very little damage because only her W has respectable base value, while if she gets a lead it becomes very difficult to lane against her due to how short her CDs are and how she can easily proc TLD with a basic ability combo. Her passive is also kinda bad early on - bonus magic damage autos don't mean too much when you have 40 base AD.\n\nShe also may have been a hard champion when she was released back in 2010 or whenever, but in 2017 shes above-average difficulty at best. The ball really isnt that hard to micro (not that it has much to do with being well-balanced).\n\nShe may always be playable while never overbearing, but the issues I mentioned above make me hesitant to say shes outright the most balanced champ.\n\nMy vote for most balanced goes to Sion and Nami.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-04-29T04:45:28.786+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said this before, and I'll say it again.\n\nIn my opinion, {{champion:267}} is one of the most balanced champs in the game.
