KORG seems to have a pessimistic attitude (based on the assumption of said schadenfreude in both OP and me, and the sarcastic responses conveying that assumption).\n\nPersonally, I don't really focus on the \"that person has a chance to reform\" part. But I do think about the \"What that person said in game really hurt me. I'm happy that other people won't have to encounter that negativity, if only for a while.\" I enjoy good natured griefing my friends (like New Super Mario Bros.
