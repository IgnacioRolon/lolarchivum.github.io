Spectators want to see fluid movement, not clunky hesitation - that's why we're still at 6.  Feel free to disagree, but that seems to be the obvious answer to me.\n\nEdit: If it's going to be an issue for the pro scene, they can keep 6 while we get 10.  Even 8 would be fine, we just need more.  There are too many champions that aren't balanced and/or aren't fun to play against that we want to get rid of.\n\nEdit 2:  Another thing I wanted to add since I see the argument of \"my mains could all get banned\" come up, is that you likely aren't going to be banned out every single game.  I mean, if you can only play FotM champions, you're likely going to be banned out, and that's your fault if you don't have something else to fall back on, so you should play champs outside of that group.\n\n In all seriousness though, what are the chances that a single role is going to be completely targetted?  What would happen 10 support bans go through champ select?  There are still support options, same for ADC, same for jungle, same for top, and same for mid if they're targeted.  Additionally, if you are concerned about losing because you're a one trick pony, and are afraid the extra bans could be used on you once the problem champs are taken care of,  then sorry, you deserve the loss for having a champion pool with the depth of a puddle.

They choose a play style, as a team, and learn champs to execute that plan.  Why would you want an aggressive bottom duo/team to suddenly try to farm it out for late game dominance?  Forcing them out of what they do naturally would only lead to lousy games full of errors and devoid of #lcsbigplayz.  While this may spark some interest initially, it would die off really fast due to the current expected level of play.  It would be like going from a dedicated viewer of the nba to watching only the wnba.  Sure they are still pros, sure they are better than a majority of the populace, but the skill level just is not as high and it never will reach that bar.

Banning out a specific role is actually that easy honestly. It takes some serious work to play a champion on LCS level let alone play multiple champions on it. If you look at alot of the pro players they have pretty shockingly small champion pools. I'm not talking about the ones that have been around for multiple seasons, I'm talking about the newer teams.\n\nI don't know the statistics but I'm willing to bet most are comfortable with or have mastered only 3-5 champions for their role. So yes, banning out would happen with more bans. Heck, it still happens with only 3 bans. It's probably not fun to watch and it'd probably be pretty stressful for the pro to have to be playing a champion he hasn't mastered yet due to being targeted. Hell, Wickd pretty much ONLY plays Irelia. And while I don't endorse only playing 1 champion and you should definitely be good at many (like Faker senpai) not everyone is able to do so. 3 is a very reasonable number IMO. 5 is what you should strive for but honestly sometimes your mains fall off and fall off at the same time as each other leaving you with 3 or less mains.\n\nHell, Season 3 I could only play Hecarim top, Renekton top and Aatrox top. And to get to Diamond in season 4 I only played Hecarim top, Kassadin mid and Talon mid. Cuz Aatrox fell off and halfway through the season Renekton did too, essentially kicking me out of toplane. Point is, I devoted my time to maining those champions (alot of time) and only came out with 3 \"mastered\". I try to play more now but it's still hard to have more than 3 mains. Hell, hitting 3 is hard.\n\n**What exactly do you need that many bans for anyway? I haven't run into the problem once yet.
