The moment you hit the launch button, your client attempts to connect to our login servers, so when this fails, it's usually because your computer cannot reach those servers. I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) since it is very likely to resolve this issue entirely.\n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Matcha Mocha","date":"2016-11-21T22:26:52.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried opening LeagueClient but its not .exe\nAlmost tried everything on the connection guide thing.\nStill doesn't work {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T22:33:41.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is likely something we'll need to dive into system logs to resolve.
