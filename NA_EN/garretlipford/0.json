I used to be able to left-click the mini-map to move my screen around faster so i could see different parts of the map. But now i cant left click it at all. Also i cant left-click select enemy champions or objectives such as towers, or neutral monsters. I have tried resting to default, but the default is not how it is supposed to be set up. Also i have went into my Cdrive and deleted Config and nothing has helped. Does anyone know whats wrong or know how to fix it. PLEASE HELP.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T18:06:32.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a recent issue that caused settings to reset for some players.  Some players who had previously modified their config may find other issues like being unable to use the mini map.  The resolution for this is to do a complete reset of your configuration:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nI know you mentioned deleting some files, but use those steps to make sure your config and settings are properly set to default.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
