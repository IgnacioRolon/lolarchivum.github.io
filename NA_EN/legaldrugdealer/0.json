I guess this could also enhance both user experience for players that want to play a proper game and for the trolls. for proper players they could play a proper game to kill their time, to relieve their stress, etc. while trolls could try their new meta, exchanging their thoughts in trolling, reminding each other to take their antipsychotics, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-10T17:46:13.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK let me stop you there. Did it ever occur to you that the reason normal players are banned is because they freak out in the chat? I tend to come across this a lot and this shows a lack of information among the player base. Trolls are banned just it takes a bit longer to put the tribunal to put together the pattern of behavior. While a player going crazy and screaming every which word at a troll is STILL a reportable offence and easier to spot and punish.","replies":[]}]}
