What if we increased tower fortifications bot lane and removed them top lane. This would alleviate pressure bot lane by making it harder to instantly take tower after a good gank, meaning the game wouldn&#039;t snowball as hard \noff of a losing bot. Top lane would also become less of an island, meaning it would be more fun to watch LCS (cuz riot loves the LCS).\n\nAlthough one may say moving the clown fiesta top lane would solve nothing and junglers would just camp top, think about the trade offs. \n1. Top lane does not have a dragon, meaning there is \nnothing to take after a gank (rift herald is basically impossible to kill pre- 18 mins)\n\n2. It is harder to take a tower with fewer people, even with \nfewer resistances on the tower.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Also, top laners are generally tanky, so even if they do snowball, they will not be able to solo carry the game like a Caitlyn or a vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-12-28T15:52:22.187+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":6,"body":"Keep that fiesta down there.\n-A toplane main.","replies":[{"poster":"SithesisLord","date":"2016-12-28T17:40:58.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why not split the clown fiesta throughout all lanes+jungle instead?","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-12-28T19:19:53.072+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let jungle monsters randomly gank lanes","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2016-12-28T20:01:50.360+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello, Doombot Udyr.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2016-12-28T23:45:13.124+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Jungler will now play an important role not just in ganking and map control, but in making sure your blue buff doesn't get fed to the enemy mid-laner because the Blue Golem won't look at his damn map before going for the solo mid-lane gank while you're at Fountain.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Toastersaot","date":"2016-12-28T22:40:48.646+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tidal Tyrant,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ILKA6VAF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-28T15:52:22.187+0000)\n>\n> Keep that fiesta down there.\n> -A toplane main.\n\n{{champion:41}} :And now let me put down my Ult while I sit here in Lane farming, getting a triple kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-12-28T22:41:51.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Triplekill?

You don't have really anything to fight back against 3 people and since most Top laners are generally tanky, they can tank a couple turret shots before having to juggle which means even focusing the person tanking will accomplish little. If it is your team doing the 3v1, you get one kill and a turret, meanwhile your bot is left completely open to ganks and you will still lose more than you gained.  \n  \n\nIt is just not ideal in any circumstances to be top lane while there is a dragon and potential snowballing of the most powerful role, Marksmen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-12-29T21:39:25.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would make more sense from a numbers standpoint.\n\nIf the bot lane gets clowned:\n2 kills for the enemy team\n1 tower\n1 dragon\nYour hard carry is fucked\n\nIf the top lane gets clowned:\n1 kill for the enemy team\n1 tower\nYour tank(y) ally is fucked\n\nTop lane getting smacked around is the better of the two if your team is on the receiving end.
