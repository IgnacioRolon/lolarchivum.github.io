In each situation I'll pretend the toxic ally is a {{champion:17}} the toxic enemy is a {{champion:92}}  and you are a {{champion:3}} .\n\nWay 1: the k method.\nThis method is just responding to all rage directed to you with k. Simple yet effective.\n{{champion:17}} : GG worst Galio please go afk\n{{champion:3}} k\n{{champion:17}} why can't you do something you useless %%% uninstall please\n{{champion:3}} k\n{{champion:17}} say something you useless galio is all you can say k\n{{champion:3}} k\n\n\nWay 2: the smart ass method. This method requires you to respond to rage with \nsuper specific responses. Dictionary definitions are recommended.\n\n{{champion:92}} You are awful you %%% galio\n{{champion:3}} %%%, synonym for gay. Gay as in homosexual, I do not find myself attracted to people of the same gender, therefore  I am heterosexual. By definition I am not a %%%. Your argument is flawed.\n{{champion:92}} stfu pussy.\n{{champion:3}} pussy, slang term for female genetals. Female genetals cannot play league of legends, therefore I am not a pussy. Once again, a flawed argument.\n\nWay 3: the loving method. This method requires you to respond with love.\n\n{{champion:17}} go die galio please\n{{champion:3}} when I die I hope to be with you for eternity since even death cannot keep us apart.\n{{champion:17}} sigh, trash should not speak.\n{{champion:3}} if I'm trash I hope that you are the trash collector so that you can sweep me away once again.\n\nSo do any of you guys have ways to deal with toxicity?

Cursing in every other sentence isn't going to get your point across any better. You should probably broaden your mental dictionary if you're wanting to make a point valid. -- Silence can be a very effective method in dealing with toxic teammates or enemies. I never mute people in my games because I want to know how stupid they're actually being. If I've done something to draw the toxic attention to myself, I want to know why. Even if they're being toxic, they're still, in a way, helping you to realize that you need to work on your game a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surr20plz","date":"2015-07-04T21:42:10.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Asturd,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Eje440i3,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-07-04T07:17:44.017+0000)\n>\n> How about, Common sense isnt that common, and if you dont have it dont play this fucking game and be a piece of shit player or people will tend to be toxic do to how fucking stupid people make choices in this game without a fucking sense of knowledge.\n> And all of this ANTI Toxic, grow some fucking balls, Riot is babysitting this game.

I however, do not recommend doing any of these things if you value the positivity of your account.\n\nMethod one is spamming. Easily reportable and has the potential to get you both banned.\n\nMethod two is even easier to report. It's a disruption to gameplay and instigating a fight. If you have enough time to type \"fgt, synonym for gay. Gay as in homosexual, I do not find myself attracted to people of the same gender, therefore I am heterosexual. By definition I am not a fgt. Your argument is flawed.\" then you shouldn't be playing this game. That valuable time could have been spent warding and actually trying to win the game.\n\nMethod three is is just as easy as two. Trolling/disrupting gameplay and instigating a fight or egging the aggressor on.\n\nPeople get banned for things such as defending themselves and contributing to an aggressor all the time. It's been said MANY times by Riot and their player behavior team that it is best to not type anything at all, ignore/mute the toxic player and report them after the game.\n\nAdding gasoline to a fire only makes it worse, but if you instead cut off the oxygen to a fire (In this case the mute button) it dies.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-04T04:14:52.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Method one is not spamming.
