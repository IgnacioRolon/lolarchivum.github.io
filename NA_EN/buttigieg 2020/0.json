I though she was fine before the buff and that people only said she was bad because easy/tank/afk junglers were better at the time. I don't really get why people are complaining now. It just makes them seem ignorant for underestimating her damage before hand. But in all honesty, she did feel like she was lacking compared to the easier jglers out there, and her low win rate at the time was reflective of that. Her new cocoon stun duration really helps with getting her team an advantage early game, which I really like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-07-26T18:19:41.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have mentioned, she did get buffed number wise, and her spiderlings are more responsive so they contribute a lot of damage, but it's also Elise building more damage instead of going tank (with a bit of mpen) like she used to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-07-26T17:59:15.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope, the damage isn't the same as befor.\nHer spiderlings have a 50% higher ap ratio, **deal magic damage**, proc spell-effects and no longer bug for 4 sec after E.\ngoing with her usuall items, both the spell-effects, the ratio and mostly the magic-damage are a huge buff to her.\nAditonally, 60% more duration on the rank 1 stun makes it far more easy to use her theoretical damage in practice, while it also allows to max W second for a better early-midgame damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-07-26T11:10:40.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...better start learning how to play Elise again since I have this feeling she will become a powerhouse again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tribbles Foxfolk","date":"2015-07-26T08:57:42.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm actually going to start playing Elise a bit.
