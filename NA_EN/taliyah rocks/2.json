Even when you look on champion.gg she doesn&#039;t have mid laner as a secondary role, which even Morgana has.\r\n\r\nWhy tho? I&#039;ve always loved Zyra mid, much more than playing her support. I have to admit i rarely play mid, but for the past three seasons she&#039;s been my first pick whenever i went midlane. Her auto attacks are great and reliable for CSing (especialy compared to lots of mage who have retardedly bad auto-attack animations that make their life a nightmare at csing) Great waveclear, and relatively safe against all-ins with her CC and ult. Plus she&#039;s so great at zoning that she&#039;s already safe as it is against all-ins. &#039;&#039;free&#039;&#039; wards with seeds also means she&#039;s relatively safe from ganks combared to other low-mobility mages.\r\n\r\nHer only real downside is how squishy she is. She&#039;s the squishiest champion in LoL, second only to Anivia(who has her passive to save her) and equal to Sona(who has heals and shields.)\r\n\r\nSo my question here is why isn&#039;t she considered a mid laner, at least as a secondary role? I just fail to see why, what makes her kit &#039;&#039;bad&#039;&#039; at being a mid laner?","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-10-31T17:07:13.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As you can see, I'm a Zyra main.

For example:\n\n{{champion:69}}  Poke her a lot at levels 1-2. Run MS quints. Save an EQ for when she lands a poison, and she can't stick to you. All-in her at level 5 with ignite for a kill. Shove lane to force her OOM. Farm passively and let her push wave after each of her buys. Rank E>W>Q\n\n{{champion:34}}  Farm around her, dodge Qs, and keep your distance. Rush Luden's to shove waves and out-roam. Rank E>W>Q\n\n{{champion:90}} Bully him super hard from 1-5. Use plants to keep his passive off. Free gold before 6. Free kill when his ult is down.\n\n{{champion:99}} MS quints. Pre-6 you win every trade EWQW if she tries to AA you ever. Rush Luden's, dodge her shit, and all-in her the second she misses Q. You have complete wave control. After 6 it's a skill matchup, but you have dps and scale better into late game unless she gets fed off snipes.\n\n{{champion:7}} This is only a hard matchup for a few levels, like 2-6 where you have to CS with plants. Once you finish Abyssal or Guise + Negatron, she will die with you if she all-ins. At 2-3 items you shit on her and win the game. \n\n{{champion:163}} Not hard at all. \n\n{{champion:127}} You win before 6. Poke hard early. Run cleanse or buy QSS and you win after 6 unless she's super on-point with exploiting vision for surprise ganks.\n\n{{champion:61}} Skill matchup. You have poke and range advantage, but she'll win most 1v1 all-ins. You're stronger in team-fights.\n\n{{champion:245}} I'll give you this one. He can be really hard since you can't do anything but react to him. This matchup is about biding your time and baiting him into outplaying himself. That's actually pretty easy to do a lot of the time, so I don't consider him hard except in top lane.\n\n{{champion:38}} Not hard. Lane with caution after 6 until you have a complete item. You should have a kill on him before 6. Shove wave after 6 to prevent roams.\n\n{{champion:55}} She's extremely easy if you know her power spikes and how to deal with bounces. Fall back during those windows and go aggro the rest of the time. Very easy to bait into over-extending by throwing an E and dropping a QWWR behind her as your jungler goes in. Even without ganks, she really struggles to stay healthy in lane due to incessant Q poke.\n\n{{champion:238}}  Zyra is one of the best mid mages to go against Zed because her mana costs are extremely low, you can CS well outside his Q range, and her damage/mana aren't completely fucked by a Zhonya's rush. He can be hard, but it's not hopeless.\n\n{{champion:91}} Ditto Zed except easier lane and harder post-lane.\n\n{{champion:105}} Ditto Zed for the most part. He can kill you pretty easily, but you'll almost always trade kills on the counter-engage. You can often get a kill pre-6 At 3 items, he'll suicide on your ulted plants while you're in stasis.\n\n{{champion:115}} Skill matchup. He wins poke, you get a kill if you land an E.\n\n{{champion:110}} Ditto Ziggs\n\n{{champion:112}} Skill matchup in his favor. It's not hard to survive lane, but he can punish any aggression. Rush Luden's if you want to duel and follow his roams, or rush Morello to match his waveclear and force him to play passive.\n\n{{champion:101}} Ditto Ziggs. Your advantage is that you can cc him through the wave, and he can't stun. You can also bait the E and flash > EWQWR Ignite for a free kill through his barrier.\n\n{{champion:8}} He's hard to judge, but he's not really a threat until he's fed. He's a rare case where you rush Morello because you have to literally spam him with plants to get him in kill range, the GW is actually useful, and you need the mana to keep up with his lane sustain. He's super hard to kill 1v1, but it's not hard to win the farm lane. Go Morello if you aren't getting help. Rush Luden's if you have a jungler who will burn his puddle for you. Get Void Staff first or second item if you see him build a spectral cowl.\n\nBut, yeah...\n\n{{champion:103}} Fuck her. You can get a kill at level 2-3, and that's pretty much it. You win after lane, so just rush {{item:3092}} and miss as many CS as needed to not die.\n\n{{champion:134}} This is actually a skill matchup. You really bully her hard early. After 6, you can win by out-playing her. Fake roams and bush-camp her route, bait with pink wards, etc. She dies if you get a combo off (usually through Zhonya's), and you die if she hits a stun first.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2016-10-31T12:19:05.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most people who play her mid are probably {{champion:143}} mains who likely queue as mid & support and nearly always end up in the support role.\n\nIf you look under champion analytics on op.gg for {{champion:37}} the people it considers to be the best {{champion:37}} players, those high on the list play her mid lane and support.

It's probably because of her slow/unreliable cc and damage. Her old Q used to have a bigger hitbox and range plus damage to poke down enemy but now the new shape probably take her out of  mid completely. If you compared her with syndra or orianna, you can see that their cc and damage are a lot more consistent and easier to put out if you mastered them. Syndra can set up her stun and kill the enemy is one rotation, and the stun is pretty easy to hit if she set up the ball and the enemy doesn't aware of it. Orianna can set up her ball close to the enemy to pressure or hard poke the enemy low enough to get the kill. Zyra E is one of the slowest ability to land and it's just really easy to dodge unless you predict the enemy movement pattern. Her R is not reliable because it takes 2 second for the knock up to happen, unless you maxed E first which no mid laner do that. She's a lot easier play as a supp though because you have adc to back you up if you missed E and your base damage if pretty high if you add the plants damage in for a supp.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-10-31T21:48:30.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her biggest problem is the high cooldowns on her w, since that's the only way she can be proactively aggressive.
