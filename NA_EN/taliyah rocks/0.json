Often times what determines whether you are or are not a viable jungler is based on whether or not you're able to do your first 1-2 clears while being able to gank or invade. Letting you make a choice of item that gives you an early buff seems interesting, but I think it'd be better to solve this problem through some of jungle sustain things we've been targeting. \n\nThe other thing is we've pseudo replaced a number of the buffs already in other ways in the system. The gromp buff is essentially tied into the damage burn that talisman applies, scrying orb thing serves the purpose of the vision buff from raptors and the spirit wolf from wolf camp. That means we're only really missing the stun, so if we were to do this we'd probably need to come up with additional buffs that would provide interesting gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-06T22:40:19.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright then, now I'm excited to see what you folks are doing with jungle sustain.

It's so retard proof right now, and they've served to be just as aggravating as they were when they were introduced on PBE. Whoever managed the jungle \"rework\" must have been out of his/her damn mind to think that reducing the complexity of the role, which wasn't that much to begin with, would help players understand the system. \n\nI mean, what's the point in maining a role if anyone can play it? Doesn't feel very unique, AND you can see that this is starting to leak into top lane. ANYONE can play top lane right now. It's like you guys are vacuum sucking anything remotely cool about a role and replacing it with some casual shit because... i dont know why.

No.  But it cancels the dash portion of the animation, letting you effectively save about the duration of 1 auto each time you do it.  This adds up to a faster clear (by about 6-8 seconds) and more importantly, a healthier clear because you kill faster.  It probably increases your clear health by 200 hp or so in saved autos from monsters, which makes a clear go from \"OK\" to \"full sustained without using a potion, allowing back to back ganks on two lanes.\"   It more than enables actually going leashless clears and still coming out of the jungle at full HP on Kayn, which is massive from the enabled aggressive counterjungling (such as starting at the enemy buff or even raptors into buff if ballsy) or otherwise amping the clears.

It might also allow you to nerf some higher performing gank junglers in a way that they would have to decide whether to gank without a certain jg buff, clear in an order that supports the buffs they want for a gank, or deny their opponents a certain camp based on the champ they're playing. Same for farming jg, like the stun on camps for junglers who struggle early could change pathing. Would also let you give limited power for champs who don't traditionally jungle to do so, without adding to their power outside of the jg. Could make for some interesting decision making without tying it into the smite cd.\n\nThat being said, I can see it being too much mind-space for a new jungler to keep track of all the different buffs. One way would maybe just make 3 kinds like plants, and just assign them to the different camps.\n\nThat honestly just solves the problem you stated of a jungler having to think about which camp to smite, but probably brings up a host of additional problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2018-03-06T20:34:17.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don’t understand how removing the things that made the jungle actually feel skillful, eas good.

Multiple ways besides. A mechanic that was actually well done was removed because of entry level blocks when those are perfectly viable to work on.
