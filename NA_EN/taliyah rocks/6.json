Demon Vi is so damn badass that she deserves her very own tenth level of hell, she also happened to be my highest mastery when released (if you can&#039;t guess by my account name already). Super Galaxy Annie takes the prize for the most adorable skin ever while simultaneously hitting me right in the nostalgia and hype of my favorite anime TTGL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Elementalist {{champion:99}} and God Fist {{champion:64}} are my bane. Elementalist Lux is just a shitty 520rp skin with it&#039;s own chroma pack mini-game, plus every god damn Lux player has it. God Fist Lee Sin has his face stapled next to the Superiority Complex entry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso honorable mention to {{champion:20}} Bot. I can&#039;t respect any Nunu player that doesn&#039;t have this skin. Nunu Bot is a hundred times more Nunu than Nunu can ever wish to be.","replies":[]}
