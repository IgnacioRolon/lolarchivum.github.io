The difference is that, the higher you go the more players are patient. Darius will not become impatient on killing you or snowballing the lane. He knows your teamfighting is better but, he also knows his is not bad either.\n\nHis main focus will be to freeze lane instead of shoving. This way he will force you to overextend to reset the wave so, he acheives a few things. He will either bait you into a gank with a high chance of success or he will foce you to fight him to reset the wave. So, you will have to either bite that or use ult to push it in. Either way, he gets a small lead. A good Daius will force this multiple times.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-10-16T05:58:36.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zzrot?

Still, since you already know how to sacrifice a few minions, you can bait Darius into an uncomfortable position(i.e overextending). But, it's a lot more difficult for you to maintain the freeze. So, your jungler needs to be aware of the exact moment Darius will start overextending in order to reset his pushing wave and gank your lane before that happens. If your jungler actually comes, it's usually a fee kill. Darius is too weak during laning phase to 1v2. \n\nOf course, during teamfights, i personally consider a rumble with Zhonya's and rylai's/liandrys to be way better than Darius in the current meta.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-10-16T05:43:04.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know Darius smashes Rumble but i'm not sure exactly why he loses out more than other melee champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth StepVader","date":"2016-10-16T05:49:53.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jelly Mac,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x2mlOd2H,comment-id=0009000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-16T05:43:04.974+0000)\n>\n> I know Darius smashes Rumble but i&#x27;m not sure exactly why he loses out more than other melee champs.\n\nExtreme immobility and lack of engage tools.

I didn't understand your last reply fully. I'd say that Darius is pretty good in this matchup due to his innate tankiness, extreme early game presence, fighting sustainability and decent cc if he has managed to reach you. On top of that, unlike a few other melee champs, Darius can pretty much build resistances and still deal immense amounts of damage through his passive. So, not only does he ignore Rumbles damage in lane but, he  is also a zoning threat since you do not wish to engage in a prolonged fight with him.\n\nI'd also say that Yorick and Trynda do pretty well vs Rumble, maybe just as much as Darius. As far as Riven is concerned, i consider that more of a skill matchup.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-10-16T04:12:11.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the top lane meta in LCS is 90% ranged champs....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-10-15T15:48:40.757+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck those people.
