Oh, wait... He's a top tier pick there. Huh. Go figure. \n\nControl wards only shut Twitch down if the enemy is incompetent and doesn't know how to play. Your control wards won't last 30 seconds if they're placed where they need to be to spot Twitch, and you _can't_ protect them in those positions. How do you propose to protect a control ward in the middle of a lane? Going straight down a lane while stealthed is very common for Twitch. His team can easily take out any obvious control wards, and a ward in the middle of your team won't have the vision range to do anything for you. Plus, you can very easily get pushed off of it. \n\nOn top of that, dedicating all 5 of your team's control wards (and, at your elo, you're not going to be having 5 control wards on the map at once, anyways - maybe 1 at a time) to try and spot out Twitch in one quadrant of the map means that you are leaving the rest of the map completely in the enemies' control. And \"moving the line of vision\" every time you change lanes or switch to an objective is rather expensive. Not only can they clear out the wards, they can just decide to move to another area, pressure another lane or objective, etc, where your team has no vision now. \n\nYour arguments are assuming 2 things - first, that your team is significantly ahead and is able to control the pace of the game and where fights will happen. That is only the case maybe 1/4 of the time, and doesn't influence lane phase at all. Second, that the enemy Twitch is wandering around solo trying to 1v5. Which will _never_ happen unless the Twitch is an idiot. You aren't \"intelligently shutting down Twitch through vision control\". You're just playing against terrible Twitch players.","replies":[{"poster":"wyvern011976","date":"2017-10-26T04:06:10.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR\n\nJust read the comments because i said nothing you say...\nJust get better and he is just like all other ADCs.\nBuy wards, learn to place them, or lose.  \nIt is not hard concept.  \n\nSorry you are hard stuck in bronze.

It's about him starting his stealth out of vision, then moving to where you are in lane.\n\nAlso, you need to stop looking at Twitch in a vacuum. Every time you talk about him, it's like you think every Twitch is trying to 1v5 in the jungle. That is never going to be the case. Not everything is late game, teams are not always grouped as 5, and Twitch should never be wandering around solo.

Even more ironic since you're calling two Plat players Bronze, while being Bronze MMR, yourself.\n\nConsidering your arguments, I sincerely hope you are trolling. Can control wards limit Twitch's power? Yeah, definitely. But they most certainly do not \"SHUT HIM DOWN\", as you claim. There's a reason Twitch has been at a 53-54% winrate for the last year and a half - which increases the higher elo you are. If control wards shut him down, he would be trash in Plat+, and especially pro play, since that's where people actually buy tons of control wards. But that isn't the case. \n\nControl wards only temporarily limit his pathing while stealthed - but he doesn't _have_ to approach you while stealthed. He is one of the strongest teamfight ADCs in the game, and will annihilate your team if he isn't picked off early. His stealth simply gives him the ability to be an assassin, as well. Control wards help against that, but they aren't _the_ answer to beating him - Twitch isn't like old Akali, where you could just pink ward her shroud and make her useless. \n\nJust tossing out tons of control wards may work against Bronze/Silver Twitch players who think they're supposed to run around solo and jump out at people, but it doesn't work as well against Twitch players who actually know how to play League with their brains.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2017-10-24T10:38:39.589+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Like ... literally any crit ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Wigglepufftuff","date":"2017-10-24T14:39:49.524+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, except they're not undetectable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2017-10-24T19:34:50.412+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PePsiLemoNN,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Xw1xgVEa,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2017-10-24T10:38:39.589+0000)\n>\n> Like ... literally any crit ADC.\n\nYou know how facecheking a bush is bad?
