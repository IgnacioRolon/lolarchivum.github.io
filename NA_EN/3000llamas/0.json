My ap taric scores have been dropping. I have conquered that the source of this problem is the removal of dfg. Other assassins have been show love, but taric has not been given that love. Ap taric is a vital part of this game we need that blend of tank and damage to balance this champion. So I suggest buffing taric to make him the true assassin he is.Here are some suggestions, give him insane ap ratios, give him a dash, give him a ult that increases his damage, and finally make his heal have a lower cd. The dfg has killed taric please revive him.  {{champion:44}}{{item:3089}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-04T23:40:28.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What killed Taric wasn't the removal of DFG, it was making his W scale off of armor and not even a good ratio with armor. His passive also scales off of armor now too instead of mana like previously. I missed the old Taric, it was fun to go RoA and laugh at people in top lane. QQ","replies":[]}]}
