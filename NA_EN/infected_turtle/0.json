I am stationed on the USS Carl Vinson (CVN70).

Can you clarify a bit more? \n\nAre you not able to connect to the League servers from PC's on the ship?","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Turtle","date":"2016-09-30T23:13:19.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct. We have no internet the entire deployment, except for 2 or 3 day port visits. We can play dota 2 offline, but a lot of us would rather play league if we had the ability to.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T16:20:56.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, Leauge cannot be played offline, so I believe in this situation, you'll only be able to play during port visits.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n*Thank you for your service, please come home safe.*","replies":[]}]}]}]}
