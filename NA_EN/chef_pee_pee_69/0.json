Since the client has a hard time displaying negative LP values, it would explain why you believe your LP values aren't working right. I recommend avoiding a dodge while you're playing ranked matches, since they count against your LP.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Chef Pee Pee 69","date":"2017-02-13T00:18:41.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx soo much","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-02-12T21:23:27.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you have negative LP from dodging?
