I know I'll get it but my girlfriend just got her account and she's currently level 3. I don't want to drag her into a pvp to earn her the free champion and skin. Will a co-op vs AI or Custom game count as well? Or does it have to be something like ranked or norms?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T18:43:20.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some small requirements here, and your girlfriend has some time still to be eligible for the gift!  She has until the 20th to reach level 5, and AI vs Coop games are totally fine!  More details on this is available through the [FAQ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/thank-you).  Get a few games in to that level, and she'll be set!","replies":[]}]}
