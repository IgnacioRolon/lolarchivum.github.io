I'm not very good with computers but while downloading league for the first time around 30-40% (Usually 33% but sometimes it gets higher.) A window pops up saying Update Failed: Unspecified error occurred, please check the logs for more information. I'm not sure if its just the device that I'm using or the problem is caused by something else but I really want to fix it. I have tried restarting and running the launcher as admin, but it hasn't helped.
