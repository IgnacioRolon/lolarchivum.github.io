IT WILL HIT YOU. Kalista can try to out run it, but she only delays the inevetable. And if she does run away from it so your team can't follow up, good enough. You removed her from the fight.\n\nIf she does stick around and let it hit her, Your nautilus. You have about 6 seconds of hard lockdown AFTER YOUR ULT. Use it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Storm Dragon","date":"2015-02-26T06:47:51.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last game I played, enemy Kalista was 5/0 by six minutes. We won that game, because from mid game on, our Lissandra would just ult Kalista and then we would dogpile her. Eventually Kalista bought Merc Scimitar, but then we just staggered our CC to keep her locked down until she died, whereupon her team fell apart because she was the only one with gold (after stealing all the kills repeatedly). \n\nBasically, hard CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zmuecat","date":"2015-02-26T05:52:04.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really, it's all a matter of understanding.\n\nAs soon as you know hot to counter her, it's easy. Just attack her when she goes to AA in lane before any attack speed items. Do this enough and it will delay her becoming such an annoying mobile monster.\n\nWhat was that? How do you stop her from being a really fast fly? Stop asking questions I don't think there's any reasonable answer to. Just buy {{item:3110}} {{item:3143}} to reduce her effective jumpiness a little and pray someone lands one some CC for your team to take advantage of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veraska","date":"2015-02-26T05:49:57.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"flanks are ussually your best bet, in like river or the jungle if your team can wrap around then she has no where to go","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBuffandChill","date":"2015-02-26T06:31:20.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"according to the dumbasses in chat and riot its hard cc not when u have a morg and qss she is invincible lmao","replies":[]}]}
