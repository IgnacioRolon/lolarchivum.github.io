Get back up and read it all... ^^^^","replies":[{"poster":"AgeOfShadow92","date":"2019-03-03T04:13:48.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop playing for a while. \nStop playing ranked; if you are having this problem in normals the game probably isn't for you.\nMute people who flame you, and report them. Yes, reports do work. \nPlay normals and make sure you play the game for FUN. If I play a lot of ranked and deal with a lot of ppl playing badly, I realize I'm no longer having fun. At that point you need to find the fun in the game again, or play something else for a while. I do this by playing ARAMs or other games completely. \nYou REALLY do play better when you take a break. You pay more attention and it's like hitting reset on your brain when it comes to the game. \n\nGood luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-02-28T23:52:57.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could try not playing the game, sounds like it is not for you, at least right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2019-02-28T23:51:16.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/JJHyN5sT-helpful-tips-for-keeping-your-cool\n\nMy recent post about this that i am going to be reposting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4G PnutCollida","date":"2019-02-28T23:38:43.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I think the best course of action here is just to take a break. You seem to be getting mad at mistakes you’re making, which is understandable, but when it’s starying to become a big problem to you, you should just take a break.","replies":[]}]}
