I do not have NVIDIA. All that happens is I enter game(recently just custom games trying to fix it), pick champion, wait for timer to reach zero, once it hits zero, trys loading game portion of game. Hits me with the bugsplat. I've tried every conceivable list of things to try getting a fix like your connection to servers list, your bugsplat and game crashed list of things and such, i've even tried uninstalling, restarting computer then reinstalling league. Nothing. \r\nTo make sure you know what I have done, here is the following :\r\n1. checked minimum requirement\r\n2. updated graphics drivers, DirectX, windows (were all up-to-date)\r\n3. reinstalled .net framework 3.5 (just in case)\r\n4. repaired game files (no problems there)\r\n5. performed a clean boot\r\n6. reset my graphics card software\r\n7. (can't change game settings if i can't enter the game can I?)\r\n8. Disabled debug version of directX (was already disabled)\r\n9. Also have reinstalled the game 4 times.\r\n\r\nI have run out of options and I'm just tired of spending an entire day trying to fix this and nothing. Would really like some help with this maybe riot member Porocles can help cause he seems to be able to communicate with most people having the same problem?","replies":[{"poster":"KillerGhost146","date":"2016-10-01T19:27:37.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for any one still having this problem they got back to me and sent this it worked for me.  We've been seeing that an issue with monitor and game resolutions has been coming up and is tied to recent Windows 10 updates. You can address this issue by changing your resolution in Windows to the ideal (native) resolution:\n\n-Click the Start Menu\n-Go to \"Search programs and files\" at the bottom and type \"resolution\"\n-Click \"Adjust screen resolution\"\n-Under \"Resolution\" for the monitor or monitors you are seeing this issue, change the resolution to the one marked \"(recommended)\" (it should also be in bold)\n-Click Apply, wait, and then click \"Keep Changes\" unless you see a major issue with your monitor\nThere's a chance that you're already using the native resolution and don't need to Apply any change, if so, move on\n\nAfter this, you will need to reset the Config files for your League of Legends installation so that the game has the correct resolution too. You'll need to do the following to reset your Config settings:\n\n-Launch League (make sure it is set to \"Run as Administrator\": https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions#wq3 )\n-Login (but don't start a game yet)\n-Minimize the game and Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n-Delete the Config folder (delete the entire folder, not just the contents)\n-Start a Custom Game to verify changes","replies":[{"poster":"Lincebianca2000","date":"2017-10-09T15:24:52.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't work","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beauts ","date":"2017-06-05T20:26:17.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I logged in to comment on this.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\nFor weeks I've been having consistent problems with this with countless reinstalls etc. \nYou are a legend \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Im Buff Daddy","date":"2017-05-12T04:27:28.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG I have literally done every single \"Fix\" Everyone has come up with from running in the low resolution mode to disabling my nvidia 1080ti graphics card, and running it only  on the integrated (Which would run the game, however only at 11 fps) and this post right here finally fixed my problem.

This is usually due to driver problems or bad game files; though, I see that you've already done a lot to troubleshoot those areas.  \n\nThere could be other factors like hardware itself, but to really rule out any possibilities I highly recommend going over each and every step of our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.
